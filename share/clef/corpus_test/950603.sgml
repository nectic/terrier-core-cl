Sir John de Medina came reluctantly to Edinburgh, but found it so much
to his taste that he remained for the rest of his life, reports Rosalind
K Marshall
IN 1694 Margaret, Countess of Rothes, sat for her portrait. A plump
lady in a loose-fitting gown, she gazed from her canvas with a
distinctly self-satisfied smile, for she had recently persuaded the
artist, John Baptiste de Medina, to visit Edinburgh. Born in Brussels in
1659, the son of a Spanish army captain serving in the Low Countries,
Medina studied with the Flemish portraitist Francois Duchatel, and by
1686 was building up a successful practice in London. Among his patrons
were the Scottish Earl and Countess of Melville.
The Countess of Rothes was Lady Melville's cousin, but Medina had been
distinctly reluctant to take up her suggestion to visit Edinburgh. It
would be folly to neglect his London clients, and he had no desire to
absent himself from his wife, Jean Mary Vandale, and their children.
Lady Rothes was determined, however, and a bargain was struck.
In order to make his trip as brief as possible, Medina and his
assistants would prepare his canvases in advance, painting in the bodies
of the future clients. The heads would be done from life, in Edinburgh,
and then, back in London, the finishing touches added. Lady Rothes had
therefore to ascertain how each would like to be clothed. Men were no
problem, for the obligatory suit of armour would suffice, but ladies
would have to say how they and their children should be garbed, and
decide on the size of picture.
Medina finally travelled north with the Earl of Melville's son, Lord
Leven, probably in the spring of 1694, and was an instant success. All
the Rothes' friends and relatives flocked to his hired studio. All
thoughts of a fleeting visit forgotten, Medina hurried back to London to
collect Jean Mary and their children John, William, Gisberta, Katherine,
Elizabeth, and Anne. He installed them in a comfortable three-roomed
flat in one of Edinburgh's high city-centre tenements and there he spent
the rest of his life. Usual clients apart, the Royal College of Surgeons
commissioned him to paint an ambitious series of portraits for their new
hall, he was naturalised by the last Scottish Parliament and he was
knighted shortly afterwards. He died on October 5, 1710, a distinguished
member of Edinburgh society, and was buried in Greyfriars Churchyard.
To this day, his portraits can be seen in Scottish country houses.

Portrait Gallery.

Jim Hewitson tells why Fifers feel close to Paradise
YOU won't get an argument from the citizens of Fife if you suggest
that the promised land, God's acre, is to be found 'twixt the sparkling
waters of Forth and Tay. Whether it might also be the location of a
stairway (or more accurately a loft door) to Heaven is another matter.
Fife has many mysterious traditions and secret corners, but is it
possible that a tradesman's entrance to Valhalla lies directly above the
Kingdom? Not as unreasonable a proposition as might appear at first
sight.
By way of explanation, let me take you first of all back over 20 years
to my gipsy incarnation and to the slopes of Mount Olympus, Greece,
where our encampment experienced the most spectacular thunderstorm a
body is ever likely to live through in this or a hundred lifetimes.
Let me refer to my dog-eared journals of August, 1973 -- ''Spent last
night under the bulk of Mount Olympus. Zeus and his pals must have been
throwing a party because during an eight-hour electrical storm
thunderbolts were being chucked around to the accompaniment of rumbling
thunder and torrential rain. No sleep.''
Additional recollections of that highly-charged night include little
fishing boats silhouetted against the eastern skyline, sheet lightning
dancing along the dark backdrop of the Gulf of Thessaloniki. It was easy
to picture the gods partying up there on the Olympian summit, to imagine
that they'd left the celestial backdoor ajar.
Lightning activity has always been associated in tradition with mighty
and mysterious forces at work or play. Here in Scotland we get our share
of electrical storms. In Orkney, with our endless horizons, they can be
impressive but are generally not long-lasting and well dispersed.
However, sifting accounts of lightning strikes, particularly in the
1700s, central Fife seems to crop up again and again as an area of
unusual activity. We can even narrow it down to the Cupar district.
Let the facts speak. In 1733 Melville House, about five-and-a-half
miles from Cupar, was struck by a bolt of lightning which achieved some
strange effects. Although no-one was hurt, a section of mirror melted,
huge splinters were torn from solid sections of wainscotting, a
chimney-head came down, and stones were hurled 100 yards across the
garden.
Two years later in Cupar itself, a blacksmith was struck down by a
bolt of lightning while shoeing a horse and ''expired immediately''. In
the 1790s a servant at Pitcullo House had her bonnet singed and was
knocked out when lightning descended via the kitchen chimney.
In July, 1783, at Monimail, west of Cupar, a boy and girl caring for
their invalid mother were killed by a bolt which again entered by the
chimney. Strangely, a dog which lay motionless for an hour after the
strike and was thrown out on a midden as dead, was later found strolling
around, apparently none the worse for the experience.
Finally in Cupar on September 20, 1787, four men were struck by
lightning in the old correction house, which was being used as a
wright's shop. Two recovered but their companions were found ''without
any remains of life''.
As I was saying, Fifers have always thought themselves nearer to
Paradise than the rest of us. Perhaps they are indeed just that little
bit too close to Heaven's door for comfort.
* Shocking Footnotes: The mast on the Empire State Building in New
York was struck 68 times during the first 10 years after its erection,
and Roy Sullivan, a park ranger from Virginia, survived four lightning
strikes.

SCIENTISTS in Norwich have discovered something our mothers and
grannies always knew. Fish oil is good for you. They've doen a study of
fish oil in diets and dsicovered that it may be beneficial in the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other disorders because it can
suppress immune reacitvity. The old song about cod liver oil and the
orange juice may soon be heading up the charts.

Welfare groups will be pleased to learn of research on immortal cells,
which could save millions of laboratory animals, reports Joe Donnelly.
ANIMALS and their well-being have never been so prominent on our news
pages and TV screens. When grannies ride shotgun alongside new-age
travellers, assorted shaven-heads and tent-dwellers to preserve the
comfort of calves, we can be assured that the steer-huggers are gaining
political muscle.
Body Shop beauty pedlar and Queen of Green, Anita Roddick, has come
under scrutiny of late about the fortune she's made in the anti-testing
policy of her chain of stores. Some reports claim that despite the boast
on Body Shop products, some substances used in some of the preparations
have been tested on animals after all, by researchers in other
organisations.
While it's clearly difficult to prevent tests being carried out by
third parties on ingredients eventually used by greener companies (and
in fact it's a legal requirement that products used on humans must be
tested), anti-cruelty campaigners might be heartened to learn of a major
Scottish research project that could eventually save the lives of
thousands, possibly millions, of laboratory animals.
Professor Caroline MacDonald is leading a project into immortality at
Paisley University. If the work is successful, she could find her name
lives forever. The immortality, however, is unfortunately for cells
only, MacDonald assures us, though if she manages to achieve it for
humans, then reservations for early treatment have already been accepted
from Frontiers.
Cell immortalisation, however, could massively reduce the number of
animals needed by drug companies and clinical investigators for their
own researches. About five million animals -- mainly rats -- are used
for research every year. To find a new drug, a company may have to test
up to 100,000 different chemical combinations, often using an animal in
each test.
The Paisley project, funded to the tune of #231,000 by the
Biotechnical and Biolological Sciences Research Council, and scheduled
for three years, is backed by a #150,000 collaboration with Dr Helen
Grant of Strathclyde University. They hope to establish a cell culture
that goes on reproducing itself while keeping its characteristics. The
''immortal'' cell cultures could replace up to 70% of traditional lab
experiments on animals.
Professor MacDonald, head of biological sciences, said: ''Cell growth
is not a problem, but the cultures grown in a solution in plastic dishes
tend to lose their characteristics. They tend to evolve into cells which
like growing in plastic, rather than retaining the properties of liver
or kidney cells.
''We are using genetic engineering techniques to immortalise mammalian
cells by introducing viral oncogenes, complex molecules which cause
cancers, into them. These oncogenes promote rapid multiplication of the
original cells, but the new growth retains many of the original
characteristics. They are also more stable.''
Basically, the cells are given a kind of cancer that makes them
explode into growth, duplicating themselves time and again very
accurately so that each cell is identical.
''This enables more accurate toxicity studies which would closely
reflect human exposure to chemicals in the environment.
''If we are successful, the research would be of great benefit to
pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries and all the others who are
obliged by law to evaluate the safety of their products.
''One likely consequence includes a reduction in drug and chemicals
development costs and several leading players in the biotech industry
are showing keen interest.''
MacDonald said another potential benefit is that the immortal cells
could be used as bio-farms to harvest specific vital medical products
like Human Blood Factor 8.
''It's possible that in the future we will use liver cells to make the
blood-clotting factor in substantial quantities which could benefit
haemophiliacs.''
For the moment, though, the work looks like a benefit to the millions
of lab rats currently used in experiments. In addition, experimenting on
cells rather than animals could cut each test's cost from #10 to 10
pence, saving millions in development funds, and large numbers of
chemicals could be tested at a time, in a cheap and automated process
which will save more time and money.
''If we can benefit humans and animals at the same time,'' MacDonald
said, ''then that can only be good.''

* LORD HOPE, Lord president of the Court of Session, is hooked on the
OJ Simpson trial, he admitted to Strathclyde University's Law School.
The Lord Justice General is fascinated by the use of info-tech which
allows evidence to be recorded instantly and by the videos and graphics
used to assist in questioning witnesses. Opening a recent conference on
information technology in Law at Strathclyde, Lord Hope said the school
has played a vital role in the development of legal training in the
field of computers. However, in comparison to the OJ high-tech court
room drama, Scotland's courtroom technology, he said, was in the era of
the air balloon.
Slugs cause millions of pounds in crop damage each year, and because
Scotland and the rest of the UK is so moist for most of the time,
they're a bigger problem here than in most of Europe. Scientists at Long
Ashton research station are investigating common carabid beetles which
eat slugs to find out if they can be recruited as a crop pest control.
One snag they've discovered is that slug pellets are also bad for
beetles.
SOME plants are spreading like weeds on deadly ground. Foresters
working with a wildlife trust in Wales have made some remarkable
discoveries on the spoil heaps of abandoned metal mines, land which is
poisoned by copper and lead. They've found colonies of rare metallophyte
lichens thriving where other plants would wilt, wither and die.
Richard Thomson, district forester is trying to puzzle out whether the
metal-loving plants need the contamination, or just tolerate it. Many
old mine sites, and there are plenty in Scotland, are on exposed, open
ground. The low density tree cover creates a humid microclimate,
allowing a rich variety of ferns, mosses and liverworts to develop.
A TEAM of researchers, backed by the Biotechnical and Biolological
sciences Research Council, and the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and
Food , are doing research into the problems of stress in animal
transportation.
Focusing on broiler chickens, the team at Silsoe Research Institute
says that 650 million chickens are transported by road. Apparently,
crammed 6000 to a lorry, the chickens build up a considerable level of
heat which can cause severe stress. Studies have made it possible to
define acceptable limits and durations for transporting the birds.
To get accurate measurements the Silsoe team have developed a
purpose-built and fully instrumented animal transporter which allows
them to monitor all the environmental conditions in transit. The study
will expand to examine the stresses on other species including pigs and
cattle and will hopefully make animal transportation as humane and
stress-free as possible.
EVEN holes in the ground need electronic solutions. The Centre for
Enviromental Management Studies at Strathclyde University has produced a
software package to improve the management of landfill sites. The
program collects data which will warn of potentially dangerous gas
build-ups and pollutant leakage. The project has been backed by Scottish
Enterprise and has had successful field trials.

AT LAST, they've developed a time machine. It was switched on here at
Frontiers and instantly, miraculously we were back in the sixties.
It is true. Our resident computer technology experts told us they'd
loaded a new program to the PC. Booted it up, they tend to say.
It's a fractal generator, they said. Fine, fair enough. But what is
it? Simple. It's a mathematical equation expressed in shape and colour.
It had us beat. Simple it is not. They take long numbers, multiply,
divide, add Pi and theta and all sorts of sines and cosines and go off
at a tangent and what ends up on the screen is a complex and
ever-changing pattern of light and shade.
The mathematics was beyond our ken, but the resident experts booted
the program into the machine, hit a key and the screen went blank for
only a few moments. After that, five hours passed in a hypnotic haze. If
the tech heads hadn't come back to switch off the lights, this writer
could have been found still glued to the screen after the weekend.
Sixteen million colours on this program, our experts had boasted.
That's 16 with a stack of zeros behind it and every colour different
from the next. Heck, I never knew there were more than 10 and out of
that, only three were in the super league. Can anybody imagine
16,000,000 shades? There's magenta and puce and nearly blue and the
colour of fun and the shade of laughter and velvet yellow. Even Leonardo
would have been knocked flat by sensory overload.
The cute little mathematical program goes on generating these shapes
and colours, which swirl and grow on the screen.They say if you remember
your sixties, you were never there. Spend more than 30 seconds in front
of a fractal display and you ARE there.
After five minutes, I believed I could hear Jimmi Hendrix hammering
the frets all along the watchtower. Straight-leg chinos widened at the
ankle into dreadful flares with striped insets. Every sentence uttered
suddenly ended with like, man. The urge to grow a droopy moustache and
sit in a lotus position was almost overwhelming. The colours swirled
around on the screen, mesmerising, intoxicating, the kind of tones that
haven't existed since the days of free love and petal power and only
existed then because of illegal potions which turned the brain into a
fractal generator all of its own, and also tended to short the circuits.
Like the little girl in Poltergeist who heard voices in the TV set,
one was jammed against the screen watching an infinity of patterns in
constant mesmeric motion. It was impossible to move. The screen had
stolen every vestige of volition. It had me snared like a rabbit in the
headlights. Fortunately, the technical folk came back and found this
poor bug-eyed hack jammed against a moving screen and switched it off
before irreversible brain damage ensured. it took several hours and
plenty of beer to recover. The fractal program has been removed from the
machine. The memory has been wiped and not before time. If this kind of
thing were to get around, who knows where it would lead.
There are some things that man was not meant to know. Millions of
living colours are some of them. Now we know where Lennon and McCartney
got the idea for the girl with kaleidoscope eyes. They were either high
as kites, or fractalled out of their skulls. If anyone offers you this
program, just say no. There should be a law against it.

Technology Initiative for the Disabled and Elderly. Dundee University's
Microcentre is working on the project which will provide a written
system for the 20 million deaf people in the EC. Wearing electonically
sensitive gloves, a message made in sign language is picked up by
computer which translates and prints it out in a picture form similar to
hieroglyphics. One bonus is that sign language does not have to be

They are truly delicious but they are also rather delicate and it
needs careful handling to save the skins of this juicy fruit, advises
Lady Claire Macdonald.
THREE weeks ago I was writing about asparagus and saying how short a
season asparagus used to have -- I could say exactly the same about
cherries. Cherries used to be a real treat, in the shops for such a
brief space of time, until a few years ago. These days I think we could
buy cherries all year round, but at a price.
The very word cherry conjures in my mind large, glossy black cherries,
but of course there are several different varieties. It's hard not to be
attracted to the black cherries, whose very appearance promises
juiciness, but some of the golden cherries are just as delicious as the
black cherries. Black cherry jam sounds so utterly luxurious and seems
to be connected in the minds of skiers, with Alpine holidays, French
bread, and steaming cups of hot chocolate. And some makes of black
cherry jam are very good, but jam made with the paler, red cherries I
think has a more distinctly cherry taste. One of the easiest sauces for
eating with vanilla ice-cream is made by heating good quality cherry jam
with either brandy, or with cherry brandy -- take care not to let the
sauce simmer, because this removes the alcoholic quality.
Cherries make a centrepiece for a table which is perfect for an
informal occasion. Pile them up on a dish with a steam or an
old-fashioned glass cakestand.But you do have to be careful with
cherries, quite apart from the fact that everyone tends to eat them who
sees them, because they are fragile and bruise easily. They need to be
stored in the fridge , and when you buy them look carefully to check
that none have broken skins or bruising. Wash them just before using
them, rather than washing them and then storing them.
Cherries are very good in savoury dishes, as well as sweet. Cherries
go especially well with almonds, and with chocolate. Cherry pie, or
rather a cherry tart, made with pastry containing ground almonds in
place of half the flour quantity, and with a couple of drops of almond
extract (as opposed to essence) added to give a more dominant almond
flavour, is sumptuous.
Cherries make into a good sauce for serving with roast duck (of the
domestic type, rather than wild duck) but it does need to have a
sharpness added to the sauce, which I get with white-wine vinegar,
otherwise the danger is to have a sickly sauce. A sauce like this is
also very good with roast or char-grilled venison fillet. To make the
sauce, enough for about six people, you just put [1/4] pint white-wine
vinegar and two tablespoons granulated sugar into a saucepan over a
gentle heat. Heat till the sugar dissolves completely then boil fast
till you have a caramel-like syrup. Add 1 pint chicken (or beef, if for
venison) stock, which will make a whoosh of steam as you pour it into
the caramel syrup, so watch out -- let this liquid boil till it is
reduced by about half.
Slake 2 teaspoons arrowroot with 2 tablespoons cold water and stir
this into the sauce, stirring till it boils. Take the pan off the heat
and stir in [1/2]lb stoned black cherries. Season with salt and pepper.
It's so simple!
But here is a pudding which combines chocolate with cherries. It, too,
is simple, and delicious.
Chocolate and Cherry Meringue
(Serves 6-8)
Whites of 4 large eggs
8oz icing sugar, sieved
1oz cocoa powder, also sieved, but keep it separate from the icing
sugar
For the filling:
[3/4] pint double cream, whipped fairly stiffly
[1/2]lb cherries, stoned and chopped. Reserve 8 whole with stalks for
decoration
3 tablespoons Kirsch liqueur, optional, to whip into the cream
To make the meringue, first line a baking tray with baking parchment
and mark out two circles about 8" diameter. Put the whites and sieved
icing sugar (not the cocoa at this stage) into a Pyrex bowl over a
saucepan of simmering water. Whisk -- easiest with an electric hand-held
whisk -- until the meringue thickens and is very stiff. Take the bowl
off the heat and sieve in the cocoa. Fold it in quickly and thoroughly.
Divide the meringue between the two marked circles and smooth even. Bake
in an oven 110[DEG]C, 220[DEG]F, gas mark [1/4] for 2[1/2]-3 hours -
when cooked, the meringues should lift off the baking parchment. Cool
them. You can store them in a tin or airtight container for several
days, if that is more convenient.
To assemble, keep about one-third of the whipped cream on one side,
for decoration. Fold the stoned cherries into the main part of the
cream, flavoured or not, as you choose, with Kirsch. Put a dab of cream
on to a serving plate and put one meringue half on this -- it holds the
meringue in place. Cover the meringue with the cherry cream. Put the
other meringue on top. With a large star nozzle, pipe rosettes of
whipped cream around the edges, and lay a cherry with its stalk on each
rosette. If you prefer, just spread the whipped cream over the surfce of
the meringue and dust with dark chocolate, shaved from a block with a
potato peeler. Arrange the cherries around the sides, stuck on to the
cream.

John Linklater finds his way to the other side of the bar for a day,
and potential perks notwithstanding, decides it is a skill best left to
the experts.
HER first impression of me was not encouraging, for either of us.
''You're too tall,'' said Alison Traynor. ''You'll frighten my customers
away.'' There was something else. Staff policy was for males to wear a
collar and tie. I was wearing jeans with a T-shirt under an open-necked
shirt. It was going to be an awkward baptism in my new position as
trainee manager at the Calderwood Inn.
I lasted one day. To be fair, that was always the deal. The invitation
from the organisers of Scottish Pub Week didn't seek a long-term
commitment. I was to manage for the day. That would make a change.
''Picture this, you are given the keys of your very own pub,'' read the
letter. ''You are the boss, the master of all you survey. A full gantry,
stocked with the finest wines and spirits. A cellar bulging with draught
lager, heavy, stout and real ale. The till full of change, ready to
serve your customers, male, female, old, young and families.''
Serve your customers? ''Help yourself'', was the way I interpreted the
sub-text. Pour yourself a bath with the stuff. Get right in there and
gargle. I could handle that. When I turned up in East Kilbride for the
first part of my split shift on Friday morning, Alison Traynor let me
in. She was the real manager. ''Are you nervous?'' she asked. It was
clear as hell that she was.
With every justification. My curriculum vitae in the field of barwork
is not exactly covered with distinction. There was that job at North
Berwick when I got sacked. Time has healed some of the grievance, but I
still maintain that it was their fault for giving me my week's pay on
Thursday lunchtime. Memory blurs, but there was a woman and a bottle of
whisky, and when she chucked me out of her place there was a golf course
between me and my five-o'clock shift. Almost there, I fell into a bunker
and scored a triple bogey, without clubs, without ball, without a clue,
without a job.
Then there was my Tom Cruise phase as a cocktail barman at the Peebles
Hydro. I worked for a brooding Spaniard called Joe Palaci, who reserved
animation for serious money walking through the door, and only then
would he open his repertoire of bar tricks and charismatic charm. It was
all about tips. I learned to throw ice and unmeasured spirits into
shakers, and developed an unhealthy penchant as an eighteen-year-old
first-year student for knocking back neat triple vodkas. Follies of
youth.
It was with a studied effort at responsibility that I asked Alison to
hand over her keys and take me to her cellar. With that same air of
feigned expertise you try to impress upon garage mechanics when you lift
the bonnet of your malfunctioning and completely incomprehensible car, I
nodded sagely at kegs and drums, valves and feeds, gas cylinders and
pressures. It was important to stage an early demonstration of
competence and assurance. Then I asked her to show me how to change a
barrel.
From there on we came to an accommodation. Alison handed me a broom
and I leaned on it. There wasn't much else to do at 10.30 in the
morning. She had already performed a damage limitation exercise two
hours before. She had unlocked the place, switched on the lights, cut
the alarm, set up the bar, the ashtrays, the jugs and the ice, and
stocked the till with change. She and her assistant, Evelyn, had
everything under control. There were another two things I should know.
She and Evelyn were a close-knit team. They were sisters. Also, they
both took Kung-Fu. ''It gives you confidence in yourself,'' said Alison,
a little pointedly, I thought.
It would be better if I tried to look at it this way. The Calderwood
Inn is a nice pub, a traditional local community pub, in a conservation
area of East Kilbride. There was a homely feel about the place. The bar
has a fireplace, wally dugs on a ledge and a grandmother clock on the
wall. Alison called it her ''sitting room''.
Describing her as house-proud would be a slight exaggeration, but she
runs a tight shop. During bar stock-taking we discovered that a single
can of Irn-Bru could not be brought to immediate account. Further
inquiry revealed it to have been served the day before to one of the
draymen when the beer was delivered. It was at about this stage that my
last illusions faded of a libertine orgy with the contents of the
gantry.
There were three men waiting outside when we opened up. Pulling pints
for the first time in 25 years proved a remarkably untraumatic
experience, once you mastered the little technique of producing a late
head on a flat delivery, or subduing an over-lively gush at the
beginning. The whole business suggests a wonderful mystique of control
at the pump, but I suspect that it's really so easy that you ought to
struggle to go too far wrong. I couldn't remember Guinness being so easy
to pour, or cider. Was lager always so submissive, export so equable as
it trickles into the glass with an obliging nod of its head? Still, I
managed an awkward moment with a dead pint of heavy, before having a
sudden impulse to collect glasses from the tables and leave it for
someone else to sort out.
During the course of the day we had only one complaint about pints. As
manager-for-the-day I felt duty bound to deal with it: a Guinness that
had settled a fair quarter-inch below the rim. Rectifying the situation,
I inquired: ''Who served you this pint, sir.'' ''You!'' was the fellow's
impertinent reply. ''You must have been pulling for the brewery.''
Possibly I am not best temperamentally suited to service industries.
My mother, who ran a guest house for a while, remarked on a passing
resemblance to Basil Fawlty the day I volunteered to do breakfasts. It
was the scrambled eggs that threw me. Still, I did them so badly that
the next morning the two old dears in question opted for the safer
option of the house mixed grill. I offered to pay mum #10.50 a room if
she kept the house clear for my next visit.
It would be outwith my means to suspend Friday night trading at the
Calderwood Inn, so there was nothing else but to get on with it. In
truth, the clientelle was an easy group to deal with, patient and
tolerant. There is nothing that alerts you more to the basic decency of
people than to observe the benign way in which they respond to a
complete amateur taking their orders and fiddling away at the
computerised till to rehearse the counting out of change before ending
the protracted transaction.
We didn't have any fights. Alison says that it is the football on the
television that has to be dealt with tactfully. She settles disputes
over which game should be shown by democratic shows of hands. The
Calderwood Inn proved, as Friday evening moved on steadily to its
midnight last orders, a smooth machine with an agreeable atmosphere.
I have to admit that this was the most sober I had remained at this
stage of an evening in quite a number of weeks. Alison, it emerged, was
no drinker. ''The last thing I'd want to do with a day off is sit in a
pub,'' she remarked. Inevitably, perhaps, she met her taxi-driver
boyfriend, Jim, in the pub. A regular, he took up position at the bar
midway through the night, with his mates demanding free drink of the new
manager. I had been told to expect the arrival of the ''baldies'' on the
stroke of 11, but there was no appearance from the Calderwood Inn's own
Jimmy Reid. He has given his initials to his own preference, a
speciality J.R. that has caught on. It is a Pale Ale tops, with Guinness
instead of lemonade.
Otherwise, tastes at the inn are straight down the middle. I imagine
that if the regular staff that night, Carmen, Suzanne and Kenny along
with full-timers Alison and Evelyn, had ever considered that I might
have any potential whatsoever, it would be in helping to clear the bar
at the end. Suddenly, I got a bit coy about this prospect, explaining
that I did not want to interfere in the relationship between the bar and
its regulars. I retired for a smoke, but sneaked a glance or two at
Alison and Evelyn doing a grand job, without once resorting to even a
hint of Kung-Fu.
The Scottish Pub Week is a promotion to illustrate the range and
diversity of bar-life in this part of the world. The week begins on
Father's Day, June 18, and at the Calderwood Inn they will be having a
pool tournament. Activities will be going on at your local, with the
invitation to check it out. No doubt I will too, but this time sticking
to this side of the bar. Best for everyone concerned, I think.

Lesley Duncan goes Gallic for celebrations which will involve bagpipes
and claret.
THE Marseillaise will be ringing at least symbolically (and maybe on a
few bagpipes, too) round Scotland this weekend as the centenary of the
Franco-Scottish Society is celebrated. It is a younger manifestation of
the Auld Alliance, itself 600-years-old when the new body was set up in
Edinburgh in 1895, and in Paris the following year. The society's aim
was, and remains, to maintain and promote friendship between Scotland
and France.
Every school child used to know (do they still?) about Scotland's
historic pact -- dating from John Balliol's reign -- with the much
larger and more sophisticated country. It suited France for the nuisance
value on England's northern frontier. It gave Scotland a benevolent
counterweight against the bullying of its big southern neighbour. The
effects could be tragic, as in Scotland's involvement at Flodden at
France's behest. On the other hand, the nation's vocabulary and culture
were enriched over the centuries by the Gallic association. In return,
such Scots as the philosopher David Hume and economist Adam Smith, made
their impact on French intellectual life. Sir Walter Scott influenced
French romanticism. And of course, French was the automatic first
foreign language for many generations of Scottish school children who
could lisp their Verlaine or de Vigny with varying degrees of aplomb.
Events in Edinburgh come to a climax this weekend. A delegation from
France, and a Canadian representative, will attend a centenary dinner
this evening in the august surroundings of the Signet Library. The
French Ambassador, Monsieur Jean Gueguinou, will be guest of honour.
Medals, however, will not be worn. This -- explains the society's
honorary general secretary, Mrs Elizabeth Laidlaw -- is in deference to
their French visitors who would otherwise have been burdened with
bringing formal clothes.
There is, predictably, a strong representation of lawyers, archivists,
civil servants, and teachers in the French group. Their number includes
Monsieur Georges Dickson, OBE, president of the French branch, and his
wife. As the name suggests the Dicksons have Scottish connections --
with Forfar and Dundee. Sadly, the splendidly titled General Guy de
Cockborne, a former luminary of the French Foreigh Legion and also with
Scottish antecedents, will not be attending. A Protestant minister,
Monsieur le Pasteur Christian Mazel and his wife, are in the party. They
are unusual, points out Mrs Laidlaw, in that the French society is
mostly strongly Catholic.
The French delegation, as well as their Scottish friends, will no
doubt be attending this afternoon's Landsdowne Lecture, an occasional
series instituted by the Marquess of Lansdowne, a former president of
the society. Today's talk will be given in St Cecilia's Hall at 2.15pm
by a Scot, Judge David Edward of the European Court of Justice. His
theme is ''Justice in Europe''. Will he refer to Thomas Muir, the
radical Scottish advocate who was fired by the ideals of the French
Revolution and deported to Australia for his pains; or mention how
Robert Burns was inspired by French views of egalitarianism?
Previous Lansdowne lecturers have included Monsieur Michel Duchein,
Inspecteur General des Archives de France, whose theme was Mary Queen of
Scots' mother, Marie de Guise; Professor Sylvere Monod of the University
of Paris who gave a French perspective on Johnson and Boswell's tour of
Scotland in 1773; Monsieur Luc de la Barre de Nanteuil on the artist
Louis David; and the Scottish architect Charles McKean on the
rediscovery of Scottish Renaissance architecture.
From tomorrow the focus shifts from the capital to other parts of
Scotland with their own branches of the Franco-Scottish Society.
Tomorrow the French group visit the Perth centre and Lord Lansdowne at
Meikleour House. On Monday they go to St Andrews and at 6pm there's a
centenary film event at Edinburgh's Filmhouse, where Bernard Chardere,
director of the Lumiere Institute in Lyon, presents what is described as
''an exceptional selection of very early short films''.
Tuesday is Ayrshire day and includes a visit to Culzean Castle. A tour
of Burns Cottage is naturally de rigueur. On Wednesday the French
visitors reach Glasgow and Helensburgh, with a civic reception in
Glasgow City Chambers and an organised trip to the Faslane submarine
base.
On Wedneday evening Cappella Nova give a public concert in Glasgow
Cathedral at 8pm. The programme is entitled ''Music for the Marriage of
Mary Queen of Scots and the Dauphin'', though Cappella Nova's director,
Alan Tavener, explains that it's really providing a focus to celebrate
the Auld Alliance. Mary's first marriage perished, with her teenage
spouse, within months. Her subsequent return to Scotland ended in
debacle and death. But though there are ''pre-echoes and a slight
tinge'' of that sad future, the programme, Alan Tavener says, is
generally celebratory.
Different groups of singers will alternate secular and sacred music.
The latter includes no Carver (too early in period) but does involve a
French mass  written in the appropriate year, 1558. There will also be
Scottish court songs of the sixteenth century (including the rollicking
Oh Lusty May) and Parisian chansons. Tom Fleming will be the narrator in
this third outing for the programme, already performed at the end of
last month in Edinburgh and Aberdeen.
Thus culturally fortified, the French group will head for Aberdeen for
their final two days, with sorties to Balmoral, Lochnagar Distillery,
and the Total Oil Marine gas terminal among their activities, as well as
a civic reception.
By the time they return to Paris next Saturday, they will have new
insights into Scotland and the Scots. Pleasant new connections will have
been  made.
This was just what the founding fathers of the Franco-Scottish Society
intended 100 years ago. And now, as they say, un peu d'histoire: in
spite of the formal 1895 date, the society's origins really stretch back
to the great international exhibition in Paris in 1889. The celebrated
town planner Patrick Geddes was a moving force and Louis Pasteur a
member of the organising Comite Franco-Ecossais. From the beginning, the
Scottish and French branches of the society have been responsible for
their own organisation and finances but maintain close contacts.
The two branches were originally much concerned with the welfare of
students and financed prizes and bursaries. This has a modern equivalent
in the Lansdowne Prize, established in 1986. Until 1991 it was given at
university level. Since then it has been awarded to outstanding
candidates in the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies French exam. Its
first winner, in 1992, was Euan Pinkerton, of Bearsden Academy and
Hermitage Academy, Helensburgh.
Elizabeth Laidlaw says the society would like to encourage the setting
up of a network or register of employers in Scotland willing to offer
work experience placements to French students.
And what of young Scots going to France? ''Ideally,'' Mrs Laidlaw
adds, ''it would be travel in both directions.''
The eight local centres of the Scottish end of the society keep in
touch through their council but organise their own annual programmes,
blending cultural, social, and linguistic activities. The
Franco-Scottish Society also has close links with the French Institute
for Scotland in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
As French and Ayrshire youngsters used to sing at summer school camps
in West Linton and Versailles, L'Ecosse est belle et vive la France!

CORNETTIST Ruby Braff has never been able to achieve even the limited
fame that has come the way of many less-talented jazz musicians.
There are several reasons for this -- his uncompromising attitude
towards his music, and his often querulous offstage persona which has
dragged him into conflict with promoters. On some occasions, Braff can
be a highly amusing raconteur. On others, he can be extremely difficult,
often best avoided.
But no-one should ever avoid the music he makes. At the moment Braff
is enjoying one of those rare spells in the limelight that at times have
been denied. Within the past six months or so we have been able to hear
him on three CD re-issues from the fifties, and two more albums made
recently. Thankfully there are still more to come.
During his career, which has now spanned almost half a century, Braff
has been blessed with a series of fairy godfathers to help him find work
and record dates.
In the 1950s, the legendary talent scout and record producer, John
Hammond, chose the then relatively unknown cornet player from Boston to
take part in the Vic Dickenson Septet recordings which helped launch the
Mainstream revival. Then there was a spell when George Wein took over
and Ruby became a key figure in the Newport All Stars. In the seventies,
Carl Jefferson was the man who featured Braff on a series of albums for
his Concord label.
Now a new producer, Mat Domber has taken up Braff's cause and two fine
CDs have been issued recently on his Arbors label. Four more will soon
be available.
The two we have been able to hear feature Braff in two different
settings. The first is a quartet which brings to mind the wonderful
group he co-led with guitarist George Barnes about 20 years ago. The
other is with a larger group featuring pianist Dave McKenna and tenorist
Scott Hamilton.
That same group has another album ready to be released and there is
also a reunion with pianist Ellis Larkins in a series of duets.
These will be on two CDs and another duet meeting with pianist Dick
Hyman has been recorded.
Now, approaching 70, Braff has retained all the melodic freshness of
his youth. When he was learning his instrument, be-bop was the
fashionable jazz sound. Braff turned his back on that and went the way
of Louis Armstrong. When he talks of Armstrong you realise that for
Braff, as for so many others, there could never be any other musical
road.
There have been other influences, of course. When he swoops into the
low register he can, at times, sound like Red Allen.
The new CDs demonstrate Braff's undying love for melody. Listen to his
duet with McKenna on What's New or catch It's Wonderful on the other
live album.
There were fears that Braff would move into near retirement when he
left New York to live on Cape Cod sometime back. Luckily Mat Domber has
made certain that is not going to happen. Last year he survived a
serious illness which put him into a coma, and he maintains to this day
that it was the music of Armstrong which helped him recover. ''I heard
Louis and that was enough to make me well again.''

The Herald's regular team of reviewers listen to the best sounds
around.
Wasted Volume 1, various artists (Volume)
* THOSE perceptive folk who run the Volume label have been issuing
indie-oriented CD collections -- each accompanied by a chunky booklet --
since 1991. Now they've come up with a 30-track, two-CD compilation of
indie-minded, dancefloor-focused music, accompanied by the mandatory
chunky booklet. Among the best-known names, you'll find Massive Attack
(with Karmacoma); Bjork (One Day); New Order (Confusion); Stereo MCs
(Elevate My Mind) and the Shamen (Hyperreal). Despite the presence of
one or two hip underground names -- Autechre, Moby -- this isn't a
collection for the cognoscenti. Rather, it's a pleasant and instructive
beginners' guide to modern modes of rhythm-transmission.
The Complete Stone Roses, The Stone Roses (Silvertone)
* HAVING recycled the Roses' work more than once before, Silvertone
now seek to charm the few remaining shillings from your pocket by
parcelling up two hitherto-unreleased tracks on a bonus CD alongside
another CD containing the band's enduringly-awesome six-year-old debut
album, plus their singles and B-sides. I am without Shoes is 1min 23sec
of non-specific backwards guitar and oblique vocalising. Groove (Black
Magic Devil Woman) is a lumpy guitar work-out. Both would have been
better left unreleased.
Welcome To The Real World, Frankie Knuckles featuring Adeva (Virgin)
* BUSY, deft, and pop-oriented, this assembly of sophisticated
housey-housey music may be a little too soft-centred to set dancefloors
alight, but it sure will add some tone to your living-room hi-fi.
The Best of Barbara Lynn: the Atlantic Years (Ichiban/Soul Classics)
* THE heroine of many a northern soul all-nighter, Barbara Lynn is a
vocalist with a sweet and smoky tone. She also wrote many of her own
songs as well as playing guitar on them. This 20-track collection
documents her work in the years between 1967 and 1973. If you enjoy an
amble down soul's dusty by-ways, then amble Barbara Lynn's way.
Branded, Isaac Hayes (Pointblank)
* WIZENED critics who should know better -- and I do mean you, Tony
Parsons, of the Daily Torygraph -- have been getting michtily enflamed
about this, hailing it as Mr Hayes's return to the soul peaks he last
scaled with his alleged classic, the half-mile-long Theme From Shaft. In
fact, Mr Hayes is doing what he always did as a solo artist: indulging
himself way too long for the good of the song he's supposed to be
presenting. Paradoxically, nowhere is this clearer than on a song which
failed to survive the jump to CD from advance review-tape: a grossly
extended, slowed-down 9min 6sec version of the Blue Nile's Let's Go Out
Tonight. What was it John Shaft said all those years ago? ''Shut yo'
mouth.'' That goes for both Isaac Hayes and Tony Parsons.
All Platinum Funk, various artists (Charly)
* TWENTY dollops of bouncy, user-friendly pop-funk from some of the
sundry artists on the All Platinum label in the late seventies. Brother
To Brother's version of In The Bottle out-grooves that of the song's
originator, Gil Scott Heron. But best of all are the little-known
Communicators And Black Experiences Band with Is It Funky Enough? It
certainly is, hot diggety.
Jiving Jamboree, various artists (Ace)
* ELVIS? Who's he? The rock started rolling for sure in 1949 with
Louis Jordan at the Saturday Night Fish Fry. You will discover many
jive-worthy tunes by solid-gone daddios -- Daddy Cleanhead for one, but
Clarence Henry and the Mills Brothers, too -- and rockin' mamas ranging
from Big Mama Thornton to Etta James.
Mussorgsky/Ravel, Royal Philharmonic; Khatchaturian, Royal
Philharmonic; Delius, Royal Philharmonic (Tring International)
* THE latest batch of new releases in the series by the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra -- contracted by Tring International to produce a
major set of recordings at economical prices -- continues to challenge
the market. The price difference is phenomenal; whereas you might pay
around #14 for a full-price CD, Tring are putting this lot out at #3.99
each.
In general the recording standards, as I have written before, are
high.
The Khatchaturian set -- Dances from Gayane, Spartacus, and Masquerade
-- with conductor Yuri Simonov, is a firecracker of a recording.
Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition (Jean-Claude Casadesus on white
stick) is a bit less competitive -- it never really smacks you between
the eyes -- though the Ravel couplings (Daphnis and Chloe and La Valse)
are markedly more sensitive.
Sketches of Dreams, David Sanchez (Columbia)
* THE second album by one imminent visitor to Glasgow International
Jazz Festival features another, trumpeter Roy Hargrove as a
near-scene-stealing guest. Sanchez plays tenor saxophone often with a
lightness and mobility more associated with an altoist and is equally
fluent and inventive on soprano as he confirms his Puerto Rican roots
and pays homage to Rodgers &amp; Hart and Jackie McLean. Not a startlingly
original voice but an engaging one none the less.
Steal Away, Charlie Haden and  Hank Jones (Verve)
* ONE of the year's more offbeat releases finds Haden and Jones
enjoying a bass and piano stroll through a not-altogether predictable
collection of spirituals, hymns, and folksongs. They play them straight,
tempting no accusations of deconstructing We Shall Overcome, say, and
with all the solemn grace that Haden brought to his work with Keith
Jarrett, although surely even that polymath wouldn't have anticipated
Haden soloing on Danny Boy.

Artist David Mach tells Ann Donald his favoured nocturnal reading.
WHEN I was a kid I was a voracious reader, into anything I could get
my mitts on: lots of rubbishy things like comics, adventure stories and
loads of Enid Blyton. I was kind of obsessed by things Jewish. From a
very early age I was reading about the Holocaust. One of the reasons
being that my dad is Polish and we travelled through Eastern Europe when
I was a kid and I think the romance of all that stuff got to me.
I've been reading James Michener's Poland. He writes these big epics
about Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands and that's right up my street.
It's sort of made-up, slightly accurate history which can be kind of
dangerous, I think. He uses names of very famous families in Poland and
embellishes certain characters within them. But he's invented one family
which goes right through the whole book from the fourteenth century up
to the present day tracing their lineage.
Another one I'm reading is one a friend gave me by Rory McLean called
Stalin's Nose. It's a great book and very funny. It's like travel
writing in a way, as he's making a journey with two eccentric aunts
through eastern Europe to Moscow. The characters are huge, really quite
bizarre because they're coming to terms with moving through an Eastern
Europe that's really changed, where walls have come down and there are
less restrictions.
I buy a lot of my books at airports. I find airports really
fascinating because they bombard you with writing and authors from all
these different countries that otherwise I wouldn't seek out. With so
many nationalities travelling you've suddenly got access to Indian,
Spanish and Venezuelan writers who are well known in their own country,
or perhaps in literary circles here, but that you'd never ordinarily
come across.
I don't buy art theory books if I can help it. The only art theory I
come across is from thinking about it, which is maybe how it should
happen. I don't think I'd be able to draw a direct line between reading
a particular book than creating a particular work. It's much more
convoluted or hidden if you like -- it travels a long and strange route
before it turns into a sculpture.

SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS. David Guterson. Bloomsbury, #14.99
DAVID Guterson's first novel is a beauty. The most remarkable thing
about it is its assurance. The story is a thrilling one, but Guterson
refuses to be hurried and tells it at his own leisurely, thoughtful
pace. He is a painstaking writer with an exacting eye for physical
detail, yet the novel is never hard going; there is a beguiling, almost
mesmerising, quality about his prose.
It is not as if he can muster only one pace, either; at times he
builds strong narrative momentum -- in some of the courtroom  scenes, in
a particularly brutal flashback to the Second World War, in his vivid
description of a nightmare journey to a Japanese internment camp in
California.
Guterson has an extraordinary sense of place. The novel is set on an
island in Puget Sound in North-west America. It is an unhurried,
inward-looking place, a community of strawberry farmers and fishermen.
There is a tourist season in the summer. The winters are long and harsh.
There is ethnic tension; there is a significant Japanese community. This
tension lies at the core of the book.
In all of this there are resonances for Scottish readers, for the
parallels with certain communities in the Highlands of Scotland are
undoubtedly there, although too much could no doubt be made of them.
Suffice to say that the book evokes an uneasy sense of familiarity,
though its setting and its time (most of the action takes place in 1954,
though there are several flashbacks to the war and even earlier) is so
far away.
The plot is built round the mysterious death of a fisherman in Puget
Sound. One of his fellow fishermen, a Japanese, is arrested for his
murder; the book begins and ends with scenes from his trial, and indeed
the courtroom sequences hold the book together. The novel operates in
part as a thriller, and it would be wrong to divulge anything more of
the very intricate and gripping plot, which Guterson unfolds with craft
and cunning.
If there are caveats, they are minor. There is no humour in Guterson's
writing and the one episode describing action from the Second World War
jars, although it has considerable narrative power; the author seems to
adopt a different voice here, more strained, more macho, less assured.
Snow Falling On Cedars is a first novel of beauty, conviction and
power. It is not a masterpiece but its author will surely write one.

POWER PLAY: THE LIFE &amp; TIMES OF PETER HALL
Stephen Fay. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #20
THEATRE directors make lousy interviewees. OK, that is a daft
generalisation, but compared with other associated professions and with
some notable exceptions, directors are not fertile ground for the
feature writer.
Performers -- even the notoriously difficult ones -- are almost always
good copy. Actors have to want to be loved. It goes with the job.
Especially the notoriously difficult ones. Writers have a confidence in
their own ideas that comes from the isolation of their profession. They
have mastered the art of joined-up thinking while directors have to be
masters of sequential compromise.
Even the ones who have been very articulate in putting their own
thoughts and theories down on paper -- Peter Brook and John McGrath
spring to mind -- are often a complete waste of time in a face-to-face
situation. They are only happy when they control the agenda and the best
interviews always come when both the journalist and his subject are
prepared to let the conversation find its own subject.
A biography of a theatre director therefore presents particular
difficulties, unless he has some identifiable style or is larger than
life. There has never been a Sir Peter Hall style of theatre, because
that somehow suggests operating at the margins, as Brook does with his
international company and continental base. Hall has been at the centre
of English theatre for 40 years, since his production of Beckett's
Waiting for Godot, but he saw himself as like an orchestral conductor
rather than as a creator. Leading both the Royal Shakespeare Company and
the National Theatre, he could not become larger than life because he
was, for a long time, exactly the same size as the English theatre. That
is the tragedy of both.
Stephen Fay is a vastly experienced journalist who began his working
life on this newspaper and was deputy editor of the Independent on
Sunday until 1991. This biography is the result of many years' work,
which makes the purposelessness of it doubly depressing. The sloppy
editing is one thing (mis-spellings like ''establishement'', repetition
of uninteresting facts like the exact amount of Hall's car allowance at
the National), but the lack of any clear intention on Fay's part makes
for a frustrating read.
Certainly he balances Hall's account of certain key events, as
published in his own writings, with the recollections of others, but you
won't catch Fay coming down on one side or the other. Even more
annoying, from this reader's point of view, we learn little or nothing
about Hall's work. We are told, for example, that some regarded his
production of Love's Labour's Lost while at Cambridge as his finest
work, yet we learn nothing at all about the show. The background to the
enormous undertaking of The Wars of the Roses at the RSC is described,
but little is said of the result. Fay is also given to irritating
journalese (''Tynan praised with faint damns'') and some absurd
generalisations (''Hall got a 2.2, an average degree. But the class of
the degree matters only to teachers and professors''), and even manages
to combine the two faults (''It is an inflexible rule of theatre that,
no matter how much rehearsal time there is, it always chaos at the end.
The Wars of the Roses was chaos at the beginning and the middle as
well.'')
In fairness, Fay is very good on facts and figures. Sometimes this can
be silly -- the exact model of car is usually mentioned -- but in the
machinations of the National's move to the South Bank it is fascinating.
Most of this appeared in the press at the time, but gathered together it
is a horror story that should be required reading for those intent on
establishing a Scottish national theatre. Worryingly it is a horror
story that continues to this day, and I speak as someone who rather
likes the National.
But then that is the other depressing thing about this book, and one
for which Fay cannot be blamed. The recognition factor: how little
things have changed. In an interview on leaving Cambridge, Hall spoke of
trying to attract a new audience of ''people in their twenties who were
more inclined to go and see a foreign film than a play'', and theatre
administrators speak of the same target group today. Nor has the
perception of the attitude of that group changed significantly, what
Hall described in a programme note to his mid-sixties Hamlet as ''a
sense of what-the-hell-anyway -- You might sleep with everyone you know,
you might not. You might take drugs, you might not.''
Hall might be a great director, he might not. This biography will not
lead you to any conclusions, but personally I doubt his greatness. He
had some successes and a lot of failures. He has been a deft politician
and a manipulative administrator. His personal life has been publicly
fraught, but not appallingly so, and he made a lot of things happen that
probably needed a man of his energy to push them through. I bet he still
gives a lousy interview though.

SALLY Soames is one of Britain's more distinguished professional
photographers. She has worked for the Sunday Times for many years, and
for some reason she has a particular empathy with writers of fiction.
She has been highly praised by, among others, Noman Mailer, who
contributes a neat and upbeat preface to her collection of author
portraits, simply entitled Writers (Andre Deutsch, #20 paperback). The
only disappointment in a very fine collection is that there are so few
studies of women writers. But the few that there are in the book are
exceptional, and we reproduce here her stunning portrait (shot two years
ago) of Ruth Rendell.

JOY STREET: A Wartime Romance in Letters: Mirren Barford and
Lieutenant Jock Lewes. ed Michael T Wise. Little, Brown, #13.99
LAST LETTERS HOME. ed Tamasin Day-Lewis Macmillan, #17.50
LETTERS become literature when they are preserved in print for
whatever reason. One reason is to add to our understanding of public
figures who, aware of their own importance, posted their letters to
posterity. Another reason is the pleasurable invasion of privacy for we
enjoy intercepting guided missives, hence the appeal of Joy Street and
Last Letters Home.
One month before Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Mirren
Barford met Jock Lewes at a wedding in Oxford. Born in India in 1920,
she was then a student at Somerville College. Born in India in 1913 and
educated at Christ Church College, he was then a member of the British
Council. Given peace in their time, Mirren had to wait while Jock helped
create a commando unit that became the SAS (Special Air Service).
Jock joined the Welsh Guards and wrote to Mirren from his training
camp in 1940: ''Persuade everyone you meet that we will and can fight
not to the end but until we win.'' He was convinced that ''to give one's
life and one's happiness in a cause like this is to win for oneself in a
future life which certainly awaits us all -- even Hitler -- such ecstasy
as we in our wildest dreams wot not of.'' Jock was killed by a cannon
shell from a German fighter in December 1941 while returning from an
operation against Nofilia aerodrome, Libya.
Mirren married Richard Wise in 1943. After her death in 1992, her son
Michael discovered her collection of letters in her desk. He decided to
publish because Mirren responded so enthusiastically to one of Jock's
letters in 1940: ''It was a fine letter; one day I hope my
great-grandchildren will take the trouble to have them published for
many people would read them gladly if they had the chance.'' Now they
have the chance they should take it.
Wise by name as well as nature, the editor has allowed Mirren and Jock
to speak for themselves by keeping his distance from their dialogue. He
provides a few factual annotations and briefly speculates on what the
mysterious Joy Street meant to his mother and Jock. Transcribing the
letters, Wise came to the conclusion that Joy Street ''described Mirren
and Jock's individual meeting''. Judging from the passionate tone of the
correspondence, Joy Street was more about mating than meeting.
''We have a chance to rank with the world's greatest lovers,'' wrote
Jock to Mirren in August 1940 after their seventh meeting which gave him
a glorious memory of ''No 7 Joy Street''. Thinking of No 8 Joy Street
(the eighth meeting), Jock asked: ''Do I or do I not wish to attempt the
seduction of Mirren?'' And he answered in his own lyrical way: ''It was
with perfect confidence that I approached No 8 Joy Street . . . We
stepped out of our clothes and slid together into the lake . . . We
ourselves were outlined in every detail of our proud bodies by a million
tiny points of steadfast light, not spattered or haphazard, but, like a
mezzotint, picking out the form of nature's beauty.''
Pressurised by the business of war, Jock enjoyed the pleasure of
writing erotic prose. The tough commando, who earned a reputation as the
most fearsome fighter in Tobruk, kept going by going on about Mirren:
''Oh God, how I desire you! How I crave and groan in spirit for that
sensual touch . . . How my lips burn for yours and the heat of your
tongue in my mouth and the smooth taste of your spittle and the warmth
of your breath in my nostrils!'' Jock wrote poems as well as prose for
Mirren but never managed to rise to the occasion in verse.
As Mirren noted in October 1941, it was an extraordinary affair. She
had met Jock only 10 times yet knew ''Joy Street was made to be lived in
and not merely the figment of dreams''. She knew Jock as a lover yet did
not want to blackmail him into marriage: ''I believe I'd marry you
tomorrow (but) remember too that I'm not asking you to belong to me; you
are as free now as you ever were.'' She was content at that time to wait
for him to come back to Joy Street, but, of course, he never did.
And he never could tell Mirren exactly what he was doing in the war.
An aside in a letter of September 1941 -- ''I have thrown in my lot with
David Stirling in a new venture'' -- can now be read as reference to the
formation of the SAS as Stirling is synonymous with the SAS though he
insisted: ''Jock could far more genuinely claim to be the founder of the
SAS than I.'' Jock's letters express his love for Mirren and, for all
his fighting spirit, he comes across as a lovesick solder longing for
the war to end. Mirren was obviously an inspirational figure. Many will
be moved by the way they come together in Joy Street, an intimate
account of an amorous adventure.
Joy Street concentrates on one couple. Last Letters Home show how
common it was for combatants to feel that fighting to win a war meant
losing out on love. Eric Rawlings, killed in action with the RAF, left a
letter to his loved ones: ''Love is such a very difficult thing to
express here and now on paper . . .'' Kenneth Stevens, captured by the
Japanese, wanted to comfort his wife as he drifted towards death: ''Oh
Pen, I love you so -- all I want in the world is to see you happy.''
Curly Oddy wrote to Irene Grundy three days before he died: ''I want us
to be married officially so that our combined love, as you put it, can
get together and we can have what you want.'' Wishful thinking in
wartime.
The pity of war is made poignantly clear in Tamasin Day-Lewis's
sensitive selection of letters written by folk emotionally wasted by the
daily experience of dwelling on death. Read both books under review and
you will realise what was lost in winning a war.

Scots melodies greet visitors privileged to see a fabulous collection
of Scottish art, which boasts virtually every name of note. But, reports
Lesley Duncan, it is housed in London and is closed to the public.
AMID all the controversy over the siting and contents of a national
gallery of Scottish art, one ironic point has been missed. There already
exists a superb collection of Scottish paintings, housed in a building
of impeccable architectural credentials. It is not, however, in the
public domain or in Scotland.
You will look for it in vain in Edinburgh or Glasgow. You have to go
instead to a quiet corner of the City of London where, within hailing
distance of the Bank of England and the gleaming obelisk of Lloyd's,
Robert Fleming Holdings Limited goes about its global business.
The international investment banking group traces its origins to 1873
in Dundee, when Robert Fleming formed the first investment trust in
Scotland. Its collection of Scottish paintings has more recent
beginnings.
Bill Smith, the Keeper of Art, explains the background. ''The catalyst
was really moving into a new building -- new for us that is -- some 27
years ago. The building had a tremendous number of bare walls. One of
our directors, David Donald, suggested brightening the place up by
buying a few pictures.''
He was left to get on with it. The only guidelines were that the
paintings had to be by Scottish artists or of Scottish scenes by any
artists.
The main object of the Flemings collection, Smith emphasises, is to
make the bank's headquarters ''a more interesting and invigorating place
to work''. It has surely fulfilled that purpose -- particularly since
the bank moved to its present custom-built base -- designed by Fitzroy
Robinson and Partners -- nine years ago.
Clients and visitors entering the marbled entrance hall are confronted
by an atrium, six storeys tall, lit from overhead by sunlight and lamps.
Semi-tropical trees, hanging plants, and arum lilies flourish in a
controlled green environment in this most urban of locations.
Only birdsong and the flash of colourful wings seem to be missing. For
birdsong, Scots melodies substitute. Three mornings a week piper Jimmy
Banks greets visitors on the bagpipes.
As for colour, that's there in abundance on the corridor walls of the
atrium on all floors, and in the offices beyond. It comes from an
exhilarating display of Scottish art, ranging in period from the early
1800s to the present. The artists involved form a litany of Scottish
creativity, from John Knox and John Fleming, whose early panoramic views
of the Firth of Clyde are full of historical and sociological detail,
through David Wilkie, the Glasgow Boys, D Y Cameron and the great
McTaggart, to the Colourists, the new Glasgow boys, and virtually every
contemporary name of note.
Everything from painstaking classical painting to the purely abstract
is represented. This outpouring of talent surely puts paid to stock
ideas of the Scots as a dour, unaesthetic lot.
There are some 800 pictures in the collection, at least 90% of which
are always on display, either in this building or in the bank's overseas
offices, in cities ranging from Paris, Frankfurt and Milan, to New York,
Toronto and Vancouver. They adorn not only public areas and directors'
suites but more lowly offices, too. Open the door into any modest room
and you may be faced with an exquisite still life by Anne Redpath or
Peploe; a covetable Borders landscape by William Gillies.
The collection has particularly strong holdings of the Scottish
Colourists, especially Peploe. His still lifes, with their heavy,
outlined flowers and fruit are characteristic images. But what exuberant
brushwork is shown in his early Luxembourg Gardens. Green Sea Iona must
be a definitive view of the island -- almost a little pat through
familiarity. A west-coast scene with fresh charm is Cadell's The Dunara
Castle, which shows a white yacht nestling up to the little steamer on
the kind of blue sea which occasionally graces Scotland, while the rump
of a paddle-steamer vanishes to the left.
The collection of Anne Redpath canvases is perhaps even more
impressive. It ranges from the early landscape Frosty Morning, Trow Hill
to the recently acquired Window in Menton, showing Redpath's
daughter-in-law looking out beyond a window-ledge of cacti to a hillside
both two-dimensional and full of atmospheric detail.
Whirling round this permanent art show by way of the glass-sided lifts
that glide up and down the atrium, one is soon in a daze of
appreciation. Some paintings particularly haunt.
The strains of The Skye Boat Song could not have been a more
appropriate accompaniment to John Watson Nicol's Lochaber No More. This
study of a husband and daughter facing the desolation of the Clearances
is the more poignant for its understatement. The elderly man, with plaid
and flat bonnet, looks out bleakly from the ship's deck on his former
haunts, while the woman's grief is indicated rather than shown by her
averted head. Their faithful collie licks her hand in attempted comfort.
The painting communicates its message more effectively than thousands
of words of historical analysis. A mirror image of this scene, Thomas
Faed's The Last of the Clan, showing the despair of those left behind,
is also held by Flemings (a bigger version is in Kelvingrove).
This is the tragic face of Scotland's past. Most of the pictures are
much happier in feeling, even when depicting the untamed Scottish
landscape, as does McNeill Macleay's The Head of Loch Eil. Among other
covetable nineteenth-century landscape paintings are Sam Bough's
typically vigorous Bruce's Stone, Glen Trool, Galloway and Joseph
Farquharson's When Snow the Pasture Sheets. In the latter, sheep plod
through snowdrifts while birch trees cast long shadows in the winter sun
-- a tour de force in off-white.
And then there are McTaggarts, with their impressionistic sweep and
tantalising child figures; the heavily decorative oils of the younger
MacTaggart; a covetable Joan Eardley, showing a sullen sea hitting a bay
in a froth of white; lots of atmospheric landscapes by D Y Cameron,
including The Boddin, Angus, where lime kilns assume something of the
presence of the temples at Karnak; and James Pryde's The Unknown Corner,
maybe located in Venice and full of ambiguous shadows and menace.
The young Turks are here in force too, for this is a constantly
expanding collection. On the ground floor, the first picture visitors
are likely to encounter is by Peter Howson. It is not of a heroic dosser
but a kneeling woman. The Brink depicts her both on a literal precipice
and in a frame of mind. Steven Campbell, Stephen Conroy, Alison Watt and
Craig Mulholland are other contemporary names to conjure with. For those
who like them, there's a clutch of John Bellanys. The brown eyes of Ian
Hughes's Franz Kafka gaze over the investment management office with
melancholy and the grace of a Greek icon.
Portraits are thin on the ground (or rather the wall). Bill Smith
explains the reason. ''So many paintings are available, why commission?
If you don't like the finished article what do you do?'' Flemings has
''felt no reason'' to commission portraits even of its chairmen. The
only banking personality portrayed is, appropriately, David Donald,
founder of the art collection, in a study by David Donaldson.
David Donald built up the collection for 18 years. On his death in
1985, Hawick-raised Smith took over. ''I'm really a banker rather than
an art person,'' he says, though he has written a study of D Y Cameron.
He looks after the collection in conjunction with Robin Fleming, the
company chairman.
''I normally do the ferreting,'' explains Smith. This involves his
visiting exhibitions, dealers, auctions, and degree shows, though ''now
we're so well-known that we're offered a number of pictures''.
Nowadays the main thrust is towards the contemporary, though there are
still gaps in the collection (no Ramsays or Raeburns, for instance) and
areas which they hope to upgrade. And of course, there is always the
possibility of adding works simply because they like them. This explains
the recent acquisition of Eve of the Battle of the Somme, James Gunn's
view of soldiers bathing and relaxing on the edge of oblivion.
''One factor we have to bear in mind,'' says William Smith, ''is that
this is a corporate collection, being seen by people who are working.
The subject matter has got to be one we feel we can hang. So sex and
violence we just simply couldn't consider. Political comment, yes.''
The collection has no large Ken Currie works (just one head).
Nonetheless, Smith says they would certainly consider buying a political
painting. ''We wouldn't be antagonistic towards a vehemently communistic
picture hanging in a capitalist bank -- not at all!''
The collection also includes some sculptures. Among these is a
miniature version of Paolozzi's Master of the Universe -- a powerful
figure at once human and mechanistic, his brain stripped of covering,
his bolted joints reminiscent of Frankenstein's monster. (A full-size
version is in the grounds of the Scottish Gallery of Modern Art,
Edinburgh.)
It's a pleasant paradox that the collection, though belonging to an
international financial company, is not regarded by it primarily as an
investment. Rather, says Robin Fleming, it remains a means of promoting
''a pleasant, stimulating and occasionally challenging environment for
both staff and visitors'', as well as fostering Scottish art and
encouraging young Scottish artists.
Flemings is unwilling to talk about the collection's theoretical
monetary value. Outsiders may speculate enviously. It is perhaps better
to view it simply as a priceless testimony to the creativity of Scottish
artists over succeeding generations. In a real sense it is a national
collection.
* THE general public will be able to sample the Flemings collection
themselves this summer when some 60 of its paintings will be shown at
the National Gallery of Scotland at Edinburgh Festival time, alongside
works from the national gallery's own holdings.
The initiative came from the national gallery. Flemings, says Bill
Smith, was delighted and felt very privileged by the invitation. In
return, Timothy Clifford, director of the national galleries, describes
the collection as ''exceptional'' and says they are thrilled to have
pictures from it on show in Edinburgh.
Reciprocal civilities apart, what will be on view? The National
Gallery of Scotland is doing the choosing to complement its own
pictures. The period covered is from 1820 to 1920, taking in the Glasgow
Boys, the Colourists and D Y Cameron, but obviously excluding Redpath,
Gillies, other mid-twentieth century figures, and contemporary artists.
Mungo Campbell of the national gallery has been working on the
exhibition with the principal organiser, his colleague Helen Smailes.
For him one of the joys of organising this show is to say of painters
such as Wilkie and McTaggart, ''Here is something different''; in other
instances, there's a chance to see painters not represented at all in
the national collection.
Where the Glasgow Boys are concerned, the national gallery's holding
is ''not as full and complete'' as it might be, and the Flemings
pictures will add considerably to their presence. ''The most stunning
pastel by George Henry of a woman reading'' is among the prime
attractions here. Other pictures coming to Edinburgh range from Lochaber
No More (one of the exhibition themes will be emigration) to Gunn's Eve
of the Battle of the Somme.
The exhibition, appropriately titled ''Hidden Assets'', will run from
August 3 to September 24.

Jack Webster reveals an opportunity to be written into Glasgow's past
ARUMMAGE through the picture library of The Herald and Evening Times
is one of those fascinating experiences which remind you how soon the
commonplace events of our daily lives take on the hue of history.
The longer you live the more astounded you become to see those events
which were so freely taken for granted assuming a significance in the
tapestry of life which you would never have imagined at the time.
Having just completed such an exercise, I found myself warming to the
sight of great Scottish entertainers like Dave Willis, Tommy Morgan,
Benny Lynch. My emotions stirred to the pictorial record of the Empire
Exhibition at Bellahouston Park, Glasgow, in 1938, the greatest
spectacle I have ever seen.
Who could forget that last night when 365,000 people linked arms and
sang and danced The Lambeth Walk, ignoring the deluge of the night and
the gathering clouds which would soon bring the Second World War?
Equally, I found myself chilled by some tragic events to which I had
been a personal witness. As a journalist I had been there, for example
in 1960, when 19 firemen died in the whisky warehouse blaze at Cheapside
Street, Glasgow.
Just a short distance away I was there again in 1968, standing outside
an upholstery factory in James Watt Street as the screams of 20 victims
faded into the eerie silence of a dull November morning.
How could I forget the Rangers-Celtic match of January 1971, as I left
Ibrox Park at the moment when 66 of my fellow spectators were being
crushed to death on Stairway 13?
Tragedies and triumphs throughout the century, all the way to the
Garden Festival of 1988 and Glasgow's place as European City of Culture
in 1990.
Now, with the latest accolade of UK City of Architecture due in 1999
-- and a new century beckoning -- there was surely a decision to be made
about this vast treasure of pictures lying within this Herald building.
Since the history of Glasgow and Clydeside throughout this twentieth
century was there before our very eyes, in all the richness of
black-and-white as well as colour, it was time to share our pictorial
archive with the readers.
The result is a book called Images of Glasgow, quite the most splendid
record of the city and its surroundings ever to hit the bookshops. It is
not on general sale until September but there is a certain urgency for
those who would like to have their name, or that of a friend or company,
printed in the subscribers' list, which will appear in every copy.
For that privilege, it is necessary to act before 10 June by sending
#15.99, with the name of the subscriber, to the address given below. It
is an added attraction to a book in the creation of which I have been
very happy to play a part.
* If you wish to have this personal link with Images of Glasgow, just
send your cheque or postal order to: Breedon Books, Breedon House, 44
Friar Gate, Derby, DE1 1DA -- by June 10.

Keith Moore talks to a book lover, whose passion for the written word
is matched by an amazing record collection
IT IS a lucky man who can indulge his passions in the workplace, and
Jamie Byng is one . In common with the Fidelity Inspector (and the
person who originated the phrase), a few of Byng's favourite things are
books and music.
Having been promoted to joint MD at Canongate Books less than a year
ago, he recently launched the Payback Press imprint, specialising in
black American music writing. Of his record collection, it must be said
it is one of the finest I have ever seen, and although they say size
doesn't matter, Byng's vinyl addiction and past life as a club DJ has
ensured an extensive collection oozing quality and style.
Storage has always been the serious record collector's classic
dilemma. In the Byng household, jazz, reggae, soul and hip-hop lie in
alphabetical order on three specially constructed, high-specification
glass shelves. His wife Whitney, however, preferred the records lying on
the floor, growing out from the skirting, as she could see the covers
(granted, she is an art student).
As the youngest of a family of four, Byng suffered the classic Big
Brother syndrome. ''I had three long haired brothers who foisted their
music upon me: Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, Bowie: classic rock I suppose.''
Of his earliest memories, however, there is one that pre-dates his
first vinyl purchase, and indicates what was to come. ''Every child
likes The Beatles, and my parents had the blue double album. I remember
coming home from holiday, running in the front door, making for the
stereo and putting on I Am The Walrus. It was like a fix -- I'd been
deprived of my favourite song for two whole weeks.'' Needless to say, he
has never since gone cold turkey for such a lengthy period.
Of great lost records, he reckons his is Burning Spear's 70s classic
Garvie's Ghost, which was stolen. He has sold records in time of
desperation, but not valuable ones. ''I remember trying to sell a batch
of records and being left with a pile no one wanted,'' he says, and
although he insists the Stones were not a formative influence in his
life, he threw the unsellable ones out of a window: ''The best game of
frisbee ever.''
His first records were an early 80s trinity: Survivor's Eye Of The
Tiger, Come on Eileen by Dexy's and The Stranglers' Strange Little girl,
but (thankfully) the musical watershed came when he met his
brother-in-law-to be, Charlie.
''I had to go through one of those 'interviews' that all young people
are bound to in order to get a room in a flat.'' Charlie had this
brilliant record collection which had a devastating effect on me: rare
James Brown cuts, Roy Ayers, Syl Johnson. I moved in and have much to
thank Charlie for. Aside from introducing me to Whitney, he taught me
the art of secondhand record buying.''
After Charlie's crash course in music over, Byng quickly became a
disciple of Gramophone Emporium, a CD-free haven for vinyl junkies in St
Stephen Street, and other secondhand shops.
A scan over the immense collection of dance-floor and front-room
pleasers reveals Miles Davis, Timmy Thomas, Nirvana and Augustus Pablo,
side-by-side with Etta James, Horace Silver, Bob Dylan and an extensive
collection of Gil Scott-Heron, whose two 70s cult novels: The Vulture
and The Nigger Factory, he is currently preparing for summer
publication.
The initial trio of Payback books has been a major success, and if
Byng continues to allow his musical taste to influence his business
sensibilities, you can guarantee that Canongate will once again
establish itself an enviable reputation in the world of independent
publishing.

John Fowler looks forward to the first of several Atlantis trips to
Russian space station Mir which takes place later this month.
CLUNK! The satisfactory sound of spacecraft docking -- in this case
the American Atlantis orbiter berthing with the Russian space station
Mir. This event, pictured here by Mark McLellan, is due to take place
later this month, probably on Monday the 19th.
On that date an American spaceman will ease himself through the port
to join Mir's Russian crew. It will be the first of several Atlantis
trips to Mir designed to provide astronauts with experience of lengthy
spells out on that lonely frontier. In the longer term it may also pave
the way for possible manned missions to Mars in the twenty-first
century.
There will be plenty to do both on board and outside the space
station. Some complex operations outside the hull are designed to
prepare astronauts for the next major step in space technology, the
construction of the international space station which will replace Mir
early next century.
Mir has been out there a long time. But inevitably this veteran piece
of space apparatus is beginning to show its age. Mir is now the first
wrinkly in space.
It's not certain how many times Atlantis will call on Mir. Ten
dockings were originally planned but the number has been reduced to
seven. Also, it's likely that one of the five expected long-term stays
by Nasa astronauts will be cut from the programme. Cost, as always, is a
crucial factor.
The planet Jupiter was ''in opposition'' on Thursday, which means that
on that date the earth, Jupiter, and the sun lay along the same line.
Theoretically this is the best time to view a planet, but Jupiter has
been too low on the southern horizon for best results. At the moment the
planet is in the constellation Ophiuchus, moving later into Scorpius.
Jupiter has several remarkable features. For a start, it's gigantic.
Its mass is more than twice that of all the other planets put together.
You could cram them all -- including our own earth, of course -- into
Jupiter and there would still be plenty to spare.
It spins on its axis faster than any other planet, whirling round the
full circuit in less than 10 hours. It is also very stormy, swept by
bizarre weather patterns. Bands of weather moving in contrary directions
whip over its surface. Prominent amid all this mega-turbulence is the
famous Great Red Spot, a vast cloud of rising gases thought to be mainly
phosphorus.
Among other planets this month Mars, too, will not be seen at its
best. Early in the night Mars disappears below the horizon, so end of
story. Come the dawn, Saturn emerges, but as it climbs into the sky in
the constellations of Aquarius and Pisces, it fades tantalisingly from
view in the brightening daylight.
The main interest within Mark's constellation of the month, Serpens
Caput, is a globular cluster known as M5. You will require binoculars or
a telescope to see it.
No problem, however, in spotting shooting stars in the neighbourhood
of the constellation Lyra towards the middle of the month. These meteor
showers, blue in colour, should be at their peak around midnight on the
fifteenth.

THOUGH some weeds can be pretty, they can also be an intolerable
nuisance. Indeed, really obnoxious weeds such as horsetail, couch grass
or Japanese bamboo can be the bane of a gardener's life. I have even
known of people to move house to get away from them.
Attitudes to weed control vary enormously. Some try to work by hand,
mowing, hoeing, pulling or mulching. They don't like the idea of using
chemicals, on environmental grounds -- or because they have pets running
around. Due to persistent nature of perennial weeds, however, manual
effort can be a lost cause.
Annual weeds and some mild perennials can be effectively controlled on
a programme of constant hoeing. It requires extreme persistence.
Chemical control can work out, if the right killers are chosen. Apply
them carefully, and dispose of any unused portions properly.
You may have to use both manual and chemical control. Information on
various types of weedkillers is a useful starting point. Contact killers
desiccate the leaf area on which they are applied. Typical are Murphy
Weedmaster or Weedol -- excellent for short-term control.
Systemics are absorbed by the whole plant, including the roots.
Typical examples are glysophate-based Roundup and Tumbleweed. They are
useful against deep-rooted perennials and can be applied on a spot
basis, among mixed herbage, for example. Weedex is typical of long-term
root-absorbing chemicals based on simazine. Ideal for paths.
A large group of weedkillers, used on lawns, are hormone types. The
active chemicals are absorbed by the leaves and they literally grow
themselves to death. The danger here is that drifting vapours can find
their way to flower beds or into greenhouses. The merest whiff can ruin
a budding tomato crop.

FOR those who admire the elegant formality of the big-house garden, a
visit to Drummond Castle Gardens near Crieff is not to be missed at the
moment, writes STEWART FRASER. Box hedges, regular plantings of trees
and shrubs -- and the magnificent castle overlooking it all -- make for
an impressive visual experience. And adding extra romantic interest
these days is the fact that that some of the filming for Rob Roy took
place here. The pictures above show (from top left, clockwise): The
dramatic perspectives of the hedging; the castle overlooking the
gardens; the meticulous care taken over the box hedging; and a distant
view that emphasises the intricate geometry of this horticultural
masterpiece.

* ONE of my tomato plants has started to throw side shoots all over
the place. It looks distinctly shrubby. It is the variety Shirley and I
am wondering why this should be so.
* It sounds very much as if you have a rogue tomato. This can happen
quite frequently with F1 hybrid varieties. It is caused by a genetical
upset and it is pointless to retain the plant. It will not produce any
worthwhile crop. Replace with a normal plant.
* I am plagued with annual meadow grass. It invades my lawn, laid with
top quality turf a year or so ago. I am told there is now a chemical
which can take out the meadow grass and leave fine grasses unharmed.
* I have been inquiring about this with some top greenkeepers.
Apparently, chemicals are being developed but are at the trial stage. I
have been in touch with a large chemical firm and there is certainly
nothing available on the amateur market. You can be sure I will keep a
look out for this. In the meantime, regular cutting, ideally with a comb
or rake on a cylinder mower, will improve the general appearance of the
lawn.
* My flowering cherry is showing a lot of distortion and crinkling of
leaves. Is this caused by air pollution?
* This is usually caused by sucking pests. They can be seen if the
leaves are unfolded carefully. Spray with an insecticide like malathion.
The problem is getting effective coverage. You may be able to
concentrate on leaf tips.
* I am about to invest in a good rake. Do I need to know about
differences?
* Rakes come in various sizes and can perform a multitude of
operations. Their prime function is on soil to prepare it for sowing.
Novices tend to let rakes dig into the ground and make it uneven.
Getting a flat surface is possible only if you support the weight of the
rake while working with it. With large areas to cover it takes a lot to
beat a wooden hay rake, though a lightweight aluminium one can be easier
to use. Rakes are also useful for garden paths. Wire ones are not
intended for soil but for leaves or loose organic matter, and raking
lawns, especially when moss has been killed off.

THERE has been something of a boom in theatres opening cafes and
restaurants during the past few years. This is good news for both
theatre-goers and the theatre owners. An evening at the theatre is now
easily extended to include dinner, and theatre owners are finding that
it can be a lucrative way to attract people to their establishment when
there are no performances.
Choice varies dramatically. In some cases all that is available is a
basic menu of soup, sandwiches, and coffees. However, there are
restaurants with three-course meals, plus wine.
In Glasgow, the Tron Theatre has built a good reputation for its cafe
and restaurant operations. The cafe serves a selection of typical bar
food, such as baked potatoes and sandwiches. The resaurant has a larger
menu.
Starters include soup, mussels in a white sauce, wild mushroom and
hazelnut pate and nachos covered in a variety of melted cheese
combinations. The soup changes daily with potato and leek served when I
visited. Main courses are the best illustration of the international
flavour of the menu. Scottish staples, such as salmon fishcakes, are
served with imaginative accompaniments like salsa chutney.
There is also a good choice of vegetarian dishes and salads. The
grilled aubergine and sun-dried tomato layered loaf sounded very good. I
opted for the pan-fried fillet of pork served in cajun sauce. The pork
was well-cooked. It's delicate flavour was overwhelmed, but not
unpleasantly so, by the spicy cajun sauce. The accompanying salad was
more than generous topped with a sharp vinaigrette dressing. My
companion chose one of the best value choices on the menu, half a pizza
and salad at #3.95. It was fresh, filling, and hugely enjoyable.
Desserts are less inspirational. They include a typical selection of
passion cake, caramel shortcake, and chocolate fudge cake.
At the other end of town, the Theatre Royal's Cafe Royal is a much
smaller operation. Sited at the top of Hope Street it can be very quiet
when there are no performances. The restaurant has a more formal feel to
it.Again the menu displays international influences. Starters include
Stilton-stuffed mushrooms, oriental spare ribs, and fries with dips. I
rarely eat chips, but decided to try the fries served with a
cream-cheese and bacon dip. The fries were large wedges of deep fried
potato. Well-cooked and not at all greasy they were wickedly satisfying.
The cream-cheese and bacon dip was luxuriously thick and equally tasty.
Scottish ingredients are included on the main course menu, and are
served in a variety of ways. Grilled fillet of salmon is served in a
teriyaki style, while lamb's liver is pan-fried in port and ginger.
I chose the vegetable en croute, which looks like a large bridie. The
pastry was light and the slightly spicy filling made of mushrooms,
courgette, onions, and tomatoes. It was very good.
The international theme continued to dessert, but less excitingly.
There is a choice of tiramisu, profiteroles, and lemon miroir. The lemon
miroir is a glazed mousse-like cake, which was by turn sharp and sweet.
Edinburgh boasts two of the most modern, but very different, cafes at
the Traverse and the Edinburgh Festival Theatre.
The Traverse Theatre's cafe is run by Henderson's, who operate the
hugely successful, and very good, restaurant in Hanover Street. The cafe
and bar is in the basement. A wrong turn in the entrance hall and you
could find yourself in the award-winning restaurant, The Atrium, run by
Andrew Radford. The downstairs bar is almost as aesthetically pleasing
as The Atrium, and offers a choice of snacks, such as filled rolls and
cakes. In the restaurant an extensive menu is available all day. Not
surprisingly, being run by Henderson's, the menu is vegetarian, with the
inclusion of at least one vegan dish each day. To supplement the regular
menu, daily specials are chalked up on a blackboard. Regulars include
spicy nachos, baked potatoes, and pizza platters. On a recent visit leek
croustade was the daily special. It was a huge serving of leeks in a
white sauce sprinkled with breadcrumbs. The leeks were well-cooked and
full of flavour, the white sauce fresh and creamy. The crunch of the
golden breadcrumbs gave it a good texture. The accompanying salad looked
a little tired.
The choice of dessert included cheesecake, trifle, and fruit tart. I
opted for the trifle. It was a colourful mix of sponge, cream, fruit,
and custard.
A smaller operation is run at the Festival Theatre. Cafe Lucia, on the
ground floor, serves soup, filled rolls, croissants, pastries, and
cakes.
There is no choice of soup available; you have to take the soup of the
day. However, there is good choice of fillings for sandwiches. These
include tuna and mayonnaise, humus, and turkey breast.
The tomato and lentil soup served on my visit was totally lacking in
flavour. The filled baguette, on the other hand, was good. A wedge of
poppy-seed bread stuffed with turkey breast and salad was fresh and
tasty. It was a huge serving of both salad and meat. The choice of cakes
and pastries include popular favourites such as chocolate-chip muffins,
fruit tarts, and the sweetest pastries.
Service in each of these theatre cafes was good. Most of the staff
were young, friendly, and certainly some of the most exuberant waiting
staff I have ever encountered.In addition, each of the places served an
extensive selection of beers, spirits, non-alcoholic beverages, and
wine.

THE mortgage market could be shaken out of the doldrums this summer --
perhaps for all the wrong reasons.
Against a background of employment worries, fears of interest rate
rises and cuts in tax breaks for homeowners, mortgage lenders are having
to work very hard to tempt new customers.
The range of loans on offer is now mind-boggling with fixed rates,
discount schemes, capped mortgages and cashbacks all jostling for
attention alongside the more familiar repayment, endowment and pension
mortgages.
The trouble is that recent lending figures suggest that the choice for
borrowers is daunting rather than appealing.
Experts believe that mortgage lending by banks, accounting for about a
third of the UK mortgage market, plunged by 30% or so between March and
April this year. If recent poor building society figures are added in
mortgage approvals last month were down nearly a quarter on the March
totals.
Those figures could see an upturn over the summer months as lenders
unveil more incentives, although increased take-up of loans could well
be due to defensive rather than positive reasons.
In October the Government plans to shrink the safety net now available
to homebuyers who lose their jobs through sickness or redundancy. But
there are fears that the Government by changing the rules could lead to
a short-term surge in borrowing, only to create an even bigger housing
slump in the future.
Anyone who takes out a new mortgage after October will have to wait
nine months before income support pays any of their mortgage interest.
''I believe insurance for this nine-month period will be readily
available,'' said Peter Lilley, the Social Security secretary.
''Indeed, I expect that many lenders will incorporate it in their
loans at very modest cost.''
Potential and existing homebuyers who don't share Mr Lilley's optimism
may consider taking action now if they are to make the most of what
limited State aid there could be if Government proposals go ahead as
planned.
Homebuyers who arrange a new mortgage before October -- whether to
finance a house move, replace an existing loan through a ''remortgage''
package or to raise extra capital -- won't have to wait so long for help
if the new rules are in place by the autumn.
Those eligible for income support will qualify for help with their
mortgage payments after two months, against a nine-month wait for loans
taken out after October.
At a time of sluggish demand for mortgages some lenders may use the
October deadline as an opportunity to push business. And while there
could be plenty of good reasons to arrange a new mortgage --
particularly for existing borrowers paying the normal variable rate of
around 8.4% at the moment -- the chance of claiming State benefits
should not be a major consideration.
Nearly 70% of homeowners can never qualify for income support and help
with their mortgage because their own income or savings -- or those of
their spouse or partner -- are too high.
The benefit changes are being fiercely attacked by mortgage lenders.
But the row over their introduction may already be doing a very useful
job in highlighting the dangers for homebuyers who lose their jobs
through illness or unemployment.
Borrowers who do decide to take on a new loan during the summer should
consider using some of the savings to be had to fund a private insurance
policy for income replacement -- cover that may not have been available,
affordable or even a consideration when they originally took out their
mortgage.
Mortgage protection policies can usually be taken out alongside a new
loan and there are a handful of policies available to existing
borrowers. These include Protect Direct from Perth-based General
Accident Direct. GA has a free leaflet explaining how these policies
work (telephone 0800 121008 for details).
Both critical illness insurance and permanent health insurance are
also worth looking at, particularly for the self-employed.
As the range of discounted and fixed rate loans expands the appeal of
remortgaging your property becomes even greater, especially now that the
standard mortgage rate is high relative to bank base rates.
Borrowers currently paying well over 8% for their home loans should
certainly take a look at rates as low as the 2.95% available from
National &amp; Provincial and 3.55% from Nationwide, for instance.
But watch out for unavoidable costs such as land registry fees and
hidden extras such as valuation costs (often refunded by your new
lender), arrangement fees and the cost of a mortgage indemnity premium
for large percentage loans.
Beware, too, of the costs of paying off your old mortgage and
potential penalties if you want to switch again in the future. Although
many of the biggest discounts apply only for a year or so, you could be
facing penalties for up to five years after the discount period has
ended.
Some lenders try to make you take out life or household insurance as
part of a cut-price interest deal which could be more expensive than if
you shopped around.
And don't forget that if, as an unmarried couple, you took out your
original mortgage before 1988 you may still be getting double Miras tax
relief which you'll lose if you switch to a new mortgage.

Adrian Henri didn't take much notice of poetry in school thinking it
was all about daffodils. Years later he is world renowned for his poems,
and also thrives on his artistic talents. Margaret Rigillo spoke with
the jack of all trades in Italy about his latest book
WHEN I met Adrian Henri, he was tucking into a hearty plate of what he
referred to as ''Spaghetti on the Rocks'', the seafood speciality served
on Fridays in Franco's on the Via Cassia, Rome. This is a
gargantuan-sized platter of steaming pasta topped with a heap of
assorted shellfish, which actually features on the menu rather more
prosaically as ''Spaghetti of the rock''.
Henri was taking a well-earned break on a busy Italian tour, where his
programme had included the presentation of his newest book of poems Not
Fade Away at the British Council in Milan, and a three-day stint at
Rome's top English-speaking school, St George's, introducing classes of
enthusiastic teenagers to The Haunted Disco and Rover of the Oyster.
He recalled: ''When I was at school, I always thought that poetry was
something to do with daffodils. I didn't realise you could write poetry
about inner cities and street lamps and newspapers blowing across waste
ground -- not till I chanced upon a poem by T S Eliot in an anthology.
It was a revelation -- a really exciting discovery.''
He considers his readings enormously important. ''It takes the poem
off the page and makes it alive. I hate listening to other people
reading my poems. Actors, in particular, don't value the words. They are
only after emotional impact.''
He chuckles as he refills our glasses with Franco's best vino bianco:
''A couple of years ago, at the end of a poetry reading, this
middle-aged couple came up to me and said, 'We think of you as the
godfather of our children.' When they were courting they had quarrelled
and split up. He had copied out this poem of mine, Love Is, and sent it
to her and because of that they'd got together again. I think that's
wonderful -- to know that you've influenced someone's destiny.''
Henri's own destiny has always followed a zigzag course, full of
unexpected developments. The overweight, bespectacled child from
dole-ridden Birkenhead -- the name Henri is not a nom de guerre, as some
people think, but comes from his French grandfather -- fighting his own
private war at school in Wales during the war years (''I could draw
airplanes. That saved me from being bullied by the other kids!'') went
on to take an Hons BA in Fine Art at the University of Durham. ''I only
ever wanted to be an artist.''
Before he settled down to a steady job as an art teacher, progressing
to lecturer at Manchester and Liverpool Colleges of Art, he was a
scenery painter and a fairground worker.
The cabaret turns on Monday nights were just a bit of a lark on the
side. But Henri met Roger McGough and Brian Patten and the Liverpool
School of poetry was born, to the great surprise of the protagonists --
as well as the rest of the world.
''It changed my life,'' said Henri, ''it'' being Penguin's Modern
Poets 10 -- The Mersey Sound, a bestseller from the start, which has now
sold more than three-quarters of a million copies world-wide.
''From being Adrian Henri, painter, art teacher and occasional poet, I
became Adrian Henri, poet. In three years I went from being a college
lecturer to a minor pop star, touring with my band, sitting in a Ford
Transit going up and down motorways.''
''We did some amazing things,'' he reminisces, still with a note of
wonder in his voice. ''Within a year, 'The Liverpool Scene' had risen to
being chosen as support group for Led Zeppelin's first British tour. We
were billed at the Isle of Wight Festival along with Bob Dylan.''
When the band broke up in 1979, Henri opted to go freelance, as he
terms it. ''I could have formed another group, but I realised there were
a lot of other things I'd rather be doing. So ever since then I've been
a freelance poet/painter, art critic, and performer.''
He also writes for the theatre, leads creative writing courses for the
Arvon Foundation and ''does the odd thing with music''. But, first and
foremost, he sees himself as Adrian Henri the Artist. It is in his
studio back in Liverpool that he feels most at home, and when his poetry
reading tours take him too long away from painting, he admits to getting
''really frustrated''.
The Entry of Christ into Liverpool, which he painted in the 60s,
features on the cover of Not Fade Away. It's a suitable complement to
his poem, Winter Ending -- also in the book -- which was published in
the Labour Party's election manifesto in 1992.
''The height of my career!'' he remarks jocularly. ''But then --
Labour lost. All my friends said it was my fault.''
These days, he says, he is painting landscapes: ''For want of a better
word. They're very much about memories of places, so they're not direct
topographical likenesses. Straightforward landscapes would be really
boring, I think. I'm fascinated by the emotional evocation of places.
Poetry, too, is very much about memory.''
Memories are, in fact, the leitmotiv which underlies the verses of Not
Fade Away -- ''I took the title from the Buddy Holly song'' -- and an
earlier volume called Wish You Were Here.
''These titles,'' he explained, ''have a double meaning. In both cases
they are about people whom I knew, dying.''
Wish You Were Here was dedicated to his ex-wife.
''We were amicably divorced years ago, and we remained very close
friends. She died six years ago. Not Fade Away opens with a poem in
memoriam to Sam Walsh, an artist friend of mine. My poems are about
memories -- places and people who don't fade away. Somehow by writing
about them, you keep the memory.''
The other poems capture impressions, fragments of experiences, Henri's
highly individualistic view of favourite works of art, foreign travel,
childhood recollections, love. The book is dedicated to Catherine, his
present companion, who has accompanied him on this trip.
The coffee arrives, a demitasse of double-strength black espresso.
Henri and Catherine are keen to put in a little sightseeing before they
return to Liverpool, where Adrian is booked the following day to give a
reading in the Art Gallery.
''The only thing I'd like to change about my life,'' he says, as we go
out into a wet Roman spring afternoon, ''is to delay the passing of the
years. I was a very slow developer. I never did anything much till I was
in my thirties. I feel as if I'm entitled to a bit of credit from Time.
I'm still growing. Still learning.''

THE first time Couch Potato saw Quentin Tarantino's apprentice
masterpiece Reservoir Dogs (rental, cert 18), about three years ago, it
was in the cinema, and an art-house cinema at that.
It was new to Glasgow then, and considered fit only for the kind of
movie house where you can't buy ice-cream or popcorn, and they only let
you in if you can pass a multiple-choice exam on the French New Wave and
you've been to university and/or bed with one or more of the usherettes.
And even at that, a good 20% of the audience checked out before the end
-- most of them shortly after the scene where Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen)
tortures a cop -- and in the foyer afterwards there was none of that
conversational buzz and crackle you hear when an audience has really
fallen in love with the picture they just saw.
But three years on, it's hard to find any even half-serious film fan
who doesn't rate Reservoir Dogs as a modern classic. What happened in
between?
At the risk of sounding pretentious, Couch Potato reckons it comes
down to T S Eliot's old line about how every great work of art has to
create the taste by which it is appreciated. Dogs created the taste
whereby truly graphic violence could be laughed off as just a movie,
just a homage, just a joke; and by doing so it added a new dimension to
the serious film-maker's permissible repertoire -- and a new license to
what a decent ordinary mainstream film fan could go out and see without
looking like a sad old sickie with no friends and a suspicious
collection of True Crime literature.
It did all this by being scripted and plotted like a cross between a
jackhammer and a crackerjack, and being so visually and verbally
stylised that it makes Fantasia look like a model of gritty realism.
Whether this transposition of the critical goalposts is a Good Thing or
not we'll leave the serious columnists to argue: meanwhile, all Couch
Potato has to say is that Reservoir Dogs, despite its oft-exaggerated
violence (much less actually happens then you think you've seen) is an
astonishingly good film, and if you haven't seen it before you should
see it now, now that it's finally out on video.
Using Stanley Kubrick's classic 1950s caper movie The Killing as its
very loose model, it takes the daring step of cutting out the caper (the
robbery of a diamond depot) altogether, letting the members of the gang
just talk about it before and after the botched and bloody event.
Tarantino has taken the conventions of the caper movie -- the Big Boss,
the masculine interplay between the members of the gang, the presence of
an informer, and the presence of a loose-cannon nutcase -- and turned
the volume on all four dials right up to 11.
Equipping all his characters with the kind of meticulously realistic
and streetwise dialogue that only exists in the movies -- highlights
include an argument over the meaning of Madonna's Like A Virgin, and a
debate between gang members Mr White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr Orange (Tim
Roth) as to whether the latter is dying of his wounds or not --
Tarantino has created perhaps the perfect gangster picture, a film that
has nothing to do with real life and everything to do with other
gangster pictures.
You can tell it's nothing to do with real life because it's extremely
funny, and in real life gangsters are about as funny as senile dementia.
And it doesn't even look all that violent any more. Get your black suit,
white shirt, and black tie on . . . let's go to work!

IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS
Tim O'Brien, Flamingo Original, #5.99 (pbk)
TIM O'Brien belongs to the generation of Americans who lost faith in
their country. They lost faith in their President and in the ability of
their institutions to effect peace and justice for all. They no longer
believed they were a force for good, that Communism had to be contained
at any price, or that this was the best way for their country to be
effective on the world stage. They found national pride resting on their
shoulders and the struggle to maintain it was far too great.
The Vietnam war was something from which American politics has never
really recovered. The reasons why a dispirited bunch of young men, who
had given up their youth, subsequently lost the will to defend the
indefensible has been revised many times. There have been pages of
analysis and actuality reports, recorded testimonies, photographs and
eyewitness accounts. They show the problem, but the place where cause
and effect can be best understood, where reasons and motivation can be
attributed and discussed, where analysis can be approached, is the
medium of fiction.
Tim O'Brien is one of the writers -- Robert Stone and Don DeLillo are
others -- raised in the afterglow of a ''good war''. Their illusions
were shattered in South-east Asia. O'Brien has continually trawled
through his war experience, trying to understand what happened, looking
for a truth and a dignity that will never allow the experience to be
undermined or lost. He has produced some fine novels, including Going
after Cacciato and at least one classic short story, The Things they
Carried.
Now he considers the post-war experience with an eye on American
ambivalence about their first lost war and the psychological debilities
it brought, and continues to bring, especially for politicians who have
not served in Vietnam but nevertheless wrap the flag around themselves
at every opportunity. He has carried the experience forward, looking
with an immediacy and political clarity that brings to light an
unforgivable use of history and its consequences, that highlights what
happens when history ceases to exist. Most analysts and commentators
look at what the war did to them; O'Brien realises they did it to
themselves.
John Wade is trounced when he runs as a candidate for the US Senate
and his Vietnam experience returns to haunt him publicly. Then his wife
goes missing. The novel is structured on a variety of explanations for
her disappearance. O'Brien interrupts the narrative with chapters which
offer quotations from sources such as interviews, newspaper articles and
reference texts, as well as a list of objects and photographs which may
be pertinent to the case. This helps him anchor what is essentially a
thriller in both the present and the past by which it is affected.
John Wade had an alcoholic father, and as a youngster he fled the
ravages and sudden flares of temper, the dysfunctionalism, by teaching
himself magic. As an American serving in Vietnam he transformed himself
into the magic soldier, into Sorcerer. As a civilian, his soldier's
skills are useless. Love is beyond him. He can see no further than his
own survival.
This is a dark and complex, beautifully-written and structured
exploration of a wounded soul. Wade is a tormented man. By the end of
this book you will know him, his wife and their tragedy. O'Brien
explores a slippery truth, leaving a definite conclusion beyond his
reach, lost in the way the Wades disappeared into themselves.

LOOKING for an original piece of jewellery? Museum shops are not,
perhaps, the most obvious place to go hunting, though the Christmas
catalogues of London's Victoria and Albert are always full of goodies.
Would Scottish galleries have similarly imaginative offerings?
My search began at Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum, Kelvingrove, its
great vaulted hall brightened these days by multi-hued banners. There
are picture reproductions and picture books galore in the museum shop.
Jewellery, too, provided you're a Charles Rennie Mackintosh devotee. The
ironic cycle of public taste has reversed his previous neglect. His
problem may now be one of over-exposure.
A variety of contemporary jewellery-makers use his designs as an
influence on their work. He did not, of course, himself design jewellery
-- but his rose motif now festoons innumerable brooches, earrings and
pendants in silver and pewter. It's not that they are unstylish. Far
from it. But is there not something rather enervating about this
preoccupation with the inspiration of one past master?
With this reservation, the silver Rennie Mackintosh Collection has
some handsome pieces. So does the cheaper pewter range of Harkisons.
There are also Celtic and traditional influences on the latter's work;
and the attached little blurbs give background information on these
motifs. They explain, for example, how Celtic knotwork and interlace
patterns have no beginning and no end and how they reached their peak in
the Lindisfarne Gospels and Book of Kells. A stylised thistle brooch is
accompanied by the story of the Norseman at the Battle of Largs, who
trod on a thistle, yelled in pain, and alerted the Scots.
Silver work by the Orcadian jeweller Ola Gorie is also on sale at
Kelvingrove. Mackintosh is an influence here too, but there are many
non-Toshie elements -- salmon leaping through hoops, chunky puffins,
sea-horse drop-earrings, Celtic loops on a diamond-shaped brooch, huge
plaid pins, bracelets linking a repeated motif.
More to my own taste is the selection of work by Anne Clare Graham of
Kilbarchan. Her pieces -- a narrow metal bracelet with little raised
knobs, curved parallelogram cufflinks in silver and gold metal,
elongated pear-shaped earrings with decorative whorls (no use, of
course, for those with unpierced-ears) -- are distinctively contemporary
and individual.
More Mackintoshiana at the Burrell. The gold-plated Partisan range is
refined in its interpretations. I liked the square brooch (that rose
again) attached to clothes by screw rather than conventional pin. An
imaginative pewter pendant by Harkison shows six stylised birds perched
on a circle.
Nothing, sadly, reflects the Burrell itself. With so many
inspirational artefacts at the gallery, jewellery designers could have a
field day using Burrell themes -- from Luristan bronze horsebits to the
elegant thistles on a fifteenth-century Franco-Flemish tapestry. Maces
could be miniaturised to tiepins. Maybe somebody could organise a
competition.
To Edinburgh, and the Gallery of Modern Art. No place for the (clean)
Mackintosh brigade here. Instead there's a cheerful selection of
original, idiosyncratic modern work. Take Heather Macfarlane. She makes
flamboyant hearts and suns and flowers from a sort of plasticine that is
baked and decorated with glass beads.
This fun jewellery is definitely for extroverts -- or introverts who
long to turn into the former. A touch of Middle-East mystery is offered
by Angie Olami's collection, which carries cuneiform inscriptions on
silver. What's the message? ''Gilgamesh was here'' perhaps or ''Turn
right for Babylon''.
Tina Ramsay makes witty earrings with something of the air of little
parachutes. One design has an umbrella theme, another a Christmas tree.
Such frivolities are again only for the pierced of ear (do you know that
holes in one's lugs apparently change one's topography in strict
mathematical terms?). Perhaps, however, you would prefer an
electroplated snail or a dyed acrylic bracelet in shades of blue; an
enigmatic brooch of glass enclosures and patinated metal, or, best of
all, a jaunty little Noah's Ark trailing fish and starfish?
Edinburgh wins hands down in this city encounter -- and the gallery of
modern art promises exciting new designer jewellery from the United
States soon.

THE Mouseman of Kilburn was a master craftsman who made furniture out
of oak and every piece bore his personal signature -- a tiny carved
mouse. His name was Robert Thompson and he was born in 1876, a member of
a family of carpenters and wheelwrights in the Yorkshire village of
Kilburn, that stands beneath a hill on which a huge white horse is
carved.
Though initially apprenticed as an engineer, he returned home in his
twenties to work with his father making wheels and gates, but he was
greatly admiring of the Ripon School of Medieval Woodcarvers, whose
carvings can still be seen in Ripon Cathedral, and wanted to produce
work of equal quality. He read about the old craftsmen's methods and
started experimenting with an obsolete tool, the adze, which they had
used.
After the First World War he was commissioned to make war memorials
and one of them, a massive carved oak cross, caught the eye of a
visiting cleric from Ampleforth College, who became Thompson's first
patron for the carved furniture which was to make his name. He made many
pieces for Ampleforth, including refurbishing the school library, and
that brought his work to the notice of connoisseurs throughout the
country.
It was at this time that he started carving a mouse on his handiwork,
and the story goes that a fellow carpenter remarked they were as poor as
church mice, whereupon Thompson carved the mouse that became his
signature and that of the men who worked with him. It is still used
today on furniture and ornaments made at his old workshoprun by his two
great grandsons. A visit to the Mouseman Centre is a trip back into the
past. The main workshop smells of freshly cut oak and beeswax and the
men work in traditional methods, using chisels and the adze, eschewing
things like nails and adhesives. They work only in English oak .
Every piece of furniture produced by Robert Thompson's Craftsmen Ltd,
as they are now known, is completely handmade . Chairs are seated and
covered with real cowhide; handles and hinges are still forged by a
local blacksmith; and every piece has a mouse carved on it somewhere.
Today there are about 18 craftsmen employed in the workshop, and each
of them has his individual way of making a mouse, so that specialists
are able to tell them apart. There is no fixed period of apprenticeship,
but by tradition a man is reckoned to have served his time when his
mouse is judged good enough to satisfy his employers.
Mouseman carvings and furniture can be found in churches and private
homes through this country and abroad.
In the Roman Catholic Church of St Edward on Canna, there is an
adze-carved oak communion table; in Crichton Church, Pathhead, near
Edinburgh, a Mouseman font; in Fort Augustus Abbey a screen; in the
Church of St John the Evangelist in Moffat an altar, and in St Ninian's
Church, Troon, there are two Mouseman pieces -- a bishop's chair and a
cupboard -- both showing bold adzed work.
Usually the pieces are cherished for their quality and rarity but in
the Church of St Mary in Wharfedale, a mouse carved on an altar rail was
removed after a lady parishioner who knelt near it complained it
frightened her. The mark of where it once was, however, still shows.
By the time Robert Thompson died in 1955, the style of his pieces was
well-established, and has not changed . There is still a huge demand and
it is made for a wide circle of patrons, ranging from specialist
collectors to members of the royal family. Because it is so
painstakingly made, it is not cheap -- a four-foot-wide wardrobe can
cost around #2700; a dressing table about #2500 and its stool just under
#300.
Tourists who visit Kilburn in the summer to see the workshops can buy
lesser priced items like a nut bowl or a cheeseboard (with mouse, of
course) for about #30.
Robert Thompson's Mouseman Centre is worth a visit because the old
man's original workshop has been lovingly restored. It still smells of
woodchips, his tools lie on the bench, and his collection of medieval
carvings is propped along the beams.
Opening hours are 10am till 5pm daily, Easter to October, and there is
a small charge for admission. Kilburn lies just off the A170 Thirsk to
Scarborough Road and the Mouseman Visitor Centre is in the middle of the
village. The telephone number is 01347 868222.
* SOMETHING to look forward to is the sale, on June 15, by Phillips in
London, of a selection of cookery books belonging to the late Fanny
Craddock. The auctioneers will have high hopes for the books because
last year they sold the fairly unremarkable contents of the kitchen of
another famous cook, Elizabeth David, for astonishing prices -- wooden
spoons fetching sums normally paid for silver ones.
Though not held in the same reverence and respect as Elizabeth David,
Fanny Craddock's books will attract buyers because she was in the habit
of scrawling caustic comments like ''fiddle faddle'' in their margins.
American interest is not expected because of an American book she wrote:
''Not America -- the master ruiners of food.''

PIONEERS who ventured into home brewing will be familiar with the
outcome when those little finings do not quite do their job. The cloudy
glass of beer has as much appeal as a grey November morning and is best
not consumed unless under circumstances of extreme duress. But there is
a beer that appears complete with cloudette -- and it is not the work of
the home brewer.
Wheat beer has been wallowing in the mists for centuries and is an
established favourite in southern Germany, particularly Bavaria where
some classics are produced. This refreshing beer, which is at its peak
this month, is made with at least 50% wheat in addition to the normal
barley. A secondary fermentation in the bottle often creates a
clove-like aroma.
In Germany, it is not unusual for the bottle to be rolled on the bar
before serving to give the contents a chance to mingle which improves
the taste. Further mystique has been added to the wheat beer tradition
by calling sediment-bottled beer Weisse (white) while still using Weizen
(wheat) in the same context. A tall glass is needed when pouring to
create the all-important head of froth.
Leading the world with more than 1.4 million hectolitres in annual
wheat beer sales, is Erdinger from the small town of Erding, a few miles
north of Munich. The brewery has steadily increased its brewing and
bottling capacity and a few years ago built a second brewhouse to meet
demand. And yet in the early 1700s, wheat beer was once brewed only as a
royal prerogative and was not allowed to be brewed publicly until the
middle of the nineteenth century.
Today the brewery makes the popular Erdinger mit Hefe (with yeast)
which is viewed by many young drinkers as a wholefood beer because of
its slight grittiness and grainy texture. It is not to everyone's taste,
this liquid muesli, and a sediment-free version in Kristall is, for
many, a favoured alternative. Erdinger also makes a Weizenbock called
Pikantus. Wheat beer is made all year and is much stronger than everyday
brews. It is bottle-fermented and has good flavour with hints of
liquorice. The Erdinger strength range is from 4.2% to 5.7% ABV. Wheat
beers are no different from other brews made for consumption in Germany
and they are bound by the laws of the Reinheitsgebot which demands beer
only be made from pure water, barley or wheat, natural yeasts and malt.
This law stretches back to 1516, and after the reunification, brewers
in the east had to fall in line with its demands.
The Belgians see things differently. Its wheat beers are not
restricted by ancient commandment, and fruit, herbs, orange or
grapefruit peel are regularly used in their production. Indeed, no other
country in the world makes such a wide range of beers. But what is the
connection between a new Belgian wheat beer and a Scots musician who
penned Scotland Again, better known as Caledonia? It is Harry Barry and
he is perhaps Scotland's first and only bierdirecktor. Harry developed a
love for Belgian beer when he went to Antwerp for a folk-dance festival
in the sixties and, despite there being a passing of 25 years until his
next visit, his enthusiasm for their beers had not dimmed. He returned
with 30 cases and so arrived the beginning of his specialist
beer-importing company. The market for wheat beers in Scotland has grown
fast and as business expanded he became involved with the people behind
the beer labels and had the idea to have them produce a beer specially
for the Scottish market; enter Buffalobier. It is brewed at the St Josef
brewery in Opitter. A little mist develops in the glass when poured but
the taste is fresh and clean with hints of spices and orange. It has an
ABV of 5%.
Many Belgian beers are ideal for laying down and a 15-year spell in
the cellar is not uncommon. However, most improve in a much shorter
time. Lapsed sell-by dates are the bargain-hunter's dream.
Buffalobier is available in Glasgow at the Brewery Tap, FIXX 2,
Ventura, Tron, Athena and in Edinburgh at Negociants. The bottled
version will make an appearance later this year in many bars and leading
retail outlets.

* Kevin Drinkell, former Rangers player and now the manager of
Stirling Albion, reveals his eating and drinking habits on the day of a
game.
I TEND not to eat much at all on a work day. I'm not a breakfast
person at any time. I get up as late as possible (about 9am) and had two
or three mugs of tea -- I drink just the basic kind, as long as it's wet
and warm -- and a cigarette. I'm not proud of my smoking. My children
chastise me every day about it. I probably do drink tea and coffee to
excess -- 20 to 30 mugfuls a day.
I spent some time reading the papers, then called in at Spencer's, the
snooker club, where I have some toast and a milky coffee. At about 12
o'clock I walk over to the Stirling Albion ground and go straight to the
cafeteria for coffee. Before the match I have tea, at half-time more
tea, and afterwards yet more tea and a cola in the boardroom. Then I
started thinking about what I was going to eat.
I've usually prearranged with my wife to have some form of steak or
pasta, though sometimes we have a take-away. This day we had steak with
saute potatoes and mangetouts. I love mangetouts -- that's my little
treat and I pile on as much as I can. I have a chocolate mousse for
pudding.
Feeling rather bloated after that, and all the tension of the day, I
sit and relax. At 9 o'clock, I take a walk to my local hostelry where I
have two or three beers (English bitter). I never take shorts. More
fluids! When I was playing, my fluid intake didn't affect my weight.
It's hard to keep it down now.
I returned home between 11 and 12, had more tea, watched golf and
basketball on TV, then went to bed.

It's time to remove the vestiges of your spring displays, writes Ian
Walls
THE WEEK'S WORK
* THE weather in many areas is now ideal for setting out half-hardy
summer bedding plants. This means removing any vestiges of spring
displays. If you have been self-raising plants, you want to get them in
before they become too floppy.
Take time to fork the ground properly after removing spring bedding.
If you have any compost or well-rotted FYM, it is a good idea to dig
this in.
I have been using compost from waste organic material, from paper
waste, chicken litter, and seaweed. This is going through detailed trial
and assessment but looks promising as a peat substitute.
After setting out the plants, make sure they are well watered for a
few days. This is especially important if planting up containers for the
patio -- very much the in-thing these days.
A reader was asking whether it was in order to pinch out the tips of
self-raised antirrhinums, which had become lanky. Doing this, you may
deprive yourself of an early flower spike. It will cause the plants to
branch more vigorously, however, and probably produce a better display.
Remember that sweet peas, planted out a few weeks ago, are now growing
strongly. They will need support, to canes or strings. Check that
adequate support is given for herbaceous plants. I was disappointed to
lose some stems on my paeony because of this.
In the vegetable garden, hoeing and thinning out are the order of the
day. Hoeing controls surface weeds, and creates a nice surface mulch. It
is also said to attract moisture from the lower depths, by capillary
action.
Apart from that, it makes the whole area look neat and attractive. It
is important not to let weeds get a grip of things. They can so soon
take over.
In the fruit section, make sure raspberries are properly supported.
There has been some wind lately. You will have to net your strawberries
soon. Birds are quick off the mark.
There is some excellent netting materials these days. Some is so
strong it will last for years. I support nets on a run of stakes and
strings. It seems to do the job adequately.
I find the wire rake attachment fitted to my cylinder mower is
improving the appearance of the grass. This applies especially to
prostrate coarse grass which has invaded lawns with a vengeance.
With roses, start spraying with Systhane or Roseclear before black
spot gets a grip. I am watching three bushes of Floral Carpet, planted
to see if it really is resistant to black spot. Time will tell.
This is a good time to thin out hardy annuals sown in April. They
should be growing fairly vigorously. The problem can be in identifying
which are annuals and which are weeds.
It is also time to treat paths with residual weedkiller. I am using
Pathclear. One good application now should last the whole season.
These residuals are not meant to be used between short-term crops.
They could be dangerous with even long-term items, if absorbed by their
roots.

THERE are reckoned to be around nine million people holding shares
quite apart from the even larger number who hold them indirectly through
such things as life assurance policies and pension funds. There are not
quite that number of choices for the investor with money to risk but the
number of shares to buy and ways in which to buy them is still pretty
bewildering.
Risk is, let's face it, inevitable. The shares of even the most solid
and reliable company are likely to move up and down with the market. The
big and solid ones with interests in a number of markets and a lot of
countries should fluctuate less than the others.
Stockbroker analysts study past track records to plot the volatility
of a share and if you worry that the market may go down but still want
to be in it because you feel it is more likely to go up, a share with a
low-volatility rating will let you sleep easier at nights.
Conversely, if the market has taken a sharp tumble and you think it
will turn up again, a share with a high volatility could well show the
best reward and bounce up more than Old Reliable PLC which did not
suffer so much when the market went into its fall.
When you sign up with a stockbroker he will ask you to indicate the
general level of risk which you are prepared to accept. It is a sensible
precaution because if your funds are limited or you are about to retire
and draw a pension, which will inevitably be less than your previous
earnings, you do not want him getting you into something which might
double or disappear within the next 12 months.
The share market seems to be holding on pretty well to its mood of
cautious optimism and provided that nothing nasty happens to interest
rates the overall trend of prices should continue gently upwards at
least until 3500 on the FTSE index of the 100 biggest companies is hit.
The 250 next biggest companies may do a little better. The strategy
team at brokers Smith New Court suggested back in April that this group
should start to outperform the top 100 and this does look like beginning
to happen. The reason is the general manufacturing companies which
account for around a third of this index against only 15% of the 100
index.
Sectors the strategists like best are engineers where they add
Powerscreen to their buy list, building materials where Travis Perkins
joins Hewden Stuart as a buy, and motor distributors where they add
Cowie.
If you have told your broker you do not want to get into anything
particularly risky he will not have been talking to you about warrants.
These are some of the riskiest things in the market. Although a very
few industrial companies have issued them -- BTR has a whole string of
them -- most have been issued by investment trusts.
Essentially a warrant gives you the right to buy a share in the
company which issued it at a fixed price during a given time span,
usually up to 10 years.
Investment trusts are usually thought of as a way of getting an
interest in a large number of shares, whether diversified across the
world or in speciality areas, with professional management which should
make it less risky than picking companies for yourself.
Warrants put a whole lot of risk back in. Calculations by Credit
Lyonnais Laing show that warrants gained an average of 208% in 1993,
which was a good year for investment trust shares but seldom as good as
that. Last year the average warrant price fell by 25.2%. And that was
after losing a 20% recovery scored in July and August. The
best-performing warrant gained over 130% but several lost more than 70%.
The attraction with warrants is that they cost less than the
underlying share so you can buy more of them for the same amount of
money. If the trust does well the warrants should do even better for
you. Remember though that you get no dividends from a warrant.
If you are tempted, keep a close eye on the expiry date. Warrants are
in essence long-term options to buy the underlying shares so there is a
''time value'' in them. You need, therefore, to check on how much time
you are buying.
Credit Lyonnais Laing points out that more than 40% of the
worst-performing warrants last year had relatively short lives. It
commented: ''Only one thing is for certain with warrants and that is the
reduction of the time value (represented by the warrant premium) to zero
over the life of the warrant.''
In general they recommend avoiding warrants with less than a year to
run and warn that they are, in any case, ''only suited to experienced
investors who fully comprehend the risk that is being taken on''.
That said, they offer non-experts a number of simple rules. They point
out that, however, fundamentally cheap a warrant may appear it is only a
movement in the price of the underlying share which can make the warrant
price increase over time. So you should buy a warrant only when you are
confident that the underlying assets of the trust will be going up.
A useful tip is to check also that the underlying trust is relatively
cheap compared with other similar trusts. Look also at the premium which
you are paying -- the warrant price plus the subscription price divided
by the share price and multiplied by a hundred -- as warrants with low
premiums are generally safer than those where the premium is high.
The brokers also warn that some warrants are very unmarketable and
there could be a dealing spread (the difference between buying and
selling prices) of 20% or more. Ask about this before you deal.
Bear in mind also that just as a warrant can, pound for pound
invested, go up more than its underlying share, it can also rattle down
faster if the market turns sour.

The natural touch of the terracotta bell pot is finding new favour,
writes Heather Rose
WHEN it comes to adding the floral touch to our homes these days it is
a case of back to basics, writes HEATHER ROSE. Terracotta is big news.
So says Alan Docherty, group buyer with Findlay Clark Garden Centres.
Not only are we finding its natural, earthy tones enjoyable to have
around the place, terracotta planters have become comparatively cheaper.
''People like what appears to be more of a natural product,'' he
explains. ''In the past year the price of plastics has rocketed because
of increases in oil prices.
''Today you can buy a terracotta lookalike in plastic and pay more for
it than you pay for real terracotta. A few years ago the perception of
that was the other way round.''
As a result the plain, old-fashioned bell pot has come right back into
vogue, costing around #4 or #5 for a version 12 to 14 inches in
diameter.
It is even possible to find designer versions. Duncan's of Milngavie
garden centre has distinctly Scottish-looking pots sporting tartan ties
and bows for around #17 to #19.
Terracino, a heavier and more upmarket form of terracotta, is proving
a winner with Scots -- although it tends to be pricier.
This nostalgic note does not mean the end of the plastic era. Far from
it. Plastic is now acquiring a more ornate image.
Alan Docherty explains: ''Plastic manufacturers are now starting to
mimic terracino, the more upmarket-looking terracotta where they can
score on price.
''A fancy vase or urn in terracino might set you back #60 or more
because of the work that has gone into it. But now you can get a very
realistic lookalike in plastic for possibly half the price.''
Natural influences are being introduced to planters and vases from
Highland Stoneware. Their new flower pots co-ordinate with items like
plates and bowls, and have Scottish outdoor designs reflecting hills,
lochs, crags, and seabirds.
Containers sell at #75, and plant pots start at #25.25. (Stockists:
Duncan's of Milngavie).
Crystal, too, is being seen in a new light for floral touches around
our homes.
According to Susan Lonie, brand manager with Edinburgh Crystal,
crystal vases appear on 54% of wedding lists.
She says: ''As flower-arranging is now an art, not only admired but
also practised by many men and women, crystal vases of all shapes and
sizes are ideal to add the finishing touch to an enchanting floral
arrangement.''
This idea also features in the new Florabundance vase collection by
Dartington.
Just as different-shaped wine glasses are designed to bring out the
best from different wines, so Dartington has come up with ten different
vases, each designed to suit one of the ten best-selling cut flowers.
Available in either clear or optic crystal, prices range from #15 for
a freesia vase to #49 for a lily vase.
However, it is possible to go back to basics for floral themes around
the house without forking out a penny on new vases and planters, says
Dot Low, chairman of the 10,500-member Scottish Association of Flower
Arrangement Societies , which has 117 clubs spread around the country.
''You name it, it can be used as the base for a flower arrangement,''
says Mrs Low. ''Anything that will hold water can be used -- and that
gives you a wide field.''
Asked to list some of the more unusual, she instantly comes up with
washing-up bowls, dog bowls, paint tins, baking bowls and baking trays.
Other everyday objects adapted by the skills of flower arrangers
include boots, shoes, rubber tyres, bicycle wheels, yogurt cartons and
polystyrene dishes.
* The association is currently staging its area biennial show, in
association with Falkirk district council, at Falkirk Town Hall.

Thinking of splashing out on splashing in? MARY BENNIE takes a look at
. . .
AT the end of a tiring day there's nothing more relaxing than to soak
up in a warm bath. The therapeutic effects of a massage to soothe these
aching limbs are well known, and what better than to combine the two by
indulging in a whirlpool or spa bath?
Whirlpool baths work by taking water from the bath and pumping it back
in through a system of jets sited along the bath sides.
Spa baths work by blowing air through a series of jets in the base of
the bath. Baths which combine both whirlpool and spa systems are also
available. Whirlpool and spa systems are only suitable for acrylic
baths.
These baths have become popular at health clubs and are now spreading
into the home market. Several manufacturers offer a range of options.
You can opt for a standard-sized bath, or indulge in a larger corner
bath or a model designed for two bathers.
The original makers of whirlpool baths is Jacuzzi. Roy Jacuzzi
introduced the world's first fully self-contained whirlpool bath in 1968
and Jacuzzi is now the world's largest whirlpool product manufacturer.
Jacuzzi baths work by pumping air and water through a series of
nozzles placed at strategic points around the sides (never in the base)
-- behind the spine, opposite the soles of the feet and at the sides.
Because people vary in size, the nozzles of the jets, set in angled
recesses, are manually adjustable.
Jacuzzi believes the location of the jets, rather than the number, is
most important, together with the angle of impact with the body. The
jets are adjustable in intensity and in the air-water mixture.
Working on a different means to acheive a similar result, Airbath
International's massage baths pump warm air into the water through
hundreds of airjets in the bottom of the bath. This creates air bubbles
which massage the whole body. The first Airbath was created in the late
1950s and they were used at first in hospitals, health spas and sports
clinics before being developed for home use.
Showerlux makes a variety of baths, available in a spa or whirlpool
option, or with a combination of both systems.
If you don't want to splash out on a new bath, it might be possible to
transform your current bath into a spa bath. Triton Spa and Spa Deluxe
systems can be installed if yours is acrylic and conforms to certain
requirements. These air systems operate on extra low voltage. The blower
unit blows air into the bath through 10 multi-jet nozzles. You can
control the speed of the blower motor to give you the option of a gentle
relaxing massage or a more vigorous, muscle-toning bath.
Ideal Standard's Whirlpool 3000 multi-jet system is available in many
of its acrylic baths. The multi-jets are in the lumbar and foot areas
and are individually adjustable.
All manufacturers recommend professional installation, particularly of
electrical systems, and urge that you check with your stockist for
safety and cleaning details.
CHEAPER THAN A CAR
* YOU too could be the luxurious creature relaxing in Triton's Spa
Deluxe bath pictured on our cover (around #400 for chrome and #430 for
gold).
Go on -- spoil yourself! Self-indulgence doesn't come easily to most
of us but the benefits of a spa bath are tried and tested in terms of
beating stress and helping people to relax and unwind.
Bathtime has never been more fun, and there are baths to suit every
taste, whether you opt for the traditional, standard bath shape or the
more luxurious corner or sunken versions. It's cheaper than buying a new
car and just as much fun for all the family, without harming the
environment!
Prices start at about #350 for Triton's Spa Pack, rising to around
#4500 for Jacuzzi's J-Sha, which is designed to give a rolling back
massage via recessed jets located in the back-rest. Larger luxury corner
baths will probably cost over #7000.   Available from: John Richmond &amp;
Co Ltd, 18-20 Carnoustie Place, Scotland Street, Glasgow G5 8PA. William
Morrison &amp; Son Ltd, 60-80 Cheapside Street, Glasgow G3 8BJ. Victor
Paris, 178 Dundee Street, Edinburgh EH1; or check with your local

* THE FIRST home-grown glossy magazine about stylish Scots and their
interiors is now in the shops.
The 84-page issue, sponsored by Scottish Television's Home Show
programme and The Herald, takes us round the homes of well-known Scots
personalities and prominent local designers and decorators. It also
gives advice on the best, and sometimes least likely, places to find
stylish touches that make all the difference.
The first home under the spotlight is the country cottage of married
Home Show presenters Viv Lumsden and Alan Douglas. Viv describes its
style as ''eclectic'', Alan calls it ''quirky''.
The perfectly-groomed hairdressing partnership of Anne and Taylor
Ferguson also open their doors to the cameras, and there's a rummage in
the less-manicured Edinburgh architectural salvage yard.
The magazine reveals the unlikely relationship between Dr Peter Tovell
and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The Artist's Cottage and Studio, the home
Mackintosh designed in 1900, was built by Dr Peter Tovell, a former
biochemist, at Inverness three years ago and is on the market at
#280,000.
All that -- plus recipe, wine and competition pages -- make it good
value for #1.95.
Publisher David Riddell, of International Magazines, Glasgow, says:
''The magazine is targeted at people interested in their own homes but
also in other people's ideas.
''It's the first Scots-based title to look at the homes of well-known
Scots, and Scots are just as proud and interested in their homes as
people in other parts of the country.''

* A WORD about spring cleaning: Don't. One writer tells us that few
people get round to a total spring-clean these days, but there's always
that nasty little nagging virus that induces us to have a general
tidy-up and throw out anything that isn't useful.
It's just as well that not everybody listens. Take last week's case of
the chap who fished out an old-fashioned reel-to-reel recording tape
which had been languishing in a cupboard for 34 years. Had, in fact,
survived 34 spring cleaning opportunities.
It was an amateur recording by a school pal of the teenage Mick Jagger
and Keith Richards, made before the Stones started Rolling, and it
fetched #50,625 at auction.
Nobody could possibly call the old tape ''useful'', certainly not as
useful as #50,625. It would have been a prime target for the
feather-duster fetishist. The only defence is to play dumb and act
lethargic.
''Look, here's that old tape still in your cupboard gathering dust,
m'lad. Aren't you going to throw it out?''
''No Ma.''
''You said that last year. Who's on it anyway?''
''Oh, just Mick and Keith playing around.''
''But they've made some proper records since then. You've got a
shelf-full.'' Etc etc.
For sheer stubborness of a high order, payday has arrived at last. So
here are some basic rules to abide by when the awful virus comes
calling.
* Do not throw anything out, anything at all. Do you know how much
broken Bakelite mantel clocks cost in the shops these days? Or wooden
ironing boards with scorch marks?
* Put a padlock on the glory-hole under the stairs. The nasty little
virus has a habit of striking when you're out of the house. ''Look,'' it
says proudly, ''I've done out the stair cupboard. You've no idea of the
rubbish I found. This nice man with a van said he'd look after it for
me, even your grandad's old stamp albums. What? Oh, that's not a nice
word to use.''
* When the glory-hole gets too small, buy a second garden shed, and
lock that too.
* When visiting a house that has been spring-cleaned, affect not to
notice. This is extremely hurtful, like failing to notice a friend's new
car or new spouse.
You may have to persist in this behaviour for several springs, but
eventually the dreaded habit will be swept under the carpet where it
belongs.

Does your dull old bathroom need some cheering up? Johanna Hall offers
a few
bright ideas on a watery theme
* IF YOU think your bathroom is looking drab but you don't have ready
cash for a new bathroom suite or to retile, why not think about some new
bathroom accessories? British Home Stores has a new bathroom range with
a distinctly watery feel.
Fish-shaped soap dish for #5, matching tooth mug and dish with lid,
all in blues with swimming fish, will perk up any bathroom. Follow the
theme through with towels in greens and blues trimmed with cotton.
Prices start at #2 for a facecloth.
Or go for the old-fashioned look, with a white water jug and washing
bowl to match with starfish and sea horses in relief for #10 each piece.
If you want to bring a part of the real seashore inside, opt for
seaweeds and shells contained in compartments in a frame for #15, or
even a sea urchin.
The bathroom is not usually thought of as an amusing place to be, but
why not raise a smile with a few unusual extras? Add an aquarium to the
bathroom by having some big multi-coloured ceramic fish from #3.99, or
some flying fish at #1.99 in brilliant colours will sit nicely along the
wall alongside some cheeky ceramic sea horses, also #1.99.
As long as you keep them away from the shower or the bath, giant
papier mache shells should raise an eyebrow, from 99p.
Finally, to keep the soap from going soggy at the side of the washhand
basin, a zebra soap dish at #2.99 could be the answer -- or a toucan on
his back with a top hat on, also #2.99.
All from Au Naturale, in Byres Road and Argyle Street, Glasgow.

If you can stand the heat, why not get into the sauna? There are three
ways of doing it, discovers Johanna Hall
IF you've just had a good work-out in your personal gym (see above)
you will probably be gasping to relax in the sauna. And you don't have
to leave the house to have this Nordic experience either.
But every sauna is not the same. Eddie O'Niel, of Glasgow-based UV
Engineering -- which supplies and advises on saunas -- explains: ''There
are three ways of doing a sauna. First, where you take a room and line
the walls and build into the room. This is marginally stronger,
marginally cheaper, but more expensive in labour costs. The downside is
you can't take it away with you when you move.
''Secondly, you could buy a panelled sauna -- most popular in domestic
situations and commercial enterprises. This is prefabricated and you
plonk it in the middle of the floor -- there's nothing special required.
We sometimes refer to it as a well-insulated garden shed with a heater
in it.
''And the third method is log saunas; but they don't tend to be used
in houses because of the weight.''
Saunas don't come cheap and most people would see them as a luxury
extra. Perhaps in the future we will view the sauna as people see the
colour television now.
A two-person sauna can cost about #1700 plus VAT and if you have lots
of space and friends you can expect to pay around #3600 plus VAT. Some
companies charge an installation cost which can be anything between
5-15% of the cost. My advice is to check upfront and haggle!
The running costs depend on how much you use it -- a rough estimate
could be 60p per hour. But will the heat and the moisture cause a
problem in the house?
Eddie O'Neil says not: ''A sauna is dry heat. As far as moisture is
concerned, you are talking about a very, very little amount of water
going on the stones. It just touches the stones and evaporates. It
doesn't come out of the sauna in great clouds of steam or anything like
it.
''As far as the heat itself is concerned, there's nothing to worry
about. No fitting in your house is going to be affected by the sauna.
This is why relatively expensive saunas are better than cheap ones
because the relatively good saunas are better insulated, which is going
to keep almost all the heat inside the sauna.''
* Health note: You have to be careful with a sauna if you have high
blood pressure. If you have any doubts about whether to use one, consult
your doctor, advises Eddie O'Neil. ''But in general,'' he adds,
''there's no safe or unsafe way to use a sauna. Many people say that, as
you've paid your money, you should stay in as long as you can. But you
should only use it for as long as you feel comfortable. The best way is
to go in for about two minutes, come out, have a cold shower to close
the pores, then go in again.''

IF you're considering having a gym as an addition to your home, there
are several points to look at first -- such as what results you are
looking for; where in the house you will put the equipment; and how much
you are going to spend.
What you want from the equipment should be the starting point,
according to Nigel Webster, of Powerhouse in Glasgow, a company which
sells and advises on individual gym set-ups.
''It's up to the customer,'' he says. ''There may be more than one
user of the equipment -- it might be a whole family of different ages
and different requirements. Which type of equipment would you enjoy
most?
''The buzz phrase at the moment is exercise adherence. One of the
biggest problems with home exercise is basically lack of
self-motivation. People spend money on home exercise equipment, and
these pieces all too often lie dormant.''
It's worth thinking about what you want before you spend the pennies.
For example, a rowing machine will work most muscle groups, but this is
the one bit of equipment that is difficult to motivate yourself on,
perhaps a treadmill or an exercise bike would be more effective.
There are many reasons people opt for the home gym, ranging from
one-upmanship to having a lifestyle which does not allow us to fit in a
trip to the local gym. The good old Scottish weather can also play a
part, as it seems we don't want to go out jogging on a cold, drizzly
autumn night.
The most likely people to kit out their house are the less-fit among
us. Serious athletes have their own exercise regimes which mean they
don't need any extra, and there seems to be an equal split among men and
women buying home exercise equipment.
What can you expect to pay? ''Most people buy individual pieces of
apparatus,'' says Nigel Webster. ''It's something you can do for as
little as #500, although you would be buying pretty cheap equipment. On
the other hand, we did a facility fairly recently where the client spent
#20,000 on equipment which went by his pool and sauna with a steam
room.''
His top tip? ''In most cases, if you are really looking for something
to deliver a result, get one good piece -- not two or three cheaper
pieces -- because you would be more likely to stay with an exercise
regime if you invest in something that's a little bit better.''

The stars will be out in force today as their playground, the Beverly
Hills Hotel, reopens in a blaze of unashamed, sybaritic glory. Douglas
Thompson reports on what they can expect.
THERE are 32,367 residents of Beverly Hills (29,113 Anglos, 787
Asians, 1354 Latinos, 500 Blacks, 38 American Indians, and 575 assorted
others) and most of them play to the rules by wearing, driving, eating,
drinking, and most of all loving their money. Accommodating the majority
motivation are 63 financial institutions, 151 dentists, 122 restaurants,
58 beauty salons, 31 jewellery stores (including Tiffany's, Van Cleef
and Arpels, Cartier and Fred), and 678 lawyers, 197 accountants, 172
business managers, 32 stockbrokers and 173 agents and public relations.
Picking-up the pieces, coping with the fall-out from such furtive
endeavour are just seven churches and synagogues but 528 physicians and
123 psychologists.
There is only one hotel.
Newcomers to this palm-fringed 5.7 square miles of avarice usually do
two things: have their teeth fixed (capped, bleached, and bonded) and
visit the Beverly Hills Hotel.
The H-shaped building which sits only a sidewalk to the north of
Sunset Boulevard reopens today after three years -- and tens of millions
of dollars -- of renovations. The revamp has mostly been devoted to the
interior ensuring superstar super-luxury into the millennium for the
high-paying guests of the latest owner, the Sultan of Brunei. But the
original structural walls remain.
If only they could talk?
''The Pink Palace'' has hosted Hollywood and British royalty, Gable
and Lombard (incognito), Burton and Taylor (in full flow), Eddie Fisher
and Taylor, Mike Todd and Taylor, Michael Wilding and Taylor (in fact
all the husbands except for obvious PR reasons Nicky Hilton), Aristotle
Onassis, Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, Marilyn Monroe, Arthur Miller, Yves
Montand, Simone Signoret (with Montand and Monroe involved in 1960's
Let's Make Love on and off screen), the Beatles and Michael Jackson.
The list is longer than the curved double driveway which sweeps up to
the hotel entrance and valet parking team (Leon Smith, known as Smitty,
has held the parking franchise at the hotel for 40 years and is said to
be the only millionaire who turns up for work in a uniform every day)
who park and retrieve cars (even for legendary non-tippers like regular
David Frost) with polite precision.
Many of the stories of the ''Pink Palace'' and its guests seem taller
than the hotel's four. They still talk about W C Fields reserving a
table for two in the all-at-once famous and infamous Polo Lounge
(Hollywood's early polo-playing crowd including Spencer Tracy, Darryl
Zanuck, and Will Rogers drank there after games) and turning up with his
man-eating plant.
And John Barrymore's body being stolen from a mortuary and rested
comfortably in an armchair in a fourth-floor suite so that Errol Flynn
could host a farewell bash.
Good business has never been seasonal, or a problem, for the Beverly
Hills Hotel (95% occupancy every evening before it closed) which has
grown in status with the town it so much mirrors. A century ago Beverly
Hills was just another place to plant lima beans and raise cattle.
Then the Rodeo Land and Water Company developed it as a subdivision
and, as war was breaking out in Europe, it was incorporated as the City
of Beverly Hills. Soon Will Rogers was honorary mayor and on the city
council and Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford the most celebrated
residents living in ''Pickfair'', two hard rights and a left up the hill
from the Beverly Hills Hotel which had been built for half a million
1912 US dollars by former wildcatter oilman Burton Green. Green was the
boss of Rodeo Land and Water and created Beverly Hills to give himself
customers; the hotel was to provide panache and a ''civilised''
attraction.
It became Hollywood's playroom and often bedroom, the centre of a
neighbourhood literally wall-to-wall with names like Charlie Chaplin and
Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, Harold Lloyd, and Tom Mix. With its
weddings, parties and screenings and conferences -- the place where the
''power breakfast'' and the mogul phrase ''to take a meeting'' were
invented -- the hub of the social and civic life of a community whose
libido purrs to comfort, credit, money, sex, security, power, cars,
planes, yachts, and glory, although never necessarily in that order.
''The Pink Palace'' has been a silent witness to much Hollywood
history, to the dreamers and the dreams built on less solid foundations
than the hotel itself. With the reopening is an appropriate time for the
place to come out from hiding in its tropical gardens of camellias,
magnolias, azaleas, Brazilian pepper trees, bougainvillea, oleanders,
orange blossom and coconut palms and neatly mown lawns which teams of
gardeners tend to daily on 12 of the most desirable of all California's
acres.
The Sultan of Brunei, a Midas potentate, was attracted not just by the
Hope Diamond novelty of the place but by the obvious long-term value of
a 12-acre resort with 265 rooms in the main building, strings of
bungalows and tennis courts, garages, shops, gardens and the 22
sought-after green-and-white-striped cabanas by a swimming-pool with the
high diving-board on which a fully clothed Katharine Hepburn used to do
back somersaults.
There was also the Polo Lounge and the easy access to Sunset Boulevard
in the heart of Beverly Hills; and, maybe more than anything else, there
is the intrinsic ''celebrity'' value of the landmark property.
Pasquale Pavone, the former maitre d' of the Polo Lounge cannot think
of any famous figure who hasn't stepped around the corner of lobby phone
booths and into the darkened rooms.
H R Haldeman, John Mitchell, and a crowd of other Nixon cronies were
at a corner table when they heard the Watergate burglars had been
caught. Sinatra was banned after a fight 25 years ago with businessman
Frederick Weisman but both combatants have since returned. The
entertainer's wife Mia Farrow was refused entry because her pantsuit
offended. Bardot's bare feet got her barred. Today the codes are more
relaxed, but just a little in the hotel which doesn't care for
convention business (they define rock groups as ''conventions'') or
taxis (stretch limousines are available at all times for guests without
cars or drivers) and insists that all hotel help know all the guests',
famous or not, names before they reach their rooms (depending on size
and number now costing between $215 to $1400 and upwards a day) from the
front desk which sits immediately inside and to the right of the
entrance.
From its beginning, the ''Pink Palace'' has set out to please and
pleasure its customers. Before Queen Juliana of Holland arrived 600
tulips were planted around her bungalow. When General David Sarnoff, the
founder of RCA, was a guest the TV sets in his rooms were replaced with
RCA equipment. When Princess Margaret visited the Pink Palace with
Snowdon, Gauloise cigarettes were provided for him, Beefeater gin for
her in suite 486.
Robert Mitchum went for bourbon in orange juice and Liz Taylor, in
overweight mode, for Maxim's style potatoes dolloped in sour cream and
caviare. The Duke of Edinburgh picked all the fruit from the orange tree
outside his door when he was a guest.
Joan Crawford would never stay in a room on the first floor. Howard
Hughes lived there for 25 years retaining three private bungalows and 12
rooms and slept in different beds every night. Diahann Carroll, of
Dynasty, didn't just change beds but also her rooms almost every day
during stays. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor were guests. So were
Prince Rainier and Princess Grace. A picture of Jean Harlow playing
tennis was found during renovations. It was captioned simply, ''MGM
Starlet''. Former executive Jean Majors recounts the days of the Polo
Lounge when all the agents from the powerful William Morris company
would sit in the booths in identical outfits, dark suits, white shirts
and ties.
''Jack Lemmon was new in town then. The first time he went to the Polo
Lounge he got up, went to the men's room, came back and accidentally
went to the wrong booth. It was a totally different agent there. It was
10 minutes before he realised it.''
Gable and Lombard's romance flourished secretly in bungalow five.
Steve McQueen moved in between marriages and the hotel was home away
from home to Liz Taylor (she once ran through $20,000 in two weeks with
a large chunk in $50 tips to maids) and Marilyn Monroe between
marriages. Monroe's marriage to Arthur Miller was doomed after they had
the next-door bungalow to Yves Montand and wife Simone Signoret. After
Miller and Signoret left on business the other couple were left making
''Let's Make Love'' and emotions flared -- so heated apparently that
Montand one night broke down Monroe's door.
Which is something that President John Kennedy didn't have to do. He
is said to have entertained her in one of the hotel's bungalows as well
as actress Angie Dickinson and Judith Campbell Exner whose affection he
shared with Mafia chieftain Sam Giancana.
When not distracted by Monroe, Arthur Miller did much work within the
pampered confines of the Pink Palace. So did Scott Fitzgerald, John
Steinbeck, and Hemingway; if they were in residence today they would be
taking notes and planning, at the very least, short stories if not a
full-blown play or novel on what tales the refurbished hotel will bring.
Drama has always surrounded the Beverly Hills Hotel reflecting the
mystique of the pink-painted stucco walls (architect Frank Lloyd Wright
snorted that it was ''Spanish medievalism'') and how it can captivate.
In the forties with the spot of bother going on in Europe, the hotel
was not booming and a young banker named Hernando Courtright (the son of
a Basque-born mother and an Irish-American cavalry officer) was sent in
by California's Bank of America to either sell it or get it into profit.
With the help of names like Loretta Young and Irene Dunn the elegant
Courtright formed a consortium and took over what he transformed into a
flourishing business. All was well until lawyer Ben L Silberstein from
Detroit (his family have always denied that he had Mafia links in
Michigan) arrived with his favourite daughter Muriel who wanted Daddy to
buy the Pink Palace.
After much bickering and dealing he did. It cost him $5.5 million
dollars. Courtright, who knew the business and, as importantly, the
customers and neighbours, remained as president and general manager. It
wasn't easy. Silberstein had a meat-and-potatoes attitude compared to
Courtright's champagne-and-caviare style.
It was Silberstein who solved the mutual dislike by turning it into
hatred when he fell for Courtright's nightclub-singer wife Rosalind.
There were divorces and marriages. Courtright bought the Beverly
Wilshire Hotel, an association which lasted longer than Silberstein's
and Rosalind's marriage.
Meanwhile, Muriel had married Burton Slatkin and Silberstein's other
daughter Seema wed the disgraced 1980s bond dealer Ivan Boesky. Seema
and Boesky stayed in New York with their four children. Muriel and Burt
became the prince and princess of the Beverly Hills Hotel although
always answerable to her father until his death in 1979.
Silberstein left 48% of the Pink Palace to each of his daughters and
4% to his sister Gertrude Marks and her two children back in Detroit.
Burt and Muriel tried to buy the 4% but didn't like the asking price.
The frowned-upon son-in-law Ivan Boesky, who had proved a clever
businessman and amassed a fortune, didn't haggle. He bought the 4% for a
never disclosed but said to be mighty fortune.
Of course, with it he bought control of the Pink Palace.
* A big bash is planned today for the reopening of the hotel. It will,
appropriately, benefit the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
-- the Oscar people and Tinseltown curators. Tickets are $1000 each and
guests will mix. Guests include Frank Sinatra, Angie Dickinson, James
Caan, Steve Martin, Dyan Cannon, Rosanna Arquette, and many other famous
faces. The not-so-famous have been vying for weeks to produce
''credentials'' to attend. This is when connections, not ticket touts,
matter.

SCOTTISH Television is considering whether to grant Mirror Group
Newspapers' request for representation on its board, chairman William
Brown confirmed after STV's annual general meeting yesterday in Glasgow.
Meanwhile, the tie-up with MGN, which bought a 19.99% stake in the
television company last autumn, could be strengthened if exploratory
talks relating to STV input to MGN's ''Live TV'' cable service bears
fruit.
STV had wanted to wait until the Government's views on cross-media
ownership were clarified before making a decision on board
representation for MGN.
Mr Brown made it clear to shareholders that the Government's
proposals, contained in a consultative Green Paper published last week,
rule out the possibility of MGN mounting a full takeover bid.
Speaking after the meeting, Mr Brown said: ''The matter will come up
again. We haven't yet taken a view on it but we will in due course.''
It appears that the news-gathering resources of STV could be harnessed
as part of MGN's strategy of providing local programmes to ''Live TV''
viewers in specific cities or regions, once the cable service goes
UK-wide.
If discussions are successful, STV could be providing material for
three hours of Glasgow-news programmes each day by the end of next year.
It may also become involved in an Edinburgh channel of ''Live TV''.
The STV input would consist of either repeats of its own programmes or
a dedicated cable-service.
STV managing director Gus Macdonald stressed that discussions were
still at an exploratory stage and that the company had time to watch the
progress of similar joint-ventures between MGN and regional newspaper
groups, south of the Border.
An MGN spokesman said: ''It has always been the intention of Mirror
Group and 'Live TV' to achieve this sort of synergy. It is very
encouraging to hear Scottish Television talking about it publicly.''
Earlier Mr Brown told shareholders that the decline in STV's share of
the ITV advertising market, which hit profits last year, had been
halted.
With the market now growing faster than for some years, STV hopes to
sustain the 8% increase in advertising revenues achieved during the
first four months of the current financial year.
Mr Brown said STV, which has argued for a balance between
consolidation in the media industry and diversity of ownership and
opinion, broadly welcomed last week's Green Paper.
He said the Government's emphasis on plurality being preserved at
regional as well as national level was particularly relevant.

CONSUMERS appear to be still nervous about borrowing given continuing
uncertainty about interest rates, house prices, and job prospects.
Though net consumer credit was higher than expected in April at #498m
against a revised #514m in March, with market projections ranging up to
#475m, it is still on a slight declining trend and below the average
increase in the past three months, according to the latest Bank of
England figures.
Certainly there is nothing in the Bank's figures to induce Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke to agree to an adjustment in interest rates when he meets
Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, on Wednesday for
their regular monthly meeting.
Total net personal borrowing fell to #1797m from March's #2151m, but
this reflected the weakness in the housing market with mortgage lending
by banks, building societies and other lenders down from #1637m to
#1299m, the lowest figure since August 1993. New loan approvals fell to
70,000 from 77,000, the weakest since November 1992.
The fragility of the housing market is expected to continue, at least
until next year and there are those who believe there will be no real
recovery until after the General Election.
Yesterday the Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, announced a
fall of 0.9% in its seasonally adjusted house price index for May. The
Nationwide had shown a fall of 0.7% over the same month. The market has
been hit by job insecurity, rising interest rates, and reduced mortgage
tax relief.
The Government's plans to restrict income support on mortgage lending,
due to be implemented in October, has not helped sentiment. The Halifax
says that there is little prospect of any imminent recovery. It says
worries over job security continue to depress consumer confidence and
make people unwilling to enter into long-term financial commitments such
as mortgages.
There was some suggestion yesterday, though, that the Government may
be contemplating an initiative to help those many thousands of
homeowners stilll caught in the negative equity trap whereby their homes
are worth less than their mortgage. If so, this might provide a boost to
the overall housing market.
Both the Halifax and the Nationwide reckon that house prices should
start to rise gradually in 1996 as personal disposable income grows more
quickly and consumer confidence starts to recover.
The Bank of England figures show that consumer credit lending by
retailers moved from a decline of #25m in March to plus #1m last month
but this could reflect the favourable credit terms being offered by hard
pressed retailers struggling to force up sales in the highly competitive
high street.
Credit-card borrowing has risen from #119m to #158m over the month,
which is above the #145m average of the previous three months and the
average from over April to December 1994 of #146m. In the view of some
analysts, this could mean that households are attempting to sustain
spending plans after their disposable incomes had been squeezed by tax
increases.
Consumer activity may pick-up in the coming months but it seems that
real consumer confidence is still inextricably bound up with the housing
market.

THE Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) is selling most of its
Scottish liquid milk operations to the rapidly expanding Robert Wiseman
Dairies for round #6.6m.
All of its liquid milk processing and distribution operations in the
central belt are being transferred, though contract distribution from
Harthill and Hawick will not be affected.
Wiseman will see its share of the Scottish liquid milk market rise
from 31% to 37.7%. It has just 4.5% of the British market, with an, as
yet, small-scale presence in Manchester.
The deal brings in over 43 million litres of annual sales to boost the
Wiseman total to about 220 million litres.
However once Manchester comes fully on stream the size of the business
could double as it puts on supermarket sales.
The company, based in East Kilbride, is raising #14m through a placing
and open offer of shares. This is on the basis of seven new shares at
130p each for every 40 held, although these will not qualify for the
1.85p final dividend Wiseman declared yesterday for the year to April 1.
Executive chairman Alan Wiseman indicated strongly that since the CWS
purchase absorbs only half the money being raised from the share issue,
there will be acquisitions later this year, probably in England.
The Wiseman family owns 73.8% of the company which was floated in
March last year at 100p. However they will not be taking up any of the
new shares and so will see their holdings dip to about 63%.
City reaction was muted -- with the existing shares easing 2p to 140p
on negligible turnover of only 13,899 shares.
The CWS decided to quit the Scottish market because it would have
needed to make a heavy capital investment to remain at a time when there
is great change in the industry following the ending of the central
buying authority's remit.
There has also been a decline in doorstep deliveries, which account
for perhaps 18% of sales in Scotland. This market is falling about 3%
annually as customers switch to supermarkets, where there is an average
14p price advantage -- 27p compared with 41p per pint.
CWS assets involved in the sell off include a processing dairy in
Glasgow, and distribution depots in Kirkintilloch, Ayr, Motherwell,
Perth, Tranent and Livingston.
Some 195 people currently work for CWS's Scottish division compared to
1100 who work for Wiseman, including 100 at Trafford Park in Manchester.
The attraction of the deal for Wiseman is that it gives it access to
the CWS retail stores on a three-year supply contract and a one-year
agreement with the ScotMid co-op group.
Group profits last year rose 46% to #7.02m, on turnover 81% greater at
#108m. There was a significant contribution from the Mackies and
Kennerty acquisitions which together brought in almost #38m of sales and
#1.43m of profit.

TEA trader James Finlay yesterday announced the appointment of Pat
Lockett, a senior partner with accountants Ernst and Young in Edinburgh,
as finance director.
Mr Lockett, 51, will join the Glasgow-based company on September 1,
replacing David Forsyth, 45, who has been with James Finlay for 22
years.
James Finlay chairman Richard Muir said the company was in no way
displeased with Mr Forsyth's performance, but it felt the need to bring
in a few changes.
Mr Muir said he hoped to find a new position for Mr Forsyth within the
company, possibly overseas. ''I hope we are still going to keep him . .
. it may be in a position abroad,'' he said.
Mr Muir said the company planned to concentrate on its core activities
-- tea trading, processing and packaging -- and would sell its 78% stake
in Adviser Inc, a fund-managing company based in Houston Texas for #2m
to #2.5m, effective from July 1.

FORMER Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer was given a ''hands off''
warning by the Heart of Midlothian Shareholders' Association yesterday
as they examined the latest proposals for a takeover of the Edinburgh
club.
The new moves began this week when Jim Glass, a one-time property
developer, decided to mount a #2m bid for the club, which went through
the same scenario less than a year ago.
Glass wants to buy out the existing owners of the club, catering
millionaire Chris Robinson and lawyer Leslie Deans, and he wants the
money invested to be used for rebuilding the team.
But yesterday the Shareholders' Association joined the latest battle
for the club and insisted that Mercer, the man who saved Hearts from
bankruptcy in the eighties, must not be involved in any new deal.
Mercer still holds 25% of the shareholding and the present directors
must soon match an undertaking of around #1m which the former owner put
in place before he quit the club last summer.
So far Glass has denied any involvement with Mercer, but there remains
a suspicion in the Shareholders' Association, which will not hold any
great clout if a shares' war breaks out, that he retains some interest
in current events.
In a statement issued last night the association declared: ''We
believe that the Shareholders' Association was instrumental in
initiating the removal of Mr Mercer as chairman and majority
shareholder. We remain firmly committed to the view that we could not
support any infusion of cash which is tainted by the touch of Mr Mercer
or where he used his 25% equity holding to gain control.''
They stressed that ''control must remain in safe hands.'' And then
went on to point out: ''We understand that a significant cash
contribution from a third party could be achieved from a Share Placing
without the need for a full takeover, thereby depriving the minority
shareholders of protection from the Takeover Code.
''This fuels our fears that such a situation would create a window of
opportunity for Mr Mercer to assert his influence on the club once
again. Clearly, this is unsatisfactory as there is a groundswell of
opinion that minority shareholders would wish to have the ability to
sell their shares if Mr Mercer was to reappear.
''Our objective has to be the total acquisition of the remaining
shareholding from Mr Mercer and to this end we believe that the first
priority of new funds must be used to achieve that goal and remove the
spectre of his involvement once and for all.''
Jim Glass, meanwhile, has consistently denied that Wallace Mercer has
any connection at all with his bid for control.

South Africa
THE Auld Alliance has been creaking at the seams this week in
Pretoria.
The mutual-assistance pact between Scotland and France, cobbled
together, as the historians will tell you, to put the common enemy --
England -- off their game, may well be in its 600th anniversary year but
the restaurant-wrecking pronouncements of French manager Guy Laporte
have irked the Scots to an entirely satisfactory degree.
As was ever going to be the case, this tussle on the high veld between
the Five Nations' rivals is the glamour tie of the pool.
Laporte's twice-repeated assertion that the tartan tyros have been
banned from Pretoria eateries because of loutish behaviour -- a charge
which must be thrown out of court due to a marked lack of evidence --
has served merely to add spice to a contest for which, really, no added
flavouring was required.
If Scotland win today, then they will meet Ireland or Wales in the
quarter-final at Durban. Defeat will see them squaring up to the All
Blacks next weekend in Pretoria. The same goes for France, therefore
both sides have incentive enough to come out on top.
As everyone should know by now, and if you don't then you haven't been
paying attention, Scotland take the field with the psychological
advantage over the Tricolours.
Was it only three-and-a-bit months ago that Gavin Hastings and his
merry men recorded that epic 23-21 win over France in Paris? How time
flies in this seemingly never-ending season of riveting rugby.
It was Scotland's first win in Paris for 26 years and how well that
statistic travels will be answered today at the Loftus Versfeld stadium.
There is no doubt that Scotland have the wherewithal to win again.
Gavin Hastings -- the hero of Parc des Princes -- is still in
record-breaking fettle and if the magic touch does not desert him when
it is needed most, then, on current form and with just a touch of
hyperbole, he has the capacity to win the game virtually single-handed.
The French have not been on song this past fortnight in South Africa.
They beat Ivory Coast 54-18 and Tonga 38-10. By comparison Scotland
racked up 89 points without reply against the Ivoriennes and saw off
Tonga 41-5.
Lies, damned lies and statistics maybe -- and Hastings said much the
same thing yesterday -- but, leaving aside the scorelines, Scotland's
performances against Tonga and Ivory Coast have been much more
satisfying than those of the Frenchmen.
Twelve of the French side who played in that marvellous Parc des
Princes game on February 18 are back on parade today and they will
surely carry with them the burden of doubt that if the Scots could
scupper them on their own patch then the same thing can happen in
Pretoria.
So far as the Scottish line-up is concerned, the principal missing
ingredient from Paris is the flair of the injured Gregor Townsend.
Scotland, then, have had to make the best of a bad job and, in their
wisdom, the selectors have decided that a centre partnership of Scott
Hastings and Graham Shiel is the optimum pairing.
Ian Jardine was the other centre in Paris. He was desperately unlucky
to have succumbed to severe facial injury in the dying moments of the
game, and the selectors have reckoned he is still a bit ring-rusty.
The locks today will be Damian Cronin and Doddie Weir, who did not
train yesterday due to a stomach bug which the medics are sure will have
cleared up by today.
Stewart Campbell was the loser here, the Cronin-Campell Paris
partnership being first disrupted by Cronin's arm injury at Parc des
Princes and Weir the Paris replacement usurping Campbell in Pretoria.
Yesterday, as the Scots completed their preparations at the
Harlequins' ground, Gavin Hastings conceded that they did, indeed, hold
the psychological advantage over their opponents.
''There is no reason to think otherwise,'' he said. ''That was a
tremendous win for us in Paris but we are in no way underestimating the
French out here and neither do I take much from the fact that we have
scored more against Tonga and Ivory Coast then they have done.
''But we have beaten France once this season already and we can beat
them again.''
Hastings wins his sixtieth cap today and that was the voice of
experience -- Grand Slams, Lions et al -- talking.
Somewhat lower down the scale of experience, Bryan Redpath -- winning
his thirteenth cap -- was in no doubt that today's encounter will be the
biggest game of his life.
''If we can cut out the errors and work hard on our defence and Craig
and I can establish a platform that we can attack them from then we can
beat them again.''
The Melrose partnership of Chalmers and Redpath has grown into one of
the principal building blocks of this Scottish side.
Basil's whiplash service will be invaluable in giving Chalmers -- who
incidentally becomes the Greenyards' most capped son today -- that
split-second advantage which makes all the difference between success or
failure.
Last night the Scottish squad were due to attend a private screening
of the film Rob Roy, which has not yet opened in South Africa. Some of
that tartan swash and buckle transferred from the big screen to the
greatest show on grass would do very nicely today. Very nicely, indeed.

COLIN Montgomerie, the holder, took a three-stroke lead yesterday
after the second round of the European tournament at the Forest of Arden
club -- a Scot in the vanguard of the English Open sponsored by
Murphy's, brewers of Irish stout, a paradoxical situation developed by
his score of 63, nine under par, a record, and the fourth such of his
career.
In beating Costantino Rocca's two-year-old mark by a stroke,
Montgomerie, who has so far not achieved the rare feat of winning the
same event in successive years, went into the third round on 132, 12
under par over the 7102-yard course. But with 36 holes to play,
Montgomerie is too knowing in the ways of this game to indulge in
premature congratulation.
Montgomerie's immediate rivals include several within six strokes
capable of usurping him of the #108,330 first prize. Philip Walton, his
closest pursuer, has already won this season -- more than Montgomerie
has accomplished -- and the close presence of Jose Rivero, Peter Senior,
Peter Baker, Barry Lane, Andrew Coltart, Sandy Lyle, and Michael
Campbell would serve to concentrate any mind.
Montgomerie disclosed that after the disappointing finish to his first
round he had holed 100 putts of two feet in succession on the practice
green, a discipline he learned the hard way a decade ago when he was in
college in America. ''If you missed, you began again, so the last 30
putts became really important,'' he explained.
''It improves confidence, knowing that if you hit the first putt a
little too firmly, you can still hole the return,'' Montgomerie added.
''I have to stop after about 50 putts because my back aches.''
Unimpressed by criticism of his weight -- he admits to some 16 stone --
Montgomerie declared: ''I don't care, as long as the putts keep going
in.''
That they regularly did in halves of 32-31, during which Montgomerie
made six birdies and two eagles -- the first at the 511-yard seventeenth
(his eighth) with a 40-foot putt and the other at the 560-yard third
where he struck a driver from the fairway -- one of his favourite shots
-- to 30 feet. The only blot on the escutcheon came at the sixteenth,
where his drive hit a tree and he took three putts.
The Scottish interest was reinforced by Coltart, who lost no time in
recovering from the setback of having missed the cut in the PGA
championship. His 68, comprising four birdies and no bogeys, placed him
in position to win his first European event, should those ahead falter,
to add to last year's Australian PGA and Scottish PGA championships.
Lyle, a stroke behind his compatriot, also had a 68 and in three of
his last four tournaments -- in the other he missed the cut -- he has
had eight rounds under the par of 72. This is a seam of form whose
consistency has eluded Lyle for what seems like half a lifetime,
sufficient to raise in him thoughts of a Ryder Cup return.
For the rest, Craig Cassells, the Aberdeen-based English professional,
collected #12,500 -- described by the sponsor as the equivalent of
13,750 pints of their product -- for holing his No.2-iron shot at the
210-yard eighteenth, almost as good as finishing tenth in the tournament
and as such a hugely disproportionate reward.

COVENTRY City manager Ron Atkinson is ready to move for Scotland
midfielder Billy McKinlay following Dundee United's relegation.
Atkinson looks almost certain to meet the Tannadice asking price of
around #1.5m, but he will face strong opposition from FA Cup winners
Everton.
The new Tannadice manager, Billy Kirkwood, knows he will have to
handle transfer bids from top teams after the club's drop into the first
division, and is unlikely to stand in the way of someone such as
McKinlay, who has spent almost 10 years at the club after signing one of
the now notorious long-term deals.
Today McKinlay will join up with the Scotland squad for a training
session before they head for the Faroes and their European Championship
clash next week. He will play in that game, but Atkinson has recognised
his talent so early that another international on a group of islands in
the North Atlantic will make no difference to the bid he is now
preparing.
Meanwhile, at Goodison, striker Duncan Ferguson has been underlining
his former team-mate's qualities to his manager, Joe Royle, who has
already decided the talents of the Tayside star would add an extra
element to his midfield.
United have offered the player a new deal to remain at the club, but
McKinlay has put in motion a court case arguing against the length of
his contract. That suggests that the club would be ready to listen to
offers -- and the player has made it clear already that he wants to
leave.
There seems little doubt that next season McKinlay will be playing in
the Premiership and Kirkwood will be spending the money he gets in
trying to revive the glory days the club used to enjoy.
However, the manager's first attempt at strengthening his playing
squad appears to have floundered, as he has failed in a bid to sign
former Rangers full back Chris Vinnicombe.
Kirkwood was ready to launch a #200,000 bid for the 24-year-old
Burnley defender, but the English club have made it clear he is not for
sale.
Transfer target McKinlay will train with the Scottish squad today and
tomorrow and then head for the Faroes, where goalkeeper Jim Leighton
will captain the side in a match which could decide whether or not the
Scots go to the finals in England.
* STAN Collymore has at last been let loose by England coach Terry
Venables, who has named the #8.5m-rated Nottingham Forest striker to
face Japan today at Wembley.
But there is no place for Paul Gascoigne, who must hope to come on as
a substitute to win his thirtieth cap.
ENGLAND -- Flowers (Blackburn), Neville (Manchester United), Pearce
(Nottingham Forest), Batty (Blackburn), Scales (Liverpool), Unsworth
(Everton), Platt (Sampdoria), Beardsley (Newcastle), Collymore
(Nottingham Forest), Shearer (Blackburn), Anderton (Tottenham).

WEW, the Glasgow-based chain of discount clothing stores, yesterday
appointed Richard Boland, a senior executive with the Sears retail
group, to fill the vacant post of managing director, writes ROBERT
POWELL.
Mr Boland, 44, will join WEW on July 31 after quitting his present
post as managing director of Freemans', the home shopping division of
Sears.
WEW chairman and chief executive Peter Carr has been running WEW
single-handed since Ian Grabiner, the previous managing director, left
in August last year as part of the company's restructuring process.
After Mr Boland's arrival, Mr Carr intends to take a back seat,
looking after long-term strategy, while the new managing director looks
after the day-to-day running of WEW's chain of 78 stores.
WEW, which stands for What Everyone Wants, has undergone a sea-change
since Mr Carr became chairman in September 1993 and led the group into a
major restructuring process that has returned it to profitability. The
company changed its name from Amber Day and shed its manufacturing and
importing subsidiaries, while increasing its number of retail outlets.
This helped WEW achieve a #3.2m pre-tax profit in the year to July
1994 after a loss of #2m previously.
Pre-tax profits grew to #5.8m at the half-year in January on turnover
#72m. But Mr Carr said profits would grow more slowly during the
remainder of the financial year.

SCOTTISH Provident is part of a new venture aimed at selling
life-assurance products in Russia through a newly-created Russian
insurance company, to be known as Principal.
The Edinburgh-based life office is investing a total of US$1m
(#630,000) in a UK company called Russian Life Management (RLM), in
which the other partners will be Employers Reassurance International --
a subsidiary of the major international reinsurance company -- and
Cornwallis Associates, a firm of consultants with experience of working
in Russia.
In turn, RLM will invest in a UK-based specialist-purpose investment
vehicle, Russia Life Investments (RLI), where the other investors will
be the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Russian
Investment Bank, a Luxembourg-based investment fund managed by
Framlington Investment Management. As well as acting as an investment
vehicle, RLM will also provide some management services to Principal as
it will take some time to build up local expertise in certain key areas.
Building on the experience brought to the venture by its various
shareholders, it is expected that Principal will be well-placed to play
an active role in the development of the Russian life-market, and
influence the development of Russia's capital markets, as these progress
along Western European lines.
In addition to the Western investors behind the project, through RLI
some of Principal's shares will be held by a Russian investor, the
Independent Trade Union of Servicemen of the Russian Federation (ITUS),
a union which looks after the welfare of Russia's former military
officers. At first retired military officers introduced through ITUS
will be the main target for Principal's products.
The next step in the formation of Principal will be to apply to the
Russian Insurance authorities for a licence to transact life assurance
business in Russia.
Once this has been done, Principal plans to have access to a total
capital of $5.25m (#3.4m) with in the first year of operations,
including Scottish Provident's contribution. This is expected to be well
in excess of that available to most of the local competition.
Norval Bryson, Scottish Provident's deputy group-managing director,
said: ''While investing in a new Russian company as part of a consortium
represents something of a departure from our normal way of doing things,
we feel the opportunity to become involved, at a very early stage and
for a relatively modest outlay, in a market which has huge growth
potential, justifies a special approach on our part.''

AN attempt to force the board of Northern Electric to allow Trafalgar
House to renew its takeover bid at not less than #9.50 a share was
heavily defeated yesterday. Of about 800 shareholders at an
extraordinary general meeting at Newcastle upon Tyne city hall, less
than 30 supported the motion.
Northern Electric chairman David Morris also revealed that following
proxy votes by big institutions there were almost 39 million votes
against the motion compared with 22 million for it -- a defeat of almost
two-to-one.
Trafalgar House is being prevented from making another bid for the
time being by Stock Exchange rules in the wake of a power prices probe
by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator. But it
could renew its assault quickly if Northern agreed.
The leader of efforts to have the ban lifted, ex-US marine Guy
Wyser-Pratte, argued that Trafalgar House might lose interest in making
a new offer before the board granted its permission.
He also feared that even if Professor Littlechild's review is
completed by the end of this month, as expected, there is a risk of a
further investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which
could extend the period of uncertainty.
If that happened, shareholders might not be able to consider a new
offer from Trafalgar House and in his view they should not be deprived
of the opportunity to consider such a bid any longer.

ABENEFICIAL spin-off from the recent prolonged national reminiscence
over years past spent in conflict and comradeship is that one falls
readily to musing and, inevitably, turns from the past to the future. No
doubt now what we were doing half a century ago but what about 50 years
on? Given that such speculation can be of interest only to the very
young I have settled for five years hence, the end of a century that saw
two world wars and technological advance without parallel.
When we are asked by government -- on present showing a Labour model
of the democratic process -- what we want from life after the Millennium
Fund has been squandered on making us believe our heads are not our own,
will we be ready with an answer, a shopping list of our imperatives for
civilised behaviour and living more gracious than we enjoy today? Who
knows but, to do my bit, perhaps claim a footnote in history 105 years
from now, I hereby put forward my tuppence-worth.
Heady stuff this opportunity to seize the hour and shape the day -- a
bit like bunging a quid into the Churchill Lottery and dreaming about
how one will spend his small change. What do I want? What may I have?
Would the extinction of Little Englander attitudes be too much to ask
before we plunge into another dew-washed and re-numbered century, fresh
as paint, unsullied?
Could we set aside the sapping battle for the retention of mushy peas,
warm beer in pints, a devalued currency not one item of which looks as
it did in 1945, and have instead fresh vegetables, cold beer, as we
already drink it from quarter-litre bottles, and a common currency that
is worth carrying around?
Might I ask for a lesser flow of the oxygen of publicity that keeps
politicians endlessly and to such little effect before the public eye --
scoring feeble points off their opponents, promising the moon on a
string, avoiding the question and ignoring the issue, always primed with
a solution and ecstatic with their own performance, quite carried away
by the exuberance of their own verbosity? Could we, please, have Cabinet
Ministers put back in their box and back benchers take a Trappist vow?
MAY we be let into the secret agenda of local authorities -- those
controlling the roads in Edinburgh come to mind.Do they truly intend to
have any motor vehicles in the city by the year 2005 or are the pack
mule and sedan chair on the point of making a comeback?
And so to the First Family, that gilded soap of showbiz royals led by
Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and territories,
Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith. Quite so. What
can we look for here is ever more books, TV shows, and legal writs flow
from those uninsured palace rooms not already let out to the gawping
paying public?
May I put in a plea for modest withdrawal from the limelight, a
reduction in the Civil List, less pomp, lessened circumstances, a
seen-but-not-heard approach to duty, and a firmer grip on how their
loyal subjects have to make their way. Settling the Prince of Wales in
his model Lego village, putting Princess Di's phone on hold and Fergie's
toes in lace-up boots with double knots would get the new-look Windsors
off to a cracking start. Should the royals decide to reduce the roll of
the unemployed, a boarding kennel immediately springs to mind for HM,
while Prince Philip's natural grace and celebrated easy manner mark him
out for duty as a traffic warden -- another uniform for his extensive
collection.
While we are at it, could it be made a criminal offence for people to
traffic in phone numbers, income statistics, and hobby interests, such
information being used at present to target the late evening calls that
disrupt dinner, the baby's bath-time, and the simple enjoyment of a gin
and tonic so that some poor wretch, armed with a list and paid by
results, can endeavour to badger you into double glazing,
floor-to-ceiling walls, patios, gazebos and conservatories?
Dearest of all of my desires in this imagined shopping list for
Britain 2000 would be a recognition, never so far a factor of life in
this country, that the decades ahead will belong to the next generation,
not to us. It is children today in primary school who will be wielding
stethoscope or welding torch, bus wheel or classroom chalk by the year
2010. So could we stop, as a nation, talking them down, labelling them
delinquent, calling in question their morals and motives, their ability
to pick up where we left off? A tall order, certainly, for how does one
follow excellence?

OF THE many signs that youth is leaving you faster than a dog on lino,
surely one of the most distressing is the decreasing attention paid to
each successive birthday. Let there be no argument: birthdays get worse
as you get older.
They start off so well too. Before you get to school, birthdays are
all parties, cakes, E-additives, and singing. All your cousins and pals
come round to your house where you spend most of the afternoon running
around in a circle shouting, just before the bit where you redesign the
living room carpet to incorporate a repeating Squashed Dolly Mixture
motif.
Once you're old enough to go to school, the threat of physical harm
somewhat spoils the feeling of anticipation. In some schools,
apparently, the trend was to have your head held down the toilet, and
flushed once for each year. That didn't happen where I went to school.
The state of our school's toilets was such that anyone doing so would
have been up on an attempted murder charge. The lav's were a
microbiologist's dream land, making the culture labs in Portondown look
like a safe place for toddlers to play. If any unsuspecting boffin had
looked down the microscope, they probably would have seen that the
organisms would have evolved to mirror the behaviour surrounding them,
in which case the teeming bugs would have been at various stages of
puberty, standing around smoking, practising swearing, and resetting
stolen Mars bars.
No. Physical damage, rather than germ warfare, was the big birthday
treat at my alma mater (From the latin ''alma'', meaning ''concrete
mess'', and ''mater'' meaning ''Was it that long ago?'').
The birthday celebrant, or ''tosser'' as he was known, would have
three yobs holding each leg, and two holding each arm. After an ironic
chorus of Happy Birthday, his back would be slammed against any hard
surface, for maximum enjoyment scattered with broken glass or assorted
ironmongery. How many workdays are lost annually in the UK by back
problems just because people had had their fifteenth birthday on the
same day as PE? Another one for Watchdog Healthcheck I reckon.
So that's the average teenage birthday for you: you just get a bit
embarrassed about birthday celebrations. There's no way you'd ever
invite any of your friends home, cos that would be a pure brass neck
right? Remembering also that if it became common knowledge that you had
had a birthday, then someone might have given you a retrospective treat.
All-in-all, silence is the best policy regarding schoolday birthdays.
Anyway, once you're 14, you've started asking for clothes and the magic
of the truly pointless present is gone forever.
By the time you're 20, the anniversary of your birth has become a time
for rolling home incoherent at an ordinary late hour. If you happen to
be a student, as I was when I was 20, then it's a condition of
graduation that there should be at least two pieces of equipment stolen
from a road works (including at least one traffic cone, to be worn on
your head once annually) kept in your room as birthday mementoes.
Students, like rugby fans, tend to walk a fine line between being
boisterous and being criminals. What would be yobbish behaviour in a
normal person, passes for ''high spirits'' for those in further
education. Perhaps Duncan Ferguson's appeal team should concentrate on
getting him a place at Uni: then the judge couldn't be outraged. No, he
would simply dismiss the case and take Big Dunc for a pint at the
Mandela/Rolf Harris/REM Beer Bar, and all would be well.
Anyone who's ever been in a student union after 6pm knows exactly what
I mean. If a group of plumbers were in a bar and decided that they
wanted to drink a yard of beans with their trousers round their ankles,
while singing a song about two dozen virgins on a day trip to the
Highlands, then they would be considered a danger to society, and left
to consider their japes in the cold cell light of the local rozzer stop.
If, however, they were 20 years younger, had a couple of Highers, and
had just failed Higher Ordinary Moral Phil, then it becomes a good
laugh, and a natural part of their development.
Birthdays after the twenty-fifth mark a turning point, as most people
have jobs that, unlike being a student, are not consistent with indecent
exposure and simultaneous breach of the peace. By 30, if you've not got
kids, an impending birthday has you feeling old and fretting about your
own mortality. If you've got kids, you spend the day wishing you had the
time to be sitting around worrying about your mortality.
If was my birthday again recently, being older than 30 and having
kids, the first thing I found out was that my birthday was only an
excuse for all children within a two-mile radius repeatedly to ''blow
out the candles'', as a front to spraying large amounts of toddler
spittle over the Lion King cake they ''knew'' you wanted. Experience has
taught me that to get the present you want you have to strike early.
Leaving it to the kids have meant me getting a Power Ranger and Mickey
Mouse pillowslip.
In an attempt to hold back my sense of impending middle age, I asked
weeks ago for a trendy tape. It wasn't that trendy but, having noticed
that they'd won all sorts of awards, I reckoned that the Oasis tape
would be quite palatable. So I got it: one of the most critically
acclaimed albums of the past few years.
Hmm. Sorry, what was that? Did I like it? Well, to be honest, as far
as I could tell, it was guitars, no tune, and lyrics I couldn't hear.
The one thing you can say about REM: they sing nonsense, but at least
you can hear the words to know that it's pretentious guff. One thing's
for sure, though, there's no way I'm going to stop listening to
O-bloody-asis until I do like it. I remember getting many of the trendy
LPs in my youth, and, like lager, peer pressure ensures that you stick
at it long enough to ''like'' it, or at least bear it. Failing to try to
like my new tape would be too much of an admission of age.
What do birthdays hold for the future? I don't know, but I'm certain
that as soon as I'm at the kind of stage where people send you cards
saying ''X Years Young Today!'', then it's time to chuck it. It's a
ridiculous statement, almost as stupid as saying I'm 18 stones light.
It's exactly the kind of stupid thing that the DJs would say, but then
again, they probably liked the Oasis LP first time round.

Joseph Bradley argues that immigrants and their descendants should not
be prevented from exhibiting their Irish or Asian identities.
DESPITE the undoubted decline of religious adherence in Scotland in
recent decades, religious identity remains a strong force in our
society. The existence of denominational schools, ethno-religious
football clubs, secret and semi-secret societies, the influence of
Ireland, and particularly of Northern Ireland, on west central Scotland,
and a widespread Catholic perception of discrimination in areas of
employment all point to the influence of religion over and above church
attendance.
As with many other societies, in Scotland religious questions can
evoke antagonism, prejudice, silence, cultural and political
correctness, and even academic and journalistic censorship. Indeed, it
can be difficult for some authors to challenge the dominant orthodoxy.
In the past there has been little consensus as to the origins and
content of religious identities in Scotland. One of the most recent
examples of this confusion can be found in the BBC national news
reporting of Glasgow Rangers' signing of a Roman Catholic footballer,
Maurice Johnston, in 1989. The significance of this event was explained
by reference to sectarianism in Glasgow. The origins of this
sectarianism were located in the First World War period when the Govan
shipyards in Glasgow experienced an influx of Protestant, Belfast, ship
workers. This migration was given as the cause of religious tension in
Scotland. It was in fact an uninformed and erroneous piece of news
casting. None the less, it was also a reflection of the poverty of
research on religious identity in Scotland.
Certainly, the explanations of these ethno-religious identities and
the consequent cleavage can be firmly rooted in earlier history. Indeed,
a historical perspective is a prerequisite for any contemporary
understanding. Thus, in historical terms, Protestantism and Catholicism
respectively shaped both the Scottish and Irish characters. As one
author states, in Scotland ''Presbyterianism was not just a state
religion but, for more than three centuries, defined the Scots to one
another and to the rest of the world''. Another writer offers a similar
perspective on the Irish: ''Irish Catholicism has been more than the
official pronouncements of the hierarchy: it is a set of values, a
culture, a historical tradition, a view on the world, a disposition of
mind and heart, a loyalty, an emotional psychology -- and a
nationalism.''
One of the traditional focuses of religious identity and sectarianism
has been the football environment. The historical development of
football in Scotland has often paralleled the evolution of aspects of
relations between indigenous Protestant and immigrant Irish Catholics.
The anti-Catholicism often displayed by Scots in the post-Reformation
period was added to with the arrival of large-scale Catholic immigration
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Ethno-religious tensions
became part of the way of life for both Protestants and Catholics in
areas of Catholic settlement.
When football clubs began to emerge in the latter part of the
nineteenth century many acquired identities which mirrored the ethnic
and religious distinctions of Scottish society. These clubs derived
their identities from a variety of social, cultural, and political
features of Scottish Protestantism and Irish Catholicism. Glasgow
Rangers and Celtic football clubs quickly became the biggest and most
successful expressions of the cleavage that developed.
Football in Scotland has acquired similar attributes to the game in
Spain, Northern Ireland, and in major parts of the English sport; soccer
has become politicised as well as socially and culturally symbolic.
Football (and sport generally) does not exist in isolation from the
rest of society. It is not an isolated phenomenon and for many people in
Scotland, football has become the main focus for the ethno-religious
contours of Scottish life. It is often the context through which the
hostilities involved in these identities become open. It has been
observed that sport has no intrinsic value structure, but it is a ready
and flexible vehicle through which ideological associations can be
reinforced.
Not only have many features of religious identity in Scotland been
avoided or ignored in serious study, but this is compounded by the way
the largest immigrant group in Scotland, Catholics from Ireland, has had
little research attention paid to it. Only since the 1970s, with the
small though significant number of works of Aspinwall, McCaffrey,
Gallagher Devine, et al, has the story of the Irish in Scotland began to
be uncovered.
Classic textbooks in Scottish schools, colleges, and universities have
failed to address the Irish in Scotland. Ireland itself has largely been
avoided in Scottish academic study while most contemporary references in
newspapers have been restricted to questions of recent manifestations of
violence and militant Irish nationalism. Why have the Irish been
ignored? Why has so much of Irish and Catholic social, cultural, and
politican life been constantly tied up with the terminology of
sectarianism?
Like many others in society, Irish Catholics in Scotland can possess
more than one identity and even several layers of identity. This
community can be either Irish or Scottish in certain settings, but on
the whole they find it difficult to define and articulate their
identity. Recent survey material shows that although most church-going
Catholics believed their roots to be Irish, a high proportion of them
reported their heritage as Scottish. Identity itself can often be a
source of confusion, inconsistency, and even anxiety. Individuals may
find it difficult to define the content and origins of their identity.
Irish identity in Scotland has been shaped by the immigrant's
experiences.
Many of the Irish, like immigrants in other countries, thought the
best way to survive was to keep a low profile. Celtic Football Club has
assumed the dominating presence in the Irish cultural scene. In the
context of the experience of Irish immigrants, Celtic has developed a
strong medium for expressing an identity marginalised and sometimes
suppressed in Scotland. In fact, Celtic reflects a definition of the
Irish identity that is unique among the Irish diaspora. It is viewed by
many Catholics as both a link to Ireland and as a defining
characteristic which helps to distinguish them from the wider
population. It is also a politicised club (as are some other clubs in
Scotland) in the same way as Athletico Bilbao, San Sebastian, and
Barcelona in Spain. Through its politicisation and its evolution as a
dominant aspect of Irish Catholic secular culture and identity, its
presence has stimulated a reaction in other clubs in Scotland,
particularly Glasgow Rangers.
It has been argued that cultural and political pressures have been a
part of the wider process of incorporation entailing pressure on the
Irish to deny their Irishness or to be invisible and silent about their
identity. The efforts by the indigenous Catholic church in Britain to
lessen and restrict the Irish identity of their immigrant Catholic flock
have been seen as successful to the point at which the Irish joke (in
which the Irish are portrayed as stupid and thick) is acceptable and
there is a widespread association of violence and the IRA with all
things Irish.
Such stereotyping, together with uninformative reporting of Irish
affairs and the existence of repressive legislation which engenders a
fear and restricts the opportunities for protest or debate, contributes
to the diminution of the Irish identity for the Irish and their
offspring in Britain and Scotland. Self-perceptions of Irishness are
thus devalued. All this reinforces a process of conformity and
assimilation (rather than integration).
In Scotland, this process was reflected in the cases of Bishop Murdoch
and Bishop Scott and in the ''The Free Press'' controversy of the
nineteenth century. A conservative, Catholic community, which referred
little to its heritage, was one of the social and political goals of the
hierarchy. In the past the teaching of subjects other than religion
differed very little in Catholic elementary schools. Thus, if the
British and/or Scottish identity was being reinforced via the education
system for the indigenous population, it invariably had a negative
effect upon the Irish identity. The education system has not only
positively assisted integration, but has facilitated assimilation.
The former Conservative Cabinet Minister, Norman Tebbit, demonstrated
the ''assimilist'' argument as recently as 1989, when he suggested a
novel type of cricket test. Asian immigrants' integration could be
tested by which cricket team they supported: England or Pakistan/India.
He went on to suggest that those who continued to cheer for India or
Pakistan were wanting in Britishness . . . that the only satisfactory
way to be an Asian in Britain was to cease being Asian.
The cricket test, in its form as a ''football test'', has also been
applied regularly by the Scottish/British press in the 1980s and 1990s
as it became common for second and third-generation Irish to represent
and support the Republic of Ireland in international football.
Depreciative comment has constantly characterised the success of the
Irish football team. The logic which underpins such an argument was
exposed by a respected British journalist:
''The assertion that we are one people has always been a lie used to
justify the unjust dominance of one group (whites, Protestants or
Anglo-Saxons, for example) over the society as a whole.''
Such examples could be repeated many times and reflect a
well-developed broad ideological and attitudinal position. This has been
a long historical process, tied up with British colonialism and the
Irish identity, as is well reflected in a quote from Sir William Parsons
about the Irish in 1625.
For Parsons, only the depreciation and destruction of Ireland's
cultural traits and identity could result in the Irish being absorbed
into the Crown's realm: ''We must change their course of government,
apparel, manner of holding land, their language and habit of life.''
We cannot hope to understand the Irish in Scotland (or indeed
Scotland) without reference to these forces which have been crucial to
shaping the Irish as a people; forces which are also important for
maintaining and creating identity in the present.
Although in some societies identity can be strengthened in the face of
antagonism, the conclusions of some researchers suggest that in Britain,
large numbers of Irish people have underplayed their Irish, and in some
circumstances Catholic, identity. Likewise, while I was carrying out the
empirical part of the research for my book* some Catholic interviewees
expressed their inhibitions in calling their children by Irish/Catholic
forenames. In some instances the Irish part of their identity was too
difficult for them to recognise, they were inclined more towards a
Scottish name or a name that had little to do with a conscious identity.
In other cases, however, the reasons that ''my child would never get a
job'', or ''I don't want to be bigoted'', were forwarded as the
rationale for such decisions. For many Catholics in Scotland, the Irish
identity is a submerged one.
Although our world is complex, in that we can ''inhabit'' a number of
different identities, share others, throw off obvious ones, and even
have others imposed upon us, the undermining and unenlightened nature of
research into contemporary Irish identity in Scotland reflects some of
the problems Scotland has with its own identities. If new definitions
are to evolve, then clearly there must be accommodation for those of a
different origin and culture (including many thousands of Asians and
other peoples).
Even if the Scottish identity is to remain an inherently Protestant
one in character (albeit it would appear to be increasingly ''secular
Protestant''), then a similar accommodation remains. This should evolve
if Scotland is to be recognised as a modern multi-cultural and plural
society.
With the question of the Northern Ireland conflict possibly being
opened up for a more informative debate as a step towards a long-term
solution, then this may also cease to contribute to the persistence of
some of the worst aspects of ''sectarianism'' within Scottish society.

* THE great British cup of tea and that early morning lifesaver
coffee, they're just not natural, according to food scientists. They say
humans have to learn to love them.
According to the institute of Food Research, we are not born with a
liking for tea or coffee. In contrast to sweet drinks and foods which
babies relish, coffee and tea are usually rejected by tots on first
taste.
Eventually, claim the IFR scientists, many people just learn to love
them, by developing what they call a ''positive appreciation'' of their
flavours. But what makes the TV couple learn to like Gold Blend, or how
does High Road get to run on Scottish Blend?
Research shows evidence that the consumption of caffeine-rich drinks
may be maintained to escape from the consequences of caffeine
withdrawal, which might explain why for some of us, that first taste of
morning coffee after a whole night without it is so miraculous.
Another possibility is that we like caffeine-containing drinks because
swilling them down is reinforced by the psycho-active effects of the
drug. Caffeine is believed to stimulate the central nervous system,
which is why it can be difficult to sleep after a few cups of strong
roast. It quickens reaction time, improves vigilance and concentration.
It also increases the feelings of alertness and energy.
So, to stay on top, we keep giving ourselves a fix.

* THE world's most advanced ocean drilling ship will be lowering the
gang-plank in Leith next month with an invitation to come aboard. The
Joides Resolution makes its two-day port of call at Imperial Dock en
route from the Med where scientists studied the growth of underwater
mountains in the Arctic to investigate climate change.
The ship has 12 labs on seven levels and does major research into
almost every ''ology'' to do with rock and the earth as part of the
Ocean Drilling Program, the world's largest collaborative earth sciences
research endeavour. In the past 10 years, scientists from 30 countries
have worked on the program to help piece together the jigsaw of
geological history. Free guided tours of the research station, from July
4-6, can be arranged through the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh,
telephone 0131 667 1000.
The BGS in West Mains Road will also be staging an interactive ocean
drilling program display with video presentations, and a working rotary
drill bit. The free exhibition runs from June to December.
On July 4, Robert Kidd, professor of Marine Geoscience at the
University of Wales, will deliver a lecture on the latest seabed
discoveries and what the future holds. He'll be talking about his 25
years mapping the sea floor and discoveries of mud ''dunes'' and mud
volcanoes the size of Vesuvius. For free tickets (limited), telephone
0131-225 7534.

* DON'T look now, but you could be under surveillance . . . by the Tom
Thumb of spy cameras. The TVX camera is the smallest we've ever seen at
Frontiers. It's less than one centimetre in size and it's literally a
camera on a silicon chip. TVX International have developed the
technology as a security system which can guard homes, offices and
shops.
The revolutionary micro-tech, which can work in low light or complete
darkness is likely to prove a deadly little foe to break-in artists by
capturing their image electronically, allowing instant identification
and providing evidence for the courts. TVX says its system greatly
boosts the chances of arresting intruders. Here's how it works:
When an intruder breaks in, they automatically trigger the alarm
system. The mini-camera captures the first of four images taken at
one-second intervals, completely unobtrusively, in the protected area.
The pictures are stored digitally direct from the lens by the computer
chip brain. Even before the last shot is taken, the system's modem is
already dialling a number to send the intruder's image instantly down
the line to a monitoring centre.
There, the operator can examine the picture on screen and decide if
the alarm is genuine.
Meanwhile, the crook, unaware of being snapped red-handed in the
infra-red, has been captured . . . and it's likely to be captured once
again by the police who have been alerted via the security monitor.
TVX says its scanning system offers a number of benefits from the
micro-technology, including the fact that it can accommodate up to 24
miniature cameras on the system which can offer protection to sizeable
complexes.
With the prospect of an easy arrest, police have the incentive to
respond more quickly, adding to the chances of a successful arrest and
conviction.
The company is proud of what it describes as a ''camera on a chip''.
The heart of the imaging system is a micro-chip, no bigger than a
postage stamp, to a specially designed lens is bonded. The result is a
tiny camera which can be incorporated into new or even existing alarm
systems on a mounting that is so unobtrusive it could be mistaken for an
air freshener. An infra-red light capability emits an invisible beam to
illuminate the target image which is then picked up by the lens and
circuitry. The lenses can achieve a 90 degree field of view and the
monitoring stations have a choice of receiving images only when
something happens -- when it happens of course -- at pre-programmed
intervals, or continually updated pictures from different cameras in the
system.
If the police are guaranteed a picture of a baddy in the middle of
committing a crime, it's certain to capture their interest. It would
surely help them capture their man.

Just about anyone can ride a bike, they say. Elizabeth Westcott puts
that theory to a severe test and sets out on a cycling adventure.
IT'S eight o'clock on Saturday morning, and a small huddle of people
are standing outside the King's Theatre, Edinburgh. We are about to
board the Bike Bus for an excursion to Pitlochry, to enjoy a quiet day
of cycling round Loch Rannoch, Loch Tummel, or mountain-biking through
Rannoch Forest.
Our host, Harry Henniker, a slim, wiry man with a ponytail, is busy
nimbly loading bicycles on to the trailer. He, like many of the others,
wears purpose-designed cycle wear; at the very least my fellow
passengers have donned comfortable elasticised trousers. Except me. I am
wearing jeans, the first indication perhaps of my novice status when it
comes to cycling. Nor have I brought gloves, but hopefully I won't need
them; despite dire weather predictions the sky is cloudless, a soft,
expansive egg-shell blue.
Harry Henniker has been running his Bike Bus tours for four years,
ever since redundancy put an end to his 25-year career at British
Telecom. He rediscovered cycling when financial circumstances forced him
to sell his car, but it wasn't until much later that the notion of the
Bike Bus occurred to him.
''There's a big problem with people finding places to cycle near the
cities. Once upon a time a big group of cyclists could use British Rail
to get places -- you could fit 20 to 30 bikes in the guard's van. But
new rules mean that only two cycles are allowed on at a time.''
These rules spelled bad news for cyclists, many of whom don't have
cars or lack bike racks. Harry Henniker's bus will take cyclists to
picturesque, isolated locations where they can choose from a variety of
different routes. He offers day trips, cycling weekends, and for July
has planned a 12-day cycling expedition.
''One of the best things about cycling is that it's so accessible,''
Henniker said. ''Just about anyone knows how to ride a bike, and you can
enjoy it from day one, and even more as you get fit -- those
intimidating hills become easy after a while.''
''Just about anyone'' certainly describes my fellow passengers and
myself. There are two friendly mothers-to-be (not obviously pregnant,
but I learnt the good news from the other cyclists), a tall, lone man
whose rich accent I can't quite place, Henniker's lodger and fellow
bus-driver Fiona, another couple, a single parent and her 10-year-old
daughter, three lads from Livingstone clad in groovy cycling gear right
down to special clips on their shoes, my husband, myself, and a Scottish
Heritage lecturer who assures us he is 60 although he doesn't look a day
older than 45. I saw his bike being loaded earlier, a big, old-fashioned
all-steel Raleigh, circa 1954. (''Heavy as hell, but terribly
comfortable'' he informed me.)
We're each provided with a map and a description of the different
paths we can take. (Henniker produces these maps himself, using the
graphics on his computer and a laminating machine.) Several of the
cyclists are dropped off in Pitlochry, and the rest of us taken further
to Loch Rannoch, where we disembark. The sky has darkened and there is a
sharp, pre-snow chill in the air. ''It's not cold, it's bracing''
somebody said, grinning at me as I button up my coat and my husband
scoots off to pull a pair of jeans over his shorts. I am going to have
to ask Harry if he has a spare pair of gloves, afer all.
We choose the easiest looking route, a 22-mile cycle around the loch,
and we are away, but not before I try out the brakes with a few loops
around the Bike Bus. My confidence returns, along with a familiar sense
of exhilaration; I am a long way from the suburban cycle culture of my
teenage years, but I remember the sense of speed, the rush of air, the
sound of the wheels whirring, the slight discomfort of the saddle. As my
husband zooms ahead, rapidly becoming a blue speck in the distance, I
pedal dreamily, rarely interrupted by a passing car, enjoying the
occasional sounds made by the wind and birds but most of all the
silence.
Cycling offers its own particular pleasure. More immediate than the
enclosed atmosphere of a car, it also covers more distance than walking
which means seeing a greater variety of scenery. City-dwellers seeking
an experience of the pastoral would not be disappointed; we pass a
gorgeous blue-stone farmhouse, drenched in the red and ochre of
geraniums and wild daffodils. Wide green meadows are filled with grazing
sheep and gambolling spring lambs with their ridiculous matchstick limbs
poking out of cotton-wool bodies.
Further along is a dense, mossy forest, with sunlit emerald patches
where the branches part, and recently fallen trees exposing their mesh
of roots and soil. Every now and then we cross a bridge, and look down
at the river feeding the loch, with all its frothy, fast-flowing drama.
Why don't I cycle more often, I think to myself, as I sail past an old
stone church and watch two men decked out in kilts walking up the path.
The atmosphere of a car seems claustrophobic by comparison; besides, how
can the occupants ever truly learn the landscape without feeling its
undulations beneath them?
Philosophising about learning the landscape is all very well, but when
I reach the first (and only) serious hill I am reminded of the comforts
cars offer. What was wrong with our pudgy, sedentary lifestyle? My
muscles plead, as I toil my way up, uncomfortably aware of blood and
oxygen, sweat steaming up my limbs and back. But the downhill glide,
which seemed to last forever, was worth it. One thing I soon decide is
that I am definitely a downhill cyclist.
We stop by the loch to eat our packed lunch, enjoying its tranquil
mood. The vast, pewter expanse glints in the diffused light, its waters
lapping at the white-pebbled shoreline. I notice the trees have a
curious, curly quality to them; the twigs of the grey branches, denuded
of foliage, taper into pasta-like spirals.
We cycle back to the pick-up point with an hour to spare, watching
cricketers walk back to a distant manor house after a match, and passing
a wedding procession on the way. We retire to the pub, joining several
others of the group to discuss our day over a few beers and crips. As
one cyclist, Margaret Kuczera, points out, one of the benefits of the
Bike Bus is meeting other people -- and having a drink without worrying
about driving home.
Violet Tate and her 10-year-old daughter, Lindsay, are among the first
back, having thoroughly enjoyed the experience. For Violet, who doesn't
own a car, the Bike Bus provides her with a way of getting out of the
city for some real cycling.
''It means we can do something other than cycle around the Edinburgh
cycle-paths,'' says Violet. ''It's very reasonably priced, I think, #20
for the two of us, when hiring a car would be #25, plus organising a
cycle rack and paying for petrol. ''The Bike Bus gives us a nice day
out.''
Although Lindsay found the day tiring, she said the countryside was
more interesting than the city.
Recreational cyclist Jim McCarthy (owner of the all-steel Raleigh)
thinks the Bike Bus is both economic and convenient. ''I'm not a car
owner, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to get out of the
cities. This is great. I use cycling for exercise and fun. What is
rather shocking to young people is being overtaken by a 60-year-old!''
We eventually all clamber back onto the bus. My muscles and bones
steeped in a penetrating but healthy fatigue. We drive to the next
pick-up point and collect Jim Bain, Alistair White, and Jim Cattan, all
virtually gnawing their fingers off with hunger after a vigorous ride.
For them, the cycle around Loch Rannoch was a mere warm-up to more
serious mountain-biking -- a rugged four-mile cross-country climb and
hair-raising descent.
We travel back to Edinburgh amidst a pleasant, sociable buzz of
conversation (''We did 13mph for 39 miles,'' says one of mountain
bikers, from behind me. ''Thirteen miles an hour?'' retorts one of the
mothers-to-be. ''That's nothing!'')
Meanwhile, I chat to Harry Henniker, who tells me about the changes
that have occurred in cycling during the past 15 years. The past-time is
more fashionable now than ever and bikes are being built with fabulous
gadgetry and suspension as a matter of course.
''Cycling suffered for a while there -- it was thought for a long time
that bikes were for people who couldn't afford cars,'' he said. ''Bikes
range in price from #30 to #1500, but while the new technology has
greatly improved the versatility of bikes, at the end of the day it's
your muscles that will get you over that hill.''
Henniker is writing a book -- 101 Cycle Routes in Scotland -- which
has grown naturally out of his excursions across the nation. He knows of
at least two other books being compiled in response to the increased
demand from cyclists.
''Scotland has so many interesting places to cycle,'' he says.
''People have been cycling here for years and they have a lot of
information which is very useful for others. Cyclists are always telling
me about new places.
''On-road and off-road cycling are different pleasures; some want the
challenge of mountain-biking but others simply prefer to cycle away from
traffic. There are nice, smooth paths available -- a group called
Sustrans has been converting old railway lines into cycle paths, which
is an excellent idea.''
One thing I have come to realise, as the world of cycling slides into
focus, is that it is far more than just transport or the hobby of a few
masochistic fanatics. It is a recreational activity which improves
aerobic fitness as much as swimming or running, while at the same time
offering a great outdoors opportunity for families or groups of friends.
As cyclist Jim Bain points out, cycling is both a physical challenge
and a chance to enjoy different places and scenery. ''Cycling gets you
away from the city. It improves your blood circulation and it relieves
depression. I think everyone should have the experience.''
HOW TO AVOID COMING A CROPPER
CONDITIONS for cycling are ideal during the mild Scottish summer, but
if you are planning an expedition and you're new to cycling, or
returning to it after a long break, there are a few basic precautions to
consider.
First, you cannot wheel your bike out of the shed after years of
disuse or perhaps the occasional jaunt to the shops on a sunny day, dust
off the cobwebs, and expect to cycle 50 miles. Before cycling any
distance, you should make certain your bicycle is mechanically sound.
According to Harry Henniker, who runs the Bike Bus tours, often cyclists
forget the importance of bicycle maintenance.
''I had someone on one of my tours who brought his own bike and hadn't
checked it properly. He was about 12 stone, and in addition had a lot of
luggage. After about 30 miles his back wheel collapsed altogether,'' he
said.
Always bring waterproof gear, food, and a puncture kit; in fact
cyclist Alistair White says that it's best to prepare for all possible
situations if you are cycling off-road. ''People really should have a
good toolkit. Aim to be completely self-sufficient. Bring plenty of
cash.''
Another precaution to consider is wearing a helmet. While people
complain that it interferes with the ''open-air'' sensation which is
part of the pleasure of cycling, in fact an open-face helmet really
isn't much different from wearing a hat. Thanks to recent technical
innovations, cyclists can obtain practical helmets which are light and
comfortable. And a helmet dramatically reduces the degree of head injury
in an accident.

* THIS evening Carlton will be in a position to make a realistic
assessment of their prospects of lifting the Ryden East League
Championship. They have established their credentials by winning four
matches in succession, although against teams unlikely to mount a title
challenge themselves, writes Frank Moran.
A visit to Goldenacre for a crack at the leaders, Heriot's, represents
a severe test of their mettle, as a home victory would open up a
significant gap between them. The whole Heriot's machine has been
functioning very nicely, with Mike Allingham's form earning him a recall
for Scotland's match against West Indies.
Another who has forced his way back into national favour is
Stenhousemuir's Iain Philip, but his club have betrayed a lack of
consistency and cannot afford to concede any more ground to the leaders.
They will expect tough opposition at The Tryst from Freuchie, who also
have designs on the title.
The only other contenders meanwhile are Grange, who make the journey
to Falkland. The Fifers were relieved that professional Manoj Parma
rediscovered his form last week.
The remaining matches are evenly poised. Royal High are at home to
Watsonians while at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh Academicals play
Corstorphine.

CELTIC declared last night that they are ready to pull out of the
transfer deal with Anderlecht for Belgium captain Marc Degryse, writes
Ken Gallacher.
Degryse, who has been earning #7000 a week with the Brussels side, has
claimed that Celtic offered him only around half that figure. But last
night the Glasgow club maintained they had made the player a reasonable
offer, but that he has now demanded terms which would amount to about
three times his present income.
At the moment skipper Paul McStay is the highest paid player at
Parkhead, earning around #4000 a week as a basic salary with bonuses to
be added. But that falls far short of the kind of money quality foreign
players expect.
Celtic are linked with other players in Europe, like Russian Dimitry
Radchenko of Spanish side Santander, but unless they are prepared to pay
high salaries, unrealistic as they may seem, they will struggle to sign
the kind of player the fans are now demanding.
For example, Burns would like to bring Ajax striker Peter van Vossen
to Glasgow, but again the salary could be a stumbling block. Ajax
players earned around #350,000 this season, double what McStay may have
picked up.

Peter Evans examines a new guide which has its uses, and its
drawbacks.
THERE are backpackers . . . and then again there are backpackers. My
version of backpacking is to take your tent, sleeping-bag, food, and
other essentials, put them in a rucksack and head off into the wilds for
a few days of perfect peace.
The target audience of this book is rather different -- the student
backpacker market: young people on holiday in Scotland, mostly from
Europe and abroad, who are looking for ideas about where to go and what
to do.
They want information on where to stay, what to eat, what to see, what
entertainment there is, and how they can do all these things as cheaply
as possible. For them the book performs a reasonable service, though it
is by no means perfect or comprehensive. The intention is to update it
every year, so the details should at least be current.
The geographical progression through the book is a little confusing at
first glance, until you realise the underlying assumption -- that
visitors arriving in Scotland will start their holiday in Edinburgh,
from there make their way up the east coast, then down the west to
Glasgow. Entries on the Borders, the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland
come last in the running order.
Now I know the capital is a fascinating place -- and Americans
especially will make it their first port of call nine times out of 10 --
but does it really warrant an entry of 22 pages, compared with just two
for Perth, for example, while Glasgow -- surely on a par with Edinburgh
-- has to make do with 13? I can't help feeling that the imbalance is
unfair.
And what about poor old Dundee, which gets a pretty raw deal from the
compilers: '' . . . you get an idea of the offerings in Dundee when the
Tourist Board promotes the public swimming-pool as one of their major
attractions. On the other hand, you can't get more down-to-earth than
Dundee, so if you are detained here, appreciate it as somewhere the
tourists hardly ever go.'' Makes it sound like a prison sentence!
This brutally frank entry is repeated elsewhere, though with some
justification in the case of Aviemore, said to have ''some abysmal
modern architecture''. There is a saving grace here, though, for the
entry continues: ''But what it lacks in tartan trimmings it makes up for
in designer Day-Glo. It's a vibrant, fun place and unless you're
terminally lazy you'll feel virtually obliged to take part in some sort
of healthy, character-building, sweaty sport.''
Youth hostels, a cheap form of accommodation, are given prominence,
but there are gaps. No mention of a hostel in Ballater, for instance,
and for all the B&amp;Bs in Callander, only one gets a mention. Stand up Mrs
O'Keefe of Balgibbon Drive -- you can thank this guide for sending some
custom your way.
It's impossible to mention every single attraction in any guide of
course, but I'm disappointed that the Old Mill at Blair Atholl failed to
get in. I once gorged myself on cakes and pots of tea there on a
west-to-east backpack across Scotland, and I've returned more than once
since. It's a working mill, too, and well worth a visit.
I don't want to be over-critical of the book, because it
unquestionably contains a lot of very useful information for young
travellers. For those who do want to get away from the tartan tourist
trail and into the countryside, there are some very good suggestions for
walks, with sensible advice about safety and preparation. Given the
number of tourists who venture up Ben Nevis every summer in shorts,
T-shirts, and trainers, that's no bad thing.
Finally, though, save me from a grammatical horror which appears more
than once and seems to be cropping up with ever-increasing frequency in
other contexts. ''The city may not have many buildings of historical
interest, but there's still some impressive ones.'' Ugh! I just hope
foreign learners of the English language don't treat this as the
definitive guide to grammar!

* WEST Lothian skipper Steve Crawley reckons that the wicket at
Boghall is ''probably one of the best in the country at the moment.''
That was after having hit seven 4s and a 6 in his rapid 38 against
Perthshire last week, writes Hugh McKinlay.
The fact that professional Ian Beven, with assistance from David Orr,
had taken apart the visitors with the ball in the same Caley 80/-
Counties league match would suggest, therefore, that Clackmannan had
better keep their eyes wide open at the same venue today.
The wee County also have their ace with both bat and ball -- Malcolm
Howell. Six wickets against Fifeshire, plus an unbeaten 49 to follow up
his 84 not out in the previous game against Perthshire, adds credence to
the Scottish cricket adage: ''Knock out the pro, knock out the
opposition.''
Joint-leaders Ayrshire visit Perthshire at the North Inch. Another
bat-and-ball expert, David Harper, again could be the key man for
Ayrshire.
Fifeshire's clash at McKane Park against the equally experienced
Stirling County looks evenly balanced, as does Arbroath County's visit
to Aberdeenshire at Mannofield.
Champions Strathmore look to have the stronger line-up when they
entertain Forfarshire at Lochside Park.

Paul Young looks at the best of the angling festivals and anticipates,
out of self-interest, the Elderly Anglers' Boat Competition.
FOR sea-anglers who enjoy a touch of competitive edge to their
fishing, or perhaps just like a bit of company out on the water, the
season ahead has a lot to offer.
Throughout the year, there are competitions and festivals the length
and breadth of Scotland. They cater for the dedicated sea angler who
wants to win, the more casual fisherman who enjoys a day out with the
pals and never mind the result, and the family, who might be looking for
nothing more taxing than the opportunity to spend a day together by the
water. If you are the kind of fisher who sometimes falls into all three
categories, rest assured that there will be an event somewhere during
the season to fulfil your expectations.
Not only that, but if you pick your events wisely, you'll be able to
see Scotland at its glorious best throughout the summer . . . and you'll
possibly catch a really interesting breadth of species of fish.
Tomorrow sees a shore competition, for example, down Greenock and
Gourock way. The Clyde and Western Region (Open) Shore Sweepstakes will,
I'm sure, produce a hugely different catch than that weighed in at next
Saturday's Skye Week (Open) Boat Competition fished out from Portree.
And if you can't make it to Skye on June 10, there is the
long-established Drumfork Sea Angling Club's all-nighter at Gareloch and
Loch Long. This is one for the dedicated, registration being between 8am
and 9.45am and the actual fishing taking place between 10pm and 8am the
next day.
Do you fancy fishing in Orkney? Well, you'll probably have to forgo
both the previous outings to take part in the Orkney Tourist Board
Trophy June (Open) Boat Festival fished out from Stromness on June 11.
But you might rather head north later in the year, September perhaps.
Stromness again is the venue, this time for the Northern Isles (Open)
Boat Championships fished over three days.
But by that time, you'll also have been to the Stonehaven (Open) Boat
Festival at the start of July, the Western Isles (Open) Boat
Championships out from Stornoway on July 7 and 8, and perhaps put in an
appearance at the most northerly event, the Viking Festival and
International Skate (Open) Boat Festival out from Lerwick from August
23-26.
The European Federation of Sea Anglers has chosen Pittenweem for its
Cod Festival in mid-June. That will be good fun, with the cream of
Europe's sea anglers fighting it out for a share of the extensive prize
list. Another one for the more dedicated angler.
But the youngsters are not forgotten. One of the questions I'm asked
most often is how to get young people started in fishing. Perhaps their
parents are not interested in fishing or aren't too sure where to go, so
it is great to see something like the Scottish Junior Coaching Course
being run at the start of July. The course includes the Scottish Junior
and Youth Boat Championships, so as well as being taught what to do,
there is the chance to put new-found skills to the test. Then the young
anglers will be ready for events like the Kinghorn Children's Gala Shore
Competition in August or the Scottish Federation of Sea Anglers' Junior
Knock-Out Shore Final at Wormit in September.
There are competitions, like the European Cod Festival, which target
particular species of fish, or quite the opposite, try to catch as many
species as possible. The Caithness Small Boat Specimen Hunt fished out
of Scrabster and organised by that splendid angler, Dave Proudfoot,
should be good fun and it will be interesting to see the number of
different terminal rigs and baits that anglers use to try for the Ling
Boat Competition at Stromness, or the all-night Conger Championships
fished in Loch Goil.
So, there is no excuse for not getting out and about and enjoying the
camaraderie of friendly competition -- but remember that, as with all
competitions, there are rules. Some might seem a trifle petty, but in
the long run it is better that way. For instance, only three herring or
mackerel may be weighed-in. This will stop someone thinking that a catch
of a hundred or so might scoop the pool. Any tope or skate caught in
eponymous festivals are to be weighed immediately after capture and
returned alive. And there is a comprehensive list of minimum sizes of
fish that can be presented for weigh-in. Any obviously undersized fish
being slapped on the scales will mean disqualification for the angler,
and quite right too.
Personally, I'm looking forward to the Elderly Anglers' Boat
Competition sponsored by some munificent brewer and the manufacturer of
anti-rheumatic cream. This will be held on a fairly calm, sunny day, at
a location where the fish are just big enough to draw a bead of sweat to
my aged brow and only come along every hour or so, thereby allowing
recuperation thanks to our sponsor's products. Now that's what I call a
Festival!

THIS World Cup has been interesting so far without a doubt.
The South Africans can gain pleasure because millions of black and
coloured people who had only known of Newlands as a police station now
see it as a symbol of their nation, and they have won their games.
South Africa will benefit enormously from the competition, but so
shall the Scots.
So far, if England had banged over as many points as Gavin Hastings
and his men have, then the media would have been going bananas about it.
But hardly a word has been spoken, because much of the rugby world fails
to believe that Scotland is a serious rugby nation.
I kid you not, they look at us in the same light as the Irish. I hope
I'm not insulting the Irish.
But I happen to believe, after watching the Aussies, South Africans,
Romanians and Canadians train, and all of the games in the competition,
that we think about our rugby more than any nation now, except perhaps
the All Blacks. We may never be the best, but by God we try harder than
anyone. I believe now that we play the best rugby. We try to, anyway.
My pal Roy Laidlaw, the SRU's national squad co-ordinator, goes home
on Monday, and we have been to see all of the big teams' sessions that
we can, and it may be wrong to say it on the morning of the Scottish
encounter with France, but the Aussies and the South Africans make
enough basic errors in training technique for he and I to give each
other a knowing wink as if to say: ''Did you see that? It was wrong,
wasn't it?''
Last Sunday, I asked Kitch Christie just what the South African
rucking technique was. He wasn't being secretive, but he couldn't
answer.
''We clear the bodies and run on to the scrum half's pass,'' said
Christie. Sorry, but there's a lot more to rucking than that.
For instance, the Aussies, like the South Africans, skip like little
wimps over bodies in the rucks. They don't get their front foot in
properly, and consequently teams can ruin their attempted quick ball.
The most important bit of rucking is the swing of the front foot into
position to form a bridging ruck.
They also don't have the first man in on the near side to obstruct.
As you all know, Roy Laidlaw's job out here for the SRU has been to
learn even more. Everywhere he went so did the video recorder and
notebook. He has learned much.
''I learned mostly from the Aussies,'' he says. ''They box in
training, have net ball practices, and even play cricket for hand and
eye co-ordination.
''I spoke to George Gregan, the scrum half, who told me that he was
only picked up as a rugby player when he was 20, and then he was sent to
the Australian Institute of Sport where they assessed him, even
analysing things like the level and angle of his pelvis when he was
passing the ball.
''He told me that Michael Lynagh wants the ball low on his hip from
the scrum half pass, and we will look at that.''
And, personally, I'll go farther than Bob Dwyer did in midweek in
criticising the referees, and say that the refereeing has been
incredibly inconsistent in the tournament, with far too many teams being
allowed to fall on the ball and obstruct the flow of games.
If rugby is to move on in the world, then it has to flow on the pitch
and forwards have to be allowed to get that ball out of rucks, at the
expense of the obstructing players if necessary.Peter Wright on Will
Carling, for instance. The Ivory Coast, Argentina, Italy, Canada,
Romania and even South Africa have all broken almost every rule when
going back in rucks.
''It's a common failing of most of the teams in the tournament that
they have been unable to stay on their feet in the drive,'' says
Laidlaw. ''That has affected some of the games.
''Plus, I would hope that we are ahead in trying to pass the ball out
of the tackle.''
Like me, Roy thinks that we have played two of the worst teams in the
tournament, and the message coming from Pierre Berbezier is that the
French have not been wound up for their games so far and the prospect of
revenge over Scotland is making their mouths water, but I think that we
have done well.
Roy reminds me that Scotland equates to Western Province in the number
of players, but when you put your best fifteen on the field then the
number of players backing up that team is totally irrelevant.
He goes back to Scotland, then, with a case full of notes and videos
and some great memories, the opening day among them.
I'll miss him, but I'm safe in the knowledge that his trip has been
money well spent by the SRU.
It's just another step by Scottish rugby keep up with, or at times
ahead of, the world game of rugby.

* IT IS our blessing, and the ringed plover's curse, that it shares
with us our summertime beaches. Thanks to human intrusion, it is most
common in reserves and power-station compounds. Yet it is still the bird
you are most likely to see when sunbathing on any sandy, shingly shore
in Scotland. However, when it is sitting still on its eggs, you could
hardly pick it out from surrounding grey and white stones. At your
too-near approach, it will counterfeit to flutter and limp away with a
broken wing. When your eye has lost the place where the eggs lie
exposed, it will never again find it. Once the chicks hatch they
skedaddle and rely on their own camouflage.
In May or June you may see the ringed plover's display flight, a slow
motion zig-zag over the beach and dunes accompanied by a varying liquid
trill. In aggressive display it shows off its pied front. One famous
experiment had the bird rushing at its own displaying figure in a mirror
until at the wrong angle its opponent disappeared and had to be looked
for in vain round the back.
Our own ringed plovers only move a short distance in winter, the
biggest flocks being on the machair of South Uist, but those nesting far
to the north also winter far to the south, which suggests that this was
an Arctic nesting species until forced south by the last ice age. Not
until May do the big numbers pass up through our estuaries on the way
from West Africa. The Solway may be the last refuelling stop before the
single hop to Greenland.

THE spring bonanza continued this week with a blaze of colourful
rarities. The Shetland Isles producing such eye-catchers as Common
Rosefinch, Subalpine Warbler, Red-backed Shrike and several Bluethroats
making it this week's premier site. Other highlights included an
unseasonal Dusky Warbler, a River Warbler, a Red-breasted Flycatcher and
a Short-toed Lark adding to the long staying Forsters Tern and
Black-browed Albatross.
Reports are listed in their approximate order for rarity or interest
of the species, giving dates seen. Unfortunately no guarantees can be
given that the birds will still be present at this time.
REGIONAL REPORTS
Shetland - On South Mainland two Common Rosefinch, two Bluethroats and
one Red-backed Shrike (27th). Also sighted here was an extremely rare
spring record of a Dusky Warbler (26th) a species more associated with
autumn vagrancy. On Fair Isle up to six Common Rosefinch were seen
(27th) along with a River Warbler, several Bluethroats, a Sup-alpine
Warbler, a Red-breasted Flycatcher and two Red-backed Shrikes. Elsewhere
in Shetland, a Golden Oriole on the Outer Skerries the Albatross still
at North Unst and reports of Common Rosefinches and Bluethroats
throughout the region.
Grampian - The Forsters Tern and King Eider remained on the Ythan
Estuary along with a Common Rosefinch at Rattrayhead (28th), and a Marsh
Warbler at Girdleness (27th). Also at Rattrayhead reports of a
Short-toed Lark seen during the week. At the Loch of Strathbeg, a Curlew
Sandpiper, four Marsh Harriers and a Black-tailed Godwit were seen
(28th).
Lothian - A Temmincks Stint was still present at the Mussleburgh
Lagoon wader scrape (28th). Also in the region, a Common Crane was seen
over the Lammermuir Hills, two Curlew Sandpipers and two Little Stints
at Aberlady Bay, a Blue-headed Wagtail and a Marsh Harrier near Dunbar
(28th). A Red-backed Shrike was also seen near Linlithgow (26th).
Orkney - A Red-footed Falcon was seen on North Ronaldsay along with a
Marsh Warbler, two Bluethroats, two Red-backed Shrikes and three Black
Redstarts.
National - Norfolks reputation for producing top-class rarities was
further enhanced last week with the discovery of a singing male Rock
Thrush at Holme. It remained until the May 25 having survived, not least
the attention of several thousand birders, but also the local
sparrowhawk. The last reported sighting of this much sought after
species in this country was in 1989. Also in the area were sightings of
Red-throated pipits, Sub-alpine Warblers, a Greater Yellowlegs, a Cattle
Egret and on a personal note a Black Kite performed well at
Fulmodestone. Elsewhere in the country, a Little Bittern was found on
the Scilly Isles, a Little Egret in Washington was one of several on the
East coast and a Savi's Warbler appeared near Blackpool (29th).
Late News - An extremely rare Eye-browed Thrush has been reported from
near Arbroath (29th). Very few records of this Siberian bird have been
recorded in this country.

Romania has discovered the legend of Dracula is a tourist attraction
people are dying to sink their teeth into, as Kirsty Scott reports.
WITH five years of capitalism under its belt, Romania has turned to
the legend of Count Dracula to kickstart it's fledgling tourism
industry.
The world's first Dracula congress ended in the country recently, with
about 50 Dracula buffs from all over the world rounding off a three-day,
government-sponsored congress and tour with a pilgrimage to the literary
home of their hero in northern Romania, 200 miles from the capital,
Bucharest.
The climax of the celebrations was a masked ball on the fir-covered
mountain slopes of the Borgo Pass, immortalised in Stoker's Dracula
tales, based on a 14th-century Romanian prince, Vlad the Impaler, and
embroidered with local vampire lore.
''For the Jews there is the holy land, for Muslims there is Mecca and
for the Dracula fans there is Transylvania,'' said Clive Leatherdale, a
publisher of Dracula books and magazines, from England.
One American Dracula expert, who traveled thousands of miles for the
experience, said she felt that the blood of the Dracula spirit lived on
in Transylvania. ''I came to hear the sounds, to touch the walls, smell
the earth and see the trees,'' said Lucinda von Reichon, of Berkeley,
California, countess of the vampire club which boasts 10,000 members
around the world.
Like the other would-be vampires, von Reichon dresses in black, is
unmarried and has no children. After spending 48 hours in Transylvania
she said she scarcely slept so she could ''fully absorb the legend.''
For the less initiated, the organisers of the congress had produced a
book How to Become A Vampire in Six Easy Steps, which sold for about
#2.50. The procedure involves a complicated ritual with eggs, a raw
chicken liver, and bizarre chants.
Tourism officials said Romania has decided to face up to the myth that
inspired scores of Hollywood movies. The aim of the congress is to boost
tourism, said Tourism Minister Dan Agaton, who personally ensured that
delegates received rooms when organisation got fraught.
For the economically hard-pressed Romanians, the vampire is primarily
money. At the Bran Castle, local women in headscarves and thick wool
stockings displayed enormous sweaters embossed with the castle and the
words, ''Dracula Romania.''
It is all a far cry from the days of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu --
nicknamed Vampirescu by some Romanians because of his harsh policies --
who saw his land as a modern industrial powerhouse. Ceausescu banned
Stoker's book and all the Dracula movies. When the Communists were
forced to sate foreigners' Dracula curiosity in the 1970s, they arranged
tours to another site -- Bran Castle just 110 miles north of Bucharest
-- which had no connection with Dracula, and only tenuous links with his
impaling forebear, Vlad.
* ISRAELIS and tourists have been snapping up non-kosher cheeseburgers
at the first McDonald's restaurant in Jerusalem. The opening of the
restaurant attracted some protests from Orthodox Jews, but guards had to
hold back a crowd of 200 or so, who had turned up hoping to be the first
in line at the renovtaed cinema. ''Burger King and Pizza Hut respected
the sanctity of this city and opened kosher branches here. McDonald's
should be kosher or be closed,'' said one protestor. ''It's not Tel Aviv
here.''
TOUR operators are now offering more and more innovative trips and
holidays to tempt the increasingly adventurous tourist. Some of the
deals on offer at the moment include an adventure break in Alaska's
Denali National Park. The trip includes an exploration of old gold towns
and the chance to go whale watching. For more information call Explore
Worldwide on 01252 319448. Back over in Europe, Headwater Holidays is
offering a canoeing break in the Creuse region of France. Prices start
at #420. Call 01606 48699. Meanwhile, Waymark Holidays is offering #75
off its one-week walking break to France. The trip is based at St Bonnet
in the south of the country, the walking is said to be gentle, and
picnics are set up every lunchtime. Call 01753 516477.
* SENEGAL has embarked on a major damage limitation exercise after it
was claimed that four French tourists, missing since April 6 in the
province of Casamance, were dead.
The bodies of Catherine and Claude Cave and Jean Paul and Martine
Gagnaire had not yet been found, but the source said they were
apparently buried in Senegal and a rebel who had taken refuge in
neighbouring Guinea Bissau knew where. The Movement of Democratic Forces
of Casamance (MFDC), which has been fighting for independence for more
than a decade, has denied any link with the disappearance of the four.
But the version of events outlined by the source, who was quoting rebels
who had also been hiding in Guinea-Bissau, suggested members of the
group may have been involved.
The Government of Senegal, which relies on tourism for much of its
foreign exchange, had offered a #2000 reward for information leading to
the discovery of the tourists. It sent more than 1000 special troops to
the area to hunt for them.
* GENEVA has thrown a major party for the first streetcar line it has
built since 1909, reviving -- for the sake of the environment -- a
network that had shrunk to a single line. With bands playing and
refreshments offered, thousands of people turned out for free rides on
Line 13, happily changing back and forth for trips on new trams and on
streetcars built as long ago as 1901. Although the new line is only a
loop 2.1 miles long, the Geneva transit authority TPG, or Transports
Publics Genevois, says it forms a vital link across the Rhone River and
will serve as the basis of a new network by the year 2005. Included will
be stops at the European headquarters of the United Nations and other
international organisations. A subway line is also planned.
Early in this century the city boasted a tram network of about 90
miles. But buses, trolley buses and cars began taking over. The old Line
13 was abandoned in 1969 and the track removed. With traffic congestion
and pollution increasing, transit officials began looking for more
efficient connections along the most heavily travelled routes. They
maintain the electric-powered tram was the cheapest and least polluting
to the city and would be a feature for tourists.

Iain White goes to the Dordogne, early enough to avoid the profusion
of GB stickers, and finds a medieval landscape of carved gables and
mullioned windows.
WHEN I told friends that I was heading off to the Dordogne for a month
they were horrified. ''It'll be crawling with Brits,'' they exclaimed.
Well actually, it would be crawling with British and Dutch visitors . .
. if I had visited in summer. However in spring and autumn the region is
a delight to explore with pleasant weather, quiet roads, and only the
occasional sighting of a GB sticker to tiptoe past.
To the French, the Dordogne is a river, but to the British the name
suggests a vast area spreading up to Limoges. I decided to follow the
course of the River Dordogne itself, through the region of Perigord Noir
which contains perhaps the most beautiful and rustic landscape. This is
a land of picture-book villages and clifftop castles set amidst rural
tranquillity.
Snugly nestled in the heart of a valley between the Dordogne and
Vezere rivers sits Sarlat-la-Caneda, the capital of the region. Built in
a heart-shape, the old town is filled with a labyrinthine web of
wonderful honey-coloured buildings. Carved gables and mullioned windows
all help make this town a prime example of sixteenth and
seventeenth-century architecture. Town planning in the Middle Ages did
not abide by the same concepts and requirements of today, and the charm
of Sarlat is its wonderful confusion of ancient dwellings competing for
your attention.
The cramped vieille ville clings protectively round the Gothic
splendour of St Sacerdos Cathedral. Behind the narrow passages, which
lead to the Chapel of the Blue Penitents, is a staircase which takes you
to Sarlat's mysterious building. The Lanterne des morts is a cylindrical
cone-shaped monument whose form and function are still debated by
historians. The most popular theory is that it commemorates St Bernard
whose miracles against the plague are believed to have rid the town of
the murderous epidemic of 1147. The French Tourist Board believes it to
have more registered or classified buildings per square mile than
anywhere else in Europe, and Sarlat is well worth a visit to meander
through its cool, shady lanes and courtyards.
Before heading west along the river I decided to take a short detour
south of the Dordogne Valley to visit a remarkable village. Leaving the
lush, fertile fields behind, the road climbed up and up on to the high
limestone plateau of Cause de Gramat. Desolate and empty, this is an
arid and sparsely populated land characteristic of the far south of
France.
The dramatic changes of the landscape in such a short distance were
surprising, as we entered a land of poor soil littered with stones and
rocks. The wilderness of wild juniper and scrub oak seemed unending and
my misgivings were growing about undertaking this detour. Then suddenly
there appeared the spectacular setting of Rocamadour. The deep and
abrupt canyon of the Alzou stream slashes an enormous gash across the
plateau and tucked under the vertiginous cliff is the village.
As you head down into the valley you can only wonder at the sheer
audacity of the setting. The village is a meandering street of clustered
houses strung between two medieval gateways and this tranquil beauty
would in itself be worth a visit. But the incredible complex of
churches, chapels and ramparts soaring above Rocamadour is what has
attracted thousands of pilgrims and tourists to this site.
When the perfectly preserved body of the hermit Zacchaeus was found in
a grave high up on the rocks in 1166, he became known as Saint Amadour
and thus started the clamour to visit the site. Numerous kings of France
and England set the trend for the devout to drag themselves on their
knees up the 223 steps of the Via Sancta past the 14 stations of the
cross to the top of the rockface. Built almost vertically into the rocky
backdrop and defying gravity as it leans out perilously above the
village, are a total of seven churches which surround the
smoke-blackened Chapelle Notre Dame.
Here resides the Black Madonna, a tiny, almost macabre, walnut-wood
statue whose miracle working propensities elevated the shrine to a major
pilgrimage site. Set high up within a protective black cage the statue
certainly emanates a strong sense of mystery in the half-light of the
tiny chapel.
After the exhausting effort of climbing to the top to enjoy the
spectacular views, I headed back into the sleepy village for a deserved
coffee and croissant and was reliably informed how lucky I was. ''In
summer,'' said the patron, ''the main street is like the Paris Metro at
rush hour, the crowds crawl over Rocamadour like ants on a honey jar.''
I had encountered less than a dozen unobtrusive Parisians on holiday.
Returning to the course of the river, I followed the Dordogne until I
reached the Montford loop where the water laps affectionately on the
pebbles and boulders around this most perfectly formed bend. The river,
lined by rows of tall poplars, describes an almost complete arc as it
lays bare the deep white limestone of the bank.
On the rocky promontory, gazing out over the rich green walnut
orchards, stands Montfort Castle dominating the valley from its
strategic vantage-point. This beautifully elegant fortress acts as a
serenely calm sentinel above the river. Its advantageous position,
however, made it the envy of others, and following the destructive
period of Simon de Montfort during his repressive crusades against the
Cathars, the castle experienced a turbulent history of attack, siege,
destruction, and reconstruction until it was finally restored in the
nineteenth century.
The castle is worth visiting, but like every other historical monument
in the Dordogne, there is an entrance fee. Everything in this region has
become tourist-oriented to the point where you cannot even enter the
grounds of a house or castle without paying at the ubiquitous toll
barrier for the privilege.
The Dordogne is believed to have the richest regional cuisine in
France, and Perigord itself offers a wealth of gastronomy. If you have
the patience and time you can search for the illusive truffle. These
black diamonds hide themselves in the warm loam beneath the dark oak
forests and do not offer themselves easily. They have an inimitable
perfume and the locals regard such hidden treasures almost as a gift
from the gods. Should you find them for sale in the market-place of any
village, the price will reflect their rarity. The omnipresent walnut of
the region, however, is hard to avoid, as the shelves of oil and liqueur
in the local gift shops and delicatessens will attest to. The savoury
taste of this oil either in cooking or on salads is a wonderful reminder
of still, autumn days and is worth bringing home as a gift.
The varied culinary fare also offers cabecou (goat's cheese), cepes
(wild mushrooms), coq au vin, and vergt strawberries. But most famous of
all in the region is foie gras, which is the liver of goose. I had
anticipated trying this famous delicacy until I was informed as to
exactly how it was created. The helpless bird is physically stuffed,
almost to choking point, with maize kernels until the liver becomes
over-developed. The removed swollen organ is then cleaned, seasoned and
sealed in a can ready for the restaurant and the tourist market. My
sensitivity forced me to decline the offer and I chose to have the local
river trout, which at least had been given a sporting chance of avoiding
the dinner table.
The region is also famous for its wine, and as you travel further down
the Dordogne you will pass through hillsides on which the white grapes
of Semillon, Muscadet, and Sauvignon are grown. The early morning mists
which shroud the river and surrounding countryside are not only
beautiful and romantic, they are practical, for they create a secret
alchemy. They stimulate the growth of a tiny fungus whose microscopic
proliferation is further encouraged by the warmth of sunny afternoons.
Thus the golden and heady white wines of Monbazillac are born in the
surrounding countryside.
The river now passes through the very heartland of the Dordogne, a
land so serene and magical it is almost impossible to believe it was the
setting for some of the most brutal and prolonged fighting between the
French and English as they contested the Hundred Years War. The village
of Domme was constructed as a fortified settlement known as a Bastide (a
corruption of the word Bastille). There were more than 300 of these
defences constructed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
stretching between the Massif Central and the Pyrenees. Domme, sitting
majestically on a rocky promontory with awe-inspiring views over the
region, is the best preserved of these villages and contains the
original walls and three of the original thirteenth-century gateways.
The village was built on a cliff so precipitous that fortifications on
the north side were deemed unnecessary. Yet in 1588 a small band of men
under the leadership of Geoffroy de Vivans scaled the unguarded crags
and captured the bastide. Today, you can only marvel at their ability,
as even a walk up the narrow, winding lane which leads from the valley
floor to the clifftop village is a long and exhausting task.
Domme is a beautifully proportioned village with its delightfully
red-tiled roofs, flowering window-boxes and golden-coloured stone
combining to give pleasure to the eye. In fact it is almost too
perfectly groomed with its tourist profile being excessively hyped at
every opportunity. It can be suffocatingly swamped in high season when
coachloads of day-trippers fill the tiny streets and swarm over the
finely preserved relics. Short of applying some sort of quota on the
numbers entering these sites it is difficult to know how to solve a
growing problem that affects the area in high season.
From its wonderful eyrie-like position, Domme has a perfect view of
the two magnificent cliff-top fortresses of Beynac and Castlenaud, which
face each other across the Dordogne. Before you reach that however,
hidden behind a sharp curve hewn out by the river is something special.
Nestling between the river and the foot of a lofty cliff crowned by
lush green oaks, is La Roque-Gageac, a regular winner of France's
prettiest village contest. With the houses dovetailing one into the
next, the village is strung out like a sparkling pearl necklace along
the bank of the Dordogne.
On a visit here Henry Miller wrote: ''If paradise existed on earth,
this is surely the kind of setting God would have chosen for it.'' It is
worth clambering up the narrow lanes behind the main street that cling
close to the rock. The stroll becomes quite spellbinding when an
astonishing tropical garden suddenly appears, growing along a narrow
ledge in the cliff. Palm trees, bananas, fig trees, cacti, and bamboo
all thrive here revelling in the warm suntrap below the shelter of the
cliffs.
Another surprise awaits further up the lane. Built into the rockface
above the village and reached by a precipitous wooden stair seemingly
pinned to the sheer cliff, is a troglodytic fort cleverly fashioned from
natural hollows high up on the rockface. It is amazing to discover that
the early people who created these structures were sheltering from the
threat offered by the Vikings who brought their pillaging far up the
peaceful meanderings of this calm waterway. The village was also once
garrison for 300 soldiers to protect the powerful Bishops of Sarlat who
had their Summer Palace here. In fact, the medieval walled township had
such strong natural defences that it successfully defied all English
attempts to capture it throughout the Hundred Years War.
Before the road was built, La Roque Gageac was a thriving port from
where the river's traditional flat-bottomed craft, the gabarres, plied
their trade. The Dordogne was a busy waterway with these boats bringing
oakwood used for cooperage from the Auvergne and wine from the middle
Dordogne down to the barrel makers and wine merchants of Bordeaux. It is
still possible to see these boats because they have now been adapted for
the far more lucrative market of ferrying tourists up and down the
river.
This is the most enjoyable and leisurely way to continue the journey
beyond the village. As you float peacefully down the river you can
almost believe that the masterly hand of an impressionist painter must
have traced the shimmering course of the Dordogne as it mirrors the
cliffs, villages, and castles along the route.
There are three chateaux to be marvelled at before you reach, perhaps,
the most impressive sight in the Black Perigord -- the two massive
fortress villages of Beynac and Castlenaud. Facing each other across the
river they resemble two medieval knights looking each other straight in
the eye, too close to turn a blind one. The splendour of this setting
would do justice to a Disney film set as the imposing bulk of towers,
turrets, buttresses, and pinnacles of the two fortresses arrest the eye
from wherever you look.
Beynac was the scene of much bloodletting with Richard the Lionheart
holding the castle for some time until his death during the siege of
Chalus, near Limoges, in 1199. It changed hands a further three times,
emphasising how important the situation of this feudal fortress was on
the French-English border-line of the Dordogne river. Castlenaud, the
true rival to Beynac on terms of impregnability, was held by the English
for most of the Hundred Years War and it was not until the Revolution
that it was finally abandoned.
Of the two, Castlenaud is by far the most fun to visit. With its
reconstructions of the great weapons of medieval warfare, it is very
much a hands-on approach to history. There are no guides to hurry you
along (you are given an information pack on entry) and few restrictions
to impede your enjoyment. The fearsome war-machines like the
stone-hurling mangonel, the bricole catapult, and the cumbersome
trebucket, are all on display on the battlements and in the courtyard.
The dimly-lit twisting stairways and passages lead you through the
cleverly recreated fourteenth-century life of the castle as you pass
through the kitchen, armoury, and prison cells.
Imaginative video games involving the siege of the castle can be
played allowing young and old participants to travel back in time and
change the course of history. When you finally reach the top of the
fortress, the view from the ramparts is quite stunning as the deep blue
waters of the Dordogne, enhanced by the pale embroidery of its
sand-banks, flows through a colourful patchwork of fertile fields.
From here, the river grows in stature as it heads west, and soon it
will link up with the Vezere, doubling its volume, before entering the
enchanting walled city of Bergerac. This is a city made famous by
tobacco, red wine, and a somewhat illusory link with its fictional
namesake Cyrano. It is the capital of Perigord Pourpre, another region,
another colour, and perhaps another holiday.

KINGUSSIE, favourites to lift the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup, will set
off this morning for Oban with three bus-loads of supporters, all
convinced they will return to Badenoch with the famous Challenge Cup.
Opponents Oban Camanachd are the biggest underdogs for years --
although they will no doubt draw great strength from the remarkable feat
of Kyles Athletic last season, when they overcame all the odds to defeat
Fort William in a dramatic final.
Kingussie appear to have far too much strength in depth and in
all-round attack, led by manager's son Ronald Ross, who has netted 62
goals so far this season.
Their preparation for the match has been incident-free and manager Ian
Ross said: ''I have rarely seen the boys fitter or train harder. Their
commitment to this final has been fantastic. I can assure you, Oban
Camanachd will have to produce something special to deny us the
trophy.''
Camanachd know they cannot afford to go behind as they did recently in
the national league final in which Kingussie romped to a 5-0 victory.
Club president Duncan MacIntyre said: ''We know what we have to do. We
are bitterly disappointed with our performances in the last two matches,
which we could have won. However, we are lucky enough to be playing on
our own park and in front of our own crowd. that could make all the
difference. Rest assured, we will give it our best shot.''
The enormity of Oban's task is to be found in reams of Kingussie
statistics -- 10 successive north championships, unbeaten in all but
eight of their matches over the last four years. The list is almost
endless.
No team has won the prized trophy without conceding a goal since
Furnace accomplished the feat in 1923. If Oban could win and equal that
record which would take the trophy for the first time since 1938, the
capital of Argyll could be in for a big party.
The match, which starts at 2pm, should attract a large crowd who will
know how to celebrate no matter who wins.
Kingussie -- I Anderson, M Thain, D Borthwick, S Borthwick, D
Thompson, A Dallas, E Sutherland, R Grant, A Borthwick, D Anderson, M
Clark, R Ross. Substitutes -- D Young (captain), J Gibson, R Jones, I
Borthwick.
Oban Camanachd -- (from) J MacGregor, A MacVicar, G MacIntyre, N
MacInnes, G Reid, D Morrison, A Inglis, D MacIntyre, G Blainey, D
Devine, F Inglis, D McCuish, A Campbell (captain), S Jamieson, G Evans,
A Pearson.

LIZ McColgan and Paul Evans have been promised a place in Britain's
World Championship team for Gothenburg this summer, provided they can
achieve the 10,000 metres qualifying time at the European Cup final, in
Lille, three weeks this weekend.
For Dundee Hawkhill's McColgan, who won the world 10,000m title in
1991, but whose last track race was at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, this
is a major encouragement on the road back from career-threatening
injury.
The British Athletic Federation made the promise of automatic world
places yesterday, officially confirming McColgan's cup selection which
was revealed exclusively by The Herald on Thursday.
The world place is dependent on her running inside the qualifying time
of 32min 30.00sec, against her UK record of 30-57.07. Evans, the
Glasgow-born former Springburn Harrier who defected to England, has a
qualifying target of 28-10.00 against a best time of 27-47.49.
Heather Heasman and Jill Hunter, both rivals to McColgan and
Commonwealth champion Yvonne Murray for the 10,000m in Gothenburg, race
today over that distance in the BUPA Great Welsh Run, a road event
incorporating a Home Countries international.
The Scottish team has been seriously depleted. Of four men and women
originally named, only Marlene Gemmell (Strathkelvin Ladies) survives.
Neither Murray nor McColgan was considered. Only three men will now
travel -- Steven Wylie and Alex Robertson (Cambuslang) and 42-year-old
Brian Kirkwood (Leslie Deans RC). Gemmell is joined by Susan McNairney,
Lindsay Cairns, and Jackie Thompson.
* THE British Athletics Federation this weekend considers whether to
permit bookmakers to reclaim the turf from which the amateurs banned
them more than a century ago.
Lest they require a reminder of how races may be rigged, I recount the
tale of the late Willie McFarlane, who won the Powderhall Sprint in 1933
and '34. An unemployed joiner during the Depression, McFarlane's family
was dependent on his athletics.
A favourite memory was of backing a rival: ''I thought I had judged it
perfectly, by just failing to catch him on the line. But the guy tied up
in the last couple of strides. I threw up my arms, as if celebrating
victory, but actually pushed him through the tape. He won, I lost, but I
collected five times the prize-money. The groceries were safe again.''

SCOTTISH RALLY
REIGNING British rally champion Malcolm Wilson had opened up a
commanding lead in the Scottish International Rally at the end of
yesterday's first leg of four stages in Perthshire.
The 39-year-old Cumbrian, clear favourite to repeat his 1985 and 1994
victories, was uncatchable in his Ford Escort Cosworth, returning to
Perth 69 seconds ahead of Finland's Olli Harkki, driving a near-standard
Mitsubishi Galant.
Belgian Gregoire de Mevius (Nissan Sunny GTi) was third on equal time
penalty with Yorkshire's Jonny Milner in a four-wheel drive,
turbo-charged version of the same car. Sweden's Tomas Abrahamsson,
driving a modified Ford Escort Cosworth was fifth.
Alister McRae's bid to extend his lead in the Mobil 1/Top Gear British
Rally Championship ended in Craigvinean, the first special stage near
Dunkeld. The Lanark driver's Nissan Sunny ground to a halt with
electrical failure after only three miles.
''I can't believe my luck. Up to now the Nissan has been so reliable.
I am lost for words,'' said a dejected McRae.
Kilmarnock's Robbie Head was left stranded at the roadside after
Craigvinean when his Renault Clio ran out of oil.
Kelso's Dom Buckley ended yesterday's first leg in ninth position at
the wheel of his Volkswagen Golf GTI.
Three times Scottish winner David Llewellin was another driver to be
sidelined in Craigvinean, when the engine of his Astra seized. Standings
after four special stages:
1, M Wilson/B Thomas (Ford Escort) 22min 07sec; 2, O Harkki/R
Mannisenmaki (Mitsubishi Galant) 23-16; 3, G de Mevius/J M Fortin
(Nissan Sunny) 23-37; 4, J Milner/S Turvey (Nissan Sunny) 23-37; 5, T
Abrahamsson/M Kidd (Ford Escort) 23.42; 6, J Kytolehto/A Kapanen
(Vauxhall Astra) 23.48.

A full-time performer, paid to sing the evenings away in hotels and
bars throughout the Highlands and Islands. To some it sounds like a job
made in heaven, but as Donald Bannatyne reveals, events in a typical
week on the road can sometimes strike a wrong chord.
AFTER four nights on Skye, the Uists, and Benbecula, the last thing I
need is a rough ferry crossing. The boat is running more than an hour
late and my body clock is running about two days slow. At 7.30 on a
Monday morning a rain-lashed Lochboisdale is not a pretty sight.
However, the delay allows time to reflect on the events of the weekend,
which started at the Ferry Boat Inn, Kyle of Lochalsh.
A great place to play, but a difficult place to sleep thanks to the
noise of roadworks outside the window first thing in the morning. (Maybe
the workmen had heard me singing the night before and this was their
revenge.)
I admitted defeat and drove to Portree to seek refuge at a friend's
house. Two hours' sleep, then up to Uig to catch the ferry to Lochmaddy.
Once on board, I make the mistake of changing my guitar strings in the
lounge only to be immediately surrounded by half a dozen schoolkids
demanding a song. Thankfully, after a poor rendition of Love is All
Around they rediscover the delights of their walkmans and I manage
another hour's sleep.
That night I meet up with Calum Iain MacCorquodale, accordionist and
fiddler from North Uist, to play at a dance in the Dark Island Hotel on
Benbecula.
It's always a welcome change from doing solo work to play with other
musicians, especially a character like Calum Iain who combines great
musical ability with a very offbeat sense of humour. His daughter Alison
joins us on stage (only 15 but what a bagpipe player!) and a good night
is had by all.
Next stop is the Westford Inn, North Uist. This is Calum Iain's home
territory so the place is packed by 9.30pm. It's one of those nights
when we can play anything from a U2 song to a Gaelic waltz; everyone
seems to enjoy it.
On Sunday we part company; I head for the Borrodale Hotel at
Daliburgh. The audience consists mainly of Celtic supporters trying to
cheer themselves up after a poor result, so I sing songs for most of the
night. I suppose it's a case of ''when in Rome . . . ''
Time for reflection is over; the ferry has arrived and it's a long
bumpy journey back to Oban. I get home at 4.30pm, ignore the mail and
the answering machine and go straight to bed.
It's been almost eight years since I decided that playing my guitar
every night must be preferable to loading a lorry every morning. Now
approaching 40, a broken marriage behind me, a constant struggle to find
work and a pile of bills to pay . . . sometimes I wonder if it was such
a good idea.
People assume that it's an easy option -- ''It's not a real job
because all you do is stand in the pub for a couple of hours and sing a
few songs.''
Maybe they're right, but I spent five years in the Civil Service
sitting behind a desk adding columns of figures -- is that a real job?
Wednesday afternoon; once again the pressures of solo work need a
safety valve, so it's time to get the band Speedy Retreat back together
again to rehearse for some local gigs. The band is usually just myself
and fiddle player Cathy MacNaughton, but we've decided to borrow
guitarist Finlay Wells from The Shoe Factory (nothing to do with
footwear manufacture -- they're another Oban band!) and Shaun Craig is
persuaded to join us on bass.
There are no proper rehearsal studios in Oban so we set up the gear in
Finlay's garage. We get some new material together and it sounds OK --
even Jaffa the dog howls his appreciation.
When I get back to the flat there's a message from Aviemore confirming
a resident spot in one of the hotels. Great. Things are looking up. Must
design new posters. My publicity material always says ''Banny and his
guitar!'' Banny is a nickname which has been with me since primary
school at Connel -- I suppose there's not much point in changing it now.
I once went busking in Paris. At the time, everyone thought I'd gone
mad because I cancelled everything and just disappeared. I had very
little money with me, so for the first time in my life the ability to
entertain became almost a matter of life and death. I think I had to do
it to prove to myself that I could really hack it as a full-time singer.
I did the Metro, and the art galleries, and ended with a proper gig in
a bar on the Boulevard St Michel.
The best piece of advice I ever had was from a folk-singer called Ian
Russell. He said: ''Only one thing is important in this game -- you have
to know that you have something to offer an audience.''
Since then, every time I have any doubts about what I'm doing I go to
Munich or Amsterdam and start busking on a street corner. Apart from
anything else, it's a civilised way to get arrested. (Incidentally, the
day after I left Paris, the Boulevard St Michel was wrecked by riots and
set on fire -- surely my singing wasn't that bad?)
No rest for the financially disadvantaged, so it's back to work, this
time at the Keel Row bar on Mull. I tend to drive with great care on
Mull, because I'm totally paranoid about crashing into a deer. I'm still
paying for the damage sustained after my last encounter with one of
these beasts -- and isn't there always someone with an agricultural
sense of humour who says: ''Why didn't you kill it and throw it in the
back of the car?'' Get real! I can just see the posters now -- ''Banny
and his guitar, with special guest George the Dead Deer!''
The next day it's a long haul from the Ross of Mull to Portree on
Skye. How many times have I driven this road? I think back to the late
seventies, to a Transit van packed with Marshall amps and dreams of
stardom. I think of the others who used to play in the bands and have
now turned their backs on it all, getting married, becoming lawyers,
junkies, lorry drivers . . . one guy even robbed a bank and spent five
years in jail!
The music scene in the Highlands has changed drastically during the
past 20 years. The tradition of Friday night dances in the village halls
has been practically wiped out by changes to the licensing laws -- most
people now prefer to stay in the pub till closing time.
Major rock bands rarely venture west of the Higland Line, except
perhaps to seek reassurance about new material about to be released on
the world market -- recent visitors have included Carter USM, Del Amitri
and the Proclaimers. Homegrown talent from the area is usually snapped
up by record companies from the south; return visits are rare.
Local music festivals are beginning to redress the balance -- Tarbert
and Barra spring to mind, with even Oban beginning at last to get its
act together. Let's hope the trend continues.
Anyway, I get to Skye and play a dance in the Cuillin Hills Hotel.
Calum Iain is with me again, Hamish MacKenzie plays drums. The music
scene on Skye seems to be thriving -- the last time we played here
Malcolm Jones from Runrig turned up with his accordion and joined in.
Later we go back to Hamish's house and watch a video of that gig. I
decide once again that I don't ever want to be famous; I look terrible
on videos. On Saturday we play the Royal Hotel and afterwards I end up
at a party somewhere in Portree. Not a good idea as it turns out,
because I don't get to bed until five in the morning.
I drive back to Oban the next day feeling terrible . . . maybe I'm
getting too old for all this. There's a message on the answering machine
offering work in Denmark next year. I fall into bed. Denmark? . . . I
wonder.

McMAHON Kelburne began their programme in the finals of the B Division
of the men's hockey European Club championship at Linwood yesterday with
a 7-1 victory over the highly fancied Stockholm, but coach Derek Forsyth
was anything but happy with his side's peformance.
Afterwards, Forsyth said: ''We played for only 20 minutes and after
that we fell out of it a bit.''
That was a fair reflection of the proceedings, but with a 4-0
advantage after 27 minutes and a match coming up today against Racing
Club of France which undoubtedly will decide who goes through to
Monday's final, it was little wonder some of the Kelburne players
switched off.
Dave McKay, the left winger, was certainly not one of them. He scored
a brilliant hat trick while the evergreen Billy Anderson, apart from
creating two of their goals, scored two himself to give the Paisley men
a perfect start.
Michael Starling, the captain, was unquestionably instrumental in
paving the way for their triumph.
He converted their first penalty corner in seven minutes. The
remaining goal came from 17-year-old Ross McPherson, who was one of five
teenagers who took the pitch at some stage of the contest.
It was not such a good day for Western Klick Photopoint in the women's
championship in Utrecht, Holland.
They played out a 1-1 draw against Stade Francais with Sheena McKelvie
scoring the equaliser in the forty-seventh minute after Monica Malzacher
had put the Parisians ahead on the stroke of half-time.
Mags Barbour, the Western manager, said after the match: ''This is a
disappointing start. We dominated the game for long spells with the
French settling into a defensive shell and hitting on the counter
attack.'' She continued: ''Unfortunately this tactic worked for them on
this occasion.''
It was also a bad day for the English side Leicester. They were beaten
2-1 by Fiauliai from Lithuania and as a result of this reversal
Leicester's prospects of contesting their final have receded
considerably. Results:
Men. Racing Club of France 7, Whitchurch 2; Minsk 4, Grammarians 1;
Stockholm 1, McMahon Kelburne 7; Wein Cobra 0, T J Hostivar 0.
Women. Leicester 1, Fiauliai 2; Western Klick Photopoint 1, Stade
Francais 1; Berlin 3, Randelstown 0; Kampong 3, Swansea 0.

THE Scottish World Cup squad has become involved in a fresh row with
the South African rugby authorities after a request to remain in the
team hotel in Pretoria was turned down.
As part of the RWC schedule, the Scots are due to move out of the
hotel they have occupied since arriving here 17 days ago.
Manager Duncan Paterson had appealed to the South African Rugby
Football Union and the tournament organisers for permission to remain
where they are instead of relocating to another hotel in the city.
The Scottish squad and management are scheduled to vacate the hotel on
Monday to make way for the All Blacks and the Irish side.
The request to stay put in the interests of continuity and to prevent
unnecessary upheaval was made two days ago, but as of last night the
manager had not heard the official decision.
However, RWC chief press officer Chris Thau told The Herald that SARFU
had turned down the Scottish request and that the decision was supported
by RWC.
Paterson declared: ''I have heard nothing officially, so at this stage
it is merely a rumour that we are being told to move.
''This is a world event and it should not be run on the basis of
rumour and second-hand information.''
He added: ''If, indeed, it is true that we are being forced to move to
another hotel within the city then the logic of that escapes me and,
once again, this is an example of the players' interests not being put
first.''
Earlier this week the Scottish Rugby Union was involved in another row
with SARFU when the players' daily cash allowance was delayed and the
Union had to withdraw #9500 of its own cash to make up the temporary
shortfall.
Paterson said: ''I want to hear it officially and I want to hear the
logical explanation for it but, I can assure you, we have not heard the
last of this.''

AUSTRALIA coach Bob Dwyer has accused England of being being
over-sensitive about jibes by David Campese, which appeared in a World
Cup match programme.
England officials have complained to tournament organisers after
spotting Campese's comments, one of which suggested captain Will Carling
played rugby ''like a castrated bull''.
But Dwyer said: ''I don't know what England are complaining about.
They're old quotes. I presume they're not complaining about Campo, just
the people who printed them. If they're over-sensitive, it's got nothing
to do with the football.''
The offending paragraphs appeared in a selection of quotes, many of
them dating back to the 1991 World Cup, in the programme for England's
match against Italy in Durban on Wednesday.
Campese says: ''Carling himself epitomises England's lack of skills.
He has speed and bulk but plays like a castrated bull''.
He is further quoted as saying: ''Even if I had been born English, I
would never have wanted to play for such a conservative mob. Forget
footballs; the only thing you're likely to get on the end of an English
backline is chillblains.''
England and the Wallabies could meet in the quarter-finals in Cape
Town next weekend, a repeat of the 1991 final.

BEN Crenshaw, using his old putter, nicknamed ''Little Ben'',
recaptured his Masters form to tie for the lead after the second round
at the $1.7m Memorial Tournament in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday.
Crenshaw, who has been suffering a ''Masters hangover'' since his
emotional victory in April, carded four-under-par 68 on the waterlogged
Muirfield Village course.
He was joined at nine-under 135 by fellow American Robert Gamez (67),
one stroke ahead of a group including two-time Open champoin Greg Norman
(70).
''I've never seen it so wet here,'' said Crenshaw. ''It's a slog. I
putted well again. I made some putts.''
A frustrated Nick Faldo frittered away numerous birdie chances in an
even-par 72. ''It's the best and worst I've ever shot,'' said Faldo, who
is five strokes off the lead.
''I had 13 birdie chances, and 10 of them were inside 15 feet. It's
disappointing really. I'll just have to wait for the putts to drop.''
Leading scores (USA unless stated):
135 -- R Gamez 68, 67; B Crenshaw 67, 68.
136 -- V Singh (Fiji) 69, 67; M Hulbert 68, 68; B Lietzke 69, 67; P
Jacobsen 68, 68; G Norman (Australia) 66, 70.
137 -- S Elkington (Australia) 69, 68; F Zoeller 70, 67; M O'Meara 66,
71.
138 -- T Watson 67, 71; B Glasson 72, 66; J McGovern 65, 73; S Simpson
68, 70.
Other scores included: 140 -- N Faldo (England) 68, 72. 142 -- N Price
(Zimbabwe) 71, 71. 143 -- J Parnevik (Sweden) 73, 70.
* DALE Eggeling shot a three-under-par round of 69 yesterday to add to
her opening 63 in the LPGA Oldsmobile Classic at East Lansing, Michigan.
Eggeling leads Elaine Crosby, Kris Tschetter, and Joan Pitcock by
three strokes with Betsy King a further shot off the pace. Leading
scores (USA unless stated):
132 -- D Eggerling 63, 69.
135 -- E Crosby 67, 68; K Tschetter 69, 66; Joan Pitcock 66, 69.
136 -- B King 68, 68.
Scottish scores: 140 -- P Wright 71, 69. 143 -- K Marshall 72, 71. 146
-- C Matthew 72, 74

THE Chancellor, widely criticised by the financial cognoscenti for
failing to raise interest rates last month, has been vindicated, by
evidence that the economy has been slowing down. It is growing still,
but at a weakening pace, and it looks as if order books are signalling
the continuance of this trend. Yet not every signal is the same and
there are worries that price pressures may be building up. Mr Clarke
will have to face much the same dilemma as he did last month when he
meets the Governor of the Bank of England again next week. Given his
previous very cautious stance, Mr George is likely to argue once more
for higher rates, though no doubt he would be satisfied with a
half-point movement this time, rather than the full point that most
pessimists were expecting last month. Their case will have been
reinforced by evidence that consumer credit has recently grown quite
strongly. Yet the fact remains that retail sales have not moved ahead
sharply, any more than house prices -- which in two building society
surveys were found to have fallen last month -- and many commentators
are expecting a poor performance for the rest of the year.
This has always been a weaker recovery (as was always expected) than
previous swings from recession. It has been patchy between sectors and
regions and the two main propellants of previous upswings -- retail
spending and a buoyant housing market -- have been notably absent. For
many, therefore, the recovery is something of a mystery. Its existence
is statistically beyond doubt but its nature is unusual, and in many
respects greatly to be welcomed. It is export led (something every
Government has desired since the end of the Second World War) and it is
accompanied by low inflation, which means monetary measurements all seem
to be modest. They are low, for the purchasing power of money is
remaining stable to a degree not seen for over 30 years. The
significance of all this may not be popularly understood. In a low
inflationary environment, for example, low wage awards are not any more
derisory than low returns from fixed interest savings or the low cost of
purchase implied by stagnant house prices. In the latter case, the real
suffering comes from the borrowings which relate to the last price peak,
but even there lower interest rates will eventually confer some
compensation.
Moving from a high to a low inflationary environment can never be
achieved without cost, without pain even. Borrowers (and they include
the biggest borrower of them all, the state) are always advantaged by
inflation which steadily reduces the debt they owe. Lenders (savers) are
quite differently placed and, as inflation comes under control, begin to
get real returns on their money, though these do seem very low after
double-digit rewards. There is bound to be a period when the memory of
the old inflationary experience makes its low inflationary replacement
seem a poor exchange. In this inescapable doldrum the Government finds
itself placed, though its own difficulties are compounded by political
incompetence and, possibly, by the boredom too long a period in office
induces in the public mind. It may need to find a new vocabulary to
overcome the confusion the old, and technical, language of economic
description and debate. It also needs to keep money costs down. Mr
Clarke should use last month's vindicated judgment to repeat himself
next week.

WHAT is it about breakfast? I've eaten a few dinners in my time and
lunched out at some excellent restaurants, but it is the breakfasts
which remain in my memory more vividly than any of them. Why? Perhaps it
is because breakfast is the first meal of the day and therefore the one
which your body craves most. Another factor in common with great
breakfasts I have eaten, is that most of them were eaten away from home
base and were variations on my normal fare.
Most of us are deeply conservative when it comes to our breakfast
menu. The muesli man does not envy the porridge person. They could not
bear to swop and they are both equally despised by little Jack Horner
who sits in the corner with his bowl of prunes. All the above three
robust breakfasters would find a fruit juice and black coffee to be less
a petit dejeuner than a pathetic one.
Chacon a son gout, as they say in the country where you can have cold
pigs' trotters for breakfast. My wife adores this ''delicacy'', and when
our friend Basil arrives soon we are sure to have them aplenty. Basil
likes them so much he would drive across Europe from Moscow to get his
teeth into pigs' trotters. I think I will turn my chair to the wall to
avoid being confronted by the spectacle of two people devouring pigs'
trotters for breakfast.
However, I must concede that my own favourite and regular menu will
not be to everyone's taste. It begins with sliced orange or freshly
pressed orange juice, it's followed by a bowl of bran and prunes, and
finishes with toast (marmalade or honey depending on the day) and tea
(preferably Earl Grey). I find the smell of roast coffee seductive, but
it rarely delivers what it promises. Tea, made with our lovely Scottish
water, is refreshing, invigorating, and the perfect accompaniment to
toast with whatever preserve is chosen.
Now that I have taken you into the inner secrets of my breakfast
table, I will take self disclosure even further and tell you about those
breakfasts which stick in my memory. The first was in the early sixties
at my grandparents' cottage in the Carse of Gowrie. Granny made her own
dropscones and girdle scones on a paraffin stove and, as they emerged
from the flat iron girdle, she wrapped them in a tea towel to cool down.
The product was excellent with butter and jam. But superb when fried
with a farm egg and bacon for breakfast. For high days and holy days
(except for religionists who abstain from pork) add a slice of black
pudding and a couple of slices of Ulster fry, the tasty oval-shaped
bacon-style product.
That breakfast experience was repeated on many weekends, fortifying me
for garden chores. My next great breakfast was in November 1967 after an
awful train journey from St Andrews to Bristol for a student debate,
which included a train change in the middle of the night at Crewe. The
full English breakfast was manna to my debating partner, Gillies Clark,
and myself, but the highlight was the coffee and buttered toast, of
which several rounds were ordered by the famished travellers.
There was a more unusual setting for the next breakfast -- the top of
a mountain in Vermont, US, in August 1977. The hotel which served it
could be reached by road from the rear of the mountain, but my
companions and I had reached it the hard way, by a rugged early-morning
hike through the steep forest. We felt we had earned our waffles and
maple syrup, bacon and egg, and hash brown potatoes. Truly a
mountain-top experience.
In October 1988, I had less in quantity to eat in an apartment near
Kavala in north-east Greece, but the quality made up for it. Free-range
eggs with orange yellow yolks of incomparable flavour, plus fried bread
and tomatoes done in olive oil which were washed down by coffee as I sat
overlooking a stunningly beautiful and deserted beach.
Last but not least was the breakfast I had the same year with the
Pentecostal preachers of the Deep South Bible Belt in Alabama of which I
wrote a few years ago. I learned how to mix the runny yolk of my eggs
with ''grits'' and a whole lot more about the exploits of these wild men
of evangelism whose hobby was to conduct crusades in Central America,
motoring down in their camper trucks like border raiders. Their captives
were not killed Comanchero-style but lived to see another life as
born-again Christians.
Perhaps it is not without coincidence that two of my five Big
Breakfasts were in the US, home of the prayer breakfast. If the way to a
man's heart is through his stomach, maybe they know something. Business
breakfasts are also more common across the Atlantic. Tycoons with a
heavy schedule start the day with a light breakfast combined with their
first meeting. I have never been at such a meeting or a prayer
breakfast. However, I suspect that those who are susceptible to good
food may be more suggestible at breakfast. Perhaps that is why it is
used as a selling tactic by businessmen and those marketing a brand of
religion which often uses the methods of big business.
This is a worrying thought. If I stepped off a transatlantic flight
and was given a big breakfast of fried pancakes, maple syrup, free-range
eggs, Ulster fry, and black pudding -- and then given the Toronto
blessing, would I be born again or simply be sick? However, the odds are
I would remember the breakfast.

WORLD CUP ROUND-UP
Wales have made eight changes -- four of them positional -- from the
side beaten by New Zealand for tomorrow's decisive World Cup pool C
clash with Ireland in Johannesburg.
Coach Alex Evans, who made 10 changes in all to the side which beat
Japan to face New Zealand, has again not been afraid the ring the
changes.
Robert Jones wins the scrum half vote over Andy Moore which means he
will break the Welsh appearance record for the position, having equalled
the 53-cap total of Gareth Edwards against the All Blacks on Wednesday.
* IRELAND'S selectors have kept faith with the experience of Brendan
Mullin for tomorrow's match. Mullin, who has 52 caps, has looked out of
form in Ireland's matches against New Zealand and Japan.
But the Irish management said they felt that replacement Philip
Danaher, who arrived in South Africa earlier in the week following
full-back Jim Staples' wrist injury, had not had enough time to
acclimatise fully.
* SOUTH Africa will attempt to recapture the euphoric high of their
win in the opening match of the World Cup when they meet Canada in Port
Elizabeth today.
The return of captain Francois Pienaar is one of five changes to the
South Africa team to face Canada, who are seeking what would be the
greatest win in their history.
* SKY TV have been cleared to report on the World Cup again after
appealing successfully against a ban for breaking media rules.
World Cup spokesman Chris Thau said Sky had promised from now on they
would follow official guidelines, which allow only South African
Broadcasting Corporation cameras inside match venues and other specified
areas.
Sky had its accreditation withdrawn on Tuesday after its crews were
caught working in restricted areas.

I AGREE wholeheartedly with the views expressed by Ronald Cook on the
wording of the System 3 poll in the run-up to the Perth and Kinross
by-election (May 29).
The option of a Scottish Parliament with substantial powers, but
within the framework of the British Government, does not represent
anything on offer by any of the unionist parties, but I suppose is
intended to cover the devolution option. What is meant by ''substantial
powers'', and is it correct to refer to this body as a parliament?
In the context of the European Union, who would consider that
Strathclyde region, for instance, has substantial powers? That appears
to be the level of devolution for Scotland proposed by the Labour Party.
And even that may be further watered down, as happened to the Labour
proposals for a Welsh Assembly.
The reported 68% of Labour supporters favouring a Scottish parliament
with substantial powers would be well advised to change their
allegiance, because the Labour Party certainly does not have any such
parliament in mind for Scotland.
The real choice facing the Scottish people is the straightforward one
of independence or the status quo. The time when any form of devolution
of power was an option is long past.

IS Roseanna Cunningham, the victor of Perth and Kinross, a closet
monarchist after all, despite her protestations of republicanism? It was
noted that after the result had been declared the winning candidate
appeared carrying a large bouquet of roses.
The significance of this lies not in the choice of flower, an
appropriate one in view of the lady's name, but in the colour of the
blooms -- white ''Prince Charlie's Roses'', the emblem of the Jacobites,
be they Scottish, English, or Irish.
Is she planning not only the disappearance of the House of Windsor,
but its replacement by some king/queen from ''across the water''?
Two days after the election you carried a report of the Queen's visit
to the City of Aberdeen when she was presented with a bed of roses for
the gardens at Balmoral. It is to be hoped for Her Majesty's peace of
mind that they were not white roses.
The SNP's antipathy to red roses is understandable in view of their
association with the Labour Party and England's rugby team. However,
perhaps their adoption of the white rose is something of a mistake as
this was the emblem of the Old Pretender, James Stuart, son of King
James II, who before his accession had been the Duke of York.
Is this Jacobite rose in reality the famous White Rose of York -- a
very English Rose indeed.

Graeme Hick beat Sri Lankan Aravinda de Silva to the fastest
first-class century of the season yesterday.
The England batsman warmed up for the first Test against the West
Indies at Headingley next week by reaching three figures off just 76
balls for Worcestershire against Surrey at New Road -- beating Andrew
Symonds' 93-ball ton for Gloucestershire earlier this season.
The 29-year-old Hick hit nineteen 4s and three 6s in his 120 in 124
minutes -- the eighty-first century of his career.
Meanwhile de Silva, who resumed overnight for Kent against Durham at
Chester-Le-Street on 79 off 68 deliveries, added only four more runs
before being caught. His dismissal sparked a Kent collapse from 144 for
four in the morning to 175 for seven. Rain later washed out play with
them standing on 272 for nine.
Mark Lathwell and Richard Harden cracked half-centuries as Somerset
made a solid reply to Yorkshire's 413 at Taunton.
Harden hit an unbeaten 65 while Lathwell, who hit nine boundaries,
finished on 61 as Somerset reached 248 for four at the close.
Fifteen wickets tumbled at Lord's. Resuming on 258 for six, Derbyshire
added just nine runs before being bowled out but hit back to restrict
Middlesex to 174, for whom Jason Pooley (85 not out) became the first
player to carry his bat through an innings since Wilf Slack against
Yorkshire at Headingley in 1986.
At the close, Derbyshire reached 83 for one, -- a commanding lead of
176 runs.
Bowlers were also on top at Cardiff, where Glamorgan failed by one run
to avoid the follow-on against Hampshire. After having been shot out for
174 -- exactly 150 adrift -- Glamorgan struggled again, reaching 155 for
six.
Bill Athey and Franklyn Stephenson both struck centuries to help
Sussex pile up 482 for seven and a commanding lead of 280 against
Gloucestershire at Hove.
Resuming on 113 for four, opener Athey batted all day to reach 163 not
out -- his fiftieth first-class 100 -- and only six adrift of his
previous best score for the county. The former England star added 162 in
46 overs with Stephenson for the sixth wicket.
After Stephenson fell for 106, hitting thirteen 4s and four 6s, Athey
shared a 126-run stand with Ian Salisbury and added 76 more with
debutant Nicky Phillips.
Paul Prichard struck his first century of the season -- 109 -- to
leave Essex's clash with Nottinghamshire evenly balanced at Trent
Bridge.

ANDRE Agassi kept on course for his first French Open triumph with an
impressive straight-sets, third-round victory over Spaniard Francisco
Clavet in Paris yesterday.
The world No.1, who has yet to drop a set in the tournament, beat
Clavet 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 to set up a relatively easy clash against
unheralded Moroccan Younes El Aynaoui, the world No.224, who beat
Australian Andrew Ilie 6-2, 7-5, 6-2.
''I'm glad I won easily because, on clay, the most important side is
the physical side,'' said Agassi. ''Physical toughness in this
tournament is more important than mental toughness.''
If he finally breaks his Roland-Garros duck after having lost the 1990
and 1991 finals, he would become the first player since Australia's Rod
Laver to win the four Grand Slams.
''It would be an incredible accomplishment and I'm not going to allow
myself to think about it until I win it,'' he said.
Austrian Thomas Muster, the best player on clay this season, had an
easy passage past Spain's Carlos Costa. He claimed his thirty-first
straight clay-court triumph, winning 6-3, 7-5, 6-2, and now faces
Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev -- the 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 conqueror of
No.11 seed Alberto Berasategui. Muster has lost only one set in Paris.
''Every year I think Thomas comes here as a leading contender and this
year even more so. I could meet him in the semi-finals but we will have
a lot of work to do in the meantime,'' added Agassi.
The No.13 seed Jim Courier, French champion in 1991 and 1992, beat
Christian Ruud 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 and is another American who has yet to drop
a set. But eighth-seeded Wayne Ferreira fell in straight sets to Alex
Corretja, of Spain, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2. He is the sixth men's seed to go out
this week.
In women's play, Conchita Martinez indicated that she would be a
serious contender for a second Paris title by stopping local favourite
Julie Halard in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2.
Wimbledon champion Martinez, seeded fourth, has yet to lose on clay
this season after 23 outings.
Steffi Graf has remained unbeaten this year despite a back injury at
the end of last season and a fit of flu last month. She disposed of
Italian Nathalie Baudone 6-2, 6-1 in 44 minutes. Eighth-seeded Gabriela
Sabatini, of Argentina, defeated Romanian Irina Spirlea 6-3, 6-4.
Britain's Clare Wood and Ukrainian partner Olga Lugina lost 6-4, 6-3
to No.4 seeded Americans Nicole Arendt and Lindsay Davenport in the
first round of the women's doubles.

GEORGE Dillingham looks the one to be on in the big race at Ayr, the
High Speed Handicap. He showed his potential when running on strongly to
take sixth in the Ebor after a deal of traffic problems and runs off the
same mark as when successful at Haydock last July. The outsider of the
quartet can assert over the veteran Latvian, an Edinburgh specialist,
who looks weighted to the best of his form.
The Kilwinning Handicap can fall to Super Rocky. After a luckless
winter campaign on the all-weather, he was rested until Monday, when he
beat Stolen Kiss a short head at Doncaster. If he can maintain that form
he should have the edge over Rich Glow, a narrow winner here last month
(Diet held). Ned's Bonanza was beaten by the draw last time out and can
be forgiven that run, but looks anchored by top weight.
Triple Joy can cause an upset in Newmarket's Charlotte Stakes.
Impeccably bred, by Derby runner-up Most Welcome out of a mare by Mill
Reef, the selection has had a busy winter, winning four times between
November and February. She ran up to her best last time out over today's
course and distance and a line through the winner, Lake Coniston, puts
her ahead of Branston Abby. Although she has yet to win on turf, her
greater strength should be enough to see off the younger Tanami.
Seigneurial showed a deal of promise in his debut season, running
consistently well with two smart wins from his first three runs. He
looks well handicapped and can make a winning return in the NGK Spark
Plugs Handicap. Saint Express looks the danger.
At Lingfield, Fard stands out from the rest in the Tote Credit Leisure
Stakes. Having comfortably won the Middle Park Stakes, he ran creditably
behind the all-conquering Pennekamp in the Dewhurst. He can defy top
weight among these more mundane rivals.
* VICTORY in the #30,000 Coral Sprint Handicap at Newmarket can go to
the improving Coastal Bluff, writes White and Gold.
David Barron's charge confirmed the promise of his first two outings
when winning at Nottingham back in April, proving too strong for La
Suquet inside the final furlong over the minimum distance.

KEEP Battling (7-2), a short-head winner at Ayr yesterday, has become
a changed character since joining Jim Goldie at Uplawmoor.
He ran nine times without success for trainer Alan Harrison in
Yorkshire but the double winner over hurdles has won both his races on
the Flat since moving to Scotland.
High Pyrenees (5-1) who cost 11,000gns out of Luca Cumani's stable,
proved too good for Sheikh Mohammed's Wurlitzer in the Cairnryan Maiden
Stakes. Nicky Connorton was suspended by the Ayr stewards for two days,
June 11 and 12, for failing to weigh in after having finished fourth on
True Bird.

THE German car firm, Mercedes, are backing their national sailing team
with #5m in a bid to retain the Admiral's Cup next month. Regatta Team
Scotland, crewing the largest of Britain's three-boat fleet, have less
than one-thirtieth of that figure, though they are pursuing commercial
backing which should launch a new boat and make their effort more
competitive.
But the Largs-based group do have a secret weapon. Campbeltown-born
Rodney Pattisson, arguably Britain's most successful yachtsman ever, has
been pressed into service.
He is renowned for intimidating opponents almost as much by
psychological warfare as the skill at the helm which brought him two
Olympic golds and a silver, three world, and four European Flying
Dutchman titles, and world one-ton and two quarter-ton titles.
The state-of-the-art vessels at Cowes next month will severely test
the Scots, but Pattisson's family has a spectacular record against
seemingly invincible German craft.
Pattisson was on board the RTS 51-footer Geronimo for the last race of
the Rover Scottish Series, which concluded on Tuesday at Tarbert.
Afterwards, as he relaxed with his new Admiral's Cup colleagues for the
first time, there was no shortage of ripping nautical yarns.
''But have you got any psychological ploy to put over the Germans?''
asked one of the crew.
Rodney responded by relating a piece of family history, from May 1941
-- when his father, Kenneth, in a Swordfish bomber, unleashed the
torpedo which crippled the steering of the battleship Bismarck, leaving
the pride of the German navy helpless, waiting to be sunk by the
shellfire and torpedoes of the Royal Navy. ''Just tell them my father
sank the Bismarck!''
It may take something almost as explosive to give Geronimo, a previous
winner of the Fastnet race, victory next month, for she was not designed
to compete under the prevailing new rules. Owner Steve Smith, a Stirling
businessman, acknowledged as much after the twenty-first anniversary
Scottish Series. Although his boat finished well ahead in every race, on
handicap it could do no better than fifth.
However Smith is confident of chartering an American yacht, Numbers,
which will be much nearer the specification of its rivals.
A former submariner -- he served in the Royal Navy for 10 years -- and
a fitness fanatic, Pattisson is determined to whip his crew into shape.
Former Scotland under-21 rugby prop Stephen Baird, a 17[1/2]-stone
grinder, is on a diet, having been instructed to lose 35lb.
Born in Campbeltown where his father was stationed, Pattisson also
co-skippered the 1983 America's Cup yacht, Victory, though even his
talents, combined with those of Lawrie Smith, could not prevent
Britain's defeat by the Aussie boat which took the cup from the USA.
At the Mexico Olympics, where Pattisson won his first Olympic gold, he
pulled several stunts which had his opponents reeling.
He produced a battery-powered wind indicator, which had never been
used before, provoking protests galore. Then he invented a revolutionary
centreboard for his Flying Dutchman. ''Soon every other boat in Acapulco
was hacking their spare centreboard to pieces, trying to copy mine --
you could not get a set of screws in Acapulco. Actually I ditched the
new board, and used the conventional one.''
He finally drove his opponents distracted thanks to the intervention
of a British pilot. After rain storms, muddied rivers poured into the
blue waters of Acapulco Bay, making it possible to read what the
currents were doing. Obviously riding these currents would increase
speed. The pilot charted the currents, then dropped a message in a
bottle to Pattisson's dinghy.
''It didn't matter if there was nothing in the bottle -- the rest of
the competitors could see it being dropped before their eyes. After
that, aircraft were banned over Olympic yachting courses. There was a
bit of a habit of rules being changed after I tried things . . .''
He has had his share of hairy moments. During the 1979 Fastnet race,
when 15 people died, he was among the crew of 10 helicoptered off Golden
Apple's liferaft.
Matter-of-factly, he recounts how the raft was so fragile that the
mooring rope ripped off as they tried to hold it in the lee of the boat
for the crew to climb in. The helicopter could not lift them off the
yacht because of its tangled rig. Under pressure, he confirms that the
wind was blowing at between 60 and 70 knots, with waves 40-50 feet high.
Pattisson jumped in and held the raft to the side of the Golden Apple.
The crew embarked and they were all air-lifted to safety.
''Married? I never had time. I dedicated myself to the Olympics for 12
years. You are away so much it's hardly conducive to long-term
relationships. Totally driven? I guess I was, yes.''
Pattisson makes a living by selling folding trimarans, and insists he
now sails mainly for fun. ''The Admiral's Cup is not really a commercial
venture for me. I just like to enjoy my sailing, with people I like, and
I tend to be choosy.''
His decision to sail with the Scottish crew is such a choice. ''The
Admiral's Cup is a British venture. Frankly, it has been much too
English. There are very good yachtsmen in Scotland, and they should be
encouraged. And even if they fail this time, it is a learning curve for
the future.''

MR STORRIE states that if he has a house for sale valued at #100,000
he would put the sale at offers over #75,000.
He is all in favour of the offers over sale. Based on this statement I
am not surprised.
He does not mention just how many couples acting in good faith, and
having worked out how much they could afford, and sent in a surveyor,
then found out the true valuation and that is was outside their budget.
Mr Storrie's method, if he uses the same tactics on all his sales, is
in my opinion rather sharp practice.
Between estate agents and solicitors and the public there is surely to
be good faith and professionalism.
I am sure more would-be purchasers would rather deal with a
long-standing law firm which has a good reputation on house sales.
With the market in Scotland as it stands, I personally would rather
see all sales at a fixed price. In my opinion this would assist in some
way towards getting the market moving. At least it would generate sales.
Houses are homes and no longer investments for quick profit as in the
80s.

THERE are some who believe that Ernie Walker was an inappropriate
choice to head the commission that will examine Scottish football, SFA
and all, as he has spent most of his adult life as a member of the
association establishment. The problem with that assessment is that it
does not recognise the nature of the man. Walker's career has been
motivated by two obsessions, football and Scotland, and if he has done
rather well for himself along the way, envy of that achievement should
not be allowed to detract from the strengths that led him there.
In any case, as he puts it, where would it be possible to find a
football man who knows the SFA intricacies, its committees,
complexities, and foibles, who is not a current working member of the
association? Examining the SFA and all its warts will be one major task
of the commission appointed by its chief executive, Jim Farry, which
will go in tandem with the investigation of the country's deterioration
in football quality.
Walker and his five-man committee, which will be in place soon (but he
aint tellin' who they are yet), want to attempt to find out why the
young talent of yesteryear appears not to be surfacing at the higher
levels of the game nowadays.
That will be tackled with the administrative acumen which has been so
impressive outwith his own country's borders that Walker is now one of
the most powerful and influential football men in the world.
Having spent 32 years at the SFA, he could not be accused of lack of
commitment to its cause but that will not prevent him taking a close
look at all aspects of its operation.
''If people wish to criticise my appointment that is up to them, but
it was the SFA who came to me, not the other way round,'' he says.
Walker and his commission envisage sitting for two or three years but
his own view is that the effect of the findings may not be seen for
about five years.
''Some folk seem to think we can do something about the premier
division next season but that is not the name of this exercise. If you
ask any premier division manager he will tell you that he is not getting
the talent through the ranks that there used to be.
''We have to try to find out why that is. Something seems to have gone
wrong with the supply of people who can play a wee bit.
''Now we have athletic players who seem to be stuck in a certain role
from an early age without ever having learned how to play so, clearly,
something needs to be looked at there. That is why I will be seeking
outside help.'' That will come in the shape of two foreigners among the
commission and maybe we could guess one at least would be Dutch,
although he was determinedly silent in that context.
He was exactly the opposite when asked about the other strand of the
inquiry, the investigation of the workings of the SFA. ''We will go
through the rule book, all the articles of the association, to see which
are effective, which are outdated and which could maybe do with change.
''There are many things which the SFA has to carry out because the
rule book requires it to do so. Nowadays a number of them seem to
infuriate the world at large but because it upsets people doesn't mean
it is bad. You can be right and not be popular.''
It seemed appropriate at that point to remind him that there were one
or two occasions when he could have claimed that distinction himself.
''It is an enormous task all told and it could not have been tackled
by the SFA. It is hard enough keeping the ship afloat there without
taking on a two or three-year inquiry alongside the daily crises.''
Walker is in the process of looking for an office in Glasgow from
where the commission will be administered. ''We are almost ready to roll
but until the new SFA committees are in place we can't get the terms of
reference approved until that is done. In terms of meeting we probably
won't begin until the start of the season.''
''However successful this turns out to be, it is a major step forward
in that it recognises that Scottish football is deficient. For Scots to
admit that about anything, but particularly about football, is a
considerable achievement and that is why there is a shining light
peeping over the horizon. There is the acknowledgement that we are not
as good as we used to think we were.''
The question that many will want to ask is why bother at all? The
lifestyle of the man who, perhaps more than any other living Scot,
epitomises the modern European, has no need at all to get embroiled in
domestic matters any more.
Since he retired he has become so much in demand by UEFA and FIFA that
he has some difficulty fitting in the games of golf at Haggs Castle
which he had envisaged would take up much of his time.
He has been given almost complete autonomy in terms of stadium
decisions for major European matches.
Last week he was in Holland and Belgium listening to their bid for the
Euro 2000, meeting with the Belgian Prime Minister, the mayors of
Brussels, Bruges, Liege, Anderlecht, Charlerois, Rotterdam, and Arnheim.
''It is a highly political, indeed much more significant role in life
than I could ever have domestically but I am still Scottish and Scottish
football remains my basic roots. This opportunity to contribute to an
improvement in the Scottish situation is much too tempting to let go.''
Walker will continue with all his other activities, including being
chairman of the UEFA stadium committee which takes up much of his time.
He is also executive director of the Eastern European Assistance Bureau,
with an office in Geneva, a body he set up to administer material and
educational help for all of the new countries that were formerly part of
the USSR.
He has been round them all, meeting the presidents, assessing whether
or not they were in a fit state to take part in European football. As a
consequence, he has drawn up plans to give them assistance, now
amounting to #1.5m per year backed up by monies from western
associations.
''To my knowledge football is the only structure doing anything in
concrete terms to help and it is not just because of a moral duty. In
our own interests we cannot have this imbalance in Europe.''
Walker is also one of UEFA's senior match delegates. He decides the
risk category of all the major matches and then he attends the more
risky games where there may be political or other problems. He is one of
a panel of experts who adjudicate in tribunals which sort out
international disputes all over Europe.
One of his tasks that few are aware of was to draw up the financial
formula to be adopted by UEFA for the Champions' League, a philosophy
for which Rangers and others can be grateful.
He has also recently retired as chairman of the Health Education of
Scotland, the body which is responsible for those chilling anti-smoking
advertisements among other things.
His own normal rude health was hit by illness during the summer last
year, so much so that he missed the World Cup in the USA, but he is
fighting fit again and ready to take on the job of telling Scottish
football what is wrong with it. He will need to be fit to face the
debate that will follow.

HERE'S your weekend starter for ten:
* Which part of the country houses a virtual science park, based on
network computer systems linking people at homes and offices all over
the place for the common purpose of running their businesses?
* Which conference and exhibition centre takes in #80m of profitable
revenue each year?
* Where are nine universities amicably working together to create a
joint regional regeneration strategy based on enhanced partnerships
between acedemia and business?
* Which docks complex confidently expects to be handling a quarter of
the UK's international traffic by 2000?
* Which shopping centre sells more per square foot than London's
Oxford Circus?
* And where is a Korean conglomerate currently building a #600m
industrial park which should ultimately provide 3000 jobs?
You may not be surprised to learn that none of these developments is
housed in Scotland. They are all located in the north of England, to be
precise (and in order) Leeds, Harrogate, Yorkshire, Humber, Sheffield's
Meadowhall Centre and Samsung at Teeside.
My point is that while we rightly pride ourselves in Scotland for our
recent economic performance by comparison with the English regions,
those regions are now fighting back aggressively with increasing effect.
In the two decades since the mid-1970s Scotland has had the undoubted
benefit of a single development agency, first the SDA and now Scottish
Enterprise, working to lead and co-ordinate economic activity on a
national basis (not, of course, forgetting the efforts of HIDB and HIE).
Combined with our decentralised Government machinery in the form of
the Scottish Office, this arrangement has enabled us to overcome many of
our inherent structural difficulties by comparison with the rest of the
UK.
Sure, we have failed to get our act together in such crucial areas as
transport infrastructure and skills training. We also lag behind most of
the country when it comes to business start-ups, unemployment and
health. But just imagine how much worse things might be had we not had
this key advantage in being able to co-ordinate economic development
activity.
Over most of those two decades such levels of co-ordination were
notably non-existent throughout England whether on a national or
regional basis. Typically a group of local authorities in a region would
fund the launch of a development agency, and then hamper its efforts by
squabbling over objectives and the spoils of investment.
I well recall a private conversion several years ago with the chief
executive of Inward, the north-west's equivalent of Locate in Scotland,
in which this normally positive individual raged in frustration at the
impossible task he had been set by his warring masters and their
irreconcilable objectives.
But this important advantage is now disappearing. The English regions
are getting their economic development acts together with a vengeance,
displaying a hitherto unknown willingness to join partnership ventures
in pursuit of the big jobs fish. Not only are local authorities
co-operating but they are being joined by a wide range of other
organisations from TECs to chambers of commerce.
Some of the impetus is coming from the newly-formed Government offices
set up to co-ordinate the efforts of central government in the regions.
Some of it comes from English Partnerships, the former English Estates
which has been restructured as the Government's strategic regeneration
agency with powers similar to those of the old SDA.
Bearing in mind our long and honourable tradition in Scotland of being
blind to events elsewhere in the UK, we cannot afford to ignore the
consequent loss of our competitive advantage. Although our economy
continues to suffer from quite specific structural problems we will not
receive any more favourable treatment.
It would therefore be wise for the Scottish economic development
industry to keep more than a wary eye on the situation south of the
Border. Little of what we are doing here, whether it be single-industry
business parks or international telecoms networks, is not now happening
elsewhere in the English regions as the above list of projects suggests.
And sometimes they achieve greater success in terms of employment or
investment that we can manage.
Add this scenario to the devolution debate currently raging in
Scotland and some interesting issues demand to be answered. Which
politician, for example, is going to be brave enough to start talking
about the need for a national economic development strategy for Scotland
to enable us to compete more effectively with the English regions?

which has served publishers, booksellers, and the general reading public
so well for almost 100 years by ensuring the widest choice and
pre-eminent value in the production, distribution, and purchase of books
of all kinds.
We at Jordanbooks, the only independent publishing house in the West

I AM afraid the letter from Larry Cairns is inaccurate (June 1).
There have been discussions about the possibility of providing better
care for people with learning disabilities, currently in Lennox Castle
and other hospitals for a number of years predating the Government's
care-in-the-community policies.
Rather than having rights now denied them, this group is going to
receive, at long last, the rights to be treated as full citizens and to
live in the community along with everyone else.
The critical factor, now, is to ensure that the care provided is
appropriately and individually planned and that the right level of
support is provided in the community.
For some it may mean living relatively independently, with support;
for others it may mean a place in the group or other home, undoubtedly
some run by private agencies but many run, still, by the local authority
or by voluntary organisations such as our own subsidiary charitable
company, ENABLE Homes.
These arrangements are likely to cost the health and social work
authorities more than the current hospital care. Very few people with
learning disabilities currently in hospital will have the means to make
a payment themselves to this care and there is no liability falling to
their near relatives.
Indeed, it is because of the cost to the State of these new measures
that their implementation has been delayed for too long.
Mr Cairns suggests that these plans have been carried out in secret. I
would counter this by saying that there has been discussion in a public
forum for a long time. Moreover, organisations like ENABLE which
represent people with learning disabilities and their carers have been
and are continuing to be consulted by the statutory bodies involved.

I AM appalled to read of the award of the contract to care for 90
mentally-ill and elderly patients in Ayrshire by Ayrshire and Arran
Health Board to an American company which has made millions of dollars
from health care (May 31).
Like many others, I am mystified how the chairman of the health board
can state that ''we have got the best deal possible''. For the patients?
For the health board? For the US company's shareholders?
It appears to me that the elderly and mentally ill are in some cases
being put in the same category as public utilities. I fail to see how
the elderly or mentally infirm can get the best treatment applicable to
them when there is a profit motive involved.
This, of course, is increasingly the case in the care of the elderly
where their life's savings can be utilised for their care in latter
years.
While some contribution is justifiable, it is absolutely immoral that
there should be a profit motive, particularly if a healthcare company is
involved, quoted on the Stock Market.

A LEAKED Government report suggests that John Major was looking to
encourage volunteering as part of the Make a Difference Initiative.
If John Major really wanted to make a difference he could look more
closely at how the voluntary sector is funded. He could look closely at
Citizen's Advice Bureaux, probably the biggest voluntary agency in
Scotland, which uses many volunteers to give free advice and information
to those most in need.
If John Major looked closely he would see that more volunteers
(although possibly desirable in some bureaux) would not make a
difference. CAB volunteers are not amateurs but well trained,
knowledgeable people who constantly are kept abreast of the latest
developments in the areas in which they give advice by equally well
trained and knowledgeable CAB support staff. To support and train these
volunteers (and staff) costs money and it's John Major's Government
which has squeezed the money available to the CAB to do just this.
Here in the Highlands the squeeze comes through the constriants on
funding from bodies such as the Highland Regional Council which are in
the process of seriously reducing funding available to CABs, and this at
a time when the CABs' workload is ever increasing.
If John Major really wanted to make a difference he could ensure that
those bodies which fund the voluntary sector have funds to do it.
Instead all he looks like doing is putting further stress and strain on
already pressurised organisations.

IT is fitting that, in the week the burgeoning Wiseman milk empire
announces its latest acquisition, from the Co-op, George Lindsay and his
brother Jim went public on a #10m-plus deal to sell control of the
excavation plant hire business they have built up over the past thirty
years.
George Lindsay, the driving force behind Kilmarnock-based Lindsay
Plant, and Wiseman's central dynamo, executive chairman Alan Wiseman,
have been close friends for years.
Indeed, when George Lindsay decided, in February last year, in the
days leading up to his 49th birthday, to take the first concrete steps
towards a possible sale, it was Alan Wiseman who advised him to seek
advice from the Glasgow office of financial advisers Arthur Andersen,
Wiseman's own auditors.
''I knew we would always unload the company some day,'' said George
Lindsay this week. ''People had been telling us for years what a
wonderful plant hire business we had. So I thought: That's fine but
let's get some indicative value on what all that effort's been worth.''
So he walked into AA's St Vincent Street office on that very birthday
and set the ball rolling. Within weeks Lindsay had his indicative
figures. By November last year, with the latest audited results for the
year to June to hand, a sales memorandum had been prepared.
On May 23, the paperwork was finally signed off on a deal which values
Lindsay Plant at #8m, leaves the Lindsay brothers each with a small
stake, gives a personal stake to three other Lindsay staff, and brings
in new management in the shape of Paul Garvey, backed by Royal Bank
Development Capital. Acronym enthusiasts face a new challenge. After
MBOs, MBIs and BIMBOs, how are we to characterise every feature of this
multi-faceted deal?
More seriously, why should the Lindsay brothers want to sell what is
widely regarded as a well-run, quality service, significantly profitable
business? ''Basically we were testing the market,'' Lindsay says. ''For
me it was just another possible deal. Even Andy Cole of Newcastle was
for sale for the right kind of cash.''
But behind that studiedly unsentimental approach to the sale of a
business he and brother Jim fashioned out of nothing from 1966 on, lie
other rigorously practical concerns. George is now fifty. Brother Jim,
who has masterminded Lindsay's service operations down the year but
leaves corporate concerns to George, is 53. Lindsay Plant now boasts a
fleet of more than 170 modern units, employs 200 people and has a
turnover touching #8m.
''I was conscious,'' explains George Lindsay, ''that, as the company
got bigger, I was sitting at the helm all on my own. If anything
happened to me, the company would be rudderless. So I was looking for
ways to beef up our corporate management.''
He and Paul Garvey have clearly hit it off. The former managing
director of Alexander Ross Holdings, the Carronshore-based family-owned
group which makes speciality soaps and distributes industrial chemicals
and janitorial supplies, 42-year-old Garvey had been looking for a fresh
opportunity.
''I joined Alexander Ross in 1989 as finance director and was made
group managing director in 1992. Although Scottish Fine Soaps is very
much the fashion side of the group, I concentrated on building up the
distribution business. I spent a lot of time acquiring companies down
south and, by the time I left, we had raised turnover to #14m.
''Alexander Ross is still a family-owned business and the reason I was
on the look-out for a new challenge like Lindsay was that, ultimately, I
was building the Ross business for someone else.''
Garvey was introduced to Douglas Kearney at the Glasgow office of
Royal Bank Development Capital. Together they began to explore various
options. There was a buy-out in northern England which didn't come off.
And talk of a start-up. Then the Garvey/Royal Bank team heard that
Lindsay Plant might be for sale.
''I wasn't interested in either a high turnover, low-margin business
or a turnaround situation,'' adds Garvey. ''In a turnaround, if you go
in with high leverage, you are just looking for trouble. And low-margin
businesses are that much harder to grow. I was looking for a well-run,
profitable company.''
Before Garvey got to hear about the Lindsay option, the rest of the
plant hire business was, inevitably, looking very closely at the
opportunity presented. Lindsay Plant has stuck to the excavation market
which has been its hallmark since George Lindsay first looked for
business in the sixties around local farms on Fenwick Moor with a #500
Whitlock tractor, fitted with a ditching arm.
Today's entire 170-strong fleet consists of just excavators and
dozers, seven versions in all. Throughout the early nineties recession
Lindsay went on replacing plant with newer machines when rivals were
battening down the hatches and relying on existing ageing equipment.
''All our machines are less than four years old,'' says George. ''In
fact, for the entire fleet, the average is only two years old.'' In the
past year, every excavator has been fitted with a Quick Hitch system, at
#2000 a time, which allows operators to change buckets in seconds rather
than the usual ten minutes or more.
Regular service schedules, under the scrupulous scrutiny of brother
Jim, have ensured that fleet utilisation seldom falls below 95%. ''It's
a very simple recipe,'' says George Lindsay. ''We purchase the highest
specification, most reliable equipment and we team that up with top
quality operators, all 180 of them on our own books, most with their own
transport to get to sites, and we couple that with a meticulous
maintenance programme.
''On-site breakdowns are virtually unheard of. That's why we don't
have to give our shirts away when we put in quotes.''
That is also why Lindsay makes very acceptable margins on its near-#8m
turnover when some rivals are get by on what George Lindsay describes as
''a shoestring''. Lindsay does not do business with people who do not
return the compliment on quality service by paying their bills on time.
He will pull equipment off a site rather than get into that spiral. Bad
debts in the past years were around #4000.
George Lindsay realised that, when news of a possible sale got out to
the trade, some of the bigger players in the market would face a
dilemma. ''We expected a bidding war among some of the majors. They
certainly showed interest.
''But I think some of our big-name competitors were a bit concerned
abour what the company would be like without George and Jim Lindsay
running it.''
It was January before the idea of bidding was put by Royal Bank
Development Capital to Paul Garvey. ''If I'm totally honest, my first
reaction was: Construction? No thanks. But I decided I'd like to take a
long hard look at the business. Only after I had looked at it, did I
discover that the more I looked, the more I liked what I saw.''
There are, he points out, some strong comparisons with the
distribution business he was leaving behind. There's a lot of
fragmentation and clear opportunities to pull bits of the sector
together. There are further opportunities, given the fact that Lindsay's
customer base in concentrated in central Scotland, for geographical
expansion.
''Lindsay has got itself into a virtuous circle of investing in the
most up-to-date plant and being able to offer the minimum operational
down time'' says the new Lindsay Plant managing director. ''There is
tremendous future potential.''
That view is echoed by Douglas Kearney. ''George Lindsay's now got
someone he can bounce ideas off. And Paul Garvey's got a good track
record on acquisitions. It's a good deal for both of them.''
Garvey readily acknowleges that he will have to lean on George
Lindsay's deep experience of the plant hire sector, as he himself climbs
a new learning curve. He is also determined to stress the team approach
in what lies ahead for Lindsay Plant.
George remains as part-time chairman and holder of a 2.5% stake in the
business. Brother Jim also retains a similar stake and will continue to
have a role on the service side. Three other members of the Lindsay
staff -- Robert Taylor, the depot manager at Kilmarnock, Gerry Millar,
plant manager, and Margaret Dempster, company secretary -- all take a
personal stake in the business.
''We've not just jumped into this like a couple of daft young boys,''
says George Lindsay. ''We think the chemistry's right and this deal
gives us all the impetus and enthusiasm to take the company to another
stage.''
Paul Garvey agrees. ''The overall growth expected from our sector is
minimal. But what matters is Lindsay's share of that market.'' In the
early 1980s Paul Garvey, newly arrived in Scotland from Ireland, helped
take the Glasgow-based PCT Group to a market listing. Could he have a
listing on his mind again?
''It's very early days, but looking down the road a bit it has to be a
goal to aim for. We must all, as a team, get this business into the
shape where it's a legitimate goal.''

POKING fun at rival publications is doubtless fair game for the Herald
Diary, but care must be taken not to mislead inadvertently: there is a
great danger that the ''Techno-measles'' piece could lull unsuspecting
computer users in to a false sense of security (May 31).
Computer ''viruses'' have often been over-hyped, but when they are
being produced, according to some estimates, at the rate of 50 a day
world-wide, the maximum possible security-consciousness is required.
As in every other sphere of human activity, there is no such thing as
total security for computers, but sensible precautions will always pay
dividends. In particular -- in relation to the Diary piece -- computer
users need to be vigilant of any material from an external source, be it
diskette, tape, or electronic transmission.
Of course electronic messages are just that, and can do no harm. The
problem is that it is not difficult to ''embed'' an executable file --
that is, a program, and therefore potentially a virus -- inside an
electronic transmission.
The most obvious manifestation of this is where a spreadsheet file is
sent. The only safe rule is to treat all transmissions from an unknown
source with great suspicion.

TOM SHIELDS'S throwaway line about the use of the A-bombs in Japan
saving one million Allied troops proves yet again the truth of the old
adage that if you repeat a lie often enough everyone will believe it
(June 1).
Far from saving Allied lives there is a growing body of evidence to
indicate that determination to use the bomb actually caused an increase
in Allied deaths. Postponement of response to the known Japanese
willingness to surrender necessitated a prolongation of the war.

As Jennifer Cunningham implies (May 24), that saying of Xenophanes is

HOW unfortunate that John MacCalman's excellent article on the
proposed Strathclyde Tram contained an incorrect definition of the word
tram (May 31).
According to The Guinness Book of Rail Facts and Feats, the word is
derived from the Swedish dialect word Tromm, meaning a log, and came to
be applied to the wooden tracks used in sixteenth century mines.
Although the wood was in time replaced by iron, these lines became known
as Tramways, or Tramroads.
The late Charles S Dunbar, an eminent transport historian, sums the
matter up by saying: ''It is a common fallacy that tramway is derived
from an engineer named Outram.''

POLITICAL correctness is a shifting and dubious feast, as is the
diplomat's delicate fear of irritating foreign nations who might be
useful but who also happen to have nasty habits. Neither should apply to
any issues concerned with human rights. For that reason the Chinese, who
daily slide deeper into ever more disreputable odour because of their
flaunting of human rights, should expect and receive no mercy from the
international community. Especially now, just one day before the sixth
anniversary of the outrage in Tiananmen Square when hundreds of peaceful
demonstrators were murdered by troops at the behest of the terrified old
men in the collective leadership. Life has not eased much since then for
any Chinese citizen who has an opinion or belief which differs from that
of the national leadership. Part of the reason for this unbending
attitude lies in the precarious health of Deng Xiaoping who, if the
rumours are correct, has been in serious decline for more than a year.
Although the leadership of China is still nominally collective, the
struggle for the position of primus inter pares persists. None of the
contenders wishes to be seen as less rigorous than the others, hence the
escalation of detentions and harassment of civil rights dissidents,
religious believers, and ethnic minorities.
Another element is present. China's economic development has been
furiously fast and distinctly unsettling. To protect it, runs the theory
which appears to be current with the leadership, dissent of all sorts
must be discouraged, thus allowing energies to be concentrated on the
economy. Some observers trace this effect to early 1994, others to at
least a year before that. It is undeniably true that human rights abuses
have increased over this period and they have been documented
assiduously by foreign agencies. One of the heftiest and most depressing
books in the library of this newspaper is Detained in China and Tibet, a
directory of political and religious prisoners by Asia Watch, a division
of Human Rights Watch. Other recent reports speak of the detention and
torture of Tibetan monks and nuns, the detention and harassment of
Christians who refuse to join official churches, and the detention of
political dissidents, some of them sentenced to jail terms of as long as
20 years for openly voicing their views. Appallingly, there appears to
be a new law which the Chinese designed specifically to abort children
who may be handicapped. In addition, dozens of dissidents have been
arrested in recent days in what is clearly a nationwide campaign. And
through it all comes the voice of Chinese officialdom, arguing against
all available evidence that China fully ensures basic freedom and human
rights
This fiction has been exposed, which makes all the more remarkable the
decision of the United Nations to stage the forthcoming World Conference
on Women in Beijing. Predictably, as we report elsewhere this morning,
the affair has run into problems. The Chinese clearly wish to sabotage a
parallel non-governmental conference by removing it to a remote rural
location. This means that the opportunity of an overlapping week, in
which participants in both conferences could exchange views fruitfully,
might be lost. The Chinese motive is to stop the forum reinforcing the
resolve of the official conference on various issues, despite this being
a recognised role for NGOs at conferences around the world. The solution
is simple: the UN Secretary-General, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, can
postpone or cancel the official conference. Somehow we doubt that this
will happen, but at the very least a protest could be made. It will not
free dissidents, or stop more being seized, but it will dent the
perception that support for human rights is best left to
non-governmental organisations.

<HEADLINE>Buffer rules 'holding back conservation'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS, FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978075844</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CALL for a relaxation of European Union regulations which dictate
that buffer strip counted as part of a farm's set-aside must be
20-metres wide was made yesterday by Jim Wyllie, convener of the legal
and commercial committee of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland.
Speaking at an open day at Channel Farm, on the banks of Loch Leven,
Mr Wyllie said that there was room for more flexibility which could, in
turn, persuade more farmers to adopt buffer strips of uncropped land as
a conservation tool.
He was supported by one farmer who pointed out that he had only three
fields which did not include watercourses. If he were to consider a
20-metre buffer strip alongside all these watercourses he would be
setting aside 28% of his land rather than the 15.7% allowed for in the
current regulations.
Sandy Braid of Channel Farm, and two of his neighbours, have adopted
the buffer strip concept as part of a plan to protect the Pow Burn which
drains into Loch Leven. The world-famous trout loch has suffered serious
problems of algae bloom and various measures are now being adopted to
reduce the flow of phosphates into its waters.
The buffer strips help to filter out soil particles washed from the
land in wet weather. Much of the land adjacent to the Pow Burn is used
for growing vegetables which tend to require frequent treatment with
pesticides and the buffer system helps to put a safety margin between
treated crops and the watercourses.
Mr Braid said that he had in recent years altered his policy on
combating weeds in his vegetable fields. ''We now try to kill most
weeds, rather than all of them,'' he said. ''Our chemical and spray bill
is less now than it was five years ago.''
Mr William Halcrow, director of the Forth River Purification Board,
said that urban development was more important than farming in terms of
the impact it could have on the aquatic environment.
''We have an excellent relationship with farmers,'' he said. ''We have
about 20 problem farms in this area -- and we have 1200 farms in total.
The majority of farmers are good people and in general we leave them
alone -- although we are often seen as victimising farmers.''
The Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group (FWAG) has produced a booklet
giving guidance on the use of buffer strips. As well as preventing soil
being washed from fields into streams and rivers, buffer strips can also
act as an attractive habitat for many types of wildlife, including
beneficial insects. They also act as a physical barrier which makes it
more difficult for fertiliser or chemicals to be accidentally sprayed
directly into a watercourse.
Although a 20-metre wide strip is demanded by European set-aside
regulations it is possible to create much narrower margins of permanent
vegetation which would do an effective job. However, two-metre uncropped
field margins may no longer be included in the cropped area on which
arable payments are claimed.
Channel Farm will be open to visitors today as part of FWAG's Farm
Walk Week, which promotes eco-friendly farm management. Eaglescairnie
Mains, Haddington, East Lothian, will be participating tomorrow. Other
participants next week will be Tulloch Farm, SAC, Craibstone, Aberdeen,
on Monday; Paxton, South Mains, Berwick on Tweed, on Tuesday; Bamff
Estate, Alyth, Perthshire, and Northfieldhead, Strathaven, on Wednesday;
Olrig Mains, Caithness, next Saturday, and Carnell Estate, Hurlford,

<TEXT>
RESEARCHERS need to take a wider, multi-disciplinary look at the human
health problems attributed to organophosphate (OP) sheep dips, it was
suggested at a London seminar yesterday.
Dr Alex Proudfoot, head of the Edinburgh Centre of the National
Poisons Information Service, said that many of the symptoms, such as
fatigue, irritability and depression, could be attributed to other
causes. They resembled many other modern complaints.
''There is a great amount of overlap which I find difficult to
explain,'' he told delegates to the conference organised jointly by the
English National Farmers Union and the British Medical Association. ''I
sometimes think half the world is tired and while this is very serious I
think it has to be noted that a lot of people have not been exposed to
OPs,'' he said to gasps of incredulity from the audience.
But he admitted there was a need to take the patients seriously to
gain their confidence in trying to assess whether there had been OP
poisoning. However, he pointed out that many patients were totally
convinced of an external toxic cause for their symptoms and even
questioned their doctor's competence if this was not found. He also
referred to the other chemicals to which farmers might be exposed.
Peter Beaumont, director of the Pesticides Trust, a charity concerned
with the health and environmental implications of pesticides, said World
Health Organisational figures indicated about three million sufferers of
pesticides side effects worldwide with many of these due to OPs.
In the UK it was estimated that 1% of the 100,000 sheep farmers were
also suffering some effects.
He said it was recognised that some people might be more susceptible
or sensitive to these chemicals than others. This was confirmed by Dr
Robert Davis, a Somerset-based consultant psychiatrist, who said there
were parallels with a relaxant drug which caused depression in some
people.
He said there was a temptation among GPs to label sufferers of
non-specific complaints, such as depression, as ''hysterics''. This
could apply in the case of those exposed to OP dips. Nevertheless, these
complaints should not be labelled as such. Instead there should be a
full investigation of the complaint, including examination of the
neurochemical and neurobiological effects.
Dr Fleur Fisher, head of the British Medical Association's ethics,
science and information, said that while much was known about the signs
and symptoms of accute OP poisoning, there was a need for more knowledge
about the possible effects of long-term, low-level exposure.
Farmers and workers needed much more training in the safe use of
agrichemicals and doctors needed much more training and practical
experience in the diagnosis and treatment of patients exposed to
agrichemicals.
All parties agreed there were no quick and easy solutions and there
was a need for continuing research.

* I have built up a holding worth over #5000 in Scottish Mortgage
Trust as a result of subscribing #60 a month over the last few years.
This is now my largest investment. In all I have about #70,000 spread
over 18 shares, plus #25,000 in gilts. Scottish Mortgage is my only
investment trust, but I wonder if I can have too much of a good thing.
In addition I find that I can now afford to lock away #100 a month, and
I am seeking your advice as to how I should proceed. In particular I
would like to know if I should continue with my existing monthly
contributions to Scottish Mortgage.
* Scottish Mortgage has an excellent record and Baillie Gifford, the
Edinburgh investment house which manages it, is among the best in the
industry. An investment of #1000 five years ago would now be worth about
#1900 assuming that the dividends were reinvested in the trust's shares.
This is significantly better than the benchmark All-Share index which
would have returned about #1640 over the same period. When asked for
guidance on what investment trusts are worth buying we invariably
include Scottish Mortgage.
However, there is no point in tempting providence by allocating too
much of your funds to one investment. Your holding in Scottish Mortgage
is still under 10% of your portfolio, and it is, therefore, not
essential to stop paying into it.
Your best course might be to reduce your monthly subscription to the
#30 minimum which Baillie Gifford will accept, and invest the balance of
#70 elsewhere.
Among trusts in the international general category, which we regard as
most suitable for small investors seeking to build up capital, a number
have performed even better than Scottish Mortgage over five years.
These include Bankers Trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust and
Second Alliance Trust. You could pick a couple of these to spread your
money around a bit, but if you choose Second Alliance note that the
minimum monthly subscription is #50, which would make it difficult to do
so unless you cease your subscriptions to Scottish Mortgage.
This would not necessarily be a bad idea since it seems likely that
you will have to do so at some stage if you are not to over-step the
mark.
From the little information you have given us about your other
holdings, you seem to have a good spread of investments. But on the
whole you are a little light on investment trusts for a private
investor.
Subscribing a #100 a month from now on would have the effect of
increasing your exposure, but if you have any weak performers in your
portfolio it would do no harm to make some disposals to build up your
investment trust position more quickly.
We also note that you have made no mention of PEPs and we think that
this is an area of investment you should be looking at. Plenty of
investment trust groups offer cost-effective PEPs though the investment
rules vary widely.
* I retired about two years ago and have a pension of #1337 a month
gross, plus #175 per month from a bond free of tax. My wife has a small
State pension of #63 per month, and most of our shares and building
society funds are in her name. She has income from shares of
approximately #2700 per annum gross and building society income of
approximately #3000 per annum, also gross. In addition we both have the
maximum Tessas. My question is, how, if at all, can we reduce the tax
payable? I have considered National Savings, but I am reluctant to tie
up capital for the required time span. I also wonder about PEPs but I am
not sure if they would really be of any advantage. Any assistance would
be greatly appreciated.
* Only a small part of your wife's personal allowance of #3525 will be
used by her State pension of #756. So the bulk of her #3000 of building
society interest will not be liable to tax. If she is collecting the
interest net she can reclaim the tax due to her. The dividends from her
shares are taxed at 20% and no further tax is due by her.
Switching funds to National Savings certificates or PEPs would save
tax, but the investment implications are more important.
In the case of National Savings certificates you have to tie the money
up, and as you rely on your capital for a substantial part of your
income this is not a particularly attractive proposition, unless your
income is greater than you require.
PEPs are a different matter. Some of your wife's equities could be
held through corporate PEPs. Charges are relatively low and there is no
liability to income or capital gains tax. You might find it worth your
while exploring this avenue.
Your letter is unusual in that you give us details of your income, but
there is no direct reference to your capital. We estimate, however, that
you have a six-figure sum.
You should be more concerned about its proper investment than the
minor savings that you might make in your wife's tax liability.
If you live within your income you might want to reduce the amount of
capital in the building society and increase the amount invested in
shares. This would have the effect of reducing the amount of tax your
wife paid since it would reduce her income.
You should also be considering whether some of her capital should be
ploughed into gilts which offer a higher return than building societies.
Maybe you should seek the advice of a good stockbroker, who would also
be able to advise you on PEPs and the tax implications of any changes
you made in your investments.
* My wife and I have simple wills, leaving everything to each other
and from the survivor to our three children in equal proportion. As our
house is probably valued at about #80,000 and we have investments and/or
savings in the region of #100,000, what steps could we take now in good
time to avoid our hard-earned finances falling in part to the
Government? In this particular case the parents are septuagenarians and
the children adults.
* You could avoid paying inheritance tax if both you and your wife
were to change your wills so as to leave some proportion of your
combined assets directly to your children on the first death. The first
#154,000 of assets are taxed at a nil rate so if you were each to leave,
say, #26,000 to your children on the first death, the survivor's estate
would not exceed this nil rate band and no tax would be payable. This
would also avoid depleting the investments left for the survivor to live
on by too high a proportion.
* What are the tax implications of renting out your house while
working in another part of the UK?
* Whether you rent the house as a furnished let or an unfurnished let,
you will be taxed on the rental you receive under Schedule A. In
arriving at the profit from renting the property you must include the
rent earned in 1995-96 and you can deduct any expenses which you have to
lay out wholly and exclusively in earning the rent. If you have a
mortgage you will need to consider tax relief on the interest you pay.
Where you are required by reason of your employment to move from your
home to another place for a period not expected to exceed four years and
you expect to return to your home at the end of this employment, you
will be able to continue to receive mortgage interest relief at source
at 15% on interest on a loan up to #30,000. But it will probably be more
favourable to notify your building society that the loan is withdrawn
from the MIRAS scheme and instead claim the interest on the whole loan
as a deduction from the rental profits.
Finally, there is the question of whether renting your home will debar
you from full exemption from capital gains tax when you sell it. The
amount of any taxable gain is proportionate to the amount of time you
owned the house but did not live in it as your principal private
residence. Again, you can ignore any period of absence not exceeding
four years throughout which you were prevented from residing in your
home in consequence of your place of work.
You can also ignore a further three-year period of absence in
calculating the length of time the house has been occupied as your
principal private residence for the purpose of claiming this as a tax
exemption.
* My will provides for a legacy of #5000 to a friend but as he is in
urgent need of funds I would like to make the gift now and cancel the
legacy. Would such a change involve me or my friend in any tax liability
now?
* Gifts such as the one you are proposing to make will normally be
regarded as a potentially exempt transfer for Inheritance Tax purposes
and will become exempt and not counted for these purposes if you live
for another seven years. Should you die within this period the gift will
be chargeable but assuming that you have made no other gifts, the annual
exemptions available for the year you make the gift and the previous
year can be utilised. As the amount of this exemption is #3000 for the
current year and the same for last year, your gift will be fully covered
and no tax will be payable.
* My wife, a non-earner and non-taxpayer, is currently in the process
of reclaiming tax credits for unit trust investments. The form R40 seeks
not only details of the investment from which the credits are being
reclaimed but also other information about taxed and untaxed income
including bank and building society interest. Is building society
interest (already taxed) included in the computation?
* The form R40 is a tax return and requires details of your wife's
total income not just the investments subject to the repayment claim.
The Revenue will include her total income, including the gross amount of
building society and bank interest, in the calculation but credit will
be given for the tax deducted at source. Your wife's tax allowances will
be deducted from her total income to arrive at her taxable income and
tax calculated on this amount. If the tax due is less than the tax paid
at source on her total investment income, a repayment will be due.
* Regarding your reply on April 22 to a questioner concerning Friendly
Society Savings Plan, I had a 10-year plan with Family Assurance of
Brighton at #8.65 per month which commenced on May 1, 1985. It recently
matured. The amount paid in was #1038 and the cheque received was for
#1158.75p, a total profit of #120.75p.
I wish to state also that my wife had a plan with Family Assurance for
seven years and five months, paying in #769.85p. She died in September
and the payout was #690.00, less than paid in. Have you any comments on
this?
* The Friendly Society admits this is a disappointing return mainly
reflecting the poor state of share prices last year which had an adverse
impact on funds. It would have preferred investors whose policies were
due to mature to have held on for better times but, of course, if
investors needed the money there was nothing that could be done about
it.
As to your other query, the society seems to think this odd but it
would have to look at the individual case, so you would need to get in
touch with it, giving the policy number.

AYR-based auctioneers James Craig, who have made an offer of #12 a
share in a #1.5m bid for Wallets Marts of Castle Douglas, have written
to all Wallets shareholders outlining the merits of their bid.
Michael Craig, chairman of the James Craig, criticised proposals from
Wallets' board for splitting the business by creating a new company
which would own Wallets' non-operational and and other assets.
''This does absolutely nothing to solve the problem of an
underperforming mart,'' said Mr Craig.
He also criticised a move from Thomson, Roddick and Laurie, of Annan,
to buy the Castle Douglas mart premises for #725,000 with a view to
basing their livestock administration in Castle Douglas and
incorporating Wallets into its trading name.
''Coming from a company which would not and now cannot make an offer
for the shares of Wallets' Marts, we doubt if Wallets' shareholders will
be impressed,'' he said.
The deadline for acceptance of Craig's offer is Friday of next week.
The firm advice of Wallets' directors has been that the Craig offer
should be rejected.

SANCTUARY is a big safe word for Carla Lane these days. Not only has
she done a Brigitte Bardot and opened one (for defenceless animals) in
her Elizabethan manor house but she has also based her latest sitcom
around one (for loopy women).
It is a curious thing but, when you check through recent newspaper
cuttings, the only stories you find about Lane concern her activities as
an animal rights activist. There is barely a mention of her television
work. It's as if she had given up scribbling scripts altogether.
The protection of fluffy, furry, beasts (everything from cats to
calves) has become something of an obsession for the Liverpool-born
writer. She's been out there regularly with her placards, fighting the
good fight on the front line at Shoreham and demonstrating against the
veal trucks. If the export of live animals is her public cause celebre
then the right to life for even the most insignificant creature (she
avoids digging into worms in her garden) is her private preoccupation.
In short, at the age of 60 Lane has become a classic English
eccentric. She shares her 57-room country home in Sussex with hundreds
of rescued beasts. Indeed, she successfully obtained charitable status
for her sanctuary which she called Animal Line.
However, for a writer of a brand of comedy which is steeped in the
subtle but sometimes obscure realities of life, Lane does seem to have
lost the place somewhat in her own little world. We should be relieved
perhaps that her latest work, Searching (ITV, Thursday) is about people
rather than animals.
Once upon a time the product of Lane's fertile imagination was
ubiquitous on television. Programmes like The Liver Birds, Butterflies,
and Bread were beautiful and often touching comedies, not so much about
situations, but about relationships. The lines which her characters
delivered were usually more important, more telling, than the storylines
themselves. People, and especially women, could identify with her comic
sense of angst and despair. Her shows were among the top-rated sitcoms
of their day.
But then it seemed as if she lost her edge. Her last two shows for the
BBC, Screaming and Luv, were poorly received. She appeared to turn her
back on television and retreat into her own personal sanctuary. But now
she is back with a new and lucrative contract for Carlton Television.
Searching takes Lane into potentially dangerous territory. In it she
treads a thin line between what is acceptable and what borders on bad
taste. She makes us laugh at psychological disorder.
Mrs Tilston (Prunella Scales), like the writer herself, is an
eccentric English lady who turns her family home into a sanctuary for
five women with peculiar psychological problems. Chancy (Julia St John)
is a husband-beater and serial-divorcee; Dora (Clare Cathcart) a
half-hearted depressive suicidal; Milly (Regina Freedman) a tarty
kleptomaniac. Then there's Hatty (Amanda Bellamy), who has a thing about
umbrellas and Lena (Victoria Carling), who is a compulsive puller of
British Rail emergency cords.
God-fearing, hymn-singing Mrs Tilston attempts to help the women to
adjust to real life with the help of a mild-mannered therapist (Robert
Gwilym) whose natural charm makes him an object of desire. Women
behaving peculiarly.
* HOLLYWOOD can wreck a novel and ruin a novelist. Look what it does.
It takes a writer's work, rearranges the plot, maybe alters the ending,
introduces new characters, discards existing ones, sets the whole thing
in a different time and place, and then, with any luck, it puts the
entire project on hold for three years.
And what does it give the author in return? A fat cheque, the size of
which is beyond his or her wildest dreams, that's what. Don't you just
hate it when that happens?
The best thing the writer can do, of course, is keep shtoom, take the
money, and move on to the next book. Then again, he could always front a
television documentary about the often fractious working relationship
which exists between the novelist and the movie-maker. In Cinefile: The
Novel Image (Channel 4, Monday) Scottish writer William Boyd does just
that.
Boyd, of course, is well placed to give comment. One of his seven
novels, Stars And Bars, was made into a bad film and another (A Good Man
In Africa) is about to be released as a movie starring Sean Connery. He
has also written numerous screenplays (including Lord Attenborough's
Chaplin, Bruce Beresford's Mister Johnson, and a television adaptation
of Evelyn Waugh's Scoop).
Monumental rows between authors and directors, the egotistical meets
the egocentric, are legion. It stands to reason, of course. The writer
wants to see his work faithfully re-produced on the screen; the director
wants to make a box-office hit. Seldom do the two desires coincide. The
most recent example of never the twain meeting was probably American
writer Ann Rice's denouncement of director Neil Jordan's treatment of
her novel, Interview With A Vampire.
In The Novel Image Boyd discusses the problems of literary
transference to the movie medium and outlines what he tries to keep as
well as what he chooses to discard from a book which could run to 500
pages (screenplays are usually about 100 pages long and most of that is
white space and directions).
The documentary, too short at 30 minutes, discusses in some depth the
auteur theory. This term was first used in the early 60s and essentially
suggests that the director -- and no-one else -- is the author of a
movie. This is because a film is regarded as a work of art and, since a
work of art is stamped with the personality of its creator, it is the
man (or woman) with the megaphone who gives it its distinctive quality.
The problem is, however, that the theory by its nature ignores the
fact that making movies is a collaborative process. Therefore, it
neglects the contributions made by actors, cinematographers, designers,
actors -- and the writers.
Boyd, rejecting the auteur theory for fostering the cult of the
director, argues that the writer often wields more control than is
generally acknowledged. He illustrates this with an examination of
several case studies including Brian De Palma's (or was it Tom Wolfe's?)
Bonfire of the Vanities which, he says, was an example of a great novel
obscuring the view of what turned out to be a much-criticised film and
Canadian director David Cronenberg's movie of The Naked Lunch, William S
Burrough's bizarre cult novel. That, opines Boyd, was an example of the
unfilmable filmed. If this all sounds just a tad heavy going, then you
can always skip the documentary and watch the movies. The Novel Image
will be complemented by a short season of films which have been adapted
from literary works. They include the aforementioned Bonfires and Naked
Lunch as well as Nic Roeg's Castaway, George Roy Hill's The World
According to Garp, and Boyd's treatment of Mister Johnson.
* IN a very average week for television, one drama stands out as
utterly unmissable. You will be well-advised to reach for the Valium
bottle before attempting to sit through ER (Wednesday, Channel 4). We
are talking a serious stress factor here. This is the one which left
American viewers traumatised.
In Love's Labor Lost, Dr Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), the cute one
with the specks and the ambitious wife, checks out a pregnant young
woman, diagnoses a simple tummy upset, and discharges her with a smile
and a comforting word. Big mistake, Mark. Minutes later she collapses
and it's a race to save her life and that of her baby. Every time they
think they've got it under control something else goes wrong.
The episode is furious, fast, and frantic and it is worth warning
that, when it was screened in America, there were hundreds of calls from
shell-shocked and exhausted viewers. The stylish ER is one of the best
American imports for years and it is so highly regarded in the States
that Quentin Tarantino asked to direct the penultimate episode
(Motherhood) in the current series.
* THERE is but one good reason for tuning in to Steve Wright's People
Show (BBC1, Saturday). And that reason is the wonderful Gillian
Anderson. Now, if the name doesn't ring a bell then you're clearly not a
fan of The X Files. Ms Anderson is best known as fearless FBI sci-fi
sleuth Dana Scully, sidekick to Agent Mulder.
Just why she wants to appear on this show is an even bigger mystery
than the ones she normally deals with but why should we complain.
Actually, there's a second good reason for watching Steve Wright's
People Show -- it also features a rare appearance by Scots pop diva
Annie Lennox.

With the purchase of the CWS milk business, Robert Wiseman Dairies
will alert the City to the emergence of a new force.
AMBITION radiates from Alan Wiseman as he takes yet another step in
building up Robert Wiseman Dairies into an even greater force in the UK
milk industry through the #6.6m purchase of the CWS business in
Scotland.
While this is not the biggest financial step in the career of a
company which has in the past 15 years made about 45 acquisitions, it is
perhaps the most significant. It is alerting the City and the milk
companies in England that there is a new force emerging to challenge
companies like Chris Haskins' Northern Foods, Unigate, and the other
smaller participants.
The East Kilbride company was floated on the Stock Exchange in March
last year at a share price of 100p. Although the shares have risen a net
40% to about 140p since then, the City has taken not that much interest.
In cash terms, the deal last year, when Wiseman bought Aberdeen-based
Kennerty which gave it dominance in Grampian, was bigger. That cost
Wiseman #8.1m but could be described as simply consolidating its
presence in Scotland.
Only half of the money raised from shareholders will go to pay for the
CWS operations. More important, it was made clear yesterday that Wiseman
has ambitions to do another important deal in 1995, which could mean an
increased presence in England, where it is already expanding rapidly
with its Manchester plant.
But how did this all come about? It is the classic story of a humble
Scottish beginning, hard work, and dedication.
Robert Wiseman, now 79, was a tenant farmer in East Kilbride in the
late 1940s. Fate intervened when a Labour Government decided upon East
Kilbride as the first post-war new town and so he had to sell his
Ayrshire cows and bought a piggery nearby at Nerston.
He went into the milk delivery business and so it continued until his
son Alan, in 1967, realised there was more to life than carrying other
people's goods to houses. They began delivering milk to shops and built
the first carton plant in 1970.
Mr Wiseman Sen still lives next door to the original site, which is
now an office with about 40 staff, and comes in every morning.
With supermarkets arriving on the scene the business grew
substantially, with Wiseman acquiring smaller dairy companies along the
way.
The Scottish milk market is different from the England one, in that it
has always been more innovative. One factor has been social; typical
housing in Glasgow and Edinburgh was the four-storey tenement which was
far from ideal for milk delivery compared with the more recent suburbia.
So it was the corner shop which supplied milk. That was also a force
for change with the Scots the first to move to non-returnable containers
and then the larger half-gallon carriers.
Unlike almost all competitors, Wiseman has concentrated on milk
whereas the others have moved into butter as well as cheese, yoghurts,
and fromage frais.
As Alan Wiseman says: ''Concentrate on the business. Keep it simple.
Diversification means more managers and complicates life.''
Now aged 44, and living on a professionally managed mixed farm at
Hamilton, he was joined by brothers Robert, 40, and Gavin, 38, in the
family concern. He says: ''It's my life. I live the business.''
Golf is the only serious relaxation, although he would have been in
South Africa for the Rugby World Cup but for the CWS deal.
The famous black-and-white carton packaging and vehicle livery arose
after Alan Wiseman was struck by the association between bright red vans
and the Post Office. A design expert was contacted and so emerged the
cow pattern which is so conspicuous on the supermarket shelves.
That has undoubtedly helped in the growth of the business which now
has annual sales of more than #100m and a stock market worth of about
#90m.
In a sector where competitors are suffering, Wiseman stands out and
the City will in future be taking more notice as it makes its presence
felt more forcefully in England.

RATKO MLADIC is the kind of man who only shrugs his shoulders to
adjust the weight of the chips. Bowed down by the baggage of his past,
he has become the most feared and powerful player in Bosnia's ongoing
nightmare.
The self-styled ''Serbian Napoleon'' was born into Balkans horror in
1943. Croats killed his partisan father while he was still a toddler.
Inter-communal butchery was a fact of his young life, shaping his
perceptions and fanning the flames of his rampant xenophobia.
The rest of his family were murdered by Muslim militiamen in 1991,
turning an already embittered Mladic into the architect of ethnic
apartheid and the arch-proponent of Serbian nationalism.
But any sympathy one might feel for a man deprived tragically and
brutally of his nearest and dearest must be tempered by the fact that he
has handed out many times more punishment than he has received.
It was Mladic who led the Serb Cetniks when they overran huge swathes
of Croatia in 1991 in a campaign aimed at stamping out Zagreb's bid for
independence. His men raped, murdered and laid waste to towns and
villages over hundreds of square miles of disputed territory.
The shattered skylines of Vukovar and Vinkovci became symbols of
Serbian savagery. Hopes of a post-Soviet era of peace dissolved in a
torrent of shellfire. Europe had itself a backyard war in spades.
When the shooting stopped, 10,000 people were dead. Most were
civilians caught in the crossfire. More than 500,000 became homeless
refugees under the ruthless programme of ethnic cleansing conducted by
all sides.
When US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance flew in to broker a peace,
Mladic conned him into accepting the status quo. The Krajina, amounting
to more than one-third of what had formerly been Croatia, became a new
Serb homeland. It was a deal which sowed the seeds of future conflict.
The Serbian commander then moved on to phase two of his master plan
for the creation of a Greater Serbia. He took charge of a huge cache of
weapons from Yugoslav National Army arsenals and 80,000 troops and went
to war in Bosnia, pounding Muslim and Croat alike.
Mladic was, to a large extent, the creation of Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic. He was propelled into the limelight when a strong
military leader was needed. Other generals had failed to quell the
Croats and Slovenes. Mladic had the confidence of his men. He gave them
guns and plunder.
But Milosevic can no longer control the man he made. The monster he
created has slipped the leash. Mladic is now calling the shots in
Bosnia, and Belgrade cannot exercise restraint.
If Radovan Karadzic sits centre-stage as the Bosnian Serbs' political
leader and entertaining liar, Mladic waits in the wings, pulling the
real strings of power. It is power that comes from the barrel of a gun,
and it is the only authority anyone in that war-ravaged land understands
or respects.
Mladic is an exceptional man. The Yugoslav officer corps was not noted
for the high calibre of its leaders. But Mladic stood out in his
generation as a capable and totally ruthless professional. He is also
fanatical and probably psychopathic.
A leading UN negotiator who has spent many hours in fruitless and
frustrating debate with the general, once described him as ''a highly
intelligent and profoundly violent man who inspires great devotion in
his men.''
The stocky, ruddy-faced, 52-year-old, likes to think of himself as a
Napoleonic figure. His greatest resemblance to L'Empereur may be his
build, but he has also chalked up some notable military achievements.
Perhaps the most important of these was the welding of the remnants of
the regular Serb forces and the ragtag local militias into a formidable
war machine, at least in Balkan terms.
Mladic also enjoys seeing people squirm, particularly the United
Nations and the Western powers. UN negotiators have yet to get the
measure of the man. He combines bluster and brute force with the
occasional flash of Machiavellian double-dealing. And he has learned one
cogent lesson. Bad guys live longer in the Balkans.
In some respects, his views are dangerously facile. Of the Muslims, he
says: ''The Islamic world does not have the atomic bomb. But it does
have a demographic bomb. Atomic weapons are under some form of control.
The Muslims' enormous reproduction is not.'' His answer is to kill them
before they breed the Serbs into submission.
Norms of Western mediation have no place in the twisted, vicious cycle
of revenge and blood-feud peculiar to the Yugoslavs. Mladic has also
read the runes correctly in his calculation that the West will go to
almost any lengths to avoid costly direct military intervention.
Brinkmanship has become an art form. He knows just how far he can push
the UN. The bombing of a Serb ammunition dump last week was more the
product of Nato's miscalculation than poor judgment on Mladic's part.
His response was typically direct. Take hostages and chain them as human
shields to other likely targets.
To some extent, his rampant nationalism blinds him to some of the
harsher realities of the situation. The Serbs are well-equipped, but
short of manpower to hold the 80% of Bosnia they occupy. The Muslims and
Croats have fewer heavy weapons, but an abundance of troops.
The inevitability of the equation is that the Serbs will have to give
up ground in the face of superior numbers. Mladic point-blank refuses to
confront that truth. Serbian territory is holy ground, bought with blood
and held with fanatical zeal. Withdrawal is not on his agenda.
The general tends to think in terms of guns and ethnic atrocity.
Political strategy comes a poor second. He claims that nobody
understands the Bosnian Serbs. And he hates Britain for what he regards
as its taking of sides. Serbs, after all, fought alongside the British
against the Nazis. Why should British forces now stand between the Serbs
and their rightful destiny?
He genuinely fails to appreciate why the West should question Serbian
action. ''You must understand,'' he says, ''that we Serbs are on our own
land. These are Serb fields, Serb forests, rivers and towns. We are not
conquering anyone else's land. We are merely defending our own.
''The Drina river, running between Bosnia and Serbia, is the spine of
the Serb state. It will be the one mother of Serbia in the future. The
West wants it to be a barrier. But we are one nation, and the Drina will
never be a borderline again.''
He is contemptuous of the UN. How, he sneers, can the UN declare
places like Gorazde ''safe areas'' when they do not underline that
status with the force to make it so? Logic is on his side. The UN long
ago began the slide into appeasement. It is a policy unlikely to impress
Mladic. He respects only strength.
Early last year, he thumbed his nose at the outside world and its
no-fly zones by touring frontline Serb positions in a helicopter. It was
a deliberate breach of UN rules. But he knew the chances of the UN
ordering him to be shot down were so remote that they were not worth
considering.
Occasionally, he likes to display mercy to dispel his popular image as
a war criminal and a ruthless killer. When the Muslims began a mass
exodus from the besieged Srebrenica enclave, a young man of military age
was discovered hiding in a truck packed with refugees.
Mladic had the terrified man brought before him. Normally, he would
have been shot out of hand. But Mladic told him: ''I will spare your
life. But just remember who did it.''
He dismisses the constant accusation that he is a war criminal. Serb
concentration camps were merely ''American propaganda''. The levelling
of towns and the deaths of tens of thousands in Croatia and Bosnia were
''military necessities''. The war in Bosnia would be over ''when the
Muslims hand me their weapons''.
There is, undoubtedly, a sadistic side to the man's character. The
Muslims call him The Butcher of Bosnia and they have reason enough for
the title. Mladic once ordered Serbs besieging Sarajevo to stop using
mortars and employ the heaviest artillery they could muster.
''Torch them'' and ''blow their minds'' are two of his favourite
standing orders for bombardment units. His tactics are simple and
brutally effective. Shell civilian areas. Create panic. Start an exodus
of refugees. Set the stage for an ethnically pure Serb state.
The only UN commander ever to force him to back down was the UK's
General Sir Michael Rose. They both spoke the same language. Rose, a
former commander of the SAS, was as tough and uncompromising as his
Serbian opponent.
The British officer twice called in air strikes against Serb artillery
positions around Gorazde. Mladic telephoned him to say that the next
time aircraft attacked, they would be shot down.
The exchange then continued with Rose saying: ''Stop your tank and
artillery fire into town or we'll have no option but to attack.''
Mladic: ''I'm not attacking. Stop your attack and we'll stop.''
Rose: ''Listen, you arsehole, you have your warning.''
Mladic: ''My forces are not attacking.''
Rose: ''You have 10 minutes.''
Fifteen minutes later, the Serb guns fell silent. The Beast of Bosnia
had decided to beat a tactical retreat. Blunt talk is something he
appreciates. He also realised that Rose meant what he said. He was a
soldier's soldier and they talked the same language.
Mladic was fascinated by Rose. He was a worthy opponent and well
beyond the calibre of the usual UN representatives.
But Mladic could not accept easy defeat. Having mulled over the
circumstances of the Gorazde incident, he ordered a resumption of the
bombardment. Nato and the UN overruled Rose on further air strikes.
Whether genius or maniac, or a combination of the two, the warrior
king has an underlying sense of humour laced with a guid conceit of
himself.
''If I had been a surgeon, I would have been a super-surgeon. If I had
been an architect I would have been a super-architect. If I had been
Frank Sinatra I wouldn't have made much of a living. The one thing I
don't have is a singing voice.''
More disturbing is his lack of regard for life. Asked if he would ever
consider trading captured ground for peace, he replied: ''I would never
order my units to retreat. I wouldn't do it if I had one million lives
to lose and had to lose them all. Only an army that is defeated
retreats. Once the Serbian flag is flying, we never take it down.''

Playing the geek has paid off for Colin McCredie, the up-coming Scots
actor who never says never.
A MERE two months out of drama school and Colin McCredie's CV already
looks impressive. It may begin humbly enough: hair -- red, eyes -- blue,
height -- 5'8'', but scan further down and you'll find theatre credits
for Glengarry Glenn Ross and Virtual Reality, television credits for
Take The High Road, Dr Finlay and more recently Taggart, and films
including Tartan Short The Pen, Gillies MacKinnon's Easterhouse and
Shallow Grave.
Oh yes, Shallow Grave, the film which brought McCredie into the realms
of public consciousness when he appeared in the opening sequence
climbing those stairs in New Town Edinburgh to suggest sharing a room
chez MacGregor, Eccleston, and Fox. He was the geeky one with the jerkin
and poly bag who was guffawed off the premises. As McCredie describes
himself: ''The Phil Kay of Scottish actors, only not as humorous.''
Our first meeting was on the set of The Pen in Inverness railway
station, platform 5, where as ''the Guard'' McCredie was spending a week
on a City Sprinter along with the likes of Imelda Staunton, Ken Drury
and for Colin, the big man, Bill Paterson. Mention Paterson and McCredie
spurts words of the you-couldn't-meet-a-nicer-man variety: ''We had one
day off filming and Bill hired a car to take us on a trip into the
Highlands, which would have been great, like, just driving around with
Bill Paterson, but . . . I slept in.''
For the second meeting McCredie is looking considerably more at home,
sipping a Miller Lite in a Glasgow wine bar having forgone (thankfully)
his navy nylon-mix BR suit in favour of denim. A self-confessed ''funny
romantic'' -- he readily admits to be obsessed with Jane Horrocks:
''She's probably quite nice . . . and sexy'' -- he's unassuming,
instantly charming, and liable to burst into laughter at any moment. How
charming? Well, he's being interviewed but he offers to buy the first
drink.
Born 22 years ago in Perth, McCredie first fell in love with acting at
school. Saturday afternoons were spent at the Perth Rep where his sister
Anne, eight years his senior and now working in television production
with programmes such as Hamish Macbeth and Taking Over the Asylum tucked
under her belt, and her husband Andy Gray . . . later of Naked Video
fame, worked and performed (''my hero, I grew up wanting to be Andy'').
Like any 12-year-old kid, he loved football, dreaming of playing for
Scotland but finding himself playing instead for St Johnstone. His first
''proper'' job was a paper round for which his dad used to give him a
lift -- ''I still get slagged about that.''
Then after years of watching the plays, McCredie joined the other
side, attending the Scottish Youth Theatre on and off for some six years
while working at the Perth Rep, at the box office, back stage, handing
out leaflets, whatever let him hang around the theatre and get free
tickets for shows.
After school the RSAMD brought him to Glasgow, which is clearly now
his home. His family were always supportive. His father, a retired
customs and excise officer, ''quietly impressed''. They're still close,
Colin returning home most weekends to ''hang out with friends. Perth is
a place to go back to, it's a good lark, but to live there would drive
me mad.
''I was never pushed into acting, they just supported me. It's not
like a showbiz family or anything, we don't sit at home and talk about
Chekov, we talk about the X-Files and Schindler's List and . . .
interesting things.''
After college Colin paced the floorboards, contemplating unemployment
for a mere two months, before becoming as he puts it, ''a job magnet. It
was unbelievable, I got three jobs in three days. The first was a
commercial for Radio Scotland where I punched the ceiling of a bus which
was like, two hours work. The next day I got Shallow Grave, which I'd
been to see Danny Boyle three times for . . . I didn't think I'd get it
but it was brilliant. Danny is just the best director . . . then on
Thursday I got an episode of Dr Finlay. It was like I was dreaming it.
His next film, Easterhouse, which has just finished filming in
Glasgow, sees McCredie as heavy Big Doug, which is unusual casting at
best, a part he claims to have secured ''by default'', being neither big
nor mean nor heavy. With the part he really craved, however, in the next
MacDonald/Hodge/Boyle project Trainspotting, McCredie was not so
fortunate. This was certainly partly due to his other commitment to
Taggart in which he plays Stuart Fraser, the new sidekick to James
MacPherson, ''a great opportunity to work five days a week for eight
weeks at a time in front of the camera'', its continuance being ''a
tribute to Mark McManus''.
However Trainspotting he feels will be the film of '96: ''People are
going mad, you can't believe the reaction it's getting'' and comes from
a keen interest in Irving Welsh, Maribou Stork being the current prized
read, and indeed literature in general. ''I'd love to write a film
script . . . I'd love to write a book. I've had this idea for a book
about British character actors of all things, you know, like Leonard
Rossiter. You know his face but not anything about him. Like Peter
Sellers . . .'' McCredie mentions Sellers four times within the first
five minutes, titling him ''Mr Comedy Genius''. . . I read a book about
him where it talks about all the other people he worked with, but I
don't know if anyone else would be interested. If I could just get an
angle on it . . .''
Other possibilities include an Open University course in languages or
working within a theatre group ''like Rain Dog, whose motivation is
doing good work and doing it well''. If he hadn't been an actor he'd
have been a writer, ''probably at Glasgow University doing English''. He
pauses and smirks, ''In fact journalism, doing your job. I'd be you,
long hair, dress . . .''
In film he cites as influences David Hayman, Adrian Dunbar, Tim Roth,
Robert Carlyle, and then leaning over to the tape recorder to stress the
point, ''Billy Wilder, Some Like it Hot, Sunset Boulevard, he was the
best. And Tarantino. I loved Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction. It's like
Shallow Grave in that it shows violence as sore. These films cause
controversy because they're showing the truth -- it's the Jean Claude
van Damme films that should be banned that just kill 20 people at a
time.''
So for now it's back to Taggart, back to being Mr Light Entertainment.
Is there anything McCredie wouldn't do when those scripts start to pour
through the letterbox? ''It just depends what position you're in. I'm a
firm believer in never say never or else you look like an idiot. You
have a criterion, you hope to do good work with good people, which means
I wouldn't do an advert for the Sun or the Conservative Party or
Scottish and Newcastle. I play to my strengths. I'm that ginger-haired
geek who's slightly amusing in that light entertainment way.''
And McCredie's off, excusing himself as he's about to be late for
tonight's 10-pin bowling match with Easterhouse against Dr Finlay. He
has a conscience problem as he's pledged allegiance to Scottish
Television already, care of Taggart, but tonight he's wearing his
Easterhouse vest. ''It's all very friendly. Whoever wins, it turns into
a slagging match of: you're only telly, at least we're on film . . .''

IT IS said to be ''a masterpiece'', and has also been described by
Hollywood's deal and concept makers and takers as ''Oscar-calibre'', but
Joe Eszterhas, one of the century's most successful screenwriters, can't
sell his speculative script Blaze of Glory for love -- or his usual
several million dollars.
The big, bearded, bear of a former newspaperman has been moving his
movie material since 1983 with enviable ease. He sold Basic Instinct for
a record $3m in 1990, and this year Showgirls, for which he earned $3.7m
dollars, has just completed production.
His other credits include Flashdance, Jagged Edge, Silver, Music Box,
Betrayed and Jade, which is at present filming with former NYPD Blue
star David Caruso in the lead.
His latest focuses on the friendship between soul legend Otis Redding
and his manager Phil Walden in the 1960s. ''The screenplay is about a
white man and a black man in the South, and examines the civil rights
struggles of the time,'' says Eszterhas.
Of course, Blaze of Glory is several steps away from the sexy, violent
thrillers which have become the Eszterhas trademark, and box-office
bonanzas. Hollywood producers paid him $3.5m for Foreplay and $4m for
One Night Stand -- two of his usual style scripts, which have still to
be filmed.
But at this stage of the game, Eszterhas, 48, can be indulgent: ''I
love the script. I won't rewrite it, because I believe in the power of
the piece. I'm proud of Blaze of Glory and we will try and get it made
in some other way.''
* RON PERLMAN, who was so good in the television series Beauty and the
Beast is to co-star with Brando in another remake of The Island of Dr
Moreau. Another beastly role for Perlman in the tale of genetic dabbling
. . .
* ROBIN SWICORD, who produced Little Women, has now adapted Roald
Dahl's Matilda for the movies, and it will be directed by Danny DeVito.
* NICOLE KIDMAN may be Mrs Tom Cruise, but she's about to be the cover
girl of the moment with Batman Forever. Maybe that should be undercover
girl -- in the July Vanity Fair she has only a wisp of gauze over her
backside.
* SYLVESTER STALLONE officially becomes an icon tonight . He is the
Blockbuster Entertainment Awards ''icon winner'' for his status as the
top grossing action-adventure hero in film history.
* THE X FILES are turning into a Star Trek phenomenon. Not only can
you already buy episodes of video at your local Tesco, there are now
''memorabilia'' auctions on the World Wide Web (Internet addresses:
http:/www fxnetworkscom/fx/ fx-top.html or http://www.delphi.com). A big
attraction is the trenchcoat worn on the series by attraction Gillian
Anderson.
* DANNY DeVITO, with his Jersey productions, is the producer of the
comedy-thriller Get Shorty, which stars John Travolta.
Directory Barry Sonnenfeld brought the Elmore Leonard novel to
DeVito's attention. DeVito explained: ''It was a very Hollywood kind of
situation. I'm in the car and the phone rings and it's Barry -- he's on
vacation on some Hawaiian island.
''He read this book and was passionate about it. I said: 'I'll buy the
book.' Barry thought I meant I'd go to the supermarket and buy the book.
We bought the rights.'' DeVito also appears in the film, which will be
seen in September.
* CHANNEL 4's 10pm Monday night import, NYPD Blue, remains one of the
most popular series in America; and Dennis Franz, as Sipowicz, the true
star. He won an Emmy -- a TV ''Oscar'' -- for his work, but departed
redheaded colleague David Caruso claims it was only because he had left
the show.
Franz laughs: ''That's a moot point. If he thinks he deserves the Emmy
more than me then he can come visit it on my mantel.''
Franz believes all have benefited from Caruso moving to movies like
the present Kiss of Death and the addition of LA  Law alumni Jimmy
Smiths: ''I truly like Jimmy as a human being and on a professional
level.''
* WATCH out for the arrival of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. It is
catching a bigger audience than Baywatch in America, and is no
sword-and-sandals nonsense.
Muscleman Steve Reeves wouldn't recognise this Hercules -- 6ft 3in
tall Kevin Sorbo from Minnesota -- who is a 1990s New Man who only kills
when the plot demands it. Sorbo, 36, is receiving massive fe-mail each
week, mainly from ladies aged 20 to 50, with pictures of themselves in
provocative poses.

IN THE States there is a radio phone-in programme of the most bizarre
kind. Devised and presented by the anonymous Mr Apology, it consists, as
he explained in Must Confess (R4) of ''voices from the apology line . .
. apology without jeopardy''. This secular confessional of the airwaves
provides the opportunity for speakers, their anonymity utterly assured,
to unburden themselves to the world.
Absolution, however, is not assured, for listeners then respond to
these declarations: the guilty are then derided, or given sympathy, in a
weird cacophonous debate with no basis in reality, for Mr Apology
figures that about one third of the confessors are liars, one third
fantasists, and one third ''genuine''. (I tried not to type in those
inverted commas, but part of the programme's fascination was that it
became a kind of Call My Bluff from hell -- no, that's too English an
analogy -- more Oprah Winfrey meets the Twilight Zone.)
Regular listeners, it was said, were waiting for ''something
extraordinary'', something more enthralling than sad suicidal snatches,
or the woman who, using her Manhattan listeners as a kind of collective
analyst, apologised for not fulfilling her own potential.
Then ''Jumping Jim'' came on, describing how he had murdered his
mother. He wanted to meet Mr Apology in a bar. Would Mr A then become an
accessory to the crime? Was the protective anonymity of murderers
justified by an ''art-piece'' inspired radio show? As it happened, his
number was found, Momma answered the phone and complained her boy had
run up a $30,000 phone bill, threatened her with violence, and had
physically abused his last girlfriend.
And so morality was left in mid-airwave . . .
Waldema Januczak in The Perfect Gallery (R4) discussed Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel. In this first of five 15-minute talks of his favourite
art-pieces, this fluent art critic lovingly described the fresco: in its
bonding of paint and plaster, the work, all 10,000ft of it, belonged to
the building for all time.
In the eighteenth century, it was cleaned with bread dipped in Italian
country wine -- a notion Januczak understandably relished as he surveyed
the huge computers of the twentieth-century restorers. Taking advantage
of their scaffolding and waiting till ''a restorer's back was turned''
he reached and touched that gap between God's stretched hand and Adam's.
The image is universally known, endlessly reproduced on T-shirts in
advertising and on television art shows, as he said, but his own wish to
connect with this ''vision of eternity beckoning to the human
imagination'' in such a simple gesture, was moving proof that
art-criticism on radio is not such an odd idea after all.
Produced in Glasgow as a ''Radio 2 Arts Programme'' special, Roots in
the Classics took a comprehensive look at the links between traditional
Scottish music and classical composers. John Purser pointed to the often
kitschy Brigadoon notions of what constitutes a Scottish musical idiom,
and explored some more truthful and less cliched networks of
connections. (When it was mentioned that Capercaillie provided the
soundtrack for the recent Rob Roy, it occurred to me that at least they
got the musical accent right.)
Iain Anderson in conversation with Aly Bain, Shaun Davey, and many
other renowned musicians put together an excellent package which was
special indeed. (I also enjoyed the nice piece of musical gossip which
John Purser planted amid the erudition. Seemingly Mendelssohn never
actually made it into Fingal's cave -- sea-sickness got to him first.)
Briefly -- Radio 4's Short Story The Last of the Mohicans, by Joseph
O'Connor, introduced me to an excellent Irish writer I would like to
hear more of, while the new panel game Missed Demeanours (R4) -- in
spite of the talented Eddie Izzard -- was as funny as Have I Got News
For You, were you to subtract Hislop, Merton, and Deayton.

ON paper it looked rather better than I suspected it might sound.
Linda Ormiston, whose career has ranged from the seriousness of the
operatic stage to the deadly seriousness of music hall-style
entertainment and comedy (with a dash of radio presenting somewhere in
there too), has worked up her One Woman Show on the lives, loves, and
music of what she called ''four doyennes of the musical stage'': Joyce
Grenfell, Gracie Fields, Gertrude Lawrence, and Beatrice Lillie.
The risk is obvious: that entertaining nostalgia can veer
excruciatingly into cloying sentiment. When she invited her audience
last night to sing, it seemed that Linda Ormiston might be courting the
latter. Fortunately the tendency to plunge into wallow was averted
largely by her timely presentation of anecdotes and myriad information
about the four musical grandes dames drawn from letters, postcards, and
pure gossip.
And by the mistakes. Performing the music from memory, Ormiston
launched into a Gertrude Lawrence number from the London Revue of 1924.
Within three lines it was clear that she was singing total mince. ''I'll
start that again -- that was complete gibberish,'' she said. At which
pianist John Scrimger added: ''Well, the piano's right.'' Which brought
the immediate, snarled rejoinder from Ormiston: ''For once.'' Aye,
nothing like live music.
By and large, an entertaining presentation of the four singers, with
some superb characterisation by Ormiston: totally over the top as
Lillie, brilliantly depicting the remorseless urge of Lawrence to
upstage everyone, and especially of the devastating wit of Joyce
Grenfell. With Gracie Fields, there wasn't a lot she could do, other
than flatten her vowels and dutifully drop every ''h'' in sight.

COMPUTER games, the Oprah Winfrey Show, Big Arnie movies on video --
we modern fortunates have access to all manner of home entertainment the
Victorians had to make do without. But then they did have an Empire to
divert them . . . But, I hear you cry -- so do we! We have that
(self-styled) Grand Palace of Varieties, the Edinburgh Festival Theatre,
where maestro Paul Iles regularly raises the curtain on acts that evoke
the pleasures and routines of yesteryear.
Latest in this lineup is the Victorian Circus of Illusion, which comes
before us in a veritable tan-ta-ra of effulgent phrases. The illusion
begins, you see, with the spinning of fine lines puffing what we are
about to see: by the time the words are made flesh we are already
thinking the best. To be honest, however, I started off thinking the
worst. The opening attempts by our MC, Lord Ringmain, to chivvy us into
vociferous conviviality fell badly from a great height, and without a
safety net. Things perked up steadily when the acts themselves appeared.
One after another they offered us traditional skills -- trapeze
acrobatics, magic tricks, juggling -- but with the kind of personalised
presentation.
This was particularly true of Steve Rawling, whose juggling act was a
rip-roaring success not simply because he had expertise, but because he
had sparky patter and a lovely, loony way of haranguing the audience,
reproaching them for not appreciating the danger he was putting them in
. . . when a member of the stalls was brought on stage to assist with a
particularly complicated routine -- balancing bottles on his chin while
juggling flaming torches -- her look of apprehension served for all.

LET no-one say the BBC's ''Forbidden Weekend'' season did not perform
a valuable public service. If nothing else, here was a chance to
remember what a truly awful, supremely inept, and thunderingly silly
film-maker Ken Russell really is.
For years I thought it was just me. Didn't anyone else object to the
ritual humiliation of perfectly good actors, the desecration of great
music, and the faintly repellent exhibition of what were plainly the
director's own odoriferous fixations? Tommy may have been the worst,
given that Pete Townsend's ''opera'' (two good songs and a story even a
deaf, dumb, and blind boy could see through) was daft to begin with, but
the competition remains stiff.
That's not to say The Devils (BBC2, Monday) should ever have been
banned. Sedated perhaps, given a cup of tea and a bit of sexual
counselling, but never banned.
In that lay the entire joke of the season: here was auntie allowing us
at last to see movies she had decided we were grown up enough to
witness. As a special treat she allowed us to stay up late, hear naughty
words, see naughty things, and wonder what all the fuss was about.
TV is censorious almost by instinct. Even the household nine-year-old
has been known to wonder why the televised version of, say, Beverley
Hills Cop contains the same murderous gun battles as the video but
significantly less of Eddie Murphy's homeboy cussing. What's the logic?
Who decides, and how, that Eddie can swear in this scene but not in
that? Try explaining it to a child.
Predictably enough, the BBC offered the revelation, so-called, in
Children of the Video (BBC2, Monday) that the majority of children
between the ages of eight and 11 often see films with 15 and 18
certificates. Shock? Horror? Actually the children seemed in pretty good
shape despite their ordeal and proved only that the one thing people of
any age want to see is the thing they are forbidden to see.
Mark Lawson, living proof of the thesis that what works in print
doesn't always work in life, returned to the topic with a Late Show
panel discussion (BBC2, Wednesday) of awesome dreariness.
Is TV damaging? When a group of po-faced ''serious'' people are
sitting round a table misunderstanding every argument it certainly feels
that way.
Here, as ever, the forces of light were ranged against the forces of
darkness, and neither had a good word, never mind an interesting one, to
say for the other.
It made you feel you wanted to do something really violent, like
smashing the TV set, not least when David Baddiel, a lame comic better
known these days as one of the lads from Fantasy Football League, turned
out to be the voice of sanity. What could be more disturbing? The
centre-piece of the season, Empire of the Censors (BBC2, Sunday and
Monday), could itself have done with a bit of cutting. As social history
it was all very well; as an insight into the minds of the sort of people
prepared to decide what's good for everyone else it was shallow and
dull, particularly in its now obligatory
and-what-about-this-Internet-thing section.
As though in deliberate contrast, the most compelling piece of the
week was The Living Dead: On the Desperate Edge of Now (BBC2, Tuesday).
This offered the thesis, all the more dangerous because it was so well
argued, that the history of the twentieth century has depended more on
the construction of myths than the conflict between good and evil.
Hitler and Goering rose to power with one idealised version of the past;
the Allies, after their conquest, created a matching fantasy, in this
case of the Good War.
The piece insisted, in other words, on historical relativism and came
dangerously close in the process to saying that even the Nazis had a
point. Granted, the film argued, it was a point based on a lie -- but so
was the myth of morally pure western anti-fascism. The Nuremberg trials,
where Goering was prevented from attempting to justify himself, thus
became the central event at which history was debased.
To illustrate its argument, On the Desperate Edge of Now deployed
surreal imagery -- vampirism, blossoming flowers, lighting, and sinister
scenery -- as if to say that all falsehoods are equal. But are they?
Even if the politicians did not truly believe they were ridding the
world of an alien evil when they demonised Germany for strategic
advantage, millions of ordinary people certainly did. They made the lie
of the Good War true.
Hannah Arendt wrote of the banality of evil; here, inadvertently
proved, was the banality of good.
For real, professional banality, though, one had to turn to Doing Rude
Things (BBC2, Monday). This was misrepresented as a programme by Angus
Deayton (currently presiding over the best season so far of Have I Got
News For You).
In reality, it was a bunch of old clips from the slap-and-tickle days
of British soft, meaning utterly flaccid, porn. Look, it seemed to say,
at the really silly things people used to watch. Look, we said, at the
really silly programme you've made to prove the point.
Nowadays we leave that sort of thing to foreigners. With the departure
of the genuinely subversive, wholly blasphemous, and generally hilarious
Father Ted, God bless him, from Channel 4's Friday schedules, only
Eurotrash remains. Anyone still attached to the mystifyingly popular
Reeves and Mortimer (BBC2, Friday) obviously has never experienced the
double act of Antoine and Jean-Paul. Foul features, faux frog accents,
and the funniest attack on all things English since Dick Van Dyke's turn
in Mary Poppins.
Offensive, too.
Sadly, none of the same can be said of Paul Merton's Life of Comedy
(BBC1, Friday), a series which ought to be wonderful yet manages to be
utterly stultifying. It was billed as Merton's personal choice of the
best of TV comedy. Instead, it offers a ragbag of familiar clips slung
together without rhyme, reason, or theme.
History is ignored, differences in comic style are passed over, and
Merton wanders through it all in some woefully unfunny sitcom skits
linking nothing with nothing. Aimless monologues were once his hallmark;
aimless comedy never was. For reasons best known to themselves, someone
has gone to a lot of trouble to prove that no-one's funny all the time.

While political lies barely create a stir, John Major now finds
himself under attack for telling the truth about the housing boom of the
eighties which has turned into the negative-equity crisis of the
nineties. Benedict Brogan reports
TRUTH is a dangerous thing. Gerald Ford, on assuming the American
presidency following Richard Nixon's exit over Watergate, claimed truth
is the glue that holds governments together. John Major, under fire for
pointing out the obvious about house inflation, might disagree. Truth,
in his case, is something best avoided.
The headlines in yesterday's papers -- Major in home-buying storm
(Daily Mail), Fury as Major blames homes loss on Thatcher years
(Guardian) -- proved just how difficult it is for politicians to be
honest without tripping up in public.
Answering questions after a routine speech to businessmen in Lincoln
on Thursday, Mr Major recalled the ''crazy situation'' of the late
eighties housing boom and the unstoppable upward spiral in house prices.
''By the time it stopped an awful lot of people had committed themselves
to mortgages that were a good deal bigger than ideally they should have
had,'' he said. Widespread negative equity was the result.
Anyone with an ounce of hindsight, or a house worth less than its
mortgage, does not need the Prime Minister's help to recognise that the
housing boom set off by Nigel Lawson's 1988 budget was a disaster for
the economy. The mad rush into property led by those trying to beat the
deadline for the end of double mortgage tax relief began an inflationary
spiral that ended with interest rates of more than 15%, soaring
unemployment, and an irretrievably collapsed housing market.
To the cynic, John Major's conclusions on the housing boom are
astonishing only for their time in coming. Margaret Thatcher, like
Joseph Chamberlain, believed in never apologising, never explaining. By
admitting that the boom was a bad idea, John Major has come the closest
yet of any Tory to offering some sort of apology to the estimated one
million homeowners who are still trapped by negative equity.
But his critics claim that by being honest he has also shown a
remarkable degree of political ineptitude. Politics is partly a question
of spotting the banana skins and avoiding them. Even an unpredictable
question-and-answer session can be managed successfully: the art is in
avoiding saying anything that might come back to haunt you.
John Major was Lawson's Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 1988 and a
member of the Cabinet responsible for the housing boom. By appearing to
criticise the excesses of the Thatcher years he drew accusations of
rewriting history and dodging the blame for the suffering of others.
Yesterday at Westminster, Labour's experts in media management were
baffled by the gaffe. One of Tony Blair's closest aides wondered out
loud whether this wasn't proof that the Government has completely lost
whatever knack for news management it once had. ''If it had been up to
us we wouldn't have let the cameras in for the informal part of the
event.''
Ruthless, yes, but for a politician's staff the first rule in the art
of avoiding bad publicity is to control what comes out of the
politician's mouth as much as possible. Press conferences are preceeded
by exhaustive briefing -- at least an hour in Tony Blair's case. And any
situation in which the politician might have to say something
unrehearsed is carefully planned. If cameras can be excluded, all the
better.
Labour's media team at Westminster is a model of its kind.
Conservatives in search of a professional press operation should wander
through the Press Gallery on any late afternoon, where they will
inevitably bump into one or more of Tony Blair's officials making their
rounds.
Their job is to make sure Labour's ''line'' -- the official version --
is accurately represented by the press, and that Government mistakes are
noticed. By chatting with journalists they also spot how a story is
developing and are on hand to counter it if necessary. Within hours of
John Major uttering his verdict on the housing boom, Blair's officials
had produced a briefing paper summarising what the Prime Minister had
previously said about home ownership.
Among Conservatives yesterday the consensus was of a harmless remark
that had been allowed to spin out of control. One Tory source said:
''You get clamour for openness and access to all sorts of events. The
downside is that when people are talking around the table the way the
Prime Minister was on Thursday it mustn't be a very formal occasion.
People shouldn't have to watch their words so carefully.''
The Government claims the comments were seized on by journalists and
presented to Labour for comment. Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown obliged
by suggesting the Prime Minister was blaming home-owners for the boom.
He hadn't, but on a quiet news day during the parliamentary recess, a
proverbial ''row'' was born. The Tory source said: ''What the PM was
doing was having conversations with people round the table saying things
they would all recognise and agree with. He was not apportioning
blame.''
The housing boom gaffe is already being dismissed by the Government
and Central Office as a 24-hour wonder. But it highlights the continuing
difficulties Mr Major has had with presentation. He is on his second
Downing Street press secretary, Christopher Meyer, who is criticised by
some backbenchers for failing to protect his boss from a succession of
damaging stories.
With Labour roaring ahead in the polls and beginning to scent victory
at the next General Election, Tory Central Office is acutely aware of
the problem. A new director of communications, Hugh Colver, took over
last month, and he has already identified a number of areas in which the
party needs to improve its news management. But stopping John Major from
telling the truth occasionally is not one of them.

Six years ago tomorrow, Tiananmen Square became infamous as a place of
national tyranny, with the Chinese Government's brutal crackdown on
freedom marchers there. This week, dozens of activists have been
harassed and arrested in a countrywide sweep to prevent demonstrations
this weekend. But Amnesty International's latest report reveals that the
communists have been significantly stepping up political repression over
the past 12 months, victimising those who dare to ask about the fate of
the hundreds killed or arrested during the 1989 protests. Against this
background of abuse, a global summit for women is scheduled for Beijing
in September, but a broken promise threatens to mar the whole occasion
IT ALWAYS has been something of a Chinese puzzle that the United
Nations should choose to plant the fourth World Conference on Women in
Beijing. With civil liberty so high on the agenda, why should the UN
enhance the status of a country which routinely sins against human
rights? In the past few days alone, at least three dozen democracy
activists have been rounded up and jailed by the authorities -- a
callous warning to those who would remind the rest of us of liberty's
betrayal in Tiananmen Square.
As ever, the UN motive is complicated, and not unpolitical. The
simplest explanation is that it was Asia's turn to hold this defining
gathering -- in effect a summit of governments and their delegations.
China, anxious to shake off the ghosts of that tyrannous June in 1989,
made the most persuasive sales pitch, and, for its part, the UN felt
that by selecting Beijing as the venue, China would thus collaborate
positively in the blueprint-for-action document to be drawn up at the
end of the September conference.
And so it seemed, until the other day, when the Chinese puzzle
acquired the kind of depressing twist which now threatens the
effectiveness of everything. When China was awarded the convention in
1991, it was made clear by the UN that the non-governmental Women's
Forum, composed of women's groups from all over the world, would be part
of the package, and that there was to be a great deal of interaction
between the two events.
The Forum, which itself will attract about 30,000 people, lasts a
fortnight and begins on August 30, overlapping the official conference
by one week. It represents the broadest spectrum of women's concerns,
aiming to be a powerful lobby among the different national governments
and UN personnel.
Now, despite years of planning, its very existence seems in jeopardy,
with the sudden announcement by the Chinese that the Forum's base will
not be in Beijing. Instead, it will be housed in Huairou, 30 miles from
the capital. Given the expense of commuting and the chaotic nature of
Chinese traffic anyway, the distance to and from Beijing will be
insurmountable for most of the Forum women, who are on meagre budgets.
But the real anger arises because the Forum organisers will be isolated
from the action in that crucial overlapping week.
China's ostensible reason for the switch is that the authorities now
consider Beijing's infrastructure inadequate for both events, and they
have promised the Forum a purpose-built centre in what is described as a
pretty tourist town.
At present, however, Huairou has little besides scattered housing and
only a few telephone and fax lines. Attempting a diplomatic compromise,
UN under-secretary Ismat Kitani is negotiating in China, but the
government there is resolute. A spokesman says: ''We have no plans to
switch the Forum from Huairou.''
Meanwhile, NGO delegates, from contries as diverse as Bangladesh and
Brazil, are urging the UN secretary-general, Boutros Boutros Ghali, to
cancel or postpone the official event if the Forum cannot operate from
Beijing as originally agreed.
With so many thousands of women descending on China, the UN is not
unsympathetic to the accommodation argument, but suspicion is growing
that the Chinese wish to marginalise the Forum for another reason: they
fear the militants in its ranks.
Among grassroot associations, from both developing and industrial
worlds, there are many with keen social platforms of mutual interest and
others whose creeds conflict: the right-to-life activists versus the
pro-abortion lobby; the campaigners for legal prostitution versus the
anti-porn crusade. (Scotland's representatives will include the women's
Joint Action Group and the Church of Scotland Women's Guild). Banners
and exhibitions will proclaim their vivid diversity, but all share one
common feature: the desire to voice their cause without fear of reproof
or reprisal.
So it has been in the past when the NGOs have been able to create a
tidal wave of viewpoints and commitment, feeding their themes into the
official discussions on poverty and women's poor health, on how to
diminish the violence against women, how to encourage their education
and increase their presence in their public life.
By the middle of September, these deliberations will be filtered into
the UN's Global Platform for Action. But how effective are such
strategies when all the evidence confirms that the ''feminisation of
poverty'' is worsening universally?
The UN insists that awareness of women's problems and their importance
has improved among governments since the last world conference in Kenya
in 1985. From New York, a spokesperson says: ''There exists now, in both
the northern and southern hemispheres, far greater recognition that if
governments do not address women and empower them, then their society
does not progress.
For instance, physical abuse of women is now a global concern. And the
tenor of feminism itself is changing. The word gender rather than
feminism is becoming widespread, as women wish to develop with men, and
not in isolation.'' Here the emerging role model is Scandinavia which,
without any threat to virility or cries of male surrender, has evolved a
culture of shared responsibility between men and women, redefining
public and private status in ways more humane to both.
But Scandinavia's New World Order remains alien to the British
mentality, never mind the Chinese. For China, however, the problem is
this: unwittingly it has invited the expression of revolutionary thought
at a time of national unease. The death of Deng Xiaoping approaches, and
the leadership is jostling for position while hounding dissidents who
might yet try to revive that valiant Tiananmen march for freedom. So,
for Beijing itself, the Chinese puzzle now acquires another twist -- how
do you ask the world inside your house without allowing it to be your
witness?

Jennifer Cunningham reports from the front-line of the holidays war
WHEN a cold, wet spring spurs Brits to dreams of Mediterranean
sunshine, the tour operators and travel agents get out the calculators
and the felt-tip pens. The challenge is just how far below #1000 they
can push flights and accommodation for a family of four.
The UK's biggest tour operator, Thomson, chose the second week of
August last year to launch their brochure for this summer's holidays.
Cynics suggest it was timed so that people who had paid the highest
peak-season prices for their packages to the sun were safely out of the
way when they revealed that prices would be cut this year with thousands
of free deals for children on family holidays and the lowest price for
an adult on a self-catering holiday in Ibiza being cut by #100.
Uncharitable perhaps, but the price of package holidays is as graphic
an illustration of market forces as any Stock Exchange results and that
was the first attack in the battle for '95. The second skirmish went to
Thomas Cook with this week's announcement of discounts of #110 per adult
on selected holidays to five of the most popular destinations. It was
the riposte to last week's cut of #100 on many June holidays by Lunn
Poly, which has now extended their booking deadline by a week to June 10
to coincide with Cook's.
The Cook's offer applies only to certain 14-night packages to Majorca,
Menorca, the Algarve, and the Greek islands of Corfu and Kos between
July 10 and September 3. Branches around Glasgow reported that the first
bookings were made yesterday morning and say there is still
availability. A typical example would be a brochure price of #345 for
one of four adults staying in a self-catering apartment in Menorca. The
#110 reduction would take the price to #235, a saving of 32%.
Independent travel agents feel as beleaguered as UN troops caught
between the Bosnians and the Serbs. ''Sheer greed by the big boys is
squeezing everyone else out. The customers are not interested in the
internal politics of the travel trade, but the result is less choice for
them,'' said Muir Anderson, who runs a Glasgow travel agency and is
currently chairman of the Scottish branch of ABTA.
''We practically have a monopoly where companies like the travel agent
Lunn Poly is related to the operator Thomson and they own the airline
between them. It is the small specialist operators as well as the
independent travel agents who are being squeezed.
''When Thomson launched this summer's programmes last year, they were
changing the direct services available by the hour -- and that is one of
the reasons why they have so much late booking. They have created a very
confusing picture. Effectively they are now offering discounts if you
book early and discounts if you book late. People now think that if they
commit themselves to an early booking they will miss the opportunity of
a greater saving later on,'' he said.
Thomson's spokeswoman said: ''We have just produced the fourth edition
of our brochure. Why do you think we would do that if the prices did not
change? We are on target for this summer's sales, but some places are
not selling as well as others and they are the places where you will
find travel agents' offers.''
Lunn Poly also dismissed the criticism, saying: ''Those who book early
are a different type of holidaymaker from those who book late. Early
bookers are people who know exactly when and where they want to go. They
may be tied to school holidays or a factory week or want to book a large
group. Last year we had an extended family of 103 who saved #2000 on a
#13,000 holiday by booking early. People who are flexible enough to go
to a travel agent on Wednesday and fly out on Saturday and wait until
they get to their destination before being told where they are going to
stay will also get bargains.''
Spokeswoman Debbie Hindle warned that late availability prices can go
up as well as down if demand increases.
It is not quite as simple as that, according to Anderson, who added:
''Travellers must read the small print. They may not notice that the
travel agent offering the highest discount also has the highest
insurance premium or makes an additional charge for payment by credit
card.
''Low prices might seem like a boon for the holidaymaker, but the
number of seats available from Glasgow has been reduced. People wanting
to fly direct from Glasgow during the school holidays in July and the
first half of August are likely to find some difficulty.'' So is it the
price or the idea of beating the system by getting a bargain which
matters most? A recent survey  showed an average two-week holiday in
Torremolinos for a family of four taking half-board in a hotel was
#2356, but that it nearly doubled when the cost of insurance, new
clothes, toiletries and car hire and duty-free shopping was included.

Carolina Herrera didn't start designing until her forties, but swiftly
established a chic style with polka dots as her trade mark. Now she has
launched a new fragrance, as Francesca Fearon reports
IT WAS a rare privilege for a fashion designer to have Jackie Onassis
model for her, but it once happened to Carolina Herrera. The New York
designer explained: ''After showing my collections Jackie would come
back to my atelier and pick out what she liked. One day she happened to
meet the buyers from Neiman Marcus (an American store) just as she was
coming out of the dressing room wearing one of the dresses; she walks in
front of them and with all her naturalness and in a friendly way she
said to them: 'Don't you think this one I'm wearing is a marvel? . . .
You should buy it!' Can you imagine how they reacted?''
Onassis and Herrera were close friends. Herrera designed Caroline
Kennedy's bridal gown, dubbed the ''Royal Wedding'' dress by Americans
-- it was a spotted Swiss embroidered affair with huge silk skirts.
Although never copied, the design prompted the subsequent successful
launch of a special couture bridal collection. And Marla Marples married
Donald Trump wearing an exclusive Herrera.
Herrera didn't start designing until her forties, but swiftly
established a chic style of slim fitted jackets, tight bodices, and
short skirts liberally smothered in black and white spots. Polka dots
had been her trade mark since that first collection in 1981, splattering
not just clothes but the graphic packaging of her fragrancies. She has
just launched a new fragrance -- her second for women -- called Flore.
Its poetic name is inspired by the mythological goddess of spring who is
the subject of a famous painting Empire of Flore by Nicolas Poussin,
which can be seen at the Royal Academy.
Flore is a light blend of lily of the valley, iris, and jasmine. ''I
really wanted a lily of the valley fragrance,'' she explains, ''because
it has been a long time since someone has created something like that.''
It is a youthful, bright, floral perfume reflecting the designer's
passion for flowers.
Carolina Herrera is from one of Venezuela's oldest families, with
Spanish ancestry, and an upbringing steeped in the fashions of French
couture -- her grandmother wore Balenciaga and Carolina wore Lanvin for
her first ball. Groomed, elegant, and with more than a passing
resemblance to Eva Peron, she frequently featured on the best-dressed
list before ultimately switching from consumer to designer.
From the beginning she displayed an innate understanding of her
customers and their lifestyle -- launching herself on the job market or
needing something special for a wedding or cocktail party. Herrera's
pastel sculpted suits border on couture in polish and quality, while the
mushroom pleated skirts and little cashmere twin sets in her summer
collection are seductively graceful. She cuts close to the body whether
for a nineties gingham dress or slim statuesque evening gown in her
signature shades of poppy and marigold -- this season's colourful
tribute to Flore.
* EURO-SCEPTICS may be having second thoughts about Britain's
commitment to European Union, but British fashion retailers certainly
have no qualms.
At the same time as top European designers like Prada, Dolce &amp;
Gabbana, and Christian Lacroix invade these shores with lavish
boutiques, the British are heading through the Channel Tunnel to
establish a vanguard position in Paris.
Household names like Laura Ashley, Hackett, Jaeger, and Marks &amp;
Spencer have had a toehold in the French capital for some time. In fact,
the overflow of chic Parisiennes purchasing such items as knickers and
English marmalade at M &amp; S's flagship branch on Boulevard Haussman has
made this store one of the most profitable in the group.
Last year designer/retailer Joseph opened his doors at one of Paris's
most exclusive addresses on Avenue Montaigne among grand old couture
houses like Dior, Ungaro, and Nina Ricci.
Although French-born, Joseph Ettedgui has built his retail empire in
London stocking a cross section of stylish, avant garde designers as
well as his own collection. The graceful Paris store echoes this
approach, except the elegant display of Galliano's couture-quality
design are a cocky nod to his neighbours.
Another British retailer establishing a firm foothold (if you will
pardon the expression) in the Gallic psyche is Pied a Terre. Pied a
Terre is a popular hunting ground for both funky and glamorous footwear.
Now snakeskin cowboy boots, colourful stilettos, suede pumps, and the
latest designs in Lycra are cladding the choicest feet in Paris.
In the Rue de Sevres, Pied a Terre is in the heart of the city's shoe
district with fierce competition -- something owners Nigel and Anita
Davis have never shied away from -- coming from Roger Vivier, Stephane
Kelian, and Robert Clergerie.
The shop is Davis's first venture on to the continent although they
are planning more branches around Europe and a global wholesale
operation. ''Our attitude is that Paris is the window to the world,
however much we would like to believe London is,'' says Anita Davis.
As those before Pied a Terre have found, opening in the capital of
fashion establishes brand names on an international scale.

Smoking jackets adorned with cigarettes and trousers sporting drain
pipes, Ann Cowan reports on a fashion parade that had it all
LAST week fashion and theatre costume took to the catwalk at Edinburgh
College of Art. The setting was the Sculpture Court, a suitably
classical backdrop for Rachel Jamieson's Grecian-style evening wear. Her
dance dresses were slender columns of grey-washed silk, some asymmetric,
some draped and all flattering.
Lavish panels of geometric pleating in rich dark poult taffeta gave
exaggerated shape to Helen Gaythorpe's Chinese Lantern look. In
contrast, the futuristic white synthetic outfits by Callum Clark. His
mock-croc cropped jackets were straight and sexy and looked great on the
catwalk.
Fiona Boyter's witty collection was shot through with shades of grey
and Schiaparelli. The ballgown of football and baseball print and the
smoking jacket featured cigarettes. Why nobody every thought of putting
pictures of drainpipes down the narrow trousers of that name is not
clear, but Fiona Boyter does now. Her clothes are strong on fun and pun.
Helen O'Donnell showed wearable light linen summer garments. More
offbeat were her corset-like mini-crinis, worn with outrageous wigs.
After experimenting with hat-wigs for some time, she produced some outre
white spirals and horns, strictly for the extroverts.
For the brave young man, Rinaldo Girasoli designed and made trousers
which incorporated a skirt-like panel and jackets which, he says, ''defy
the limitations of tailoring''. Lightly into chiffon and organza goes
Susan Orford who has won a travel award worth #2100 in the 1995 Royal
Society of Arts Design Awards.
And for something completely different, theatre costume. Connie
Fairburn launched a maritime creation so evocative that it almost smelt
of the sea. In grey-blue and gold, draped with fishing nets and
ornamented with dangling pearls and oyster shells was The Fine Ship. The
dramatic eighteenth century creation had a corset of masts and rigging,
and was worn with a high wig topped by a ship.
As the graduating class of '95 embark on the often stormy sea of
commerce, we wish them well. They are clearly adventurous enough to face
the challenge of the wider world.

* In the run up to Father's Day on June 18, Remington, the makers of
electric shavers, has uncovered some alarming facts about facial hair.
Devout Muslims save every whisker in a sacred box that accompanies them
to the grave. Alexander the Great ordered his troops to shave so the
Prussians couldn't grab their beards in combat. Bearded tourists were
banned from entering Greece until as recently as 1967.
Remington has a wide range of shavers from the top of the range Triple
Foil at #64.50 to the mid-priced Dual Foil at #16.99. Their beard
trimmers start at #14.99. All available from Boots, Argos and leading
electrical retailers.
* Wings for Men by Giorgio Beverly Hills has something for Father's
Day too. When you buy a 100ml Wings For Men Aftershave or products to
the equivalent value, a stylish teal green 'pebble-suede' bag will be
yours, or Dad's. Gift available while stocks last at all major stores.
* Sixty per cent of people say they never use a sunscreen when
involved in outdoor activity abroad or in the UK -- other than when
sunbathing. Windsor Healthcare has produced a range of high protection
suncreams to minimise damage to the skin through heat, wind or humidity.
Its three products are sweatproof and waterproof, and they will not run
into the eyes. Uvistat Long Lasting protects with one good application.
It costs #8.99 for 100g of Factor 25 cream; #8.29 for 100ml of Factor 15
Lotion, and #5.99 for 23g Uvistat Long Lasting Factor 20 Sunstick.
* Tesco has extended its basic skin care range, at great value for
money -- each product is less than #1.30. Look out for the Tesco Skin
Essentials Fragrance Free range, a mild PH balanced selection for
sensitive skin, and the brand new Vitamin E range. Products include the
basics; Eye Make-Up Remover, Foaming Facial Wash, Cleansing Lotion and
Toner, Moisturising Cream and Lotion. Dermatological tests have been
carried out on products in both ranges and none have been tested on
animals. Prices start with a 150ml bottle of Cleansing Lotion at 99p, up
to #1.29 for 100ml of Foaming Facial Wash.

VETERANS of the Second World War began lining up at Edinburgh Castle
yesterday for their tickets to attend the sunset ceremony to be held on
the esplanade on August 20 to mark the 50th anniversary of VJ Day.
On that evening, 8500 veterans and their spouses are to watch a
performance of marching and music by massed bands and pipes and drums
from all three services and the Royal British Legion Scotland. A
fireworks display will follow. It will be attended by the Princess
Royal.
The army in Scotland is encouraging all members of the wartime
generation to apply for tickets.
In the advance guard yesterday were veterans from Whitefoord House and
Haig Memorial Home, both Edinburgh.
The oldest veteran was Mr Harry Cummings, 90, who was a
colour-sergeant in the Royal Scots and served from 1926 to 1947. He saw
service in Palestine before the war and in France in 1939 and 1940.
Others in line were Mr Robert Finlayson, 87, who was a
lieutenant-colonel in the Indian army during the war; and Mr John
McMillan, 85, a sergeant in the Royal Scots, who was taken prisoner by
the Japanese at Hong Kong and escaped three times.
Also there were Mr Hugh Erskine, 83, a chief engine room artificer in
the Royal Navy, who served on three destroyers, which were sunk between
1939 and 1943, and later sailed on seven convoys to Russia; and Mr Sandy
Duff, 73, a leading aircraftsman in the RAF, who served from 1940 to
1946.

CAR driver James Friar forced an off-duty policeman on a motor cycle
to crash, a sheriff ruled yesterday.
Constable Robert Madden and his wife Valerie, the pillion passenger,
were thrown off the bike. Awarding the Maddens damages of more than
#4000, Sheriff George Evans said Mr Friar had ''deliberately caused the
accident due to 'road rage' ''.
The accident happened after a five-mile duel in which both drivers,
and another off-duty policeman on a motor bike, had flashed their
headlights at each other at speeds of up to 50 mph. The couple, of Barke
Road, Seafar, Cumbernauld, had sued Mr Friar, of Laggan Road,
Bishopbriggs, in a civil action at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
In his written judgment, Sheriff Evans said: ''I have little doubt
that Mr Friar had worked himself up into a lather of outrageous
indignation about what he took to be the intimidatory way that the two
motor cyclists had been driving.''
The accident took place in June 1993 on the Kirkintilloch-Cumbernauld
Road. Constable Madden was on his way home from a night out with his
friend, Constable Steven Foggan. Their wives were pillion passengers.
When Mr Foggan tried to pass the car, Mr Friar accelerated. When he
passed the car at a second attempt there was an exchange of gestures.
After both riders had passed the car, Mr Friar began switching his
full beam on and off as he followed them at 50 mph. At a roundabout, Mr
Foggan missed an exit road, had to go round again, and finished up
behind Mr Friar.
The sheriff was told the car twice veered against Mr Madden's bike,
clipping his wife's leg and hitting the handle-bars. The policeman lost
control and the couple fell off.
Sheriff Evans found that Mr Friar had deliberately caused the
accident, resulting in the couple suffering certain injuries and the
bike being extensively damaged.
The sheriff said he preferred the evidence of the couples, who did not
strike him as being the usual type of ''bikers''.
Mr Friar claimed he had become ''very frightened'' when he found
himself between the two bikes. He alleged it was Mr Madden's bike which
veered towards him and he tried to accelerate to avoid a collision.

A year after a Chinook helicopter crashed on the Mull of Kintyre,
killing some of the country's top terrorism experts, relatives returned
to the scene for a memorial service. Keith Sinclair reports
RELATIVES of the Northern Ireland counter-terrorism experts who died
in last year's Chinook helicopter disaster gathered at the scene of the
accident on a remote Scottish hillside yesterday to pay silent homage.
About 100 relatives stood in prayer on the Mull of Kintyre exactly a
year after the giant twin-rotor Chinook ploughed into the hillside in
bad weather, killing all 25 members of the security services on board
and four crew.
As they gathered around a memorial cairn marking the spot where the
helicopter crashed, evidence of the tragedy was all around them on the
hillside still scorched by the fire. Most of all, however, it showed on
the sombre faces of the loved ones of those killed.
The accident, which happened as the senior security staff were
apparently travelling to the Army base at Fort George near Inverness for
a conference, was the RAF's worst helicopter crash of modern times.
Ten members of the RUC Special Branch, nine army intelligence
officers, six ''Government officials'', and the four-man RAF crew were
killed.
The relatives were flown to the crash scene yesterday from Belfast
after first attending another anniversary service at a newly-built
garden of remembrance in the grounds of the army's Northern Ireland
headquarters at Lisburn.
The centrepiece of the garden is a large stone brought from the Mull
of Kintyre. At Lisburn, Northern Ireland GOC Lieutenant General Sir
Roger Wheeler paid tribute to the victims' ''quiet but absolute
professionalism and determination''. The peace of the present Ulster
ceasefire had been won by the commitment and dedication of them and
their like, he said.
The families were flown in a VC10 aircraft to RAF Machrihanish and
taken by bus and mini-bus to the remote spot on the 1300ft Beinn na Lice
-- The Mountain of the Stone Slab -- where the tragedy happened.
For many it was their second visit to the scene. Some had been there
when the cairn was first dedicated in September.
As they trekked up the hillside on the last part of their pilgrimage,
evidence of the crash was all around them. Large expanses of ground are
still bare, the heather burnt away by the fireball which erupted when
the Chinook hit the hillside while it was climbing at a slight angle.
The scene was shrouded in thick mist before the relatives arrived but
the skies cleared by the time the simple half-hour service began. Out to
sea, just 12 miles away, the hills of north Antrim were clearly visible.
As relatives clustered around the six-foot cairn high on the hillside,
there were no VIPs and few army top brass for what was intended to be a
private family affair.
Some wreaths and posies were already in position before the relatives
arrived. One had a card attached saying: ''Bob, we miss you badly.
Thinking and remembering our happy times together.'' Many relatives
arrived bearing fresh flowers and tributes.
The service was jointly conducted by two local ministers, Church of
Scotland minister the Rev Roddy McNidder and Roman Catholic priest
Father Roddy McAulay, and by three military chaplains from Northern
Ireland, the Rev Andy McMullon, the Rev David Wilkes and the Rev Michael
Masterson.
Mr Wilkes told them: ''We return here today to remember, to grieve --
and to hope.''
Mr McNidder, of Southend Parish Church, spoke of the ''painful and
poignant memories''.
Many relatives fought back tears. One woman spent the service with a
comforting arm stretched out around the shoulder of a younger woman.
Some toddlers fidgeted but one young boy sat alone and well away from
the crowd lost in his thoughts.
In one of several Army tents erected at the scene, the local
Campbeltown brass band played a musical accompaniment. The service ended
with a girl member of the band, Morgan Gilchrist, 17, playing Last Post
and Reveille.
In the silence between, only the wind could be heard. That and the
distant noise of the sea hundreds of feet below.
Mr McNidder, who was one of the first local people on the scene after
the crash and gathered rescue workers in prayer on the hillside, said it
was a service ''for the families and for the folk locally who feel so
close to the families. We have got to know them and there hasn't been a
month gone by when there hasn't been someone visiting the scene or just
coming to have a look.
''Quite close ties have developed but in a sensitive way. The local
community has been tremendously supportive and, for most folk, it does
not seem like a year has gone by. It seems much more recent.''
Investigators have ruled out terrorism or mechanical failure for the
crash and the accident report, which is likely to be published in the
next few weeks, is believed to focus on why it was flying so low when
approaching a mountainous area. One of many theories is that a wrong
figure was entered in the helicopter navigation system.

<HEADLINE>Tighter rules on nuclear waste for Rosyth subs</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROB ROBERTSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978075867</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TOUGH new restrictions are to be placed on the disposal of radioactive
waste discharges arising from the refitting and de-equipping of Royal
Navy nuclear submarines at Rosyth Royal dockyard.
The Scottish Office said yesterday it was proposed that the level of
liquid and gas radioactive waste would be reduced, in some cases by
around by 18%. Levels for discharges of solid radioactive waste are not
to be changed.
Fife Health Board, Forth River Purification Board, Forth District
Salmon Fisheries Board, and two local authorities have been asked to
comment on the issue.
The Government says the reduced discharge limits set reflect
improvements in operating practice at the dockyard since the previous
authorisations for the disposal of radioactive waste, issued in 1987. It
added that the reductions in discharge limits would set even higher
standards and were consistent with internationally recognised standards.
However the environmental group, Friends of the Earth, accused the
Government of playing a statistical game.
Mr Graham Stein, energy campaigner with the group, said: ''The
Government and other agencies may set agreed limits but any discharge of
radioactivity is potentially dangerous. There is certainly no safe
level.
''We always predicted the only way Rosyth would be allowed to develop
was to allow it to have nuclear submarine decommission work and just now
there are five hulks sitting rotting away there.
''By putting Rosyth on a knife-edge regarding work, it shows they are
at the dirty end of the entire job.''
The Scottish Office said the issuing of draft certificates for
discharging radioactive material at Rosyth was part of the ongoing
review of existing authorisations granted for nuclear installations in
Scotland.

<HEADLINE>Girls tell police their fears of rapist's return</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978075868</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO 12-year-old girls who were beaten and raped at knifepoint by a
teenager this week were afraid they might see their attacker again,
police said yesterday.
One of the children has been helping detectives build up a picture
profile of the rapist. She saw his face when he removed his balaclava.
It was chubby, with a scar. He had scaly hands and bitten nails.
The victims are slowly coming to terms with their ordeal, which took
place in a country park in Oldham, Greater Manchester, as they were
returning from a picnic. They were bound to a tree and attacked.
WPC Alison Donoghue said: ''At the moment, they are very upset and in
a state of shock. But they are coping very well although they are
distressed and feeling unwell and sick.
''With a lot of support, I think they will come to terms with it
slowly but surely.''
Ms Donoghue, who has interviewed the children with a colleague,
Detective Constable Jean Haughton, told a news conference: ''Their main
worry is that they might see this man again. That is what is on their
minds at the moment.''
This was because the attacker forced them to tell him their names and
addresses.
It was also revealed that both girls were beaten during the attack on
Wednesday afternoon. ''They suffered fairly minor injuries,'' said Ms
Donoghue.
Both girls had been ''very tearful'', she added.
''Any kind of sexual assault is bad. It has affected them greatly. It
is something you do not expect to happen when you go with your best
friend on a picnic.''
Ms Donoghue said she and her colleague had built up a ''rapport'' with
the girls.
''We are on first-name terms and they enjoy our company.
''Both sets of parents are stunned. They are not very talkative and
are deep in thought about the matter.
''All the officers involved in this inquiry are upset and shocked but
we have to maintain a degree of professionalism and get on with the
job.''
Officers are preparing to question a number of local youths following
dozens of calls from members of the public.
Detective Inspector Dennis Barnes said: ''Considering the seriousness
of the attack, the two girls have given us an extremely good description
of the attacker.''
One boy in his early teens was being questioned, he said. Yesterday,
an 18-year-old man was questioned and released without charge.
It was also revealed that two other young girls were approached by a
youth with a knife near the same spot some weeks ago.
However, he ran off when a woman approached on horseback.
''We are aware of the incident and it is possible that they are
linked,'' said Mr Barnes.
However, police are not connecting the double rape with the rape of
another 12-year-old girl at Wigan, Greater Manchester, last week.
Mr Barnes said the response from the public had been ''tremendous''.
Earlier, the man leading the inquiry, Detective Chief Inspector Geoff
Isaacs, said: ''We are building up a picture of the attacker, who was
probably local. As he left the girls, he told them he was from
Macclesfield in Cheshire but we are discounting that.''
He added: ''This man had scaly hands which could indicate that he was
suffering from eczema. He also had a scar at the side of his right
eye.''
The rapist was described as aged between 16 and 18, with a chubby
face, blue-green eyes, and short brown hair. He also had badly bitten
fingernails.
''We want to hear from people who were in the area of Strinesdale
reservoir, Waterhead, where the attack took place,'' said Mr Isaacs.

STRATHCLYDE Regional Council has lodged an appeal against sacked
social worker Rashid Zafar's industrial tribunal win.
A Glasgow industrial tribunal ruled earlier this year that he had been
unfairly dismissed by the council following alleged incidents involving
social work clients and colleagues.
The tribunal further ruled that Mr Zafar's dismissal was
discriminatory on racial grounds, but dismissed a number of further
complaints of racial discrimination and victimisation.
The Employment Appeal Tribunal confirmed that an appeal against the
tribunal's finding of unfair dismissal had been lodged by Strathclyde
Regional Council. An appeal hearing will be heard towards the end of the
year.
Mr Zafar, 59, of Baliol Street, Woodlands, Glasgow, may also cross
appeal the tribunal's dismissal of his other complaints.
The tribunal continued the case to decide on a remedy but this will
now be postponed until after the appeal.

CORONATION Street's Ken Morley is leaving the show after five years as
Reg Holdsworth -- the second star to defect from the top-rated programme
in just over a week.
And actress Anna Friel yesterday confirmed reports that she was giving
up the role of Beth Jordache on the Channel 4 soap Brookside.
Granada Television confirmed yesterday that Morley would be stepping
down in the autumn, following Julie Goodyear's decision to quit as pub
landlady Bet Lynch.
The show's producer, Ms Sue Pritchard, said: ''Ken Morley's portrayal
of Reg Holdsworth has made a colourful contribution to Coronation Street
over the past few years.
''His relationships with other Street residents have provided some
memorable comic moments -- one of which was the legendary waterbed scene
where Derek Wilton drilled a hole through his ceiling and into the bed
with hilarious consequences.''
Popular comic character Morley, 52, has threatened to leave in the
past. Last year, he was reluctant to renew his contract but was
persuaded to stay on for another year.
Granada said he was leaving to pursue other projects, including a new
sitcom for the station. He also has a panto lined up for Christmas.
The nature of his departure will be kept secret but he is likely to
film his final scenes in August, shortly before his contract ends.
There is speculation that his exit will be tied to Julie Goodyear's,
who leaves around the same time.
A Granada spokesman said: ''While we are sorry to see Ken leave
Coronation Street, we fully understand his desire to work on other
projects, including a sitcom for us.''
Morley, who earns #120,000 a year from his contract as randy Reg, has
found life more lucrative outside the Street.
He is said to have been offered #140,000 a month in panto and a
two-year advertising deal worth #250,000. The actor has also wanted more
freedom to make personal appearances -- a four-day Irish tour earned him
around #10,000.
He was once quoted as saying: ''Who would work a year when you can
earn the same in a month?''
Morley has also enjoyed spending the cash he has been busy earning.
The trappings of success at his #200,000 home in Clayton-le-Woods,
Lancashire, include four classic American cars and a Rolls-Royce. In the
Granada sitcom Flash Harry, he will play a photographer.
Other TV credits for Morley, a former maths teacher married with a
four-year-old son, include 'Allo 'Allo, in which he played German
officer Flockenstuffen.
Ms Goodyear announced she was leaving after 25 years to spend more
time with her grandchildren and work on other projects.
Meanwhile, Brookside star Anna Friel, whose lesbian scenes shocked
millions of TV viewers, yesterday explained why she was leaving the
Channel 4 soap.
Ms Friel, who plays Beth Jordache, confirmed for the first time
reports that she was giving up the role.
Her character is currently serving five years in prison for helping to
murder her drunken father, Trevor.
Ms Friel said yesterday: ''I have been in the soap for two-and-a-half
years but I will be leaving after the court appeal scene is made.
''I want to see this storyline through because this character has come
up with some very heavy storylines. I want her to be remembered for
those strong storylines rather than someone who just peters out.''
Ms Friel, who is also a singer, revealed that she had rejected a
string of record deals.
''I do sing and I have been offered four recording contracts but I
have turned them all down because I think it would detract from my
acting.''

* They say that behind every great man is a great woman, and no more
so than in industry. Nine times out of 10, adminstrative back-up is
provided by the fairer sex.
* Anvar Khan, UK Feature Writer of the Year, reports that not only do
female PA's lend their practical support and encouragement, but a little
soul too.
* Theirs is not merely a job of paperwork, but the management of
personality. When such strings are pulled, they are responsible for
their boss's performance.
* Given their workload, it may be understood that PA's are, as a
whole, waving a crude flag for feminism. To counter this cliche, two
women talk about the pros and cons of the female, not the male, boss.

work for anyone you don't like.
* Name: Anne Shaw
* Job: Senior Secretary to the Finance Controller of the Beer Division
of Scottish Brewers, Edinburgh.
* Remit: Provides a confidential service to her boss, organises his
travel arrangements, his diary and answers queries on his behalf.
* Age: 32
* Salary: #13,000 per year plus perks.
MY BOSS is so unorganised, he needs someone to sit on him and say ''go
here'' and ''do that!''.
I started at Scottish and Newcastle as a stats assistant. I gathered
weekly figures, played about with them, and put out sheets at the end of
the week which were distributed round the brewers. I only lasted a year
at my first job here because I was working for a woman.
I prefer to work with men. I'm quite a competitive person and I
suppose there was an element of threat involved. I'm not saying there
was bitchiness. But I don't think I would like to work for a woman
again.
I don't think you can motivate them the same as you can a man; you
don't have the same hold over them. Not that I twist my boss round my
little pinky, but women can handle men much more easily than they can
another woman, on a one-to-one basis.
As a secretary, which I was years ago, my boss organised himself and
all I was doing was his typing really, which was pretty boring. Whereas
now you can end up doing anything, from getting petrol for his car to
Christmas presents.
I think my boss depends on me a lot. He depends on me to make sure
he's in the right place at the right time with the right papers.
We've got a lot of respect for each other. We have a very good
understanding of each other, but we have fun as well. We can crack jokes
and laugh, and he can confide in me, which is a big thing, especially
working in finance.
''To do this job you have to be 100% committed. You've got to be able
to come and go, to be in the situation where you can work late at the
drop of a hat. You've got to have a sense of humour, you've got to be
able to make your boss laugh.
''There's nothing worse then Tom coming in in a grumpy mood and
passing it on to me. I like going in with a cup of coffee and a biscuit
and cheering him up.
''You have to have a sense of loyalty and a personality. If you can't
do that then you can't survive in the job.''
* Name: Janette Smith
* Job: PA at PR Consultants, Glasgow
* Remit: The day-to-day organisation of the Managing Director and
Finance Director
* Age: 35
* Salary: #15,000 per year.
I WORK for the managing director and the finance director; the MD's a
woman and the finance director a man. Basically, I look after them both.
My job is the day-to-day organisation of the workload; the mail,
filing, letters, reports and telephone calls; keeping both their diaries
up-to-date; arranging all their meetings, appointments, conferences and
seminars. There's a lot of preparation involved.
It's a demanding job time-wise. You don't know what's coming in; you
can't plan your day. You could try, but it would go to pot. I don't have
any domestic commitments. I don't have anyone else that I have to
consider, especially children. It would be difficult if you had to pick
up the kids from school.
I had three male bosses before this job, now I've got a male and
female and I don't find it any different at all. Professionally, they
both want the same job done. My female boss encourages you to express
your views and to be involved.
She doesn't lay down the law. She's very fair. I enjoy working with
her. Being a female, and perhaps not having worked for a woman before,
you wonder if it will cause trouble, but not in the least. And I'm not
sent out for petrol or birthday presents.
One of the reasons we work so well together as a team is the nature of
the job. We help each other out. Even down to the coffee-making, we all
take our turn.
You need good organisational skills to be a PA, do various things at
the same time under pressure, prioritise and learn to juggle and work to
deadlines.
You've got to have a happy disposition and be easy-going because you
deal with various types of clients. You must be reliable. If my boss
needs something, she needs it now. You just get on with it.
I'm now in the new role of health and safety officer. I've got to make
sure that the three offices comply with health and safety procedures.
I've got my manuals and if I need extra training I'll take an external
course. It's a challenge, isn't it?

ANVAR KHAN previews a series of lectures on women's rights aimed at
improving the quality of life for all females
VARIOUS high-profile feminists will spearhead a series of lectures on
women's issues taking place in Glasgow throughout June. The aim is to
debate issues such as pension rights, part-time workers and women
carers, employment and health. Today, Helena Kennedy, QC, is a guest
speaker at Castlemilk Law Centre where she will tackle the treatment of
women in the legal process, focusing on women offenders, victims of
assault, and the inadequate support provided for them.
According to a recent publication by the Women's National Commission
and an advisory committee to the Government -- established in 1969 and
co-chaired by Angela Browning, MP -- women in the nineties suffer
because of insufficient pensions and childcare, lack of job
opportunities and subsequent poverty.
The June lectures and workshops guarantee to heighten awareness of the
gaps in current policy, legal or political, which hinder women having
some kind of quality of life. Knowledge is power, and the aim of the
meetings is to educate participants on their rights.
In the nineties, the UK has seen an increased polarisation between the
rich and the poor. A report entitled Poverty: The Facts by Carey
Oppenheim, published in 1990, said low wages had dropped 17% during the
past decade, while the average incomes of the wealthy had risen 36%. It
stated that 62% of the poor were women.
One in five families consist of a lone parent with dependent children,
double the number in 1971, and 90% of single parents are women. For
every two marriages in the UK in 1991 there was one divorce. Between
1962 and 1992 there was a threefold increase in the number of people,
especially women, living alone.
Women's pay is on average 80% of men's. Many are stuck in low-paid and
insecure jobs which offer few chances for advancement or training. Often
women must accept jobs well below their capabilities in order to balance
a home and working life.
The most impoverished of women are those who are lone parents; the
elderly, who, due to bereavement or divorce have little or no
independent income; and carers with the responsibility for more than one
generation.
It is said in the report by the National Women's Commission that women
have made little progress in the past few decades. Regardless of
equality legislation, some women are still trapped by violence and
intimidation in their own homes. It must be concluded, therefore, that
the mentality of a bully and the psychology of the workplace are a
united front in an attempt to undermine female self-esteem. It is this
issue that feminist organisations want to challenge.
On June 5, a debate entitled European Law and Equal Opportunities will
discuss the fact that on the basis of European Court of Justice
decisions, the limit on compensation for sex and race discrimination has
been removed. Speakers include Judge David Edwards (ECJ) and Doris
Littlejohn.
From June 15-17, in conjunction with the Royal Norwegian Consulate,
representatives from the Equal Opportunities Commission compare British
women and their lack of rights to those of Norwegian women and their
abundance of rights. Gunhild Oyangen, the Minister of Agriculture for
Norway, and Morag Alexander, director of the Equal Opportunities
Commission, Scotland, will expound on the fact that Norway ranks among
the highest providers of publically funded childcare in Europe. Women in
Scotland earn 71% of men's wages while their peers in Norway earn
85-98%. The facts speak for themselves.
* For more details on lectures please call the Royal Norwegian
Consulate on 0131 226 5701, or the Equal Opportunities Commission on
0141 248 5833 who are holding an additional seminar on June 20 about
women and local government reorganisation.

Men and women have for centuries made fools of themselves in the hope
of attracting the opposite sex. Anne Cowan trawls a history of high
folly
DAVID Salayria has a penchant for Armani jackets. Even as a student of
illustration and printmaking at Duncan of Jordonstone College in his
native Dundee, he was interested in all aspects of design and style. He
now lives in Brighton with his wife, Shirley Willis, who is an
illustrator, and their two-year-old son, Jonathan.
The Salayria Book Company specialises in lively, off-beat books for
children. The latest series includes volumes on Underwear, Mummies, and
Keeping Clean.
All is Vanity in the fourth of these amusing and informative little
books. The lengths people go to in order to look good, attract the
opposite sex and upstage the competition are amazing. The paint and
powder, mutiliation and constriction, curling and crimping can be
positively bizarre. No single nation or century has the monpoly on
self-decorative daftness. We're all into it.
Jezabel, wife of King Ahab and Queen of Cosmetics, was the Elizabeth
Hurley of her day. She liked to attract attention and didn't care what
they all said. Jezabel was roundly criticised for her excessive make-up
and in an early and long-lasting example of sponsorship has lent her
name to every brazen hussy for almost 3000 years.
History ancient and modern teaches that men are not averse to padding
out the codpiece or posing over the Perrier. Narcissus was so conceited
that he even gave his name to a strain of vanity. Julius Caesar wore a
wreath of laurel to hide his baldness.
Indeed hair, or the lack of it, gives enormous scope for making an
exhibition of one's self. Rainbows of punk spikes and pictures tattooed
on the bald scalp spring to mind. The height of the ridiculous was the
eighteenth-century powdered wig surmounted by a miniature sailing ship
or flower garden. In 1776 the roof of the main entrance to St Paul's
Cathedral had to be raised by more than a metre to admit the
wearer-worshippers.
Ever a motivating factor is the desire to display status. The snob
appeal of a creamy complexion lasted for centuries. When most people
worked out of doors pale skin was in, then when mass employment was
moved indoors to factories, offices and shops, a tan came to denote
leisure, travel and money. Now that the ageing effects of the sun are
recognised, the unbronzed look is back for models and role models alike.
We may have come a long way from mouse-skin eyebrows and wooden false
teeth but current vanities include fad diets and cosmetic surgery. It
just goes to show that people are always prepared to suffer to be
beautiful.
* Vanity, A Very Peculiar History, by Vicky Power, Watts Books, #7.99.

RESCUE workers pulled two more survivors from the rubble almost six
days after an earthquake flattened this oil town in Russia's Far East
but officials said hopes of finding more were fading.
Medical officials in the remote settlement on Sakhalin island said
rescuers pulled Misha Deputatov, aged nine, and 33-year-old Fyodor
Yakimov from the wreckage late today.
However, the Emergency Situations Ministry in Moscow said the death
toll from Sunday's earthquake had risen to 866. A further 405 people had
been pulled out with injuries.
The final toll is expected to exceed 2000.
Of the latest survivors, Deputatov had suffered two broken ribs while
Yakimov had a broken right leg. -- Reuter

Vatican City, Friday
THE resignation of Switzerland's youngest bishop after he got his
girlfriend pregnant is the latest sex scandal to haunt a Roman Catholic
Church that insists on celibacy from its priests and nuns.
Today's resignation of Basle's Bishop Hansjoerg Vogel, 44, is bound to
fuel new debate over whether the Church can expect its consecrated
members to live a chaste life in a modern, secular world filled with
temptations.
Pope John Paul II accepted the resignation of Vogel as 92nd bishop of
Basle, with immediate effect. He named an auxiliary bishop, Monsignor
Joseph Candolfi, as temporary successor. The Swiss Conference of Bishops
said they learned of the resignation with ''great sadness but equally
great respect'' for Vogel.
The Vatican said the Pope accepted the resignation in accordance with
Church canon (law) 401 which says a bishop is ''earnestly requested'' to
resign when he has become unable to fulfill his office due to health
''or another serious reason''.
Vogel acknowledged in a public letter that he had turned to the
unnamed woman for comfort from the pressure of his new post after
becoming head of the Basle diocese 18 months ago. He said he was certain
his resignation would unleash renewed debate about the Church's celibacy
rule. ''There will be new doubts about whether priests can stick by
their decision to be celibate,'' he wrote.
He told fellow clergymen and women: ''I ask you not to let yourselves
be confused by my (resignation). I remain convinced that it is possible
to lead a fulfilling life in celibacy.''
Scandals involving sexual activity by Catholic churchmen --
acknowledged or alleged -- have been a bane of this papacy. Easier for
the Church to hide in past decades, they now appear regularly on front
pages of newspapers. Some have led to lawsuits that have severely tested
the financial resources of the world's richest dioceses.
While Vatican sources stressed that Vogel had sung celibacy's praises
in his resignation letter, dissidents said his case showed the Church
was out of touch. ''Celibacy should be optional,'' said Frances
Kissling, president of the US-based Catholics for a Free Choice. ''One
of the major problems in places where there is a shortage of priests is
the unwillingness of men to deny themselves a committed, sexual married
relation,'' she said. -- Reuter

Washington, Friday
ACTOR Christopher Reeve, who was seriously injured in a riding
accident six days ago, was said today to show a slight improvement.
His doctor said ''he has a little more feeling in the upper part of
his body'' and could communicate with his family by mouthing at them.
His mother, however, said that it was very difficult to understand
him. He is completely paralysed and can breathe only with the aid of a
respirator.
The doctor said that the hospital would attempt surgery to repair the
two cervical vertebrae he broke when he fell head- first off his horse.
The surgery will not affect his spinal cord.
The doctor would not offer any long-term prognosis, but other
specialists have said that damage to the spinal cord where it joins the
brain is usually irreversible.
There is also the extreme danger of infections. The doctor said that
they would try to operate during a ''window of opportunity' when
pneumonia was not a factor.

Cape Town, Friday
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela faced a barrage of attacks from
his black coalition partners and white opponents today with both
demanding murder charges for his role in the 1994 ''Shell House
massacre''.
The attacks on Mandela followed remarks he made to the Senate
yesterday when he said he had authorised guards at the Shell House
headquarters of his African National Congress to kill if necessary to
protect the building against Inkatha demonstrators on March 28 last
year.
Velaphi Ndlovu, spokesman on safety and security for the Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom Party, told a news conference that police chief George
Fivaz should question Mandela and charge him ''as an accomplice to
murder.''
About 60 people were killed in and around Johannesburg when supporters
of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party marched in
support of their king and against all-race elections to be held the next
month.
In what has come to be known as the ''Shell House massacre'' at least
eight were killed outside the ANC head office.
Mandela's ruling ANC moved swiftly to defuse the issue today with the
party's deputy general secretary Cheryl Carolus saying the president had
not given direct orders to open fire on the Zulu marchers.--Reuter.

Messina, Friday
FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd admitted for the first time today that
next year's super-summit to review the Maastricht Treaty could continue
beyond the British General Election.
His remarks raised the prospect of more warfare over Europe on the
floor of the Commons if, as expected, the divided Conservatives seek
Parliament's approval of a tough negotiating stance.
Mr Hurd was speaking in this Sicilian town after attending
celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the meeting which produced
the Treaty of Rome.
Today's gathering formally set up a so-called Reflection Group of EU
ministers who will set the agenda for the 1996 inter-governmental
conference (IGC) which is expected to continue the process of European
integration.
Mr Hurd was asked if the British Government, preoccupied with
preserving national sovereignty and harassed by its own Euro-sceptic
wing, would block agreement until after a General Election. This would
raise the possibility of an administration led by Mr Tony Blair signing
a revised Maastricht.
The Foreign Secretary said: ''I cannot say when there will be a
General Election. A British election may occur before the conclusion of
the IGC. This is a possibility but I cannot be certain at this range.''
Britain must go to the polls by the spring of 1997. Some EU states
reportedly believe British opposition to the Maastricht review is so
deep-seated that a deal will be impossible as long as the Conservatives
are in power. But Mr Blair has recently been at pains to sound as tough
as John Major on the issue of the veto.
Mr Hurd said it was clear that the Government's position on the
Maastricht review, which will ignite fresh divisions inside the
Conservative Party, must be set out. ''There must be a debate in the
House of Commons as we had before Maastricht,'' he said. But he did not
make clear if there would be a White Paper on the issue.
His remarks will fuel speculation that the Government could call a
snap ''Union Jack'' General Election if it feels the need to win clear
electoral backing for its approach to the Maastricht review.
Mr Major has already made a series of speeches insisting in
categorical terms that there will be no reduction in the national veto
in the Council of Ministers and no increase in the powers of the
European Parliament.
His uncompromising approach has already detached Britain from
mainstream EU thinking and set the UK on a diplomatic collision course
with the Germans and other federally-minded member states.
Detailed work in the Reflection Group will be undertaken for Britain
by Mr David Davis, the Euro-sceptic Minister for Europe who is Mr Hurd's
deputy. Asked if Mr Davis approached his duties with relish or
foreboding, Mr Hurd replied: ''Certainly not with foreboding.''
But he sought to play down the importance of the conference by saying:
''There is no huge intellectual idea which dominates this IGC. This is
clear. There will be nothing comparable to the idea of the Common Market
or the single market.''
But he admitted there would be arguments and discussion about majority
voting and the powers of the European Parliament. ''We will have our own
positive ideas to put forward.''
Mr Hurd said: ''Forty years ago in the prelude to Messina the attitude
of the British Government was patronising and pessimistic. This is not
our attitude now.''
He praised the EU for helping to secure peace and bring prosperity in
a way which, he said, even the most optimistic observers a few years ago
did not think possible.
The EU should not rush ahead of public opinion at the IGC, Mr Hurd
warned, adding that it had shown signs of doing this at Maastricht
itself. ''We British are the carpenters rather than the visionaries of
Europe.''
He repeated the Prime Minister's view that ''there will be no massive
leap forward of the kind which occurred at Maastricht'' in next year's
negotiations which would be practical rather than visionary.

Moscow, Friday
YURI Gagarin, the first man in space and one of the Soviet Union's
greatest heroes, could not cope with his fame and took refuge in alcohol
and outrageous behaviour, it was claimed today.
The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper, which specialises in sensational
stories, made the claim in an article which published extracts from the
diaries of Nikolai Kamanin, the air force officer in charge of training
the first group of Soviet cosmonauts.
Kamanin said that at one point Gagarin badly smashed up his face when
vaulting out of a woman's bedroom after being surprised by his wife.
Rumours about Gagarin's alcoholism and excesses were firmly suppressed
by Soviet authorities.
Gagarin, an air force pilot, became the first man in space on April
12, 1961, aged 27.
The Soviet leadership, keen to trumpet its technological superiority
over the United States, sent the cosmonaut on gruelling trips across the
Soviet Union and then around the world to advertise his feat.
Kamanin said Gagarin was soon out of control and deliberately began
taking dangerous risks, such as zooming out to sea on a heavily
overloaded motorboat and seeing how tightly he could turn the craft at
high speed.
One night in October 1961 Kamanin heard shouting outside the Russian
hotel where the cosmonauts were staying.
''I saw Yuri, lying face down on a park bench, his face and shirt
covered in blood. There were gaping wounds on his face,'' Kamanin wrote.
Gagarin had tried to seduce a maid in a second-floor hotel bedroom but
when his anxious wife came looking for him and banged on the door, he
leaped off the balcony and smashed his face on the concrete floor below.
The cosmonaut needed emergency surgery to reconstruct his left
eyebrow, thereby missing what would have been a triumphant appearance at
the 22nd Congress of the ruling Communist Party two weeks later.
The newspaper printed photographs of what it said was Gagarin's face
before and after the accident, which clearly showed the cosmonaut's left
eyebrow was deformed.
Kamanin said Gagarin's fellow cosmonaut German Titov, the second man
into space, also found his fame hard to handle. On one occasion he
sneaked out of a motorcade in his honour and was discovered riding one
of the accompanying police motorcycles.
Both men were officially warned several times to reform themselves but
kept on drinking heavily, Kamanin said.
Gagarin died in a mysterious plane crash in March 1968 after
apparently becoming disoriented in low cloud. Less charitable sources
say he was drunk at the time.--Reuter.

MALCOLM Rifkind and a dozen of his colleagues from Europe, Canada, the
United States and Turkey, who have troops involved in Bosnia, meet this
afternoon under the chairmanship of French Defence Minister Charles
Millon at the Kleber conference centre in Paris. Whatever solution
emerges from the talks, the meeting, which was a French initiative, will
prove a test for Millon. His job was largely a reward for supporting
President Jacques Chirac during his campaign -- the satirical paper Le
Canard Enchaine last week caricatured the new minister receiving
instruction to identify a gun.
More importantly, the summit should provide further proof that Chirac
is treating his first foreign policy crisis with aggressive seriousness.
Elected president and thus head of the French armed forces only a month
ago, Chirac has already short-circuited the UN command by instructing
French troops to behave for once like real soldiers and retaliate. He
showed last week that the days of providing passive French targets for
Serb aggression -- 39 dead and 450 wounded so far -- are over. By doing
so, he restored pride to the country's military, humiliated by the sight
of French troops manacled to posts, hostages against further air
strikes.
Britain and France have slightly different interests to defend in
Paris today. The French, for example, want to create a supply route to
Sarajevo, where they have most of their troops, whereas Britain has her
men stationed mainly in the centre and the east of Bosnia. But intensive
behind-the-scenes talks last week between French and British military
and diplomats from the two countries should ensure there will be no
public disagreement between Rifkind and Millon.
Chirac's first official trip as president should, according to
tradition, have been to his home region of Correze. Instead, he went on
Thursday to Vannes in Brittany to pay homage to the two French soldiers,
Marcel Amaru, 25, and Jacky Humblot, 19, who were killed last weekend.
The men died when their units recaptured the bridge of Vrbanja which had
been taken by Serbs dressed in stolen French uniforms. The men's
heroism, the president said, would live in the memory of the army as a
symbol of dignity.
''France will not tolerate that her soldiers be humiliated, wounded,
or killed with impunity by those who have chosen to oppose their mission
of peace and protection,'' Chirac said, before stressing French
philosophy on Bosnia: ''Our military presence is based on a strong and
straightforward idea: the security of Europe is at stake in this region.
We will not accept that ethnic hatred and barbarity return to the
continent.''
It is a measure of the personal grip which the president is keeping on
the handling of the Bosnian crisis (with the aid of his Prime Minister
Alain Juppe, and over the head of Foreign Affairs Minister Herve de
Charrette) that the decision to recapture the Vrbanja bridge came after
instructions to retaliate were telephoned by Chirac to General Janvier,
French CIC in Bosnia, last Saturday.
A little earlier, the president had criticised the French army chief
of staff, Admiral Lanxade, so violently that it seemed possible he might
resign. Chirac ordered the admiral to ''resist aggression with all
available means'' without waiting for instructions from UN forces.
The president and his prime minister are still furious that no-one
among the US military, who had feared European objections to air
strikes, had seen fit to inform them of the bombing raids which provoked
the Serbs into taking troops hostage 10 days ago. UN Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali reportedly told the Elysee that he could not tell
''every member of the organisation'' each time a bombing raid was
planned. Juppe's anger has spilled over into harsh criticism of UN
military planning -- the raids, he said, were ''ill prepared''.

THE captain of an Aberdeen-bound aircraft which crashed last week,
killing 12 people, had reported ''a problem'' just minutes after
take-off, an inquest heard yesterday.
West Yorkshire coroner David Hinchliff said pilot John Casson
requested permission to return his Brazilian-built Bandeirante to
Leeds/Bradford Airport.
About two minutes later, the light aircraft disappeared from radar
screens and was seen to crash in a barley field near the village of
Dunkeswick, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire.
Mr Hinchliff told relatives of the three crew members and nine
passengers on board the tragic Knight Air flight to Aberdeen on May 24
that the investigation into the crash would be conducted ''fully,
fairly, and fearlessly''.
After hearing evidence of identification from WPC Jean Vanes, the
coroner adjourned the inquest until after the completion of the
investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Aircraft Accident
Investigation Branch.
Mr Hinchliff said the aircraft caught fire on impact but the outbreak
was quickly extinguished due to torrential rain at the time. It was
obvious those on board had suffered fatal injuries.
Eight of those killed were identified by comparison with dental
records, one from personal documents and the others from items of
clothing, a personal description by relatives and a name badge.
Mr Hinchliff said: ''It is my public duty, as I am responsible for the
conduct of this inquest, to ensure the relevant facts are fully, fairly,
and fearlessly investigated and I intend to do just that.''
Those who died were the pilot, Mr John Howard Casson, 49, a married
man, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire; his co-pilot, Mr Paul Anthony
Denton, 29, a married man, of High Burton, Huddersfield, and air
stewardess Helen Lynn Leadbeater, 22, of Shelf, Halifax.
The passengers who died were Mr Dennis Oliver Davis, 46, a contract
manager, married, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire; Miss Katherine
Duguid, 35, an accountant, of Dunlin Road, Cove, Aberdeen; Mr Phillip
Hutchinson, 34, a retail sales manager, married, of Stable Yard
Cottages, Esslemont, Ellon, Aberdeen; Mr William Mitchell Ingram, 61, an
area contracts manager, married, of Bain Crescent, Mintlaw, Aberdeen; Mr
Karl Daniel McGrath, 27, a sales manager, single, of Ashvale Crescent,
Springburn, Glasgow; Mr Raymond Nettleton, 51, a maintenance engineer,
married, from Baildon, Bradford, West Yorkshire; Mr Phillip Race, 46, a
director of human resources, married, from Lethenty House, Lethenty, by
Inverurie; Mr Christopher Mark Tonkin, 32, a geologist, married, of
Crosshills, Keighley, West Yorkshire, and Mrs Irene Wolsey, 73, a widow,
of Eccleshill, Bradford, West Yorkshire.
The coroner said the cause of death in all cases had yet to be
established.

EDUCATION Secretary Gillian Shephard yesterday promised a crackdown on
a rising tide of violence and disruption in schools.
But she stepped into a row with parents after saying some of them were
ducking their own responsibilities for disciplining their children, and
so undermining the work of teachers.
Parents' representatives accused her of pandering to the audience in
her comments to the conference of the National Association of Head
Teachers in Harrogate, north Yorkshire.
The Shadow Education Secretary, Mr David Blunkett, sought to take
advantage of the row by stressing the importance of parents and teachers
working together to keep good order in schools.
Concern over mounting disruption in the classroom has been a theme of
all this year's teaching union conferences. The number of children
permanently excluded from schools is thought to have trebled in three
years to an estimated 10,000.
Yesterday, for the first time, Mrs Shephard acknowledged the problem,
saying in some schools it was an ''overriding worry''. She promised more
Government support for schools and a review of sanctions.
The causes were far from straightforward, she said. They included the
breakdown of family networks, more single parents, drugs, and the
influence of mass media.
But delegates applauded loudly when she said it could not be the job
of schools alone to put the problems right.
''Children are in school for only about one eighth of their time. Yet
it is always to schools that society looks to solve it all,'' she said.
''It has to be stressed that the first and continuing responsibility
for a child's behaviour is that of its parents. We do need parents to
co-operate with schools in matters of discipline.''
Later she told journalists: ''We have got to deal with the young
hooligans and ruffians who disrupt school classes and parents must, if
they are not doing so, be prepared to take part.''
Mrs Shephard's words were welcomed by NAHT's general secretary, Mr
David Hart, who said heads would be ''delighted that their views on
parental responsibility . . . have been recognised as valid''.
He would be pressing for an extension of fixed-term exclusions, which
heads blame for the rise in the number of children permanently excluded
from school.
But there was a furious response to Mrs Shephard from Margaret
Morrissey, spokeswoman for the National Confederation of Parent Teacher
Associations, who said teachers should take the blame for classroom
disruption.
''Children who run wild are those who are not interested or switched
on by lessons.
''You can't sit next to your child in the classroom. If a child is
well motivated in lessons and excited and there is a good relationship
with teachers then good behaviour will inevitably follow,'' she said.
Mr Blunkett commented that good discipline in schools had to be the
responsibility of both teachers and parents working together. ''It is
important that both play their part in developing an orderly learning
environment for children,'' he said.
Elsewhere in her speech, Mrs Shephard repeated her broad hint that,
after tough spending curbs expected to cost thousands of teaching jobs,
schools could get more money next year.
She recalled the Prime Minister's pledge that education would be top
of the Government's priorities as growth provided room for higher
spending.
She also gave delegates clear signals that she would fight hard in
up-coming spending negotiations with the Treasury. But Mr Hart said the
pledge was not convincing.
''If anyone can forecast that she is capable of out-punching
(Chancellor) Kenneth Clarke . . . then she will win the battle. But I
don't think anyone can make that assumption.''
Mr Blunkett added: ''It simply will not do to keep promising jam
tomorrow when schools face a crisis today.''

AN inquiry has been ordered by the Transport and General Workers'
union, Scotland, into how the union's national secretary, Mr Jack
Dromey, obtained a copy of a draft report relating to the public
transport implications of Glasgow's millenium plans.
The report was being prepared for the union by a Glasgow-based
consultancy firm, Harrison Consulting. Mr Douglas Harrison, of the firm,
has threatened legal action over ''breach of intellectual copyright''.
Mr Jim Elsby, regional secretary-designate of T &amp; G Scotland, said the
union and the consultancy were dismayed to see references to the draft
study made by Mr Dromey in The Herald's sister paper, the Evening Times,
on Thursday.
Mr Elsby said the study was incomplete and existed only in draft form.
It had not been cleared with the T &amp; G's central legal department.
In the article, Mr Dromey claimed Glasgow District Council's millenium
plan, aimed at cutting traffic congestion, risked driving people away
from the city centre.
Mr Dromey, who is one of three contenders for the leadership of the T
&amp; G, one of Britain's biggest trade unions, could not be contacted for
comment yesterday. The other contenders are general secretary Bill
Morris and a Kent-based tractor driver, Mr Norman Davidson.

THE shutters have been firmly clamped shut during drinking hours in
front of one of Glasgow's traditional pubs, forcing the hard core of
regular drinkers, temporarily, to partake elsewhere.
Inside, workmen saw and hammer. A new partition has sprung up and a
small extension is being tagged on out the back. The nicotine-stained
walls are to get a fresh lick of cream paint.
However, M J Heraghty's, an unassuming bar on Pollokshaws Road in the
city's South Side, is not undergoing the usual pub restyling. A more
dramatic change is afoot. The bar is one of the last pubs in Glasgow to
instal a ladies' toilet.
According to the licensee, Mrs Anna Heraghty, the decision to plunge
into the modern era was foisted upon her by the demands of a changing
clientele. The 60-something owner has seen her small pub evolve from a
drinking man's bar when she and her husband took over in 1973 to
something more, well, sophisticated.
''More and more women come in here now, especially a lot of young
ladies. I expect some of them are saying it's about time that there was
a ladies' toilet.''
True, the lack of a ladies' toilet was, she says, something of an
attraction. Scan a decent Glasgow guidebook and there will be a
reference to M J Heraghty's Irish charm -- and the lack of female
facilities.
But if the tourists will be disappointed Mrs Heraghty says her female
customers are delighted. They will no longer have to nip out to a
neighbouring bar or ask male friends to guard the door to the Gents.
Mixed feelings, though, exist among the regular male drinkers. There
are a few doubters who, says barman Patrick, may murmur that the
character of the pub has been brutally altered, and not for the better.
Suddenly, from amid the hammering workmen, there is a cry of
''ruination!''

ONE third of women at risk from breast cancer fail to turn up for
vital screening appointments.
Speaking after the offical opening of a #600,000 showpiece
breast-screening centre in Edinburgh, clinical director Dr Alastair
Kirkpatrick said around 30% of women aged between 50 and 64 failed to
turn up for appointments.
He stressed it was essential that women turned up for the lifesaving
test, which takes only a few minutes.
Dr Kirkpatrick said the unit, which has been screening women since
1988, had started to see some early ''encouraging'' trends since the
programme was launched.
Around 116,000 women are invited by letter to be screened at the new
centre and by the two mobile screening units on a three-yearly basis in
South-east Scotland.
Dr Kirkpatrick said the new centre was a keynote point in the long and
distinguished history of breast- cancer screening in South- east
Scotland.
The centre was opened by High Road star Eileen McCallum yesterday.
European Union health ministers meeting in Luxembourg were told
yesterday that two thirds of deaths from cancer are linked to
''lifestyles'' and could be prevented.
Health Commissioner Padraig Flynn said it was well established that
fatalities from the disease caused by the way people live could be
avoided by ''adequate'' prevention.
The Commissioner promised that #47m would be used on a large-scale and
large- impact campaign to reduce cancer deaths by the year 2000.
The health ministers also agreed a #40m action programme to fight Aids
and #24m to be spent on promoting health education and training.

HEINZ recalled all stocks of Minted Vegetables with Lamb baby food
last night after some cans were found to contain small pieces of metal.
A company spokesman said the recall followed complaints from six
people who had bought the product.
''As soon as we had evidence that there was a problem, we acted. We
are not aware of anyone suffering any injury. Independent medical
authorities have advised Heinz that, almost certainly, such pieces, were
they to be swallowed, would simply be passed through the digestive
system and present no danger.''
The affected stocks are in 163g cans and are a junior variety for
babies from seven months old.
Heinz is advising parents to discard any cans with the product code
01-97 KL1 0825 00:00 to 01-97 KL1 0825 03:41. The code is printed on the
base.
Shoppers should then send the labels to HJ Heinz Company Ltd (consumer
services department) at Hayes Park, Hayes, Middlesex UB4 8AL. The
company will refund the purchase price and postage.
The spokesman said there was no suggestion of deliberate
contamination.

<HEADLINE>Wife cultivated cannabis using horticultural lamps in a locked room at the family's isolated home. Advocate denies drug involvement</HEADLINE>

AN advocate facing a drugs charge told a jury yesterday that cannabis
plants found at his isolated Perthshire home belonged to his wife, and
he played no part in growing them.
Mr Keith Henderson, 49, who has previously appeared in High Court
trials both as a defence counsel and as a Crown junior assisting the
prosecution, said if he had tried to get rid of the cannabis it would
have placed ''desperate strains on his marriage''.
Mr Henderson was giving evidence at the High Court in Edinburgh, where
he denies producing cannabis at his home at Brae of Monzie, near Crieff,
between February 17 and May 31, last year.
Mrs Rosalind Henderson, 44, has admitted producing the drug at Brae of
Monzie over the same period.
Mr Henderson, who has three children, told the court that he had been
an advocate at the Scottish Bar since 1973. He had never been a user of
cannabis, although he had tried it. ''I never liked it,'' he added.
He said he had nothing to do with the cultivation of cannabis plants
in a locked room at his home and had never been in the room while plants
were being grown there.
''The house was quite extensive. It was a spare room and I had no real
cause to go into it,'' he explained.
He was aware that his wife was growing the drug: ''I didn't like it at
all and I made Rosalind aware of it. I made it clear on many occasions
that I didn't want anything to do with it.''
Mr Henderson told Advocate-depute Colin Boyd QC that he had tried to
get his wife to stop her involvement with the drug. ''I suppose I could
have thrown them all out of the window. I am pretty sure that would have
caused desperate strains on the marriage.''
Mr Boyd asked him who was reponsible for looking after the cultivation
system for the plants when his wife was away on holiday. Mr Henderson
replied: ''Nobody. As I understand, it looked after itself.''
Mrs Henderson told the court that no-one had been looking after the
cannabis while she was away on holiday with a girlfriend. The lights
were on timers and a pump used was on constantly.
She told the court that she smoked the drug perhaps 10 times a day and
that she had used cannabis, which she preferred to alcohol, for about 18
years. Mrs Henderson said her husband did not like using the drug.
Questioned by her husband's defence counsel about the cannabis growing
operation at her home, Mrs Henderson replied: ''It's mine entirely. My
husband had nothing to do with it at all.''
She explained she had started growing the cannabis because it was a
better quality than she could buy. She had not appreciated the potential
consequences of her actions for her husband's career.
Earlier, the court was told that when drug squad detectives raided the
Hendersons' home, early on the morning of May 31, they found a locked
room.
Mrs Henderson was on holiday but Mr Henderson told them: ''There are
plants in there. You will get the key under the carpet.''
Inside the room, police found 13 mature cannabis plants grown by a
soilless system using powerful horticultural lamps.
There was a propogating tray with 77 spaces for seedlings, most of
which contained a cannabis plant seedling, and other potted-up seeds and
seedlings were found in a greenhouse. Detectives also found 48 grammes
of dried cannabis leaves.
The trial continues.

NEGOTIATIONS are under way to sell a Steinway grand piano decorated by
Phoebe Traquair, the Scottish fresco painter.
The piano, expected to fetch between #55,000 and #70,000, attracted no
bids when it was offered in a sale of art nouveau by Phillips, the
international auctioneer, in London on March 28.
Private talks have since taken place and yesterday a spokeswoman said
Phillips was confident the sale would be finalised soon.
The piano was made in 1909 and was commissioned by the Tennant family,
the Glasgow industrialists, for Lympne Castle, their property in Kent.
The present owners of the piano, Americans, bought it in Inverness for
#350 in 1952 and took it across the Atlantic.
The piano was last seen in Britain in that year and had been
considered lost. It was catalogued as such in an exhibition of Phoebe
Traquair's work at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in 1993.
Ms Traquair (1852-1936) illustrated the keyboard panel with images
from Rossetti's sonnet ''Willowwood'' because Mr Frank Tennant, who
commissioned the piano, was a collector of Rossetti's paintings.
Other decorations on the piano are watercolours with illustrations
from ''The Song of Solomon'' and painted panels of Scottish scenery.
Ms Traquair is reported to have been delighted with her work and to
have said in 1909: ''I do honestly think it is the best painting I have
ever done. Wood is so delightful to work on.''
Meanwhile, possible uses of Mansfield Place Church, an A-listed
building in the Bellevue area of Edinburgh that contains religious
murals by Ms Traquair, are being considered.
A feasibility study, by Halcrow Fox, has been commissioned by a
consortium formed by Edinburgh District Council, Lothian and Edinburgh
Enterprise Ltd, and Mansfield Traquair Trust. Its findings are expected
to be made known later this month.

THE good folks of Millport have never seen anything quite like it. And
it's likely the Isle of Cumbrae resort ain't seen nothing yet.
Local bars have take on the appearance of western saloons, the paper
shop has become home to the Nashville Gazette, and the pottery is run by
someone not unlike Pocahontas.
The locals are warming up for Scotland's biggest country and western
festival, which is to be held over the first weekend of August.
For three days, the town will be buzzing with concerts and events with
a country theme including bucking broncos, shoot outs, and fast draw
contests. A group from nine Indian tribes will visit the island to
exhibit paintings, sculpture, jewellery, and bead making.
Marquees are being set up to augment the town's hall space and the
Cathedral of the Isles, Europe's smallest and the subject of a
restoration appeal, will host a gospel choir concert.
Mr Tony West, one of the festival organisers who have been working
since last summer to put the event together, said: ''This is a great
opportunity to put Millport on the world map and we are hoping that
everyone who lives here or is a regular visitor will give us their
backing.
''We have a tremendous range of attractions and events and we are
hoping that around 6000 people will be on the island for that weekend
and that many will be back for another visit. Contact has been made with
the Mayor of Nashville and we are hoping that the home of country may be
represented at the festival.''
Among the stars taking part will be Philomena Begley from Ireland,
Cleve Francis from the US, and home grown talent including the Dez
Walters Country Band, Rambling Fever, and Texas Express.
Special travel packages of train, ferry, and bus tickets are
available. Visitors are being urged to keep the number of cars to a
minimum.
Ritz Cafe proprietor Luigi Giorgetto has the alter ego of a Mexican
bandit for the duration. As he dusted off his sombrero and sixgun before
consigning another gringo to Boot Hill, he said: ''There is a great
atmosphere about the place already and it will be building up towards
the August holiday weekend.''
He signed off: ''It will be a great weekend. See y'all there.''

THE Press Complaints Commission announced yesterday that it is
reopening its file on a complaint made by Tory MP Graham Riddick against
The Sunday Times over the cash-for-questions affair.
The decision came after a meeting yesterday when members considered a
report from the House of Commons Privileges Committee which recommended
the suspension of Mr Riddick and a second Tory MP, David Tredinnick.
The committee had highlighted an apparent discrepancy in evidence
submitted by The Sunday Times to itself and the PCC.
A statement from the PCC said: ''At its meeting yesterday, the PCC
considered the report of the committee of privileges and reviewed the
manner in which it had dealt with Mr Riddick's complaint. In
consequence, the commission decided to reopen its file on the matter.
''It will now seek further evidence from the parties to this complaint
in advance of considering the issues further under the terms of the
industry's code of practice.''
The Commons voted in April to suspend both MPs for a short period for
a ''serious error of judgment'' in being willing to accept #1000 for
tabling questions.
The affair arose from an article published in The Sunday Times last
July.
Immediately after publication, the PCC decided that the subterfuge
used by The Sunday Times was justified as the only means of discovering
the truth for an article which raised issues of serious public interest.
However, the Privileges Committee criticised the paper, saying bugging
and entrapment could not be condoned as a method of researching for an
article.
The Privileges Committee has been in the headlines more recently over
the case of Sir Jerry Wiggin, who used Tory MP Sebastian Coe's name to
table an amendment which directly benefited his own paid interest.
Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd decided, however, that Sir Jerry
should not be punished and that his case should not be referred to the
committee.
Her comments suggested she believed the Commons disciplinary system
was inadequate. Many MPs interpreted her remarks as support for the
Nolan Committee proposals for an independent watchdog to investigate
MPs' conduct, a ban on lobbying by MPs, and the disclosure of outside
earnings.
Shadow National Heritage Minister Chris Smith said: ''If there is a
major discrepancy in evidence, then obviously it needs to be considered.
''But if it is only a minor technical difference, then the PCC may
well be wasting its time.''
Mr John Witherow, editor of The Sunday Times, said his paper was happy
to co-operate with the PCC but added that he thought there was no
discrepancy in evidence.
''It's simply that the committee wanted to have a go at the press, to
get back at them, and this is their way of doing it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Dustmen beat politicians as economic forecasters</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978075894</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE worth of economic forecasters was nicely illustrated yesterday.
Just over 10 years ago, four London dustmen pitted their wits against
the same sized teams of ex-Finance Ministers, company chairmen, and
Oxford University students.
They were asked by The Economist magazine to predict inflation,
exchange rates, and economic growth in a decade's time.
When staff at the magazine came to compare the panels' predictions
with what had really happened, they found that the dustmen came joint
first with the company chairmen.
The four former Finance Ministers came bottom, with the Oxford
students in third place.
Subjects put to the panelists included oil prices, inflation, the
pound's exchange rate, and the chance of South Africa having a black
government by the year 2000.
Dustmen came top when it came to forecasting oil prices and the
pound's exchange rate.
The report is in yesterday's issue of the Economist. Its author, Ms
Pam Woodall, said: ''Our survey goes to show that economic forecasting
can be just guesswork.
''It can all be a matter of luck and dustmen seem better than finance
experts at getting it right.
''Economic forecasting is not really a science, more of an art.
''After all, Britain's economic forecasters have made some big errors
in their time -- they failed to predict the last recession and the
subsequent recovery last year.
''It seems dustmen have got just as good a chance of coming up with
the right answer as economic experts who can be bogged down in
statistics.''

THE row over share options and the boards of privatised utility
companies broke out again yesterday when a senior director of an
electricity company took a windfall profit of more than #567,000 through
selling them.
Mr Granville Camsey, a board member at National Power, exercised the
option to buy more than 200,000 shares in the company and immediately
sold them at more than double the original price.
The deal, announced by the Stock Exchange, brought a call from Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown for immediate Government action to curb
boardroom pay abuses.
Labour research shows that four directors of the generating company
have now made collective profits on share options of more than #2m.
The Prime Minister has publicly condemned excessive pay increases but
is insisting the Government would take no action before the publication
of the report of a Confederation of British Industry inquiry into
boardroom pay led by Sir Richard Greenbury.
Mr Brown renewed his demand for a clampdown on pay and perks in the
privatised utilities, the focus of growing public anger after a series
of well-publicised salary rises for senior directors.
''Far from the scandal of share options diminishing, the abuses are
getting worse even as they are being reviewed by Greenbury. It is now
time for the Prime Minister to act,'' he said.
Mr Camsey, 59, managing director of group technology for the
generating company, was granted options on 136,815 shares in April 1991
and on a second batch of 79,069 in December that year.
Under the scheme, he was permitted yesterday to buy the first batch at
#2.01 per share and the second at #2.15 per share before selling them at
the current market price of #4.69. For an outlay of around #445,000 he
was able to make an overall profit of #567,499.
Labour researchers said company reports showed Mr Camsey, a married
man with two children, still had options on a further batch of 98,828
shares.
National Power insisted the granting of share options to directors was
in line with normal business practice in the private sector.
''These share options were granted in 1991. They are now well over
their original mature date -- he could have drawn them last year but
decided to take them this year -- and they are a reflection of the way
the company's share value has gone,'' a spokesman said.
''When National Power was floated, there was no criticism in the press
that these shares were undervalued. Indeed, there were warnings at the
time they may not be a good bet for the ordinary shareholder.''
The high-profile sale follows a week of turmoil in the privatised
utilities over levels of profit and pay.
Small shareholders of British Gas packed an annual meeting in open
revolt against the salary increases of board members.
They demanded the resignation of company chief executive Cedric Brown,
whose salary is #475,000, and chairman Richard Giordano, who earns
#450,000, but the move was blocked by big City institutions voting with
the company.
Meanwhile, writes Cameron Simpson, the maxim that it pays to advertise
yesterday took the heat off the chiefs of British Gas.
The shareholders' complaints were put at a peep by a new pay and
performance package unveiled for an advertising chief executive: he is
set to get a #14.3m bonus.
Mr Martin Sorrell, 50, will be given 4,691,000 shares if the share
price of his WPP advertising and marketing group grows by 22.5% a year
over five years.
The bonus will be triggered if the price hits 304p a share, compared
with its current price of 131p. He would then get shares worth #14.3m --
but if the price goes higher, he will pick up even more cash.
However, to achieve the growth, WPP would have to out-perform the
average of the top 100 companies on the Stock Market.
Also, Mr Sorrell, the company's chief executive, is required to buy
shares worth a total of #2.2m from his own resources in the meantime.
The WPP group's annual report published yesterday shows Mr Sorrell's
pay package last year rose 28% to #1,224,000 from #956,000 in the
previous 12 months. The total included a bonus of #575,000 based on the
company's performance.
Pre-tax profits jumped last year by 57% to #85.3m from #54.4m in 1993.
Shareholders are to vote on the proposals at an extraordinary general
meeting following the annual meeting on June 26.
Mr Sorrell, former finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, built up his
own company through a series of spectacular takeovers and overtook his
former firm as the world's biggest marketing services group.

MORE than 3000 British children are estimated to have HIV-positive
mothers, and more than 600 of them live in Scotland, according to
figures published yesterday.
Barnardo's said the number -- more than half of whom are under the age
of 10 -- was set to increase by a third in two years and would continue
rising after that.
The study, carried out for Barnardo's by the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine, also shows that two-thirds of the children are in
London.

A DISPUTE over emergency services from Bute deepened yesterday, when
unions accused health authorities of calling out ferry staff to
transport ambulances without justification.
They claimed that health officials were taking advantage of the crews'
good will, and possibly wasting public money, by asking ferries to sail
in situations which did not appear to be genuine emergencies.
The Herald yesterday revealed that a stand-off involving the ferry
staff and four publicly funded organisations -- Caledonian MacBrayne,
Argyll and Clyde Health Board, Argyll and Bute NHS Trust, and the
Scottish Ambulance Service -- had resulted in medical emergencies being
taken off Bute by military helicopter.
That option costs around three times as much as the use of a CalMac
ferry and is less comfortable for the patient.
The Scottish secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association,
Mr Dick King, yesterday cited four cases within the past year of
''supposed emergency scenarios'':
* A reported drugs overdose case taken off Bute overnight, yet seen
waiting on foot for the first scheduled ferry back to Rothesay.
* A patient who, once the ambulance had driven on to the ferry, got
off his stretcher and demanded to use the ship's phone to sort out
business problems.
* A patient who was seen playing cards in the back of the ambulance.
* A case where the only injury was a broken arm.
Mr King said: ''The ships' officers are willing and able to give up
their precious rest in cases of real emergency but they are pretty fed
up with being used, especially when the apparently indiscriminate use of
the ferry after normal hours could lead to fatigue and endanger the
safety of daytime services.''
He pointed out that, under new regulations imposed by the Marine
Safety Agency, a ship's master was obliged to satisfy himself that a
situation was life-threatening before putting to sea but ''there is
virtually no evidence so far that the health authorities are prepared to
reveal details of a patient's condition''.
Ideally, said Mr King, the ferry service should be replaced by
improving health facilities on Bute and providing an air ambulance. More
practically, the situation would be greatly helped by more
discriminating use of the ferry.
The national secretary of the Rail, Maritime, and Transport union, Mr
Norrie McVicar, echoed many of the points made by Mr King.
He said: ''The health authorities are putting all the pressure on
CalMac but it is not just they who should solve the problem. There
should be more discussions involving the unions as well.''
A health board spokesman last night declined to discuss any individual
patient cases but said the clinical judgment about their condition had
to remain with qualified medical staff such as the GPs on Bute.
He reassured islanders that, in the event of an emergency, a patient
would be taken to the mainland for specialist treatment.

MEDIA tycoon Robert Maxwell was not dishonest when he used employee
pension fund assets as security for loans, nor did he commit suicide
when he realised the game was up, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
They heard that when Mr Kevin Maxwell, son of the newspaper publisher
who died in unexplained circumstances while cruising in his yacht off
the Canaries, eventually gives evidence he will insist that his father
did not take his own life.
Mr Alun Jones, QC, on behalf of Mr Kevin Maxwell, said that in the
course of the trial his team would be suggesting that Mr Robert Maxwell
was not dishonest in relation to transactions involving pension fund
assets that were subject to the first count on the indictment, which
alleges a conspiracy between his client and the late Mr Maxwell.
Mr Robert Maxwell at the time of his death clearly believed he was
legally entitled to transfer pension fund shares for the benefit of the
Maxwell group as a whole, he said.
''The history of the group shows that this was the entire process of
decision-making,'' counsel declared. ''It was designed to make easy his
habit of taking all important decisions by himself and getting others to
rubber-stamp them later.''
Mr Jones said that Mr Robert Maxwell had told his son Kevin that
shares in two Israeli companies had been transferred from company
pension funds to the Maxwell Group. Trading in these shares are at the
heart of the conspiracy trial.
''We are not here to investigate whether in other aspects of Maxwell
companies business he (Robert Maxwell) was or was not dishonest,'' said
Mr Jones. ''We are here to show he believed he was lawfully entitled to
transfer assets, even from the pension funds, to other companies in the
group.''
He told the jury: ''Kevin Maxwell is here charged with conspiracy with
someone who is not here to defend himself, his father Robert Maxwell.
''The proof of Robert Maxwell's dishonesty is one step the prosecution
have to take to prove Kevin Maxwell's dishonesty. It is part of the
charge.
''Part of our function in this case is to ask the question: 'What
would have been Robert Maxwell's defence if he was here?' ''
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, denies two charges of conspiracy to defraud. The
first alleges he conspired with his late father in the month before his
death to misuse #100m worth of shares in the Israeli company Scitex,
which belonged to the trustees and beneficiaries of the pension fund.
He is also charged, along with his brother Mr Ian Maxwell, 38, Mr
Robert Bunn 47, and Mr Larry Trachtenberg, 42, with conspiring to misuse
shares in another Israeli company that belonged to the trustees and
beneficiaries of the pension fund.
Prosecution and defence were agreed, said Mr Jones, that if Mr Kevin
Maxwell had believed that the beneficial ownership of the shares in
question had been transferred legally to RMG before they were pledged as
securities to banks, it was a complete and absolute defence on both
charges he faced.
The Crown has told the court that in 1991 Mr Robert Maxwell's
companies were in increasing financial difficulties. They faced mounting
debt -- more than #845m -- and growing pressure from their bankers to
repay loans.
The perception that Mr Robert Maxwell committed suicide led to a
disastrous plunge in share prices in the group, Mr Jones told the jury.
Banks that held these shares as collateral then decided to put an end
to the group.
Mr Robert Maxwell was a man who had taken decisions unilaterally. He
had complete power to take any decision.
The group was run as if it were just one company. Assets from the
pension funds were included.
He also suggested that Mr Kevin Maxwell had been let down by
professional advisers.
Many of those who would give evidence would attempt to distance
themselves from an alleged conspiracy for various reasons. The banks
might do so because of their concern over the regulatory authorities --
especially the Bank of England.
Mr Jones insisted that there were faults by professional advisers,
private individuals, and regulators. They all shared responsibility in
varying degrees for the collapse of the Maxwell group. It could not, he
said, be put down to a conspiracy by a few conspirators, as the Crown
alleged.
Counsel for Mr Bunn said that his client was not a member of the
Maxwell family. While he held the title of deputy managing director
(finance) at one stage this did not tell the story of his real position,
which was very much subordinate to Robert and Kevin Maxwell.
The trial continues on Monday.

<TEXT>
OLDER women may be denied the chance to have a baby because of ageism
among medical experts, an infertility specialist warned yesterday.
Professor Ian Craft, director of the London Fertility Centre,
questioned the value of ethics committees set up by fertility centres to
decide whether treatment should go ahead.
Instead of viewing the well-being of the future child as of paramount
importance, members were likely to impose their own personal prejudices,
he claimed.
''All too often, decisions made individually and taken collectively
reflect an individual's own background and upbringing,'' he wrote in
this week's British Medical Journal.
The article is one of a series published in an ethical debate on
whether older women should be allowed invitro fertilisation.
It follows a public outcry over the pregnancy of a 58-year-old woman
who received fertility treatment in Italy after being denied it in
Britain.
The oldest ''test tube'' mother in Britain to agree to be named is
Pauline Lyon, 52, of March, Cambridgeshire. She admitted lying about her
age, claiming she was 47 when she realised she would be 50 by the time
she ''conceived'' through fertility treatment -- the age when she would
no longer be eligible for help.
Critics believe a line should be drawn at 50. Although in law there is
no upper age for treatment, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority, set up to license clinics, said concerns for the future
well-being of children ruled out treating elderly women.
Professor Craft said he had changed his belief of 20 years ago that
ethics committees were needed to consider some of the more ''emotive''
types of treatment.
He asked what was wrong with treating women of 51, if natural
conception had resulted in births to women aged 55.
Admitting to being ''disillusioned'' with ethics committees, he added:
''I am not sure they are in the best interests of patients. Surely their
role must be to decide whether a proposed treatment is ethical or
unethical -- not whether a specific woman, or couple, should have her
request voted on after a written anonymous submission by a clinician and
an independent counsellor, as has been the practice of the committee at
my centre.''

HOUSING organisations have been told they should stop relying so much
on the police and play a bigger part themselves in trying to prevent
crime such as drug abuse, vandalism, and housebreaking on estates.
The Institute of Housing in Scotland has offered the advice in a
publication, Housing and Crime -- how are we managing?, launched
yesterday.
Mr Alan Ferguson, director of the CIH in Scotland, said housing
organisations were underestimating the absolutely crucial role they had
to play. They must stop seeing the police as the key agency in crime
prevention.
Instead, they should put the emphasis on a partnership approach to
tackle crime. The agencies involved along with housing could include the
police, offender services, schools, and tenants associations and other
community groups.
There was a growing concern among housing managers about the level of
drug-related crime in some areas, said Mr Ferguson, and this was not
limited just to larger local housing authorities.
The institute advises that all housing staff are trained to recognise
the signs of solvent and drug abuse and are made aware of how to deal
with some of the associated problems.
It also stresses there should be a strategy between housing managers
and the police for tackling drug-related crime.

SCOTLAND'S hockey players are renowned for the lengths to which they
will travel in search of competition but their enthusiasm for the sport
pales into insignificance when compared to the exploits of the Belarus's
Minsk men's club.
They set off for Paisley on Tuesday, for the finals of the B Division
of the European Club Championship -- being staged this weekend at
Linwood -- by bus, which became their home for the next three days and
nights.
On reaching Hamburg, they could not get a booking on the ferry and
carried on to Rotterdam but arrived 13 minutes before the ferry was due
to sail, too late to get their bus on board.
So it was on to Calais, where they finally managed to board a ferry
crossing to Dover on Thursday. Yesterday morning, they arrived at their
hotel in Paisley -- just five-and-a-half hours before their first game
against Grammarians of Gibraltar.
The team's 13 players were able to grab an hour-and-a-half's sleep
before their opening match but the rest of the party of 17 whiled away
the time elsewhere, as the club had only 13 beds at the hotel.
The cash-strapped Minsk team's plight came to the attention of
Paisley's McMahon Kelburne club, who immediately rallied around.
Mr Stuart McAlpine, a former Kelburne player and director with
Kilbryde Communications of East Kilbride, had promised his company would
underwrite the cost of their accommodation.
Tonight, they will be guests at the home of liaison officer Barrie
Scholefier and then go on to a ''Scottish'' night at the Kelburne
clubhouse in Whitehaugh, Paisley.
The players are due to begin the homeward journey on Monday, happy in
the knowledge their sacrifice was not in vain. A victory over
Grammarians gives them a strong chance of reaching Monday's final and
winning promotion to the A division.
Meanwhile, Czech Republic side T J Hostivar made a 32-hour trip by
coach. As they also have financial problems, they are staying at the
YMCA.

AN upsurge in the number of reported cases of tuberculosis in Scotland
will lead to a study in Edinburgh and Lothian on social deprivation and
poor housing, a major symposium on the disease was told yesterday.
Delegates meeting at the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh were
told clinicians were confident that it would not reach the plague
proportions in Scotland which are being experienced worldwide but that
vigilance was required to stem any increase.
Referring to a study in 1993, Dr Gordon Leitch, of the Royal Victoria
Chest Clinic and Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS Trust, said 574 cases
were notified. The study documented the distribution of TB by age, sex,
and ethnic group for the first time.
He stated: ''Notification practices need to be improved.''
Infection with HIV was currently uncommon in cases of TB in Scotland,
he said, but continued vigilance was essential.
Delegates were told that as people aged, the possibility of
contracting tuberculosis was heightened, because the ''sleeping''
bacillus could be activated.
Questioned about the problems of social deprivation being linked to
the last major outbreak in the 50s, when the disease was thought to have
been eradicated, he replied: ''This is something we intend to look at in
Edinburgh and Lothian.''
Dr Brian Watt, director of the Scottish Mycobacteria reference
laboratory based in Edinburgh's City Hospital, added that new molecular
processes being used in clinical checks were now seeing a technology
which was becoming more user friendly, and would drop in price in the
near future.
However, he added: ''It is extremely important that we keep examining.
''TB will not become a plague but we must keep looking at measures to
prevent it from spreading.''
Earlier, Sir John Crofton, from Edinburgh, recognised worldwide as an
expert for his work on the disease, said he was concerned that a
recurrence of a TB epidemic could threaten the whole world.
The disease, he said, was now the biggest single killer, affecting
eight million people, mainly in the sub continent of India and the
African countries.
He called for more international funding into research, while
admitting that Britain was the second biggest contributor to this.
He added that integration of services, proper operations, and training
was essential to counter its spread.

MEMBERS of Aberdeen's business community joined civic leaders
yesterday to denounce the threatened closure of the city's
internationally renowned food laboratory.
They opposed any move by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and
Fisheries to axe the Torry-based Food Science Laboratory and its
specialist workforce of 100.
It has been rumoured that the Ministry is to close the research
station, the only one of its kind in Scotland specialising in food
safety, and concentrate all its expertise in food safety at a new
super-lab in York.
''It is not a battle that is going to be on, it is a war,'' said
Councillor Neil Cooney, chairman of an emergency meeting of the
high-level economic steering group, the Aberdeen Industrial Authority.
He added: ''We must get the message across that we cannot allow this
laboratory to close. It is a jewel in the crown of research in the
North-east of Scotland. We cannot allow a brain-drain here.''
Mr Bob Hughes, Labour MP for Aberdeen North, told the meeting that the
Ministry said it was only holding discussions about the future of the
lab and that no decision had yet been taken.
Mr Hughes will join Mr Raymond Robertson, Conservative MP for Aberdeen
South, and Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat MP for Gordon, at a
meeting with Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave and Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang next Tuesday.
He said he would be seeking a guarantee that a promise to keep the
laboratory open, made by Food Minister Nicholas Soames during a visit to
the premises a year ago, would be upheld.
''It does appear as though the whole thing revolves around the need
for the Agriculture Department to produce an annual business plan. But I
believe there is a very powerful case to be made and that case will be
made at every possible opportunity,'' he said.
The Torry lab's Dr Terry Whittle said relocation would have a
detrimental effect on Aberdeen, Grampian, and Scotland as a whole,
especially as it was the only station in Scotland capable of dealing
with an outbreak of salmonella or similar infections.
He also stressed that the North-east's position as the UK's premier
fishing and fish-processing region would come under threat if the
research station closed.

JACK Charlton, the Irish Republic's football manager, yesterday gave
the Prince of Wales the thumbs up for choosing the West of Ireland for a
weekend salmon fishing holiday.
''If the water levels are right, Prince Charles will have a brilliant
day's fishing,'' Big Jack told reporters.
He enthusiastically endorsed the Prince's choice of the exclusive
Delphi Fishing Lodge in County Mayo.
Mr Charlton also revealed that it was he who suggested that the Prince
should try his luck in this fishing paradise in a mountain valley,
described in a tourist guide as ''one of Europe's most breathtakingly
beautiful and isolated areas''.
Prince Charles retreated to the Victorian lodge on Thursday evening
after a two-day public visit to Dublin and County Meath.
As a result of his successful public engagements, Irish newspapers are
buzzing with speculation that the Queen will make an official visit to
Ireland in the near future.
The Prince's private secretary, Mr Richard Aylard, said the Prince
would be spending his time painting and fishing.
Last night, a leading Ulster Unionist strongly criticised the Prince's
visit. Mr Peter Robinson, the deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist
Party, insisted that the Prince should not have gone to the Irish
Republic because of its territorial claim over Northern Ireland which is
''part of the realm''.

PENSIONERS voiced their concerns yesterday at the fourth annual
Pensioners' Forum in Glasgow about the effects of the community care
programme.
One of the chief fears expressed by delegates at the City Chambers was
the financial implications for couples if either of them had to be
admitted to a residential home.
Mr John Mann, a retired civil servant serving on the forum's executive
committee, said that by the time most people realised how the
means-testing system, worked it was too late.
''The regulations affecting savings over #8000 are affecting a lot of
people who are certainly not rich and who have worked and saved hard all
their lives,'' said Mr Mann, who has retired to Largs.
''If someone is on an occupational and a state pension, and they have
to go into a home, their spouse could end up being left to survive on
only a small pension.''
Scotland's one million pensioners were becoming increasingly disturbed
at the pressures being put on health services, according to Mr Mann.
Mr John McShane, Strathclyde region's principal officer for community
care, outlined some of the social work department's strategic plans for
pensioners.
He denied that plans to extend the range of services provided by home
helps was a way of getting ''nurses on the cheap'' but it would mean
them undertaking tasks a husband or relative would do.
Dr Brian Potter, the Scottish secretary of the British Medical
Association, said that as a group, pensioners wielded a tremendous
amount of power.
''Pensioner's expectations have been driven down over the years by the
constant propaganda but I want a proper health service to respond to my
needs when I need it,'' said Dr Potter.
''It's in everyone's interests to have a decent NHS. Look at the US,
where their health service is held up to be a paradise, but huge groups
have no medical cover whatsoever.
''Pensioners must speak up for the NHS that we have and must mobilise
the very real power they have.''

ENGLAND footballer Dennis Wise was yesterday acquitted of attacking a
taxi driver and damaging his cab.
The Chelsea captain also won a vote of confidence from England coach
Terry Venables after walking from the dock.
Venables, confirming the 28-year-old midfielder remained an important
part of his European Championship plans, said: ''I always felt he wasn't
guilty.''
Wise had been wining and dining at Venables's Scribes West nightclub
in Kensington, London, shortly before the alleged attack on Mr Gerald
Graham, 65, on October 8 last year.
He was jailed in March for three months for criminal damage and
assault and branded a ''bully'' by magistrate Geoffrey Breen.
He successfully applied for bail pending his appeal hearing at
Southwark Crown Court, London.
During the two-day appeal case, Wise said his alleged victim had
repeatedly lied by saying he kicked the outside of the taxi, booted his
way through its interior glass partition, and rained blows on his head.
He admitted smashing the partition, but only with his fist, and
grabbing the taxi driver round the neck.
However, he said he had no option after Mr Graham drove off as Wise's
girlfriend Geraldine Lennon was getting out, accidentally knocking her
over with the open passenger door and dragging her several yards along
the ground.
Judge Gerald Butler, QC, who was sitting with two magistrates and took
less than an hour to clear the player, told Wise his alleged victim's
evidence could not be relied upon ''beyond reasonable doubt''.
He said their decision was made ''with no enthusiasm''.
He added: ''Even on his own account, Mr Wise's conduct was quite
disgraceful and does him no credit at all.''
The judge said that because the player -- represented in court by a
QC, a junior barrister, and a solicitor -- had largely brought the
prosecution on himself, he would have to meet the cost of his own
defence.
Just before retiring to consider the evidence, the judge referred to
the mystery of Mr Graham's spectacles, a subject repeatedly mentioned
during the case.
The taxi driver claimed they were damaged when they fell during the
attack.
Wise's counsel insisted Mr Graham, who had a previous conviction for
assaulting a passenger, damaged them himself after the incident to
bolster his own version of events.
The judge said the glasses seemed normal when they accidentally
appeared in one of the photographs the cab driver took of his damaged
vehicle. When they were later handed to police, one of the arms was
bent.
The acquittal was met with cheers from some of the player's dozen
supporters crowded into the court room. This produced a frosty response
from the judge, who said such ''foolishness'' was not helping their
hero.
A relieved Wise, of East Acton, London, promptly strode from the dock
and minutes later was being hugged by his tearful girlfriend.
Outside the court, he said: ''I just want to put it all behind me and
get on with the rest of my career. I'm happy, I'm going on holiday
fairly shortly.''
Mr Eric Hall, Wise's agent, said he was ''monster monster happy''.

death recently at 83 of Robert S Barclay brought an end to an era in
cardio-thoracic surgery in the West of Scotland.
Brought up in Glasgow as a son of the manse, Bert (as he was known to
many friends and colleagues) soon realised that his future career lay in
medicine. After graduating at Glasgow University in 1934, he developed
an interest in the surgical treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.
Subsequently he was to pioneer the surgery of both congenital and
acquired heart disease. Many children and adults with serious heart
conditions owe much to the care and skill of Mr Barclay and the team he
built around him, both at Mearnskirk Hospital and the Royal Hospital for
Sick Children, Yorkhill.
He was instrumental in establishing clinics not only in Glasgow
(Southern General Hospital, Western Infirmary, Victoria Infirmary) but
in Ayrshire and Dumfries.
In his school days, Mr Barclay excelled not only academically but in
such sporting activities as rugby and golf. His love of golf was to
continue throughout his professional career.
His memory for the names and faces of people, many he had met many
years previously, was quite remarkable. A compulsive talker and the
possessor of a fund of stories, he also had a quick wit, often directed
against himself.
His fondness of travel and meeting people stood him in good stead as
he was able to visit many countries to complement and further advance
his knowledge of cardiac surgery, then in an evolving stage in the 1960s
and 1970s.
In recognition of his services to cardio-thoracic surgery in the West
of Scotland, he was awarded the OBE in 1967. He acknowledged, in his
customary unassuming manner, that this honour was a tribute to the work
of the entire team of surgeons, physicians, anaesthetists, and nursing
staff. He was honoured the previous year by being made president of the
Society of Thoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland.
Mr Barclay will be remembered by his many friends and colleagues, not
only for his technical skill and prowess but also for his humanity and
dedication to the care of all his patients.
He is survived by his wife Inez, his son and daughter, and three
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE>Coastguards' safety pledge. D-day for ballot on rescue dispute</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S 500 full-time coastguards will decide within the next two
weeks whether to hold a ballot on industrial action in a dispute over
staffing levels and emergency radio cover, it was confirmed yesterday.
A senior union leader yesterday assured seafarers that their lives
would not be put at risk by any action, which would be the second threat
of its kind by coastguards in the past six years.
The previous threat was made in 1989 over the proposed closures of
coastguard stations.
Mr Dutchy Holland, chairman of the coastguard grades committee of the
National Union of Civil and Public Servants, said that an ''indicative
ballot'' was under way to gauge the feelings of coastguards on the
possibility of industrial action.
He said the move followed a branch vote of ''no confidence'' in Chief
Coastguard Derek Ancona over his decision to accept additional
responsibility for the emergency radio cover.
Mr Holland said a decision on a ballot for possible industrial action
would be taken on June 14 once members' views were known.
He said: ''The public can rest assured that whatever industrial action
the coastguards may take, it will not jeopardise the lives of
seafarers.''
He said it was unlikely that any industrial action would result in the
first strike in the history of the coastguard service. It is more likely
to involve an overtime ban, a work-to-rule, and perhaps a refusal to
operate the emergency radio cover as proposed.
The dispute has been simmering since earlier this year, when the
Coastguard Agency announced that it was ending British Telecom's #1.5m
annual contract to monitor the marine radio distress frequency, 2182
kHz. The decision followed an incident when a BT operator missed a
distress call from a fishing vessel north west of Shetland.
It is proposed that the work, formerly carried out by Government-run
coast radio stations such as Wick Radio and Portishead Radio, will be
taken over by selected coastguard stations from July 1.
Mr Holland argued that extra staff would be needed to maintain 24-hour
monitoring of the emergency channel. He said it appeared the chief
coastguard wanted to save the #1.5m but that he did not want to spend
any more on additional resources, including adequate staffing levels.
''Unfortunately, due to lack of consultation, we have got no choice
but to ballot,'' Mr Holland said. ''Coastguards do not oppose taking
over the 2182 kHz watch, nor are they asking for more money, but they
believe that the watch needs dedicated staff, not 'a loudspeaker in the
corner of the watch room'.''
He said it would be only a matter of time before a distress message
would be misheard or lost, which could result in subsequent disciplinary
measures for the coastguard officer involved.
He further argued that putting a loudspeaker into the operations room
would merely increase noise levels and stress for coastguards.
The Coastguard Agency in Southampton could not be contacted for
comment yesterday.

ONE of three police officers accused of unlawfully killing illegal
immigrant Mrs Joy Gardner was cleared of her manslaughter yesterday, on
the orders of a judge.
After legal arguments, Constable John Burrell, 43, was freed by Mr
Justice Mantell at the end of the third week of the trial at the Old
Bailey.
The judge told the jury of seven men and five women that he had
decided to instruct them to return a not guilty verdict ''as a matter of
law''.
''I have come to the conclusion after referring to the evidence in
great detail that there is no evidence John Burrell played any active
part in administering the gag'' -- to 40-year-old Mrs Gardner.
He explained that, on examination, the prosecution evidence ''does not
show in a way that is clear or satisfactory that he was holding Joy
Gardner at the material time, which is the allegation the prosecution
made''.
An essential element of the offence was missing, said the judge.
Mr Burrell left the court without comment. The trial of his
colleagues, Detective Sergeant Linda Evans, 41, and Constable Colin
Whitby, 48, continues.
All the officers had denied the manslaughter of Mrs Gardner during her
deportation in the summer of 1993. The mother-of-two died at her home in
Hornsey, north London, after being gagged with 13 feet of sticky tape
and trussed up with leather restraining belts round her waist, thighs,
and ankles.
The prosecution has alleged that there was a violent struggle between
13-stone Mrs Gardner and officers from the Alien Deportation Group, who
were trying to return her to her native Jamaica.
While she was trussed up and prone on the floor, Mr Whitby allegedly
took a roll of tape and wound it round her head a number of times, said
Mr John Bevan, prosecuting.
Mr Burrell, married with a son of 18, joined the Metropolitan Police
in 1969 as a cadet and went to the deportation branch in 1990.
He has an ''exemplary'' record, the jury was told, with two
commendations for outstanding bravery.

A JUDGE is to hear evidence on claims that the supermarket giant,
Safeway, is in breach of a court order which bans the closure of one of
its stores.
The store at Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, which operates under the Presto
name, was due to close last weekend, following redundancy notices to 54
members of staff.
However, at the Court of Session on Friday of last week Lord Penrose
granted an interim interdict in favour of Highland and Univeral
Properties Ltd, the shopping centre's landlords, which in effect ordered
the store to carry on trading.
The judge said the store had a lease with the landlords which was not
due to expire until 2009.
Highland and Universal argued that it had already spent #2.5m out of a
planned #12m improving the centre. Presto was the ''anchor store'' and
the centre would become commercially unattractive if it closed down.
In his ruling last week, Lord Penrose said the landlord's complaint
was about conduct which, if it was established, could only be
characterised as a blatant breach of contract.
Yesterday, the judge was told that only one till out of eight was now
operating and the store was offering only a limited selection of goods
from a restricted shopfloor area.
Mr Jonathan Lake, counsel for the landlords, asked Lord Penrose to
hold that Safeway was in breach of the order he had pronounced last
week.
Mr Alastair Dunlop, QC, for Safeway, said he wished to make it clear
from the outset that at no time had his clients set out to disobey any
order pronounced by the court and their position was that there had been
no breach of interdict.
He explained that the store had already been run down before the
judge's order. When it was trading fully it carried #300,000 worth of
stock. After the closure announcement, the stock was run down to #30,000
and was at that level when Lord Penrose issued his decision last week.
He added: ''What they require to do is remain open for trading and, in
my submission, they are doing so.''
Lord Penrose said he wished to make it abundantly clear that he
required that the whole of the first floor of the premises should remain
open for trading.
No date for a breach of interdict hearing has yet been fixed.

THE police have apologised unreservedly to the Ayrshire parents of a
crash victim, after the car in which he died was used as the focal point
of a nationwide anti-drink driving campaign.
If alive today, 24-year-old John Danks would have strong grounds for a
defamation action against the Association of Chief Police Officers,
responsible for the campaign which implied he had been drinking before
his death.
But the nightmare continues for his parents, Mr Robert Danks and his
wife Winifred. Police have refused to make an ex gratia payment for the
upset and distress caused by using the vehicle in the campaign, even
after conceding that the failure to contact them beforehand was
unjustified.
Publicity material which included their son's car has recently
resurfaced -- this time on television -- on a programme about the power
of posters in getting campaign messages over.
Police have admitted that drink was never an issue in the death of
John Danks, of Thorntree Avenue, Beith. The accident was caused by a
pool of rainwater causing the car to veer off the road.
However, police have specifically instructed their lawyers against an
ex gratia payment. It was deemed not appropriate in the circumstances.
The victim's parents wanted any payment to go to a trust set up for
their four-year-old grandson Kirk, whose father died from his injuries
at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital on August 1 last year.
They are annoyed that police action to withdraw the campaign material
has failed, and have spoken publicly for the first time to clear their
son's name and expose the drink-driving campaign as ''false''.
Posters featuring the car have not only appeared on a television
programme, but are still on view in public places, including libraries.
Mr Danks, 54, who ran a driving school until a heart attack shortly
before his son's death, said yesterday: ''To use the car of someone who
was innocent was appalling enough. But what has happened since then is
worse.
''When I first saw the campaign material I thought it was
unbelievable. I also thought 'this can't be right because he had not
been drink-driving'.
''We have never got over John's death and suddenly this anti-drink
driving campaign is all over television again. I thought lessons had
been learned from the heartbreak we went through earlier. Now I am not
so sure.''
Their legal postion is being reconsidered in the light of distress
caused by not knowing where and when the literature will next appear.
The car featured prominently in posters and leaflets in the Drinking &amp;
Driving Ruins Lives campaign in the run-up to Christmas and New Year.
It was also on food trays at McDonald's, a regular eating place for
young Kirk, before being hastily withdrawn. It was also shown on page
one of the grandparents' local paper in an article against
drink-driving.
An apology from Assistant Chief Constable Ian Mackinnon, head of
Strathclyde's traffic and administration support department, and
secretary of ACPO, was accepted earlier this year by the parents.
They also decided not to pursue the claim for an ex-gratia payment,
accepting instead ACPO's offer to meet legal fees in connection with the
original claim.
Mr Mackinnon, in a letter just three days before Christmas and at the
height of the anti-drink campaign, proffered an unreserved apology for
''the upset and distress'' caused by using their son's vehicle.
He also wrote: ''I can fully accept your views that the inclusion of
the vehicle does give an inference that your son had been drinking prior
to his death in the road accident, and any such inference is entirely
wrong.''
Mr Mackinnon said the failure to contact them before using the
photograph was not justified, and gave an assurance that ''valuable
lessons have been learned in identifying material for future
campaigns''.
In a separate letter to their lawyers, Mr Mackinnon said every care
was taken to ensure identifying features were removed from the car in
order to protect the driver's identity. He acknowledged these measures
were insufficient.
Mr Danks is no longer confident of measures to prevent a recurrence,
and said his wife Winifred, 53, is also deeply fearful that ''a false
campaign which does not even use an authentic vehicle'' is still doing
the rounds.
Their son had been returning home from work as an ice cream van driver
when the car veered out of control in rainwater on the A737 near Risk
Brae at Howwood, Renfrewshire.
Ms Gillian Wade, of Bannatyne Kirkwood France, solicitor for the
Danks, said she awaited with interest fresh instructions from her
clients. There is a possibility that the parents could sue for negligent
misrepresentation.
The parents would probably have to show that the police owed a duty of
care to them.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said last night that it would be
difficult to recover all material distributed in Scotland, but police
had endeavoured to remove it from the area where the family lives.
He added that the use of the photograph may have saved another young
person's life, and went on: ''But this is a really, really unfortunate
situation. We have learned a lot of lessons from it. It will not happen
again.''

TRANSPORT Minister Dr Brian Malwhinney yesterday applauded an
Edinburgh-to-London East Coast InterCity 225 154mph record, comparing it
favourably with the Japanese equivalent but forgetting to mention a
typical France norm of 186mph Channel Tunnel Eurostar outings.
As he met the southbound train in Peterborough, his home constituency,
Dr Malwhinney declined to comment on the West Highland sleeper service
issue.
Instead, he preferred to talk about the successful 150-plus mph record
when he said: ''It represents what BR has achieved in railway
improvements. More has still to be done but today demonstrates
confidence in the future of the industry, as rail moves from the public
into the private sector towards the twenty-first century.''
He had very recently travelled in Japan where, the Minister claimed,
the best of bullet trains over there travelled by only 10mph maximum
speed faster compared with yesterday's record.
BR chairman Mr John Welsby revealed that, in terms of investment, the
West Coast Line would still attract the bulk of funds compared with the
East Coast line.

THREE computer operators have been sacked after their employers
claimed to have caught them watching hard-core pornography on their
screens.
The men, who worked for Hydro-Electric in Aberdeen, are understood to
have accessed the material from the Internet.
It is believed the material they are alleged to have called up from
the international computer network included child sex abuse.
A major police inquiry is now under way, after an internal
investigation by Hydro-Electric. The three men worked at the company's
Seaton computer centre in Aberdeen.
Detective Inspector Alan Smith, leading the inquiry, said yesterday
that police were called in by Hydro-Electric and were examining material
on its computers, but refused to discuss the nature of the material.
''We are preparing a report for the procurator-fiscal and it will be up
to him to decide whether to bring any prosecutions,'' he said.
A Hydro-Electric spokesman said the company became suspicious during a
routine systems check and launched an internal inquiry.
''Further investigations confirmed our suspicions and, regrettably, we
have had to hold internal disciplinary hearings concerning the misuse of
company property and time.
''As a result, three members of staff have been dismissed. All three
are appealing so, at this stage, we cannot give any further details.''
The company refused to confirm or deny that pornographic material was
allegedly being accessed by the men. A spokesman said the internal
investigation lasted two weeks.
The Seaton centre houses 29 Hydro-Electric staff and is used as a
back-up centre for the company's main computer network in Aberdeen.
A spokesman for the men's union, Unison, confirmed that they would be
appealing against the sackings.

A MILLION hard-pressed home owners could be in line for help under
proposals being considered by Government strategists, it emerged
yesterday.
Whitehall is working to find a way to rebuild confidence in a housing
market left in tatters by the collapse in prices and rising interest
rates.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke yesterday faced pressure from back bench MPs
to give tax breaks to help hundreds of thousands of people throughout
Britain who are locked in the mortgage trap.
He was urged to adopt a plan that could see tax help given to home
owners who fell victim to the collapse in house prices and left them
saddled with properties worth less than their mortgages.
Treasury officials insisted the scheme was just one of a number likely
to be considered by the Chancellor in the run-up to the Budget in
November.
However, Tory back benchers remain deeply worried about the effect of
''negative equity'' on one-time supporters in the middle class areas
across the country.
Many believe it is crucial that the Government should do all it can in
the two years before the General Election to ease the pain for home
owners trapped in houses which have collapsed in value.
The Halifax Building Society released figures which confirmed that the
decline in house prices was continuing, down by 0.9% last month, placing
home owners under even greater pressure.
The fall, which follows a 0.4% decrease in April, indicates that the
housing market is ''very weak with little prospect of recovery'', the
Halifax said.
More than one million home buyers in Britain are caught in the
negative equity trap -- where their mortgages exceed the value of their
properties.
The average negative equity is #7000 and the worst-affected area is
London and the South-east, where more than half-a-million home buyers
are shouldering deficits running at an average of #9500.
The problem is far less common in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and
parts of Northern England, as the market in those areas has weathered
the slump.
At the peak of the boom in 1988-89, house prices were rising by an
average of more than 20% per year.
But, in 1992, the worst year, prices fell by more than 5% and
repossession has been the scourge of the 1990s with almost 1000 families
a week losing their homes.
Mr David Shaw, vice-chairman of the Tory back bench finance committee,
has submitted a plan for one-off tax relief of up to #3000 a year for
three years for people caught in the mortgage trap.
But the vast cost of the scheme -- which could total #2250m over three
years -- might deter the Government.
The Prime Minister caused a storm of protest on Thursday when he
appeared to pin the blame for the ''crazy'' spiralling of property
prices in the late 1980s on home buyers.
He won backing yesterday from Lord Tebbit, former Tory Party chairman,
who said people had got ''very excited'' in the late 1980s and house
prices had gone up excessively.
But he insisted: ''That panic buying was not the fault of the
Government. That had to be the responsibility of the people who were
doing it.''
However, estate agents said Government policies, and not home owners,
were to blame.
The 9500-strong National Association of Estate Agents has written a
letter of protest to Mr Major accusing the Conservatives of complacency
over house prices and of failing to listen to the needs of home buyers.
Chief executive Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy said: ''One of the key factors the
Prime Minister seems to have overlooked is that Nigel Lawson, as
Chancellor, announced the removal of dual tax relief for unmarried
people on mortgage interest. This created a buying spree by encouraging
people to beat the deadline.
''Mr Major did not issue warnings to house buyers that they should not
get carried away and that house prices can go down as well as up.''
The association's president, Mrs May Storrie, a Lanarkshire estate
agent, added: ''It was made easy to buy property and, after the market
overheated as a result of Tory policies, it is incredible that the
Government can blame these people.''
She said the association had written to Mr Major calling for measures
to assist people in the mortgage trap, such as increasing mortgage
interest relief at source (Miras) from 15% to its former rate of 20%.
This would restore confidence among home owners and people considering
buying.
Mrs Storrie added that Scotland was not so badly affected because
people were ''generally more cautious'' and admitted that some people
who are unaffected would not support Government assistance for others
who were less cautious.

THREE ''Citizen Smith'' radicals who decided that a riot would put
their housing scheme on the map were jailed yesterday at the High Court
in Edinburgh.
David Graham, 23, was given a six-year sentence after admitting that
between August 12 and 14 last year he assembled incendiary devices with
intent to cause an explosion.
John Gilmour, 20, and Kevin Williamson, 18, were each jailed for four
years for petrol-bombing a kebab shop in Pennywell Court, Edinburgh, on
August 13, endangering the lives of two workers and damaging the
premises.
The court was told that an outbreak of civil unrest had led to
improved facilities in the Pilton district of Edinburgh and the three
believed that by damaging property they could achieve similar benefits
for their own area, Muirhouse.
Mr Paul McBride, advocate-depute, told Lord Johnston that, on August
13, Graham had 10 petrol bombs at his home in Muirhouse Drive and
discussed with a number of others the possibility of a riot to ''put
Muirhouse on the map''.
Later that night, Gilmour and Williamson, also from Muirhouse Drive,
made their way to the kebab shop, each with a petrol bomb.
Gilmour walked in and threw his bottle at the wall. It exploded and
the counter caught fire. Williamson was outside at the rear of the shop,
throwing his bottle at the wall.
The two workers, Shamim Saeed and Mohammed Gouse, fled and were
uninjured but the shop suffered #24,000 worth of damage.
Mr McBride emphasised that there was no suggestion of any racial
motive for the attack.
Mr Gary Allan, defending Graham, said the discussion at his client's
house had been about the Muirhouse area lacking many of the facilities
that had recently been provided in Pilton after some civil unrest.
''Graham had the misguided belief that by causing some significant
damage to property, the authorities would in some way be compelled to
spend money refurbishing Muirhouse.''
Lord Johnston asked whether it was some kind of revolutionary activity
but Mr Allan thought that was a somewhat dramatic description.
''One is put in mind more of the television programme Citizen Smith,
about a misguided radical whose attempts at achieving anything were
somewhat pathetic. The tragedy of this matter is that Graham took some
overt steps to do something about it.''
The intention was to damage property, not endanger life.
Lord Johnston said Graham had not been involved in any burning of the
premises: ''But you did prepare explosive substances for the purpose of
causing serious damage.''
The judge told Gilmour and Williamson that their condiuct had been
crassly stupid but the fact remained that it was a very serious offence,
even if drink had played a part.

LABOUR'S constitutional plans will plunge the United Kingdom into
chaos, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said last night in the latest foray
by a Scottish Office Minister south of the border to bang the drum
against devolution.
Addressing the Langbaurgh Conservative Association, Mr Lang said the
discrepancy between plans for a tax-raising Scottish parliament, a Welsh
assembly without tax-raising powers, and as yet undefined English
regional assemblies, would create strains on the fabric of the UK.
''Tony Blair's constitutional plans just don't stack up,'' he said.
''He hasn't thought them through. He's prepared to break up Britain for
party advantage. Labour's plans pose a threat to us all, not just the
Scots or the Welsh but the English too.''
Mr Lang's visit to Langbaurgh, in Cleveland in the North-east, follows
visits to English constituencies by Scottish Office Ministers Lord
Fraser and Allan Stewart -- shortly after he resigned in February --
that form an unofficial attempt to shore up support for the union in
England.
He told Conservatives in the seat held by Scottish Whip Michael Bates
that Labour was already showing signs of retreat on its plans for
regional assemblies in England.
''The idea of dividing England into regional assemblies was always a
nonsense. Establishing artificial divisions within England would create
all kinds of anomalies and injustices between different regions,'' he
said.
The differences between plans for Scotland, Wales, and England ''would
create all kinds of tensions and pressures. Our constitution has been
tried and tested for nearly 300 years. It has proved beyond doubt its
ability to serve all the peoples of our islands.''
Meanwhile, speculation over the likelihood of a summer Government
reshuffle continued at Westminster. Mr Major was said to be considering
a limited number of changes, aimed at removing Mr Jeremy Hanley as party
chairman and Mrs Virginia Bottomley as Health Secretary.
The three main offices of State -- Chancellor, Foreign Secretary, and
Home Secretary, are to be excluded from the exercise, according to the
latest speculation, in order to allow for a more comprehensive reshuffle
next year to produce a fresh-look Government on the eve of the General
Election.

CALTON Athletic, the Glasgow club for recovering drug addicts, has
received an anonymous donation of #80,000.
The benefactor's only stipulation on the windfall is that the donor's
identity must not be revealed. Only a few members of the club know and
they are sworn to secrecy.
Calton Athletic founder and leader, Mr David Bryce, was taken aback by
the news yesterday. He said: ''What an incredible donation. This is
fantastic news and a godsend. I was astonished at such a generous
gesture and very, very proud that this club has been chosen to spend the
money wisely.''
He said the money would be used in a unique drugs prevention project
in Strathclyde's schools in a bid to stop another generation of
youngsters being lost to drugs.
Calton Athletic has been undertaking voluntary talks in schools for
three years with recovered addicts speaking to pupils in an attempt to
de-glamorise drug misuse. The donation will be invested in the project
to pay for full-time staff to continue the talks.
Calton Athletic football team was founded 10 years ago by Mr Bryce,
himself a former drug addict, as a self-help group for recovering
addicts. The club expanded into a full-time drugs project four years ago
when health and social work departments agreed to fund their day
programme.
The award-winning drama Alive and Kicking, starring Lenny Henry and
Robbie Coltrane, was based on the club and its stars became Calton fans.
Coltrane, who is on location filming the last series of Cracker, said:
''This is brilliant news and the money couldn't be in better hands. It
is an incredible gesture and the club is more than worthy of using the
cash to stunning effect. I am delighted for them and I know Lenny will
be overjoyed too.''

THE row over share options and the boards of privatised utility
companies broke out again yesterday when a senior director of an
electricity company took a windfall profit of more than #567,000 through
selling them.
Mr Granville Camsey, a board member at National Power, exercised the
option to buy more than 200,000 shares in the company and immediately
sold them at more than double the original price.
The deal, announced by the Stock Exchange, brought a call from Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown for immediate Government action to curb
boardroom pay abuses.
Labour research shows that four directors of the generating company
have now made collective profits on share options of more than #2m.
The Prime Minister has publicly condemned excessive pay increases but
is insisting the Government would take no action before the publication
of the report of a Confederation of British Industry inquiry into
boardroom pay led by Sir Richard Greenbury.
Mr Brown renewed his demand for a clampdown on pay and perks in the
privatised utilities, the focus of growing public anger after a series
of well-publicised salary rises for senior directors.
''Far from the scandal of share options diminishing, the abuses are
getting worse even as they are being reviewed by Greenbury. It is now
time for the Prime Minister to act,'' he said.
Mr Camsey, 59, managing director of group technology for the
generating company, was granted options on 136,815 shares in April 1991
and on a second batch of 79,069 in December that year.
Under the scheme, he was permitted yesterday to buy the first batch at
#2.01 per share and the second at #2.15 per share before selling them at
the current market price of #4.69. For an outlay of around #445,000 he
was able to make an overall profit of #567,499.
Labour researchers said company reports showed Mr Camsey, a married
man with two children, still had options on a further batch of 98,828
shares.
National Power insisted the granting of share options to directors was
in line with normal business practice in the private sector.
''These share options were granted in 1991. They are now well over
their original mature date -- he could have drawn them last year but
decided to take them this year -- and they are a reflection of the way
the company's share value has gone,'' a spokesman said.
''When National Power was floated, there was no criticism in the press
that these shares were undervalued. Indeed, there were warnings at the
time they may not be a good bet for the ordinary shareholder.''
The high-profile sale follows a week of turmoil in the privatised
utilities over levels of profit and pay.
Small shareholders of British Gas packed an annual meeting in open
revolt against the salary increases of board members.
They demanded the resignation of company chief executive Cedric Brown,
whose salary is #475,000, and chairman Richard Giordano, who earns
#450,000, but the move was blocked by big City institutions voting with
the company.

FIVE Scots Guards have been identified as drug takers, it was
disclosed yesterday.
The disgraced men, based at Windsor, could now be discharged from the
Army.
The discovery was admitted by the Ministry of Defence, which said:
''Drug taking is incompatible with service life.''
The five men are among 21 Army personnel who have been caught after
the introduction of compulsory drug tests in December last year.
Although laboratory tests showed most of the drug-users had been
taking cannabis, one soldier proved positive for LSD and there was
further evidence of the use of ecstasy and amphetamines.
So far, there have been no identified cases of heroin or cocaine among
the 4420 officers and soldiers tested.
A total of 48 Army units have been tested and the number of positive
tests stands at 0.47%.
This compares favourably with Home Office figures which show that
three million people, 6% of the population, take an illegal substance.
Compulsory drug testing was introduced as a deterrent by the Army amid
a blaze of publicity. It has been well received across the ranks.
Soldiers and officers found to be taking Class A drugs such as
cocaine, heroin, and LSD face instant dismissal. Officers must resign if
they are found to be taking any illegal drug.
Non-commissioned officers above the rank of lance corporal usually
face an administrative discharge, although privates and lance corporals
might be given a second chance in exceptional circumstances.
Of the 21 identifed as drugtakers, 15 have been discharged or
recommended for discharge, two will receive formal warnings, two have
applied to leave early, and decisions on the other two have still to be
made.
Units tested so far include the Ministry of Defence, the Parachute
Regiment, the Army Air Corps, and the Royal Military Police.

A FORMER Tory Minister, Sir Nicholas Scott, was arrested after
allegedly leaving the scene of a motoring accident involving a
three-year-old child, it emerged last night.
The incident happened on Thursday night in Chelsea, west London. He
was arrested later at a nearby address and released on police bail.
Scotland Yard refused to confirm that the former Minister for the
disabled, who is a JP, was involved. But a spokeswoman did release
details of an incident.
''Police were called at 9.30pm to an incident in Sydney Street,'' he
said. ''A man had tried to drive his parked Volvo car into the road from
the kerb when he was in collision with a motor vehicle in front.
''The other car moved backwards, where it's believed to have been in
collision with a man who lives locally and his three-year-old child.
''The father and child were taken to Westminster and Chelsea
Hospital.''
London Ambulance Service said the boy was treated for shock and sent
home.
Sir Nicholas was arrested at a ''nearby address'' and released on
police bail to appear at Chelsea police station next month. He was
breathalysed.
An ambulance service spokesman said: ''The boy was given the once-over
by ambulance crew and then taken to the Chelsea and Westminster
Hospital.
''He displayed the usual symptoms of shock. There was no other patient
requiring treatment.''
A hospital spokesman confirmed that a three-year-old boy arrived at
the accident and emergency unit for treatment with his parents. He said:
''He was not admitted and went home. He had no apparent injuries.''
There was no sign of Sir Nicholas last night at his Battersea home and
no answer on his telephone.
A spokesman for Conservative Central Office said it knew nothing of
the incident and added: ''We would regard something like this as a
personal matter.''

<HEADLINE>Serbs free British hostages. UK troops among 120 released as US jet shot down</HEADLINE>

BRITISH troops were among 120 UN hostages freed in Bosnia last night.
The Serbs appeared to toy with world opinion: releasing some troops
after capturing others and shooting down a US warplane.
The British charge d'affaires in Belgrade confirmed that British
troops were among those released. ''We have confirmation there are some
British soldiers among those freed but we don't know how many,'' Mr Ivor
Roberts said in the Yugoslav capital.
A Foreign Office spokesman added: ''Who they are, how many etc.
remains to be confirmed.''
They were in a convoy of three buses which crossed the border into
Serbia early this morning.
The soldiers also included men from France, Sweden, Denmark, and
Canada, said Jovica Stanisic, the head of Serbia's state security.
He said they were all in good condition apart from two Britons who had
been injured in a accident when their vehicle crashed after they had
been taken hostage.
Belgrade television said Bosnian Serb forces released the 120 on an
appeal from Serb President Slobodan Milosevic.
A presidential statement said the release was ''a sign of readiness to
take a step in the direction of resolving the crisis''. It said the
''first contingent'' had been delivered into the custody of Mr Stanisic.
The announcement followed two days of talks near Belgrade between Mr
Milosevic and UN peace envoy Robert Frasure in an effort to isolate the
Bosnian Serbs and secure the release of almost 400 UN troops. There was
no immediate indication last night whether any of the 34 British troops
being held were among those freed.
Earlier a Serb missile battery destroyed a US F16 Fighting Falcon jet
over north-western Bosnia. The American pilot was later reported to have
been captured by Serb forces.
Two hours before the aircraft was hit, reportedly exploding in midair
25 miles south of the Serb stronghold at Banja Luka, International Red
Cross officials said they been given assurances that the military
hostages taken last weekend would be freed by today.
However, at first the reverse appeared to be taking place. Three
Ukrainian peacekeepers were taken hostage in Gorazde, and 16 French
soldiers were tricked into leaving their post at a weapons depot north
of Sarajevo, and added to the numbers.
Then the Serbs took 45 Canadians from observation posts and brought
them to the police station in Ilijas to join eight other Canadians
already detained there. Ilijas is a town north of Sarajevo inside a
narrow band of contested territory held by Bosnian Serb forces.
UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward said: ''They're taking
with one hand and giving with the other, if in fact they're giving at
all.''
Officials said Bosnian Serbs were sweeping up UN peacekeepers who had
held out against demands to surrender in order to bring all UN posts on
territory they hold under their direct control.
The US fighter was on routine patrol to enforce the UN's ''no-fly''
zone exclusion rule imposed on Bosnia in April 1993, to prevent Serb or
Croatian bombing raids. It was struck by a Soviet-made missile at a
height of about 20,000ft.
The F16 was part of a Nato squadron based at Aviano in Italy. It is
the first American aircraft downed in Bosnia. Britain lost a Sea Harrier
to a missile strike last year.
Mr Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, told reporters in Messina, Sicily,
there would not be a troops withdrawal. He said the other option -- of
UN troops joining forces with the Bosnians against the rebel Serbs --
had also been rejected.
He was in Messina for an EU meeting after discussing the crisis with
Nato forces in Italy.
The rapidly fluctuating situation, apparently being controlled by the
Serb rebels, was highlighted by Mr Hurd when he said Mr Nikola
Kolejevic, vice-president of the self-styled Bosnian Serb Republic, had
denied a report that UN peacekeepers held hostage would be released.
''He stated he did not say what has been reported,'' declared Mr Hurd.
''The situation is simply inconclusive.''
Asked how much longer Britain could tolerate British solders being
held hostage, Mr Hurd said: ''We don't tolerate it. We believe the
hostages should be released at once, unharmed.'' He said efforts to win
their release were constant but he declined to go into details.
The Foreign Secretary hinted that important decisions could be taken
by Defence Ministers meeting today in Paris before the UN Security
Council meets to debate the Bosnian crisis next week in New York.
French officials said the capture of 16 more French soldiers has
highlighted the need for a rapid reaction force to bolster the
lightly-armed peacekeepers.
They said the seizure justified French efforts to get the force set up
at a meeting of Defence Ministers and armed forces chiefs at the Paris
meeting.
President Jacques Chirac, who has vowed that further attacks on French
soldiers would not go unpunished, discussed the proposed multinational
force and the need to revive diplomatic peace moves with President Bill
Clinton on the telephone.
His office said Mr Clinton agreed on both points but there was no
indication that he had changed his mind on contributing to the UN ground
forces.
Washington has said it might commit troops temporarily to help UN
units to regroup to safer positions.
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe earlier called on Western nations to
join the proposed multinational rapid reaction force and reiterated that
a pull-out of French soldiers was possible.
''The latest news is not good. The hardliners are becoming more and
more hard line,'' Mr Juppe said.
He said a rapid-reaction force would protect UN soldiers if they were
attacked. ''It would not be an aggressive force but a protective force.
We can no longer tolerate being scorned and humiliated without
reacting.''
Mr Juppe dismissed a warning by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
that an attempt to free the hostages would end in bloodshed, saying
France was ''accustomed to these kinds of gestures and threats''.
The US Air Force launched a massive search and rescue mission to find
the pilot of the F16. Sources at the Pentagon said the pilot of an
accompanying plane did not see the pilot eject.
President Clinton appeared briefly at the White House to declare his
concern at the loss of an American plane, and to affirm that American
policy in Bosnia would remain firm.
The commander of Nato's southern command said the Alliance was
checking unconfirmed reports that the pilot had been taken prisoner.
''We have unconfirmed reports that the Bosnian Serb army have in fact
recovered the pilot of the F16 shot down earlier today,'' Admiral
Leighton Smith told CNN television from Naples.
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, accompanied by Chief of the Defence
Staff Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge, will urge the allies at the Paris
meeting to form a force directly under UN command.
Four more pieces of British artillery will be flown to Bosnia today,
with vehicles and other equipment as the build-up of the British
armoured reserve protection force increases.
Known as Task Force Alpha, it will have Lynx anti-tank helicopters,
two batteries of light artillery, Warrior armoured fighting vehicles,
Scimitar light tanks, armoured engineers, and support units.
French Defence Minister Charles Millon said a rapid reaction force
might open a permanent land corridor across Bosnia to Sarajevo, secure
Sarajevo airport and guarantee access to Muslim enclaves in Serb-held
areas.
Millon said the force would have about 4000 troops. France and Britain
appeared likely to provide the most soldiers, with the Netherlands and
Spain also contributing.
France's armed forces chief of staff was reported to have tendered his
resignation a week ago after a closed-door row with Chirac over military
policy in Bosnia.
