LABOUR yesterday branded Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley a
member of Mr John Major's ''Bastard Tendency'' in a row over single
mothers.
The attack came from Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar in
the aftermath of a debate sparked earlier this week by right-wing Tory
MP John Redwood, who urged teenage mothers to think seriously about
having their babies adopted.
Mr Dewar said: ''Peter Lilley, too, has made his own particular
contribution to the demonology. His speech suggesting young mothers
became pregnant to jump the housing queue was a classic example of
argument by accusation.
''Like John Redwood he is a founder member of the Prime Minister's
Bastard Tendency. Unlike John Redwood, he is in office and at the heart
of this Government's social policy.''
There were repeated reports that Mr Lilley was again targeting single
parents, he said. Income support, lone parent premium, one-parent
benefit, and maternity payments were all said to be in the firing line.
''Yet what will cutting lone parents' income mean? It will simply
close options,'' said Mr Dewar. ''It will leave parents and children
struggling in even more depressing circumstances. Increased misery is
hardly an effective incentive.''
Mr Dewar said Mr Redwood -- who this week launched a new think-tank,
Campaign 2000 -- needed publicity to survive.

THE Scottish economy should grow by 2.7% both this year and next,
according to an average of independent forecasts included in the latest
half-yearly edition of the Government's Scottish Economic Bulletin.
Industry Minister George Kynoch expressed pleasure at what he called
very respectable rates by historical standards. However, the 1995
forecast is inflated by a 3.5% forecast (made in March by the Fraser of
Allander Institute) which might prove over-ambitious.
The economic review contained in the Bulletin is somewhat dated. All
the data used in it stop at the beginning of June, effectively excluding
first quarter output figures, second quarter export figures, two
business opinion surveys in July, and revisions by two of the
independent forecasters, also in July.
Scottish Office economists admit that the delay in publication is
unsatisfactory and are exploring ways of giving the review a more
contemporary impact.
That said, there is a wealth of other information in the Bulletin
including, this time, an attempt to explain apparent inconsistencies in
the Government's output data from manufacturing industry and independent
figures on Scotland's export performance, produced by the Scottish
Council.
The export data suggests growth of 10% in 1992, 19% in 1993, and 22%
in 1994. But manufacturing output grew by just 0.2%, 2.7% and 5.6% in
the same three years.
Of course the two sets of data measure different things in different
ways. But the Scottish Office has now done more detailed analysis which
reveals that the computer industry, Scotland's largest single exporter,
effectively distorts the picture.
Because around 75% of the components that go into computers assembled
here are imported, and computers account for more than 30% of total
exports, it emerges that the value added by Scottish employees and
companies accounts for less than 50% of the total inputs used to create
our exports.
The Bulletin says the challenge still facing Scottish industry is to
improve the proportion of domestically produced goods and services which
go into exports.

PAISLEY MP Irene Adams is cutting short a holiday in America and
flying home after becoming ill in New York. It is believed she has been
suffering from heat stroke.Temperatures in New York have approached
100F.
Mrs Adams, who has been under considerable strain after publicly
standing up against the drug gangs in Paisley, is on holiday with her
daughter Barbara and son Allan.
The MP's assistant, Mr Bob Macaulay, said at her constituency office
in the town yesterday: ''She didn't feel well and went to hospital for a

KILMARNOCK MP Willie McKelvey, chairman of the all-party Scotch Whisky
Industry Parliamentary Group, yesterday visited United Distillers
packaging plant in the town to witness the first bottling of a premium
Scotch whisky, Johnnie Walker Gold Label.
The plant has recently undergone a #13m modernisation programme. The
young John Walker set up a shop in the town 175 years ago.
As a purveyor of wines and spirits, he began blending Scotch whiskies
to suit customers' individual needs and laid the foundations of the
global business empire which is now part of United Distillers.

<HEADLINE>Mackay sees some sense in federalism</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976830469</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, has backed the
principle of federalism, ironically during a strong defence of the
Union.
In an interview at his home in the Highlands, Lord Mackay gave his
personal views on the constitutional question and the family unit.
He said: ''I think it would be a retrograde step for Scotland and
England to separate. At this stage in our history, we have had this
quite long period of union with England and I do not myself believe that
destroying that union would do anything to help the Scottish people.
''I believe the way forward for Scotland is to build on what we have,
rather than to turn round and go back on it. If England and Scotland
were in real competition, outwith the Union, I don't think it would be
to Scotland's advantage.
''I don't say that Scotland couldn't survive but I don't think it
could survive better and that is what counts.''
However, he endorsed the principle of federalism, adding: ''Now, if it
was a federal system we were talking about, that might be all right
where you had a group of equal states which had a central parliament
that legislated for them all.
''The trouble about that system in the United Kingdom is that one
nation group is so much larger than the other three -- Northern Ireland,
Wales, and Scotland. In the central parliament, England would be bound
to dominate.''
Lord Mackay also made a strong plea for the return of marriage as the
''fashionable'' thing to do rather than the present-day trend for young
people to set up home without a long-term commitment.
He said: ''The family unit is an important one and loyalty to the
family requires commitment from parents as well as children. We should
do everything we can to strengthen it.
''I have been putting proposals forward on divorce and I haven't come
out with them without a good deal of thought and discussion -- but it is
very difficult.''

THE Scottish Labour Party is likely to disagree with Britain's largest
unions over what size a future Scottish Parliament should be.
Unison has written to Labour backing proposals that a parliament,
which Labour pledges to set up if it wins the next election, should have
145 MPs.
That is what the Transport and General Workers Union has proposed and
there is considerable support from the Scottish Liberal Democrats.
Others in the Labour Party believe the figure should be 112 MPs. That
would help Labour gain an overall majority in the parliament but would
limit attempts to make the parliament more representative of all the
parties.
A compromise will probably be decided upon before the executive of the
Scottish Labour Party takes a decision on September 9.
The Constitutional Convention, the all-party group overseeing
proposals for a parliament, meets less than three weeks after that, to
agree a final scheme.
The 145-member scheme involves 73 constituency MPs, based on
Westminster seats but with separate seats for Orkney and Shetland, plus
a further 72 members elected from regional lists, based on European
constituencies, to top up parties so that there is a form of
proportional representation and also to equal out the genders as much as
possible.
Mr Bob Thomson, Unison's associate Scottish secretary, argued
yesterday: ''A parliament of 145 members would not be excessively large.
It would only be slightly bigger than the 142 member assembly as agreed
by the Westminster Parliament in the 1978 Scotland Act.''
However, some Labour officials argue that with Westminster having only
650 members, 145 in Scotland is excessive and could lead to the charge
of politicians simply trying to get their snouts in the trough.
Unison will put up a tough fight for 145 within the Scottish Labour
Party executive where it has four representatives, plus as least another
three elected from elsewhere who are Unison members.
It will not accept 112 but as one Unison member on the Labour
executive conceded: ''We are a trade union and a trade union is used to
negotiations.''

THE announcement by Mr John Patten, former Education Secretary, and
Sir Jerry Wiggin, a senior Tory and former Minister, that they are to
retire at the next General Election brings to 42 the number of
Conservative MPs who have declared their intention of standing down.
Several more are expected to do so, and another significant number are
abandoning their present constituencies to look for safer ones at the
next election -- branded by Labour as ''the chicken run''.
Some marginal Tory seats, such as Basildon, have been made virtually
unwinnable for the occupants by boundary changes. In others the
incumbents have calculated their chances of holding on and have decided
to seek pastures new.
A decision is expected soon from Tory Party chairman Dr Brian
Mawhinney, who has to choose between the greater part of his
Peterborough seat, made more marginal by boundary changes, and moving
into the new seat of North-west Cambridgeshire which includes part of
his present constituency.
A factor thought to be influencing some Tory MPs is the tighter
restrictions on MPs' ability to earn from parliamentary consultancy work
which are likely to be imposed in the next Parliament as a result of the
Nolan Committee report on standards in public life.
Current opinion polls indicate that a Tory MP with a majority under
2500 stands little chance of keeping his seat, and majorities of 5000 or
under look almost as precarious.
Some 20 Labour MPs have also said they will quit. A few others are
believed to be delaying an announcement to try to block selection of
their successor through women-only shortlists. Three Liberal Democrats
are also to stand down.
Mr Patten, MP for Oxford East and Abingdon, with a slim 3539 majority,
insisted he was going for family reasons.
He was sacked from the Cabinet a year ago after a stormy two years at
education, when he clashed with teachers and governors over reforms.
Sir Jerry Wiggin was embroiled in a sleaze row after admitting having
used the name of a colleague, Mr Sebastian Coe, to promote an amendment
to legislation in which he had a financial interest.
The Tory MPs who have announced their retirement are: Michael Alison
(Selby), Kenneth Baker (Mole Valley), John Biffen (North Shropshire),
John Butcher (Coventry South West), Sir Kenneth Carlisle (Lincoln), Paul
Channon (Southend West), Sir Julian Critchley (Aldershot), Sir Anthony
Durant (Reading West), Dudley Fishburn (Kensington), Sir Anthony Grant
(Cambridge South West), Sir John Hannam (Exeter), David Harris (St
Ives), Sir Terence Higgins (Worthing), Sir Peter Hordern (Horsham), Sir

(Whitney), Michael Jopling (Westmoreland and Lonsdale), Dame Elaine
Kellett-Bowman (Lancaster), Dame Jill Knight (Birmingham Edgbaston), Sir
Michael Marshall (Arundel), Sir Patrick McNair Wilson (New Forest), Sir
David Mitchell (Hampshire North West), Sir Hector Monro (Dumfries), Sir
Fergus Montgomery (Altrincham and Sale), Sir Cranley Onslow (Woking),
Sir Geoffrey Pattie (Chertsey and Walton), John Patten (Oxford West and
Abingdon), Tim Renton (Mid Sussex), Wyn Roberts (Conwy), Sir Tim
Sainsbury (Hove), Sir Giles Shaw (Pudsey), Roger Sims (Chislehurst), Sir
Trevor Skeet (Bedfordshire North), Sir Keith Speed (Ashford), Sir James
Spicer (Dorset West), Patrick Thompson (Norwich North), Peter Thurnham
(Bolton North East), Neville Trotter (Tynemouth), George Walden
(Buckingham), John Ward (Poole), Sir Jerry Wiggin (Weston-super-Mare).
Retiring Labour MPs are: Jeremy Bray (Motherwell South), Jack Thompson
(Wansbeck), Don Dixon (Jarrow), Roland Boyes (Houghton &amp; Washington),
Max Madden (Bradford West), Peter Hardy (Wentworth), Harold Walker
(Doncaster Central), Terry Patchett (Barnsley East), James Callaghan

Hattersley (Birmingham Sparkbrook), Peter Shore (Bethnal Green &amp;

<HEADLINE>EXCLUSIVE: McCoist plans his career after Rangers. Super Ally ready to move into the world of sports agents</HEADLINE>

WALTER Smith shook his head in disbelief and John Greig heaved a weary
sigh. Ally McCoist, aka Super Ally, Coisty, and The Greatest Living
Ranger, never fails to surprise people.
He did precisely that last night when he indicated he could ''switch
camps'' and move into the world of sports agency.
''Given the chance, I could be the best agent in the country,'' he
said, ''and I have considered forging out on my own in that sphere. The
greater part of my life has been spent in professional football and I
know everyone of any significance in the game.
''I don't think there could be many better qualified than myself to
look after the needs of people involved in sport.''
McCoist also is intrigued by the rapid developments taking place in
the world of rugby union and feels he could play a major part in
securing the correct deals for those who are about to relinquish their
amateur status. ''A whole new world is opening up in that sport and soon
players will be moving from club to club, continent to continent.''
The striker, whose goal which won the European Championship qualifying
tie against Greece at Hampden the other night could be the most crucial
in the entire series, was addressing his public via the media and he
stressed that he will go out while still at the top of his profession.
''Palmerston Park on a regular basis is not for me,'' he said.
A press conference had been called yesterday at Ibrox, although no-one
was quite certain who sanctioned such a gathering.
The suspicion was McCoist, who is allowed more leeway than just about
any other player on the planet, felt it would be appropriate. ''He's
called a what?'' asked Smith on return from training.
''Ally McCoist has called a press conference? Here?''
The Rangers manager, who all these years had thought he was the one
who called press conferences, disappeared to have words with the man
himself and returned to say McCoist knew nothing of the meeting.
The player himself appeared, shrugging his shoulders and behaving like
one of the Hollywood stars of old who were adept at feigning
astonishment whenever they entered a room to be confronted by a battery
of photographers.
''You've all come to see me? What can I say?''
Immediately, he proceeded to say a great deal, talking about his
dramatic goal, the heartache of two years of injury, and his fear of the
day the balls stop hitting the net and the cameras focus on someone
else.
McCoist has many interests, many friends, but his appearance as a
substitute for Scotland reminded him the thing he loves doing most is
playing football.
He lives to score and his sixteenth international goal gave him great
satisfaction, although, he says, it will not be enough to ensure his
place in the Rangers side to play Anorthosis Famagusta in Cyprus next
midweek.
''With all respect, I think it is fair to say that getting into
Rangers' first team is slightly harder than getting a game for Scotland
at the minute,'' he said. ''However, while I enjoyed the goal and can't
begin to describe the feeling, because it was like the release of two
years' frustration, I am not sitting here for a minute thinking that I
have turned the corner.
''Probably I'm just hitting the bend of the corner and I have a long
way to go yet in terms of fitness and sharpness. The last two years have
been the most difficult I've ever known and after I broke a leg playing
for Scotland I then had two operations, a hernia and an ankle, and two
torn muscles.
''There were times when I was down, and when I pulled a calf muscle in
the first game of the season against Motherwell last year I though to
myself, 'when is all this going to end', but that's when people close to
you really help.''
Smith had warned the conversation might get become a touch emotional.
''He'll come in here and thank everyone for having helped him through
these last two years. In fact, he'll probably have you all in tears,''
the manager said.
The football family, which is very close knit, can also be an
extremely sarcastic one, but McCoist is appreciative of his time in the
game and said: ''My dread is the day when I can't play any more, you
now, the day when I won't be able to walk into the dressing room at
Ibrox and enjoy the banter.''
The end of the line, he believes, is a long way off yet and it is his
immediate aim to regain all of his sharpness and start scoring for
Rangers and Scotland again.
Although Craig Brown is slightly cautious about qualification, it
would seem Scotland, who play Finland at Hampden next month, will go
through and, certainly, McCoist believes the place in England has been
more or less secured.
''We would want to beat the Finns, but a draw would be all right,
too,'' he said. ''Naturally, I hope to be part of the next squad.''
When most football supporters think of McCoist they think of someone
who was born to enjoy more than one man's fair share of luck, but that
isn't quite true, either.
McCoist makes much of his luck in that he has a sixth sense which
directs him to the right place at the right time, and he pointed out:
''I hear people saying that so and so may be a better striker because he
gets three chances and takes two of them. Well, my argument is that I
get six chances and score three.
''So what do you want? A player who scores two or one who gets three?
That's my logic, anyway, and I've done not too badly on the strength of
it.''
He had just about convinced everyone when the door opened and Greig
entered.
''Can I borrow someone's pen? I want Ally to choose six numbers for my
lottery ticket.''
The McCoist smile was back in place, bright as a beacon and ready
again to tackle the world.

MARNIE McGuire is certainly a rarity in golf. The 26-year-old New
Zealander comes from impeccable Scottish stock -- her father from
Motherwell and mother from Strathaven emigrated three decades ago -- yet
she and three Australians are the only caucasians on the Japanese LPGA
Tour, to which in three years she has settled contentedly and with
success.
Winner of the British Amateur championship in 1986, McGuire has had
victories in Japan in each of the last two seasons and with 43,056,500
yen (or more believably #28,700) is currently third on the money list.
In hot sunshine at Woburn yesterday in the first round of the Weetabix
Women's British Open the Auckland-born player made her first serious
impression in Europe.
A score of 68, five under par over the 6257-yard Duke's course -- made
hard and fast running by the recent drought and in colour, if not in
texture, bearing a decided resemblance to the sponsor's product -- gave
McGuire a share of second place with Marie-Laure de Lorenzi of France
and Australia's Shani Waugh, a stroke behind the defending champion,
Sweden's Lotta Neumann.
Three substantial putts and two of no distance provided birdies in an
outward half of 21, smudged only by three putts at the short fifth. The
rest for McGuire was a holding operation by the slightly-built player,
whose clothing affiliation reinforces the Scottish connection. Her shirt
carries the name Musselburgh, in fact that of a Japanese manufacturer.
Neumann began her five-and-a-half-hour round as if intent on holding
her title. She pitched dead at the first, also birdied the next two, and
in completing her score of 67 included in her seven gains four at long
holes which the run on the ball made agreeably vulnerable. They yielded
Laura Davies the only four birdies she had in her 74, a severe famine in
contrast to recent feasts.
Swing changes made in the 1993 took some time to work their way
through de Lorenzi's elegant method. The Frenchwoman won the first of
this season's events, her sixteenth victory, and third-place finishes in
Ireland and Scotland recently gave her the confidence to trust her
driver. Her most rewarding shot, however, was the 35-foot chip she hold
for an eagle 3 from behind the fourth green.
Waugh, who also almost exclusively relied on her driver, had two
fortunate breaks, shots at the long tenth and thirteenth holes passing
unhindered through trees. At the former, she made the fifth of her seven
birdies on quick greens to which her Australian upbringing accustomed
her more than the shortening effect of the conditions.
Elsewhere, Annika Sorenstam, the US Open champion, and Davies,
respectively on the European order of merit first and second and on the
American equivalent sixth and third, had contrasting experiences as they
began the tournament which would give the Swede her fourth success this
season and Davies her sixth.
Sorenstam put struggles on the first nine holes behind her in her 70,
but Davies took four strokes more and she may have left herself too much
to do. After winning in Ireland she began the Scottish Open with 72,
seven strokes off the lead, and could not catch up and having just won
in Wales, again to give seven strokes of a start could prove as
insurmountable.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
67 -- L Neumann (Sweden).
68 -- S Waugh (Australia), M-L de Lorenzi (France), M McGuire (New
Zealand).
69 -- K Webb (Australia), J Forbes, L Brooky (New Zealand), P Hammel
(USA).
70 -- A Rogers, A Sorenstam (Sweden), M Spencer-Devlin (USA), S
Prosser, C Pierce, A Gottmo (Sweden).
71 -- L Irvine, S Croce (Italy), J McGill (USA), E Orley
(Switzerland), N Lopez (USA), E Klein (USA).
72 -- N Fink (Austria), P Wright, K Orum (Denmark), H Kobayashi
(Japan), D Barnard, J Morley, B Burton (USA), J Geddes (USA).
Other scores included: 73 -- A Nicholas, 74 -- L Davies, G Stewart, C
Matthew. 76 -- D Reid. 77 -- K Marshall. 79 -- C Panton-Lewis.

THERE was a relaxed air about Scotland manager Craig Brown yesterday
as he surveyed the immediate footballing future of his country. You
could sense that while Brown would not make plans for the European
Championship finals -- because points are still required to make
participation certain -- he knew that the most difficult work has been
done.
Indeed, it could well be that a draw with Finland, followed by victory
over San Marino, would be enough to take us to England next summer.
Brown will not see things that way, however. He will look for two more
victories before he begins his planning although he did say yesterday:
''I now believe that we will qualify. I would be very disappointed if we
were to falter at this stage.''
Brown admits that his team are short on skill in certain areas but
knows that there are other attributes they have in abundance.
Yesterday he mentioned professionalism, fighting spirit, commitment,
and team understanding: ''The purists may want to see superior skills
but they are not readily available. What we do possess are honest,
hard-working professionals mixed with several players of proven ability.
So far the mix has worked.''
It has worked to such an extent that the Greeks, who reached the last
World Cup finals, were sent homewards the other night to think again of
the next World Cup qualifying matches, knowing that the European
Championships now seem to be outwith their reach.
And it has worked even better for Brown who, along the way, has
managed to unearth fresh talent, unused at international level until he
took over from Andy Roxburgh.
Colin Hendry, of Blackburn, has become of huge importance at the heart
of the defence as has Spurs' Colin Calderwood.
Chelsea's Craig Burley, despite a couple of rash tackles, is a
maturing talent who moves up and down the right flank tirelessly and
still finds his way into the penalty box.
Also, Celtic's Tosh McKinlay slotted in as if he was a regular member
of the squad instead of having joined up on the morning of the game.
Brown knows that because of the men who have emerged while others have
been unavailable, he now has real competition for places in the Scotland
set-up.
It is a happy position for the manager as he contemplates an invasion
next summer across the Border.
Rangers goalkeeper Andy Goram could be back in place for the match
with the Finns next month. Brown would not be drawn into any debate on
the man who called off from the game with Greece. However, he stressed:
''I will select the men who are in form. There will be three goalkeepers
named and the fittest and best will be there.''
It is clear that he has immense respect for the veteran Jim Leighton,
who made one superb stop in the second-half against Greece, but,
diplomatically, he pointed out that Goram had been equally effective for
his club in the European Cup tie against Cypriot side Anorthosis
Famagusta a week earlier.

* The Herald's man in England, STEVE TONGUE, looks at the players who
will be making the news south of the Border when the new Premiership
season kicks off.
AFTER English football's walk on the wild side in season 1994-5, how
Lancaster Gate would love a season of tranquility and a quiet run-up to
the European Championship finals next summer.
It won't happen, of course. Bad publicity is already guaranteed from
the forthcoming court case involving Bruce Grobbelaar, Hans Segers, and
John Fashanu, whatever the verdict.
The Premier League's 'bungs' inquiry team are due to deliver another
report to follow the one that did for George Graham, who is still minded
to appeal against his ban from the game.
Eric Cantona, having famously made his mark on a spectator last
January, will be a marked man himself if, and when, he finally returns
to Manchester United's colours. And, however restrained the thuggish
element among the nation's football followers may be, the feeling is
that there will be ample opportunity for them to do their worst once
thousands of fans from the Continent (and Scotland?) begin to arrive
next June.
All the more important, then, that players and managers set an example
with principled behaviour and positive play. There is certainly no
shortage of performers with expensive reputations to live up to
following a summer of unprecedented spending.
For all the anxiety generated by that spree, notably among the
players' union, the influx of foreign players, in particular, has
increased interest and anticipation.
Like last season, there are four or five teams with genuine
championship prospects, and, while it would have seemed unthinkable a
year ago that two of them, Blackburn and Arsenal, would now be under new
management, that is no reason to discount either club.
Seeing Kenny Dalglish sitting on the front bench at Wembley for
Blackburn's Charity Shield match last Sunday was a literal illustration
that he will not be taking a back seat.
The club is sensibly moving towards a Continental system of
delegation, but Ray Harford will certainly make use of all his
predecessor's knowledge and experience.
Defeat by Everton last weekend was a useful reminder, however, that
nothing comes easily to reigning champions, and with a minimum of six
Champions' League matches to distract them, the Lancashire side could
easily fall between two stools.
Manchester United, following their runners-up double last May, have
suffered a traumatic summer, losing Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, Andrei
Kanchelskis almost certainly, and very nearly Cantona, too.
Alex Ferguson has spent so much time dealing with that quartet that
promised signings have not materialised. A cup of some sort next spring
looks more likely than a third championship in four seasons.
Fitting a complex individualist into a team pattern is a problem
Liverpool face as well after paying Nottingham Forest a record #8.5m for
Stan Collymore.
There is a lot of talent at Anfield and, if Collymore does blend in
harmoniously, on and off the pitch, Roy Evans' side will be up with the
best.
The England captain, David Platt, will contribute guile and goals to
an Arsenal midfield previously lacking in both. Paul Merson has fully
regained his appetite and Dennis Bergkamp's class will tell, as long as
he quickly learns to play closer together with Ian Wright, rather than
dropping off and leaving the latter isolated.
Graham's replacement, Bruce Rioch, will stand no nonsense and Arsenal
ought to be in the top three.
So should Newcastle, who looked formidable last Saturday in winning
2-0 at Tottenham in Gary Mabbutt's testimonial match. Kevin Keegan
responded to last season's disappointments (missing out on a place in
Europe after leading the Premiership for four months) by spending #14m
on forwards Les Ferdinand and David Ginola, full back Warren Barton, and
Trinidadian goalkeeper Shaka Hislop.
Leeds, Chelsea (with Ruud Gullit as sweeper), Forest and, perhaps,
Everton should be among the chasing pack and the cup contenders.

ABERDEEN yesterday launched their share issue and left manager Roy
Aitken in no doubt that he must break Rangers' monopoly.
The move to go public by selling two million shares is expected to
raise around #3.5m, and most of the money will go towards buying new
players.
But Aberdeen chairman Ian Donald, whose board has underwritten the
launch for #750,000 to ensure there is no repeat of the Hearts share
flop, insisted: ''We must be winning trophies and championships.
''Everything done over the last five years here has been geared
towards providing success on the field. The share issue is a unique
opportunity for our fans to be a part of the club with full voting
rights.
''I believe it will kick-start this club into a new, exciting era.''
Aitken has been promised funds immediately to help make Aberdeen a
power once again, but he stressed: ''If the right player to improve the
squad becomes available I will bring him in, but it may be wiser to wait
and see exactly what money is available to me after the share launch is
completed.
''I look for three things in a player -- professionalism, quality and
reliability. I must be sure that any player who comes in will improve on
what is already here.''
The Pittodrie club have offered several different share packages,
ranging from #455 to #10,000 blocks with bank loan facilities available.
This will entitle supporters to a variety of discounts and facilities in
return. The share launch will close at the end of September.

FORMER world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson has shown the world just
who is boss in his new multi-million-dollar heavyweight operation.
And if Don King had a forelock, instead of his trademark shock of grey
hair, he would probably have touched it at the MGM Grand's gathering of
fighting and media men, camped in Las Vegas for tomorrow's comeback
appearance against the Boston ''Hurricane'', Peter McNeeley.
Twice Tyson interrupted King's usual noisy and amusing rhetoric, and
the king of promoters admitted: ''I shall serve the master with my
heart, my soul, and my mind. Everything righteous and just, I will do.''
Tyson sat expressionless for almost two hours, flanked by his equally
poker-faced co-managers John Horne and Rory Holloway, as King held
court. But when King announced he would be paying him #16m plus #300,000
training expenses. Tyson protested: ''Don't tell 'em my business, man.''
When Tyson was occupying the microphone, he sharply told King not to
interrupt him.
The man who converted to Islam during his Indiana incarceration for
rape said: ''I'm ready to fight. This is my calling. This is what I do.
''I'm back. My religion is Islam. It's a way of life. It's a way of
maturity. I'm more conscious of my involvement in life.''
Then came a verbal blast at a New York fight writer. Dealing with the
journalist's question, Tyson accused him of being ''a character-killer''
and said of the media: ''These guys did a number on me for three years.
People wanted to see me crumble, but I'm not going to let it happen.''
Later, on the Larry King show on CNN, he again showed resentment at
his press treatment during the three-year period when the other
contenders slugged it out, only to bring about the tangle of the current
world heavyweight scene.

ENGLAND vice-captain Alec Stewart has ruled himself out of the
deciding sixth Cornhill Test against the West Indies at The Oval next
week.
His right index finger, broken twice last winter and again in the
third Test this summer, has still not healed sufficiently to let him
risk it in the showdown on his home ground.
''It's frustrating,'' he admitted yesterday. ''It's improved
considerably -- in fact, it is the best it's been for a long time.
''But the sixth Test is such a big game and you have to be able to
know you can go in there and complete the job, and I can't afford to
take the risk.''
The news is not good for Surrey, either. They have won two
championship matches in his absence, but the batting needs Stewart's
experience. He said: ''I don't know when I will be able to play for
Surrey. It probably needs another couple of weeks to make sure.
* MIKE Gatting spearheaded Middlesex's bid to go top of the county

THE Andrei Kanchelskis affair took a new turn last night with the
Football Association poised to intervene.
Manchester United had cancelled the Russian internationalist's #5m
transfer to Everton after a dispute with his previous club, Shakter
Donetsk, over a #1.14m sell-on fee.
That left the winger, United's top scorer last season, in no man's
land and Everton furious, demanding the matter be settled through
arbitration.
Last night Everton issued a brief statement through their solicitor
and director Keith Tamlin. It read: ''In accordance with the rules of
the FA, Everton has referred its differences with Manchester United to
the FA for arbitration.''
''This will now lead to an arbitration hearing. This has been
confirmed by the FA.''
FA spokesman Mike Parry agreed that this was the case, but no-one at
United was available for comment.
Having come on as substitute in Russia's 6-0 European Championship win
over Finland in Helsinki on Wednesday, Kanchelskis flew back into
England yeserday and said he would be training with Everton today.
He is still registered with United, but has said he will not play for
the club again as long as Alex Ferguson is manager.
Tottenham manager Gerry Francis, who was unsuccessful with a bid for
the winger last month, admitted he was closely monitoring the situation.
Meanwhile, Wales finally settled their managerial problems by
appointing Bobby Gould. The former Wimbledon, West Brom and Coventry
boss agreed a two-and-a-half year deal, taking him up to the end of the
1998 World Cup qualification series.

DAMON Hill set the fastest lap yesterday, the final day of Formula One
testing at Silverstone, but his time of 1min 28.93sec was almost 0.8sec
slower than the best of the week -- by departing Williams team-mate
David Coulthard.
The Scot's future remained undecided after Williams announced that
they had signed Canadian Jacques Villeneuve to partner Hill next season.
Benetton, Ferrari -- who have signed world champion Michael Schumacher
in a two-year deal that could cost #32m -- and McLaren have been tipped.
But Coulthard's manager, Tim Wright, said: ''We're not in any hurry.
Coulthard's future is secure and he will be in a seat with a top-four
team.
''I am not saying it will necessarily be Ferrari, but I think a
Schumacher-Coulthard partnership is a dream team. If he is going to be
the greatest driver, he has to put himself up against the greatest.''

AC MILAN'S Dutch internationalist Marco van Basten finally admitted
defeat yesterday in his battle against a chronic ankle injury that had
kept him out of action for more than two years when he was forced to
retire.
The three-times European footballer of the year told a news
conference: ''The news is brief -- I've decided to quit.''
He explained: ''I took the decision after speaking to my doctor in
Belgium two weeks ago when we realised the situation with my ankle is
exactly the same as it was a year ago.''
Van Basten began his career at Ajax Amsterdam and won the Dutch title
three times, also helping them to the Cup-winners' Cup in 1987 before
joining AC Milan.
His partnership with compatriots Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard
powered the Italian club to European Cup successes in 1989 and 1990. The
trio also inspired Holland to their European championship triumph of
1988.
Van Basten has not played since the May 1993 European Cup final in
Munich when Milan lost 1-0 to Olympique Marseille.
That appearance was part of an abortive three-match comeback following
an operation on his troublesome right ankle in December 1992.
More surgery followed but the specialists were unable to repair the
damage done by more than a decade of heavy tackles from defenders
determined to halt the skilful star.
Milan have asked the Dutchman to stay on and work with them in an
off-the-field capacity but van Basten said he had not yet made up his
mind.

<HEADLINE>All Black captain kicks rebel circus into touch. Paris meeting must face professionalism issue</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DEREK DOUGLAS CHIEF RUGBY WRITER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>46</PAGE>

<TEXT>
THE International Board meeting in Paris next week must come to a
positive decision on professionalism otherwise its future will be in
serious doubt, Scottish Rugby Union IB representative Freddie McLeod
declared yesterday.
McLeod also pronounced the rebel World Rugby Corporation and its
attempt to hijack the game not quite dead and buried, but certainly
''limping heavily towards the exit.''
Details of the WRC plan to buy the world's top 1000 players, and then
to franchise its professional game to traditional administrators like
the Scottish Rugby Union, were revealed yesterday in The Herald.
The WRC scheme was dealt another blow yesterday as All Black captain
Sean Fitzpatrick signed a contract with the NZRFU and the expectation is
that most of his World Cup team-mates are set to follow suit. WRC have
already failed to sign the Springboks and the Australian Test squad, and
this means that the coup attempt, which to be successful had to sign up
all of the world's top players, seems virtually certain to fail.
Fitzpatrick said ''99%'' of the squad which reached the final of the
World Cup earlier this year would officially declare their allegiance to
the NZRFU today. ''We're thrilled this has been resolved. It has been
very stressful, both for the players and the administrators,'' he said.
With the likely demise of the rebel circus, the focus is now back upon
the traditional unions with a vengeance. The Scottish Rugby Union --
alone of the northern hemisphere administrations -- has already shown
its hand by declaring that it is ready to embrace professionalism with
all its ramifications, like contracted players, when the IB meets in
Paris for three days next week.
It would be a major shock if the IB did not concur, but yesterday
McLeod said: ''We don't yet know what is going to happen. A number of
people are still very frightened of the word professionalism. The
pay-for-play situation alarms a lot of people. However, I would hope
that something positive will come from the meeting. If it doesn't, then
I would think that the future of the International Board is in very
serious doubt.
''If the issue is fudged again, then the Board would have absolutely
no credibility with the players.''
McLeod added that the game's administrators had taken the WRC threat
seriously. ''Much of what was in The Herald today was not entirely new
to us and suffice to say that we did not treat the threat lightly,
because it had amazing connotations, not least of which was the
ludicrous position whereby they would franchise our game back to us.''
The WRC plan was said to be bankrolled by Australian media tycoon
Kerry Packer and was fronted by fellow countryman Ross Turnbull.
McLeod said: ''We know Mr Turnbull. He was at one time vice-president
of the Australian RFU and chairman of New South Wales. Then they parted
company. I think anybody who knew him would have been extremely wary of
becoming involved.''
Yesterday WRC said that it would now work with the rugby
establishment, without explaining how. McLeod said: ''I would be
interested to know just exactly what this means because, knowing the
history of Mr Turnbull's relationship with the Australian union, I would
be amazed if this were to happen.''
As part of the deal which keeps the Australian Test squad with the
ARFU, player-representatives will sit on union committees. McLeod said
the SRU was unlikely to follow suit but it was not outwith the bounds of
possibility that a mechanism could be put in place which would take
account of any player concerns.
''So far as players coming on to the committee is concerned, I'm not
sure if that is the correct way to go,'' he said. ''It might be better
if there was a communications group involving the players. We had a very
good meeting with some of the international players earlier this week on
the professionalism issue, and the players have indicated that they are
keen to ensure that misunderstandings do not happen.
''Maybe we have to find a proper vehicle for communicating with them.
It might not be practical for players to sit on the general committee.
They are there to play rugby at the top of the game and, in any case, we
have tried to involve recently retired players in the non-playing side
and, for one reason and another, they are often too busy elsewhere to
become involved.''
Meanwhile, Will Carling has been drafted on to the working party
negotiating a cash deal with the RFU following the withdrawal of Rob
Andrew and Brian Moore.
England captain Carling has joined Tim Rodber and Mike Catt on the
team attempting to treble the squad's income for promotional activities
from #16,000 to #50,000 amid reports that Andrew and Moore had withdrawn
because they had lost the confidence of the players.
RFU secretary Tony Hallett said: ''Moore and Andrew are unable to take
on this task any more. It is not the case that either has lost
confidence of the squad. But Carling will take up the reins and we are
trying to get the deal completed as quickly as possible.''

ALL Black wing Jonah Lomu, who is being chased by Leeds rugby league
club, is still undecided whether to continue playing rugby union or to
switch to the 13-a-side code.
All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick yesterday signed contracts with the
rugby establishment and has stated that the majority of the New Zealand
World Cup squad would do likewise by the weekend.
But Debbie Tawse, Lomu's agent, said she had been ''frustrated'' by
negotiations with the New Zealand Rugby Football Union.
She said: ''He wants to continue in rugby and if we can get a fair
deal from rugby, he'll stay, or we'll pursue other options we've got.''
The NZRFU's current offer to All Blacks is about $150,000 (#100,000)
per year, but offers from Leeds and Australian rugby league side Sydney
Bulldogs are reported to be much higher. Tawse declined to say what
offer from the NZRFU would satisfy Lomu.
In an interview with Rugby World magazine Lomu reveals that money is
not what motivates him. He says: ''I'm just like any other 20-year-old.
I want to meet lots of people and travel the world and play rugby. I'm
not bothered about the money -- that's not why I do it.
''Fame is highly overrated. I could do without it all really. It makes
me feel very uncomfortable.''

A SNAIL'S pace -- by ocean racing standards -- continues to prevail on
the first leg of the Teacher's Around Britain Challenge, with the 10
identical Five Nations' yachts managing to cover only 80 miles in the
past 30 hours.
The biggest lottery of all remains during the night, when the wind
always dies to nothing. The fleet, which at one point was spread over a
nine-mile stretch, was compressed to within a two-mile radius again
yesterday after a fretful night in the doldrums.
Scotland's Jon Fitzgerald, Chris Nichol, and their crew on Glendronach
had climbed four places up to second yesterday evening, while the second
Scottish boat, Lord Inverforth (Paul Jeffes and Chris Owen), remained
fifth -- but the boats placed fourth down to ninth were virtually
parallel off Start Point by Plymouth.
The organisers' latest plan is now to finish this leg at Land's End --
about 75 miles away -- leaving the fleet to motor to their original
landfall, Cardiff.
Biggest problem for all the skippers is that most of their mobile
phones -- the only sure means of secret communication between skippers
-- are not functioning. Results:
1, Dream of Erin (David Harte, Ireland) 238 miles to finish; 2,
Glendronach (Jon Fitzgerald, Scotland) 239; 3, Positively Belfast
(Dickie Gomes, Ireland) 239; 4, Spirit of Hartlepool (David Allan
Williams, England) 241; 5, Lord Inverforth (Paul Jeffes, Scotland); 6,
Celtic Dragon (Colin Lyons, Wales) 241; 7, Pride of Cardiff (Richard
Tudor, Wales) 241; 8, Coeur de Paris (Didier Nicholas, France) 241; 9,
Belle Helene (J P Saliou, France) 241; 10, Spirit of London Docklands
(John Horn, England) 272.

FRANCE'S Mary Pierce humiliated Martina Hingis 6-0, 6-0 yesterday,
taking just 40 minutes to dispatch the Swiss teenager and advance to the
quarter-finals of the Canadian Open women's championships in Toronto.
Pierce, the fifth-seeded Australian Open champion, dominated from the
beginning, hammering winners from the baseline. By the second set,
Hingis looked grim and appeared like she couldn't wait to get off the
court.
In other third-round play, seventh-seeded German Anke Huber outlasted
Romianian Irina Spirlea, the No.16 seed, 1-6, 6-3, 7-5. Her reward is a
quarter-final date with joint-top seed Monica Seles today.
No.6 Gabriela Sabatini, of Argentina, looked impressive in defeating
Japan's Yone Kamio 6-1, 6-0.
BRITAIN'S Miles Maclagan reached the quarter-finals of the ATP
Challenger tennis event in The Bronx, New York, yesterday.
The No.4 seed from Scotland avenged a defeat at last week's Binghamton
Challenger to beat Australian James Sekulov 6-4, 6-2. He now takes on
fifth seed Hicham Arazi, of Morocco.

Strathgryffe 6, Newlands 3 (Strathgryffe names first): D Morrison and

DEAN Robertson, the 25-year-old former Walker Cup player who is in the
midst of an outstanding rookie year on the European Tour, was one behind
leader Ronan Rafferty after an opening five-under-par 66 in the Chemapol
Czech Open yesterday at Marianske Lazne.
The Gleddoch-based Scot, a former Scottish amateur champion, fired six
birdies and only one bogey. His iron shots were so accurate he had many
more birdie chances, but said: ''I'm not under any pressure here this
week. I'm not in the Ryder Cup running and I'm just looking forward to
playing well and having a good time.''
Robertson is currently No.49 in the Volvo Order of Merit with winnings
of #81,776 -- including a second place finish in the Jersey Open -- but
is #17,000 behind Swede Michael Jonzon at No.33 in the race to be top
tour school graduate. Jonzon shot 74 yesterday.
Also on 66 was Sam Torrance, the current European No.1 who is assured
of his eighth successive Ryder Cup spot, and there were six other Scots
in the sub-par zone -- Sandy Lyle and Gary Orr (both 68), Ross Drummond
(69), and Paul Lawrie, Gordon Brand Jr, and Stephen McAllister (70).
Rafferty, joint second in the Austrian Open last Sunday, is only No.43
in the Ryder Cup points table but if he carried off the first prize of
#125,000 here he would be right back in contention. He would also clinch
a place in the Irish Dunhill Cup team.
Rafferty, who had seven birdies and only one bogey on his card, played
with Torrance, who has his eyes fixed on finishing top of the order of
merit. ''I've been second once and third twice but never first,'' he
said. ''I'm in front at the moment and if I could win here that would be
fantastic for me.''
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
65 -- R Rafferty.

GRANITE CITY CLASSIC
LETHAM Grange professional David Scott won the #12,500 Granite City
Classic at Hazlehead yesterday. The 32-year-old former PGA Cup player
equalled the course record seven-under-par 63 set by Colin Gillies in
Wednesday's opening round to beat Glencorse's Colin Brooks by three
strokes.
Scott birdied the first three holes to move him into contention after
his opening 66. He reached the turn in 30 and four further birdies on
the back nine -- including the last where he rattled in an eight-footer
-- more than compensated for his bunker-induced bogey 5 at the 430-yard
fourteenth.
A double-bogey 6 at the 309-yard eighth blighted Brooks' chances.
Leading final totals:
129 -- D Scott (Letham Grange) 66, 63 (#2025).
132 -- C Brooks (Glencorse) 65, 67 (#1500).
133 -- D Thomson (Kings Links) 65, 68 (#1200).
134 -- C Gillies (Falkirk) 63, 71 (#1000).
135 -- S Thompson (Gleddoch) 66, 69; B Marchbank (Marchbank Golf
Enterprises) 65, 70 (#767 each).
136 -- F Mann (Musselburgh) 69, 67 (#555).
137 -- D McKay (Ladybank) 70, 67; F Coutts (Deeside) 69, 68; W Guy
(Buchanan Castle) 69, 68; S Martin (North Engineering) 68, 69; K
Fairbairn (Goswick) 69, 68; R Weir (Cowal) 68, 69.
138 -- G Forbes (Aberdeen Petroleum Club) 70, 68; R Arnott (Caddy
Shack) 70, 68; S Kerr (Renfrew) 69, 69; S Stephen (Braid Hills) 66, 72.
139 -- R Aitken (Kilmarnock Barassie) 71, 68; H Kemp (Bishopbriggs GR)
71, 68; I Young (Braid Hills) 69, 70; S Henderson (Kings Links) 69, 70.

THE dream ticket for Steven Young is now well within his reach after
he secured a spot in the final of the British Boys' championship at
Dunbar yesterday with a semi-final win over Stewart Whiteford of Lundin.
Having won the Scottish title three times, 36 holes with Birmingham's
Sam Walker is the only obstacle remaining in an unparalleled boys'
career before the 18-year-old heads off to America to take up a golfing
scholarship in two weeks time.
It would add the finishing touches to an amazing year for Scotland on
the British amateur scene should he become the first Scot for 11 years
to win the title.
''I was thinking about Gordon Sherry winning the Amateur Championship
and Scotland winning the internationals and how great it would be if one
of us won here,'' said the Inverallochy golfer.
No matter what Walker produces today, Young has every right to expect
an easier match than he had in yesterday's semi-final with fellow Scot
Whiteford, a 16-year-old who gained his first cap only last week.
Whiteford fought back from two down and took Young to the fourth extra
hole before an 18-foot putt for a birdie gave the favourite victory.
Had Whiteford pulled off the unthinkable, he would have been the first
Scottish boy to beat Young in a competition for five years.
Walker, aged 17, who gained his first English cap last week, put paid
to two Scottish internationalists.
Scottish Boys' Strokeplay champion Craig Lee was his first victim in
the morning, when he won 2 and 1. He then ended hopes of an all-Scottish
final when he put out West Kilbride's Graham Fox by one hole in the
afternoon. Results:
Sixth round -- S Walker (Maxstoke Park) beat C Lee (Stirling), 2 and
1; G Fox (West Kilbride) beat D Lucas (Worksop), 2 and 1; S Young
(Inverallochy) beat S Chapman (St Enodoc), 3 and 2; S Whiteford (Lundin)
beat P De Salvatore (Italy), 5 and 4.
Semi-finals -- Walker beat Fox, 1 hole; Young beat Whiteford, at 22nd.

SCOTLAND claimed second place with a 7-2 victory over hosts Wales at
Northop Park yesterday in the girls' home internationals. Hopes of a
fourth successive title had been shattered by the opening 9-0 defeat
against England.
However, they recovered with victories over Ireland and yesterday's
win against the Welsh.
Scotland led 2-1 after the foursomes with Laura Moffat and Shona
McEwan beating Eleanor Pilgrim and Louise Davis on the eighteenth green.
The other morning victory was provided by Claire Hunter and Karyn
Burns, who overpowered Hannah Fitzpatrick and Ann-Louise Worthing 7 and
6.
At the top of the singles order, Moffat was never in front against
Welsh girls' champion Pilgrim until the match reached the eighteenth,
where a par 4 snatched the honours.
Elsewhere, Heather Stirling, McEwan, Hunter, and Leslie MacKay all
reeled off comfortable wins. The only Scottish loser in the singles was
Burns.
In another tight match against twice Welsh girls' champion Kate Stark,
Burns was level with only four holes to play, but then lost three on the
trot.
England defeated Ireland 6[1/2]-2[1/2] yesterday to clinch the
championship for the first time since 1991. Results:
Scotland 7, Wales 2. Foursomes (Scotland first) -- L Moffat and S
McEwan beat E Pilgrim and L Davis, 1 hole; H Stirling and F Lockhart
lost to K Stark and J Evans, 2 and 1; C Hunter and K Burns beat H
Fitzpatrick and A Worthing, 7 and 6.
Singles -- Moffat beat Pilgrim, 1 hole; Stirling beat Davis, 3 and 2;
Burns lost to Stark, 3 and 1; McEwan beat Evans, 5 and 4; Hunter beat
Worthing, 5 and 4; L MacKay beat Fitzpatrick, 5 and 4.
Final Standings: 1, England; 2, Scotland, 3, Ireland; 4, Wales.
* BRITISH Amateur champion Gordon Sherry qualified for the matchplay
stages of the Candadian Amateur championship at Toronto Golf Club
yesterday, when a two-over-par second round of 72 for an aggregate of
143 placed him seven shots behind leading qualifier, Australian Matthew
Goggin, runner-up Howard in this year's Cameron Corbett Vase at Haggs
Castle.

ERNIE Els bounced back from last week's disappointment to grab an
emphatic lead after his opening round at The International tournament
here in Denver, Colorado, yesterday.
Els took a three-stroke lead into the final round at the US PGA
championship last Sunday, only to finish tied for third behind champion
Steve Elkington and play-off loser Colin Montgomerie.
As upset as Els was at the time, the sight of the majestic Rocky
Mountains, which form a backdrop to the Castle Pines course, helped to
take the South African's mind off what happened at Riviera.
''Last Sunday is completely forgotten. With the beautiful views out
here, it didn't cross my mind,'' Els said after recording nine birdies
and one bogey.
He shot eight-under-par 64 which translated to 17 points in the
modified Stableford format which awards five points for eagle, two for
birdie, zero for par, minus one for bogey, and minus three for double
bogey or worse.
With half the field back in the clubhouse, Els led by six points from
Americans Davis Love, Craig Stadler and Tom Kite.
Els, starting his round at the tenth, made four successive birdies
from the eleventh as he struck beautifully-judged approach shots in the
thin mountain air.
He birdied the eleventh and twelfth holes from 10 feet, the thirteenth
from 15 feet and the fourteenth from eight feet, before adding another
birdie from three feet at the seventeenth.
After four more birdies on the front nine, he made his only bogey at
the par-4 ninth, where he rifled his approach shot over the green.
Leading completed scores (Americans unless stated):
17pts -- Ernie Els (South Africa).
11 -- Davis Love, Craig Stadler, Tom Kite.
10 -- David Duval, Bob Tway, Lee Janzen.
9 -- Andrew Magee.
8 -- Justin Leonard, Peter Senior (Australia), Tom Lehman, Joey
Sindelar, Mark Wiebe, Dudley Hart.

FORMER British Amateur champion Gary Wolstenholme of Bristol and
Clifton was the only competitor to break par in the inaugural British
Mid Amateur championship at Sunningdale New yesterday.
A three-under-par 67 gave him a two-round aggregate of 138 and a lead
of three over Michael Reynard of Moseley, a beaten finalist in this
year's Amateur Championship. A good showing in the matchplay stage,
which starts today, would strengthen the English leader's claim to one
of two available Walker Cup places.
Kingsknowe's Scott Knowles led the Scots, posting a three-over-par 73
to trail by four. Elsewhere, Tommy Cochrane and Derek Paton, of
Dunnnikier Park, made the cut on 151 while Mike Thomson, of Torwoodlee,
finished on the mark on 154. Leading scores:
138 -- G Wolstenholme (Bristol and Clifton) 71, 67.
141 -- M Reynard (Moseley) 70, 71.
142 -- C Rotheroe (The Berkshire) 67, 75; S Knowles (Kingsknowe) 69,
73; S Barwick (East Berkshire) 74, 68.
Other scores included: 151 -- D Paton (Dunnikier Park) 74, 77. 152 --
T Cochrane (Dunnikier Park) 74, 78. 154 -- M Thomson (Torwoodlee) 76,
78. 161 -- A Smith (Duddingston) 80, 81; S Smith (Duddingston) 82, 79.
162 -- B Forsyth (Turnberry) 84, 78.

Ross Finlay goes into Africa where Toyota has a strong force
SEVERAL car manufacturing
companies began as bright ideas within firms whose principal field of
operation was something entirely different. Wolseley is a prime example,
an offshoot of a business which made sheep-shearing machinery. As a make
name, Wolseley may be lying dormant, but Toyota is anything but. It is
celebrating the 60th anniversary of the first prototype vehicle to be
built within what was at that time a factory devoted to making textile
looms.
Saloons, estates, sports cars, vans, trucks and 4x4s all bear the
Toyota name. The company also has an interest in Hino and Daihatsu. As
well as operating subsidiaries building cars and components in the UK
and elsewhere, it still runs the Toyoda Automatic Loom Works -- the
founding family's name being spelled differently from the name of the
vehicles. They still provide the chairman and president of the board of
directors.
Toyota is particularly strong in 4x4s, not just in recreational
vehicles like the RAV4, but especially in the big, robust class of
off-roaders where the Landcruiser, in many markets, is the dominant
force. When I was in Zimbabwe last year, driving from the Eastern
Highlands via the Hwange National Park to Victoria Falls, it was
noticeable that, in a country where currency controls make new cars very
difficult to come by, Landcruisers of various vintages ruled the
four-wheel drive roost.
One of the reasons for the Landcruiser's success is that the model
line was established very early. The first generation Landcruiser was
built in 1951. It has always seemed to be a tough, no-nonsense vehicle,
with a strong chassis, good ground clearance, better passenger space
than many of its rivals, and the ability to batter on over the worst
Third World roads it encounters. It also offers, in the easier
conditions here, fine towing performance when hauling a trailer,
caravan, horse box or boat.
Landcruisers usually have big, powerful engines with beefy torque.
That is particularly true in the case of the latest long-wheelbase
versions, the petrol-engined 4477cc VX automatic at #38,689 and the
corresponding manual version, which comes only with a 4164cc turbo
diesel at #39,120. Those prices show that Toyota is hoping to tap into
the luxury end of the 4x4 market, but the same diesel engine is also
fitted to the more simply specified Landcruiser GS at #29,630, while the
short-wheelbase Landcruiser II at #20,394 comes with a smaller
three-litre diesel power unit.
The 4.4-litre straight-six 24-valve petrol engine pushes out 202bhp
and reaches a peak torque figure of 266lb ft. With the standard
four-speed automatic transmission, which features traction control, high
and low ratio ranges as well as front, centre and rear differential
locks, that engine allows the bulky VX to reach 60mph in about 12.5
seconds, reach a notional top speed of 106mph, and provide fuel
consumption returns like 28mpg at 56mph, 20 at 75 and 15mpg around town.
The slow-revving turbo diesel has less ultimate power but even meatier
torque -- 280lb ft as low as 2200rpm of engine speed. It matches the
petrol version in off-the-line performance and top speed, has absolutely
stump-pulling traction and gives notably better fuel consumption figures
at 56mph and on the urban cycle.
A short introductory test drive in the latest VX and GS Landcruisers
showed that these fairly massive vehicles can inch their way easily
round a sinuous off-road course, and handle well, for their class, on
ordinary roads. Up-market details on the VX include such features as air
conditioning, leather upholstery and burr walnut fascia trim, and it is
worth bearing in mind that, if you count the ''occasional'' seating
right at the back, it will take a driver and seven passengers. However,
although some luxury items may have crept in, like the other
Landcruisers the VX will also do a real job of towing, rough-road or
up-country work.

ISEE that IBM is to set up a multi-lingual helpline call centre for
European customers at its Spango Valley plant in Greenock, creating some
200 jobs. No reflection on Big Blue, but our household's experience with
computer helplines to date has been decidedly frustrating.
Earlier this year we bought a modem and associated fax software for
the personal computer we run at home. When the package arrived we
plugged in, loaded up, and stood expectantly round the screen to witness
the results.
Part of the object of the exercise was to allow two busy people to
send and receive faxes at home. A greater part was to allow my partner,
Carol, to communicate, computer-to-computer, with a work colleague 400
miles away in the south of England. She has the same computer model and
had purchased the same, recommended (and pricey) communications package.
What happened was weeks of unresolved aggravation as the software
failed, failed, and failed again, to deliver what it promised. The modem
worked fine. The software did not. Error code after impenetrable error
code was logged up on the screen.
Just occasionally, a test fax would actually make it to a friendly
destination, like this office. Would that they had not. Each small
success simply prolonged the agony as the frustrating failed attempts
multiplied.
We engaged in extended dialogue with the dealer who had supplied the
equipment. We tried to engage in dialogue with the Californian software
company to discover what all those error codes meant. The dealer tried
to help, even to the extent of setting up a link and attempting,
unsuccessfully, to exchange fax messages. The software company's
helpline could not have cared less. They were on to newer versions. If
we wanted to talk upgrades, fine. But problems? Forget it.
On a business trip to New York, I even unburdened myself of our woes
to a Manhattan computer store sales assistant. Buy a much cheaper
alternative, he advised, naming a particular package. It doesn't have
all the bells and whistles, but it does what is says it will.
Eventually two expensive boxes of less-than-satisfactory tricks were
returned to the supplier. One of his people confided that we were far
from alone in experiencing the problems. We went out and bought a
conventional telephone fax machine. Carol's dreams of communicating
computer-to-computer and the boys' plans to graze the further reaches of
the Internet are currently on hold.
I should add that IBM played no part in this domestic drama. But, ever
since the first personal computers started appearing less than two
decades ago, the customer-support area has always seemed to me the one
where most of the PC and software suppliers could do very much better.
They can hit us with a new model every six months and a new-generation
chip every other year. But old-fashioned customer support is not their
best suit.
The early computer manuals were written by engineers for engineers.
For the broad mass of users they were impenetrable gobbledegook. Some of
the documentation in our fax/modem package suggested little progress has
since been made in communicating meaningfully with customers.
So will the proliferating call-centre helplines transform the
situation and banish the kind of frustration we endured? The call-centre
concept is itself a product of rapid advances in computer technology. In
areas as diverse as catalogue shopping, debt recovery, service inquiries
in the utilities and selling insurance or mortgages and solving Baffled
of Balfron's computer problems, it looks like the sales and customer
care tool of the future.
The technology already allows operators to identify you, by name,
before your call has been answered. They can also throw up details of
your entire business history with them on screen at the flick of a key
or two. Built-in software protocols can also impose a large measure of
uniformity on the way each and every call operator responds to a
particular kind of call.
But, of course, the same technology can be and is used to control the
productivity of call-centre staff. I listened on radio, the other day,
to a description of an American trucking company which has satellite
computer links with each and every one of its cab units.
Headquarters can log and control where each unit is at every hour and
minute of the day and night. So sophisticated is the system that the
company can monitor the engine revs and speed at which each driver
changes gear. Similarly, in call centres, call frequency, sales success
rates and myriad other performance indicators for each individual
operator are logged and assessed. Management can even tell how long, in
minutes and seconds, your comfort breaks take.
Does that lead to a satisfying working environment for the staff
involved? I talked recently to someone intimately involved in
call-centre technology. He was blunt about the impact on staff. Staff
turnover in call centres, he told me, is unusually high. ''I would
not,'' he added candidly, ''want to manage a large call centre with 200
operators. I can think of a lot more pleasant places to work.''
That is, of course, only one man's view, albeit an informed source.
Glasgow has attracted a number of such centres in the past few years and
the Glasgow Development Agency is keen to promote the city as a place at
the leading edge of call-centre development.
Are they the silicon equivalent of the Victorian dark satanic mills or
a striking example of how computer technology can transform the art of
selling and keeping the customer happy? I don't know. But isn't it
interesting that our main economic development body is out touting for
more of them without any debate at all about that rather intriguing
question?

DOUBTLESS the weans and the young people have been enjoying the first
genuine heatwave for 20 years in this country. Who am I to be such a
curmudgeon as to suggest that we would all be better off with a nice wee
wintry summer?
How well I remember the days when summer was Pacamacs over the khaki
shorts. Actually springs and summers were rather good in my childhood
and boys and girls ran about for months in frocks and shorts and ankle
socks and sandshoes and it was quite sunny and very nice really. I think
1976 had a bumper year of summer heat when the grass went the colour of
Italian coffee and the Government told us all to bathe in two
millimetres of Loch Katrine water.
But this summer has been dreadful. Forget about the tanned bodies of
children and the sort of thick young female office workers who prefer to
have themselves practically blinded by nightly sun-bathing sessions,
like something out of the ''Four Feathers''. Most able-bodied building
workers are cracking up because they can't work in heat like that. They
can work in howling gales at the top of the sort of scaffolding high
enough for Chicago's Sear's building but they will drap doon deid in
heat like this summer's. And I hate the heat myself.
How I hate the heat. I have spent the last month sweating like a child
molester. D'you see, the heat has got to me and I am now writing prose
so unacceptable for a family newspaper that it has to be the Sun getting
to me. Gad this heat, damn these flies. It could be east of anywhere
Somerset Maugham had ever visited.
All I need is a solar topee, a wrinkled linen suit, a sweaty hankie in
one hand and a gin-sling in the other; the next thing you know I shall
be committing hara-kiri in Java having slaughtered the Portuguese trader
in the next bungalow. Here. I can get used to this. Dashed good idea.
Carruthers I shall call myself.
So I am sweating enough pints of whatever it is I drink to slake the
thirst of Gunga Din's little pal and do I not bump into a young lady
friend of mine, a Doctor O'Neill. I am not sure I am allowed to name a
doctor, like advertising, really, but that's her problem and not mine.
She is a GP and shatteringly lovely and worse, rather caustive when she
wants to be.
''How are you'' she asks. ''Terrible,'' I retort, ''the heat is
driving me to distraction. I am ill, I tell you, ill.'' Her attitude
left a lot to be desired coming from a young and lovely lady doctor.
She wanted to know what I expected. I have, she pointed out,
pointedly, liver disease, sugar-level problems, severe hay-fever
symptoms, arthritis, and I am overweight and take no exercise, unless
you count the physical process of shoving fags and booze down my throat
at such regular intervals that she was surprised, she said, that I was
displaying any sort of life at all. ''I hope you don't imagine you will
join our practice,'' she told me coldly, adding, ''We can't afford
you.''
A bit miffed I was; told her I intend to leave my organs for
unfortunates in need. She more or less intimated that the Messiah
himself couldn't come back from the Dead if he was supplied with a
McLean transplant. Well I ask you? And then she told me that part of my
problem was that I was fat.
Well, Dr O'Neill, I hope your time comes as well. Should I live so
long I will positively crow, my dear, at your sudden expansion from a
size 10 to a size 16.
The heat is bad enough; the men in shorts are worse. I might look
surrealist enough in a floral frock but Salvador Dali couldn't come up
with anything more bizarre than a Glaswegian over the age of 20 in
shorts, and no socks.
Not so the modern Scots lass. She looks horribly well and the shorter
the shorts, the higher the skirt, the more splendidly chaste, confident,
haughty, and lovely she seems to look. Sunshine is designed to make
ducklings look swans.
I may say my physical capabilities, as that of any male, are truly
diminished by the heat of a heatwave, but my ardour isn't. The reason
why suddenly the most beautiful women and girls emerge when the sun
takes its hat off is because the sun transforms them all.
Sadly it transforms men as well. Only the very young males can cope
with this. Middle-aged fellows take upon them paunches held in in the
calm of winter and their natural tumescence can be held back by the
weather. It is not the weather for chaps at all really. And don't the
Young and Female know it. Good luck to them at that.

THE sleepy East Neuk fishing village of Anstruther emerges in a new
book as a hotbed of sex and sin. Keeping up with Magda, a first novel by
local writer Isla Dewar, is set in the mythical village of Mareth ''a
noisy, seething place where everyone knows everything about each other
and what they don't know they assume.
''From Granny Moran who can never escape her raunchy past to Ginny
Howard, who is wasted chairing the Mareth Improvement Committee when she
should be sorting out the Middle East, the villagers live against a
constantly changing backdrop of elaborate scheming and sexual
activity.''
We asked around and this seems like a pretty fair description of life
in Anstruther. Isla Dewar, being diplomatic, insists that while she has
taken the setting and the mood of Anstruther for her novel, none of the
characters are based on locals.
She said: ''It could be any small town. Parochialism is fairly
international.'' Isla tells us she has also lived in Kirriemuir and
Forfar. This could either be a hedging of the bets or an attempt by her
to have the good folk of these places buying the book, as well as
Anstrutheronians, in attempts to put real names to fictitious
characters.
The book is published next month by Headline at #14.99 who are so
confident it will be a success that Isla Dewar's second novel,
provisionally titled Women Talking Dirty, will be out next spring.
* The Diary must apologise that due to pressure of deadlines we were
unable to fillet Ms Dewar's book and pass on the, er, highlights.
Hamish lives on
THE Regional Directorate of the BBC has a new financial database.
Thank you for reading on.
The database has been given the name Hamish. It has been called Hamish
after a regional directorate person's Scottie dog which died recently,
which shows a nice human touch for people who run financial databases.
But the BBC being such an acronymic place, people have been asking
what Hamish stands for. (The TV industry is full of acronyms such as
ENCA, editor news and current affairs, and HOLE, head of light
entertainment.)
Anyway, a prize of a bottle of champagne has been put up by BBC high
heid yins for whoever can come up with the best meaning for the acronym
Hamish. Our chums at BBC Scotland are in with a shout with their version
-- Half-Arsed Management Information System for Headquarters.
For the record
THERE are some stories which, we feel, are better told exactly as they
come to us. John I. Thomson of Glasgow writes: ''I earn a living as a
freelance radio producer. Recently I was in Govan to do some tape
recording. I was walking along a street between Govan Road and Golspie
Avenue when I noticed a strange creature, dead, lying on the ground. It
reminded me of the creature from Aliens.
''I was about to move on when I was joined by a man and a woman. 'Do
you know what that is?' asked the woman. I shook my head. 'It's a
lizard. Something's went and ate a lizard. Still,' she continued,
'that's Govan for you,' and walked on.''
See Govan? See encounters?
Field of conflict
DEPT of Seeing Oursels As Ithers See Us: The scene is the train from
Glasgow to Edinburgh where four very unquiet American tourists are
dominating proceedings. The train stops near Murrayfield whereupon one
of the Americans points to the stadium and announces: ''That's where
they hold the soccer riots.''
A gay gargle
THEY say it doesn't make you a bad person, so the Diary was willing to
try GL Gay Lager. This brew is sold in Route 66, a pub which claims to
be Edinburgh's sole stockist of gay lager.
It is produced by the Pride Brewing Company of Manchester and comes in
a black and pink tin with the motto ''The spirit to defeat the
prejudice''. We outed a couple of the tins at #1.80 each for 500ml and
tried it on some colleagues.
Rugby writer Derek Douglas gave it a bad review (we will not quote him
exactly) but that's what these macho oval-ball people are like. How
would you like to face the Scottish XV after admitting that you quite
liked gay lager? Photographer Mike Wilkinson thought it tasted a bit
like Skol.
As they also say, don't knock it till you've tried it.
*THE above sign was snapped for our delectation by Senga Deans of
Glasgow while on a trip to Kent in southernmost England. It transpires
that this is a genuine if not entirely official twinning between the
tiny hamlet of Pett Bottom, near Canterbury, and the wee Scottish toun
best known for its football team, Stenhousemuir Nil.
The man behind the scheme is Ron Brown, mine host of the Duck Inn and,
by public acclaim, Mayor of Pett Bottom. Mr Brown was impressed to see
on TV that Stenhousemuir had an Oslo supporters club and decided that
Pett Bottom should become the southernmost outpost of fans of the
Ochilview team.
Their enthusiasm became even greater when Stenhousemuir scored that
kenspeckle Scottish Cup victory earlier this year over Aberdeen.
The Pett Bottom Stenhousemuir Supporters Club will take in their first
game in October when they travel north -- about 40-strong -- and will
even sponsor the match ball. Paul Tewkesbury, barman at the Duck Inn,
has ben appointed archivist of the supporters club.
His task is to dig out information on Stenhousemuir. ''All I know so
far is that they have never won a trophy,'' he told the Diary. ''We have
a Scot who is a regular at the Duck Inn. He is a Dundee fan but we hope
to bring him north to act as an interpreter.''

THE VIEW from the top of the chute, a precipitous funnel which only
just accommodates my middle-aged hips, has scarcely altered in four
decades. I see the landscaping round the new sewage-treatment plant
tunnelled into the cliffs of the East Bay, and a recent housing
development above Coo's Green; the pool itself has got bluer, apeing the
azure of the Caribbean in a doomed effort to achieve the allure of a
brochure sunspot, but otherwise little has change.
It's a view which belongs to the simplest and most blameless part of
my life: the sandy scoops on either side of the Platcock Rocks, the
rough red boulders of the harbour with the ambient percussion of its
yachts, the grave guest houses and stately villas on the edge of the
links, the volcanic hump on the town's back and the breezy glitter of
the Forth estuary at its front. I pick off the islands west to east, by
names which are fixed on an early map of memory: Fidra, the Lamb,
Craigleith, the Isle of May on the sea's horizon and the big Bass Rock,
whiter than ever in its skin of guano, a misplaced iceberg.
North Berwick is a national treasure. It should be protected by
Historic Scotland, although that would almost certainly ruin it. It's
one of the few places left in Scotland which can give children (and
adults) the experience of an old-fashioned seaside resort, but it's
about to lose the soul of its summer identity: the huge outdoor swimming
pool, one of three East Coast survivors of its kind, which closes for
good at the end of the month.
The timing is cruel. Not only has the summer been sublime but the
municipal swimming-pool is only a year short of its centenary. Its
thrilling seawater cavity was hacked out of the Platcock Rocks in 1896
when the site -- an old rubbish dump -- was developed by some of the
Victorian investors who turned North Berwick into the ''Biarritz of the
North''. By 1913 instructors had been appointed to teach people to swim,
and for the next 50 years the pond and its esplanade were the nerve
centre of the summer season.
There were galas; therer were diving displays; there were ''the
pierrots'' in the harbour pavilion was built in 1930. Now the pool's
esplanade neighbour is moribund, too, despite community efforts to keep
it open for the local operatic society. Yet their site is magnificent
and their potential challenging. Oh for some visionary Victorian
investors . . .
East Lothian District Council sure don't fit the bill. As regards
North Berwick's status as national treasure (and consequent ornament to
a tourist industry which, if predictions about warmer summers are
accurate, will be more and more home-loving) they have thrown in the
towel. They're building a new indoor pool at the top of the town --
nothing special, no Wet 'n' Wild -- and say they can't afford to
maintain the seasonal outdoor one, too.
Their engineers are investigating, but they haven't yet decided what
to do with the site, the esplanade and the Harbour Pavilion, although
the option of extending the harbour has been -- ahem -- floated; which
will almost certainly kill two with one planning proposal, as the
existing harbour, built of russet porphyry stone from the quarry on
Berwick Law, couldn't be repeated and deserves its own protection.
Only the most sentimental would deny that the pool itself needs
investment. Its facilities are primitive, and (apart from a heating
system which barely takes the chill off the water and a fence of flashy
perspex windbreaks whose opaque cobalt blue is designed to exclude
spectators who haven't paid for seats) they haven't been updated since I
lived in North Berwick as a child in the fifties.
Yes, my children, we were tough as Arctic seals in those days. We
started swimming in the unheated, unfiltered seawater at the beginning
of May and didn't stop until mid-September, tutored first by Pondmaster
McCracken, whose custodian's eye and severity with rules made his
aquatic fief the safest of playgrounds. We only stopped swimming on
cleaning days, when the pool was emptied and task forces of
holidaymakers joined the staff to scrub it down.
We undressed and dressed in communal changing rooms, one for Ladies
and Girls, one for Boys and one for Gentlemen, who presumably couldn't
be trusted with the boys. They are all still there. The damp, concrete
floors are still there, and the worn, wooden benches and the white
tiles. You still store your clothes in heavy wire-baskets and hand them
into the Basket Room for safekeeping, and there's a paucity of hot
showers which surely weren't there in the fifties, otherwise we wouldn't
have needed our ''chittering bites.'' But my 11-year-old and her chum,
who joined me in my last splash, were beguiled by the quaintness of it
all.
These are children who have bathed in some of the most sophisticated
waterparks in the world. They are flume-wise from Stingray through River
Rapids to Geronimo's Leap, but they judged North Berwick Outdoor Pool
''brilliant.'' They loved the sheer scale of the pond, the exhilarating
views from the chute, the little waves whipped up by the breeze, the
sense of ''safe'' sea-bathing.
We signed the petition. North Berwick has been slow to respond to the
death-throes of its pool, which have been known for some time, but a
campaign of opposition is now underway; almost certainly too late.
A few years ago I met a long-standing resident whose husband's nanny
had also been nanny to the Ethiopian royal family when they were exiled
in Britain during the war. Ruth Tweedie told me that the Emperor Haile
Selassie sent his grandson to the resort every summer, ''because Nellie
Wood said no child should be brought up without spending his holidays in
North Berwick.''
It's an idea worth cherishing, along with the pool.

With the help of an able-bodied volunteer, Anvar Khan puts some insect
repellent to the test on Scotland's perennial scourge.
WHEN hiking two weeks ago in the Highlands, my partner's walking
stick, a brontosaurus thigh no less, was spotted by some fellow
travellers.
''Is that for the midges?'' asked the extra from The Sound of Music.
Scotch midges are horrible, bumbling and determinedly stupid. To them,
you're just one big landing zone. They and the weather alone are
responsible for off-putting tourists.
For miles and miles of pure, virgin scenery is marred by black, blurry
and buzzing raisins ducking and diving within vision. It's probably
because theirs isn't so hot that they bump into you in the first place,
and it was with this theory in mind, that I volunteered my boyfriend for
The Herald Great Midge Repellent Experiment. He's nearly 6ft high and
3ft broad (muscle not fat) so they couldn't miss him. He agreed. He's
such a gentleman.
''All you have to do,'' he said, ''is spray each of the repellents on
me, stand back, and watch to see what happens''.
It is, during such occasions, for there are many, that I regard myself
as a lucky girl, having a personal Rambo. My mission was to test the
effectiveness of four brands of beastie-killer to bum them completely
from my personal space.
Some might say it was nasty of me to take advantage of my boyfriend's
good nature, but I say it was survival. Japanese-style torture tests are
not written into my contract.
Folklore is responsible for a horde of silly acts and deeds which
precede the triumph of hope over experience. A pot of sweet gale ensures
a bite-free zone. Crofters used to put it in the straw beds they slept
on. A Scottish plant by the glamorous name of Bog Myrtle is said to be a
remedy, as is cigarette smoke.
Other mythological measures include local dirt. If a person covers him
or herself with village earth the midges will stay away, because it is
only alien smells that they are attracted to.
As it was, David was not bitten but he was chased. The closest he got
to being spiked was when a wasp tried to get down the back of his neck
in the car. Yes, we nearly crashed. Road safety, it seems, is as good a
reason as any to stamp out the little suckers for ever.
MOSI-GUARD NATURAL
* BRAND: Mosi-Guard Natural
Contents: 75ml
Price: #4.45
Smell: A mixture of eucalyptus and cedarwood.
Effectiveness: A good wasp deterrent.
Marks out of 10: 5
Anvar: This claims to be non-toxic, and approved and recommended by
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. No adverse effects
on fabrics and surfaces.
David: When I sprayed it on a whirlwind of midges they moved off to
the side until the air cleared, and then they moved back. It's stinking
on the skin. Very oily. So strong in fact, that it stripped the dye off
the container on to my hands. The blue blotches eventually came off with
detergent and a nailbrush.
SHOO! INSECT REPELLENT
* BRAND: Shoo! Insect Repellent
Contents: 30ml
Price: #2.60
Smell: A mixture of pink bubblegum and dentist's mouthwash.
Effectiveness: It says ''Apply before imminent attack''. Don't,
because it doesn't.
Marks out of 10: 2
Anvar: Made in Argyll, Scotland, so you'd think that having a great
experience of Highland beasties, the makers would concoct a strong,
merciless cure. Allegedly water-resistant.
David: Weak and greasy. They used to issue this stuff in the army. The
only time you put it on is when you sweat, after running, because
insects want your salt. But either the sweat just washes it off, or the
repellent just attracts them because they come at you in swarms.
BOOTS REPEL PLUS
* BRAND: Boots Repel Plus
Contents: 100ml
Price: #3.35
Smell: A strong gin and tonic or a vodka and bitter lemon with an
undernote of French furniture polish.
Effectiveness: The midges took their time but they went.
Marks out of 10: 6
Anvar: CFC-free, and contains 20% Diethyl toluamide to ward off
insects and 0.5% Permethrin to help prevent insects from biting. The
toluamide, however, is now known to cause side effects such as skin
irritation.
David: Sticks to the skin like hairspray. When directed into the air,
this attracts a bigger and better class of bug. It drives wasps crazy,
it produced a kamikaze effect, they started diving into each other in a
frenzy. They don't bite you but go on to bite each other instead.
X-GNAT SKIN GEL
* BRAND: X-Gnat Skin Gel
Contents: 100ml
Price: #4.45
Smell: A milder version of Mosi-Guard, but less potent.
Effectiveness: For 6-8 hours allegedly, but who'd take the chance.
Marks out of 10: 6
Anvar: Says it does ''not contain harmful Diethyl toluamide (deet)''.
Contains ingredients from flowers and aromatic oils. This product is the
only one not tested on animals, but tested on people. It doesn't says
whether it's been tested on midges.
David: The cream disappears into the skin quickly. Flies and wasps
appeared in their hundreds to smell me, but none landed. They were very
curious about my body odour. If you get it on your lips, however, it
burns.

* WOULD you have the nerve to offer a credit card for a 50p train
fare? For anyone who shares anxieties about rail safety voiced this
week, toughing it out at the ticket office could be a smart move.
According to the credit card companies, not everyone realises they
qualify for free accident insurance each time they pay plastic. Royal
Bank of Scotland, for instance, offers a #50,000 benefits package for
death or serious injury while travelling by train, airliner, coach and
ship, or a car hired for up to 30 days. Cover extends to spouses and
dependent children.
Even on long-distance train journeys, many cardholders still opt for
cash or cheques, so the chances of their buying a local ticket with Visa
or Access are even more remote. In fact, most recent fatalities have
taken place on suburban services.
ScotRail say they will accept a credit card for even their cheapest
fare -- a 50p single, although they wouldn't claim to be ecstatic at the
prospect. To learn more about playing your cards correctly, ask the
payment centre shown on your monthly statement.
* WANTED: Scotland's most dedicated child carer. Baby product
manufacturer St Ivel is offering a #1000 prize to the winner of their
1995 competition, plus #250 for the nominator.
As well as standard skills, judges will be looking for someone who
keeps junior entertained in a ''fun but educational way'', pays
attention to diet, health and welfare -- and comes up smiling while
wiping baby's bum. To enter your child carer, send a 250-word pen
portrait and recent colour photo to St Ivel, Cavendish House, 33
Margaret Street, London W1N 7LA by the end of the month. An SAE is
needed to return photos.
* ANYONE who sympathises with ex-Far East POWs' pleas to boycott
Japanese goods will find it hard going. When Check-out examined product
information at electrical supermarkets like ScottishPower and Currys,
the country of origin wasn't indicated. If sales staff are to be
believed, shoppers care more about interest-free credit and cashbacks
than where their washing machine, fridge or camcorder comes from.
John Lewis customers seem more discriminating: at its branches in
Edinburgh and Aberdeen labelling provides full information about the
country of manufacture for those who care about such things.
* GET HIPP is the advice for mothers concerned about what goes into
baby foods. Europe's leading organic baby food, HIPP, is now on sale in
Scotland.
All the fruits and vegetables used are guaranteed free from pesticide
residues and the synthetic chemical fertilisers used in conventional
farming. Ingredients come from accredited organic farms, regularly
checked to ensure soil and seeds meet rigorous quality standards.
Of the 24 varieties available, 15 are suitable for vegetarians.
Stockists include Boots, Safeway, Tesco and Co-ops, health food shops
and pharmacies. For a leaflet and money-off voucher, write to HIPP

ELIZABETH WESTCOTT marvels at the convenience of out-of-town
superstores, and their remoteness from some of the most disadvantaged
communities.
What could be more convenient than one-stop shopping, where all
consumer needs from the supermarket to the post-office are housed in one
spacious, shining complex?
In Scotland, 70% of food is bought in superstores, many of which are
located out of town, on purpose-built sites, where you can buy clothes,
have them dry-cleaned, have your prescriptions dispensed at a pharmacy,
withdraw extra cash from the till where you pay for your groceries, and
stop for coffee at a nice cafe when your feet hurt.
What does it matter if the local shops have a narrow range of goods
and are more expensive? It doesn't, if you have a car or access to a
good public transport.
But for the elderly, who depend on not having to travel far for their
needs, for mothers encumbered with young children or for people stranded
in poorly-serviced housing estates, these shopping developments are not
accessible. Often, low-income consumers end up paying more.
The recent launch of the Government's Draft National Planning Policy
Guideline on Retailing, emphasising the protection of town centres, has
been welcomed by the Scottish Consumer Council. It believes that
low-income consumers should have access to the same shopping facilities
and competitive prices enjoyed by the more affluent and mobile, says SCC
director Ann Foster.
''If you are without access to private transport then you are
disadvantaged in lots of ways,'' she says. ''You can't buy in bulk or
take advantage of special offers. You are paying high prices in smaller
shops. While you're dealing with a local trader who knows your needs,
for many people there is no match for low prices.''
Out-of-town developments are not a bad idea in themselves, Foster
says. In addition to providing wide choice and quality they have other
effects, such as easing inner-city congestion created by heavy-goods
vehicles.
''However, they can take away from an area that was previously
thriving,'' said Foster. ''Normally you find an anchor store like a
supermarket in a shopping development, and once that is taken away it
has a knock-on effect for other stores. There are bits of Glasgow that
have become dead that were once thriving.''
Part of the problem is the increasing domination of multiple retailers
who do not have outlets in poorer areas, as some disadvantaged
Glaswegian estates have experienced.
''Large multinationals have extremely sophisticated area profiles;
they simply won't go there. These people will have local retailers but
they won't get the multiples.
''It's a very competitive market, so groups like Safeway, which
recently reported a reduction in profits, are not likely to display a
sudden outburst of community spirit if it is not going to keep the
shareholders happy,'' claims Foster.
This last point was disputed by both Tesco and Safeway. Tesco says
that while it would not discriminate against poorer areas, it was
''obviously looking for prime locations''. Safeway spokeswoman Odette
Sullivan, says that the relative wealth of an area was not part of its
criteria for site selection.
''Safeway will go quite happily into housing estates . . . It more
depends on where stores can be built. Safeway is trying to generate
one-stop shopping and the minimum size for a new store is 25,000sq ft,
so that's what guides us where to go.''
The fact remains, as one Glasgow health worker pointed out, that
multiple retailers will choose the most economically viable areas, and
community spirit is hardly going to influence those decisions.
Professor John Dawson of Edinburgh University, who wrote a report on
retail development trends for the Scottish Office in 1994, sums up the
problem in one neat question: are retailers providing an economic
service or a social service?
''There's a trade-off between consumers being provided with a local
service which isn't economically strong or accessibility to something
with a wider choice,'' Professor Dawson says.
''The same issue applies to remote rural areas. Is a person's right to
have access to a shop the same as the right to have access to a library?
Policies don't address those specific problems.
''Low-mobility people become disadvantaged if there are no changes in
public transport, but if they are services then it shouldn't pose a
problem.''
The guideline stresses the need to site new developments where they
are accessible by public as well as private transport.
While this does not solve the problem of the elderly or mothers with
children travelling home with shopping, it will allow access to those
without cars.
Recognising some of the problems that have occurred with shopping
developments is an important step, but the SCC believes that a public
commitment should be made to following the guidelines, so that
low-income consumers are less disadvantaged.
''They do take account of regional structures and there is much more
emphasis given to sustainable development,'' says Ann Foster. ''However,
the problem with guidelines is that it takes take a long time to see any
effect.''

William Russell looks at festive present ideas from the National Trust
for Scotland.
THE clootie dumpling is rapidly becoming the National Trust for
Scotland's trademark. Last year the Trust sold 600 of the things through
its mail order service. This year the dumpling in a presentation tin
costs #6.50. Food is always welcome, and the Trust, ever seeking
something new in the cut-throat world of the mail order Christmas
catalogue has produced its first ever Taste of Scotland hamper -- a
basket of goodies rather than one of those things with lids -- a snip at
#13.99. From Pettigrews of Kelso, the basket contains a 14oz Christmas
pudding, cranberry sauce, hot gooseberry chutney, lemon curd, and a box
of butter shortbread rounds.
Add a giant mince pie made in Dundee (#2.25), a whisky fruit cake
(#6.50), and some of the Trust's sought after after-dinner mints (#2.95)
and you could be this year's favourite giver of presents. On the other
hand the people you love may prefer to make and bake their own, in which
case give them either the Haute Ecosse pack of 40 Scottish recipes for
everything from Cullen Skink to Black Bun (#7.95) or The Laird's
Kitchen, which documents 300 years of Scottish cooking and gives recipes
for some fine feasts (#18.95).
The NTS Christmas mail order catalogue is a cut above the rest. The
nightcap set -- two dram glasses and a miniature decanter engraved with
a leaping salmon design -- is just the thing for insomniacs, and comfort
could also be found in the bag of marbles with booklet of instructions
(#9.95), ever so much more enthralling than a computer game. You can get
the catalogue for yourself from The National Trust for Scotland -- 0131
243 9393.

YON fabulous Umbilicals begin at the gates of Heaven and end by
tilting the Gilded Balloon's very fabric first 180 degrees one way and
then 180 degrees another.
In between, they race across a richly-realised cartoon soundscape,
Wile E Coyote versus Wile E Coyote, in high-powered cars and thundering
juggernauts, on skateboard and on horseback. Lunar weightlessness is
explored and exploited. Chainsaws buzz and gizzards are extruded.
It's like being sucked into a blockbuster movie starring Bruce Willis,
Bruce Lee and Bluto -- all of it miraculously created on stage by two
skinny blokes in red singlets. I clapped till my hands exploded in a
cascade of blood and bone-shards. Almost. See the Umbilicals and learn
that an imaginatively-propelled human body has no limits.

A GIANT pinball table towers on its end. Wriggling and squirming
between the prongs are bodies in army fatigues. Sounds of amplified
rapid-fire nick our eardrums. This is D2R (Descent 2 Return or Detour)
and the vertically dangling bodies belong to American company Diavolo
Dance Theater.
Diavolo's work seems to centre on bizarre tests of endurance. They
could craft assault courses for Green Beret wannabes. AWOL finds a
hapless female (white-shirted among black-balaclava'ed hordes) pursued
through flying tackles and acrobatic scrums.
The light relief of Bonjour! gives way to the commando antics of D2R
before new horizons descending from great heights arrive headlong down
the huge wooden steps of Tet en L'air. It doesn't just defy gravity, it
eventually defies watching -- seriously pleased with itself, I'm afraid.

A POSTMAN, unmistakably French in his chic-but-shabby uniform, wheels
his ramshackle bicycle on stage, its load of exotically stamped parcels
and packages hinting at foreign travel and faraway places.
With engaging humour, which makes light of the skill and precision of
his performance, the postie lovingly unpacks a miniature fantasy world
from his mysterious brown parcels, leading the audience on a journey of
dream-logic; from tropical island, complete with baby dinosaur and
smoking volcano, through sea voyage to circus tent.
For anyone who's ever struggled to build their own ''Tracey Island'',
collected Brittan's plastic animals, or delighted in show-domes, this
Velo Theatre production is a must. A theatre-of-the-dinky, steering just
the right side of the cutely whimsical.

THE new line-up of an old band, they promised. But it was really It
Ain't Half Hot Mum, with said parent greeted from the stage, and even
Windsor Davies's doppelganger on keyboard. Alongside stood four
colleagues, a credit to any concert party. Or perhaps a village hall
because, judging from the familiar, two-way badinage, it seemed the
whole village was there to hear the boys' triumphant return.
Well, it's better to travel in hope etc. What they actually got were
workmanlike singalongs, an instrumental medley that will ensure Altan
sleep soundly in their beds, and the spectacle of a grown man going for
notes he hadn't sung since he was in the Cubs. The Drouth -- catch them
before they make it big. You've plenty time.

TWO west coast painters are selling well here. Helen Turner's big
breezy skies and white sands of Rhum, Eigg and Skye are inspired by the
Colourists. Cadell is obviously her hero, and even Loch Ken comes in for
Mediterranean treatment.
Mussel Beds, Prestwick (acquired by Flemings) has a nice vigour. I
also like The Picnic, a more casual composition where you can feel the
sand in the cucumber sandwiches. A Spray of Gold Forsythia is another
noteworthy small picture, so too At Anchor, Tarbert where limpid wet
sand is captured with a sure touch.
Lin Pattullo weaves all her scenes into patterns, be they Venice or
Troon. She can overdo it but Seat in the Sun keeps this to a minimum, so
too Noon Doorways, Greece. Leone Cockburn's gallery at 21 Dean Park Mews
is the perfect setting for domestic pictures. You can see what they
would look like at home.

IS The Shark going soft and gumsy on his E-burg crowds? ''Do you
realise, the more seriously you take it, the more evil I become?''
That's what the legendarily-cruel Greg asked us, sensing a certain
uneasiness in the stalls when the Queen Mom seemed about to get hers.
But then what happens? Greg lets the old royal gimp off, that's what.
Same as he does with the woman in the balcony who keeps saying ''Wuh''
at inopportune moments. Having vaulted from the stage, Greg simply ends
up wagging a metaphorical finger at her. But when it comes to bigger,
more culpable targets, Greg's comic insights remain deeply wounding.
David Copperfield, John Major, Kevin Costner, supermodels, Tories,
Republicans: all were tortured and then killed by Greg Proops's barbed
tongue, a weapon as sharp as ever it was.

FROM last year's triumphal cast of skewed characters, there are but
two survivors: Mariella and Petra, the energetically-vapid Dutch MTV
presenters. Thankfully, Mel and Sue's trenchant powers of observation
remain wholly intact. Emma Thompson and Liz Hurley get theirs, along
with targets ranging from organic aristos in Tuscany to Home Counties
hip-hop home-girls.
Would it be accurate or fair to hail Mel and Sue as a latter-day
French and Saunders? No. They're much faster and fresher, zappier,
snappier. It might be more instructive to label them a post-feminist
ambient-techno re-mix of Joyce Grenfell and Victoria Wood. Or it might
not. Either way, when you see them, you'll say: ''Wham-bam, thank you,

''IT was OK,'' said Tommy and Davey, ''but there was too much story.''
They have a good point, for instead of concentrating on the magic in
Shakespeare's Tempest, Intimate Exchanges decided that they were going
to try and retell the whole story, in a child-sized lump, with a few
random glances at the original text. The result was rushed and at points
misunderstood, with too much meat and only a couple of chips.
There was too little Ariel, although his few appearances and songs
went down well, unlike Prospero's magic cagoul which didn't seem to
impress. The audience participation was popular, but a little hurried.
The younger members of the audience did come out with opinions about the
characters they had seen on stage, but they weren't captivated. They
were never offered  a chance to leave this world of flesh.

COOL, controlled strength is the hallmark of Ricochet's first piece,
Re-Coil. Choreographed by Russell Maliphant to a throbbing, drilling
soundscore (Andy Cowton), it deals in images of sustained composure shot
through with spasms of fast, dynamic movement. Almost sculptural in its
lines, this is complex, absorbing -- beautifully performed -- dance.
In complete, and gorgeous, contrast is E Muoio Disperato by Javier de
Frutos. Everyone -- men too -- dressed in short, flirty scarlet frocks.
And as Puccini's Tosca pours out anthems of passion, the five dancers
throw themselves into a malestrom of avid sex, jealousy and death where
resurrection comes in suctioning kisses that hoover bodies off the
floor. Wow! Brilliantly extravagant stuff, full of wit and clever,
clever movement all danced with feisty panache..
Ends Saturday.

SHY, apologetic and understated, Dan Freedman teeters prettily on the
deconstructionist tightrope, creating a form of comedy which is mostly
about comedy itself.
In other, plainer words, while Dan's act echoes that of many
contemporary stand-ups in lampooning kitschy seventies TV shows, his
does so with a knowing half-smile which seems to say: ''Isn't it a bit
sad that so many contemporary stand-ups are content to go for the easy
laugh by lampooning kitschy seventies TV shows?''
This is a difficult trick to pull off. Dan manages it, though. Yet
it's also one with an in-built tendency towards disappearing up its own
fundament. See him and you'll hope Dan doesn't vanish.

IS Tasty McDade Glasgow's answer to Archie Rice? Not quite, but
writers John Paul Leach and Ford Keirnan have certainly crafted a
memorable and richly-characterised entertainer in Tasty, so named
because of the slang for nice he picked up after two years ''shovelling
shit'' in London.
The two-hander is a polished production from Castlemilk People's
Theatre, with Pat Welsh subtly suggesting all the bottled-up resentments
of Tasty, a Scottish stand-up, emanating real menace. The play traces
his rise, inevitable fall and various dodgy dealings through the sixties
to the eighties, with Stephen McCole offering solid support in diverse
roles, from Mrs McDade to a Glasgwegian henchman.
The dark undertones of the piece are most obviously realised in the
spotlighted segments of Tasty's act, cruder than anything you'll find on
the Fringe -- perhaps more Glasgow's answer to Bernard Manning.

THE Scottish Office could face a legal challenge from the National
Farmers' Union of Scotland if it decides to adopt the same stance as the
Ministry of Agriculture south of the Border and change the rules
governing the allocation of sheep quota from the national reserve.
The industry was thrown into confusion on Wednesday night when the
Ministry, with no prior warning, announced it proposed to revise the
criteria for the ''developers'' category of the 1993 sheep and suckler
cow reserves.
The NFU in England and Wales has been involved in a long-running
dispute with the Ministry over the way in which the regulations covering
allocations from the national reserve were being applied.
Farmers who claimed to have given prior notice of their intention to
increase their flocks found they were not qualifying for a full
allocation. This meant that some of their ewes would not qualify for
sheep annual premium payments, currently worth more than #20 a head.
After failing to reach any agreement with the Ministry, the NFU in
England sought a judicial review and won its case when Mr Justice
MacPherson ruled that the UK quota regulations determining eligibility
for developers quota were unlawful.
The result is that the Ministry has decided to start again from square
one, which could mean some farmers being allocated less quota so that
others, who were unsuccessful in their original applications, can get an
allocation.
Scottish Office ministers were said yesterday to be urgently
considering the implications of all this for Scotland. Scottish
Agriculture Minister, the Earl of Lindsay, was in discussion with his
counterparts at the Ministry of Agriculture in Whitehall and promised a
further announcement as soon as possible.
The Scottish NFU, which did not take court action in Scotland over the
intitial complaints, announced yesterday that it was now consulting its
lawyers about developments south of the Border.
It seems unlikely that the Scottish Office would fail to fall in step
with Whitehall on this issue.
Mr John Ross, president of the NFUS, warned that the statement issued
by the Ministry of Agriculture in London could have serious implications
for some quota holders in Scotland. '' We are taking advice about
whether or not these moves can be challenged,'' he said.
''We fear that Scottish producers who hold quota quite legally could
face a frustrating period of uncertainty, with no firm guarantee of
compensation. This is unacceptable to us and the Scottish Office have
been told of our attitude.
Our aim is to see to it that all those with legitimate claims for
quota are satisfied without putting in danger the allocations already
made.''

<HEADLINE>Over-producing dairy farmers are warned of #2.8m penalty</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Milk has warned its dairy farmer members that those who were
over quota in the last ''milk year'' will face penalties totalling
#2.8m.
The company said the liability for levy would be shared among 750
members of the co-operative. It had not yet calculated individual
liability, which would be applied according to the degree of
over-production in each case.
An estimated threshold of 4.5% of quota will apply, which means that
levy will only become payable by individual producers once they have
exceeded quota by by that amount.
This is possible because some producers will have failed to use all
their quota allowance. At Scottish Milk the over-quota figure was 12,600
litres. At a UK level the total liability for levy has been
provisionally calculated at just over #48m.
There are indications that some over-producers in Scotland could be
facing bills in the region of #15,000.
Andrew Macfarlane of quota brokers Hayes, McCubbin Macfarlane,
Aberdeen, said the figures showed how important it was for farmers to
try to stick to their quota allocation.
''I was surprised at how many Scottish Milk members were over-target,
but I imagine that many of them would be only fractionally over. ''
Those who were more than fractionally over quota would come to realise
that it could be a risky policy, he said. Some of those who had a close
shave should be considering buying extra quota now while prices were
about the 60p a litre mark.
In England, Milk Marque, the dominant co-operative, has warned that it
may have to break some of its supply contracts because of a fall in milk
production due to the continuing drought.
Scottish Milk has also noted a drop of between one and two per cent
this month and say it is monitoring the position on a daily basis.
Meanwhile, Scottish farmers can expect payments of more than #148m
under the Arable Area Payments Scheme.
Despite an overshoot of 3.8% in the non-less favoured areas sector,
leading to the application, of penalties, payments will be #33m up on
last year.
Concessions negotiated by the Government mean that penalties will be
imposed at 50% of what would be the normal rate, but Agriculture
Minister the Earl of Lindsay warned this would be the last opportunity
for farmers to get their claims down to base area figures before full
penalties begin to be applied next year.
He expressed disappointment at the failure to get production aligned
with base area figures. There was no overshoot in the less favoured
area.
Scottish NFU cereals convener David Jack responded that it was wrong
that Scottish producers should be penalised at a time when the grain
market was seriously under-supplied.
''A permanent solution must be found which will allow Scottish
producers to fulfil market demands without the threat of penalties,'' he
said.
The Scottish Office Agriculture Department expects to make the first
tranche of oilseeds payments to some 2000 farmers within the next few
weeks.
The final payment for oilseeds will be made next spring, based on
figures laid down by the European Commission. The vast majority of
payments for cereals, protein crops and set-aside will be made over a
period of weeks beginning in mid-November.

GERMAN chemical giant Hoechst said yesterday that strong volume sales
and higher prices helped half-year pre-tax profit to nearly double to
DM2100m and forecast 1995 results will top 1994.
''For 1995 as a whole we expect clearly higher results than in the
previous year,'' Hoechst said in its interim report. A year ago, when
the industry began roaring out of recession, Hoechst posted a DM1360m
net profit.
First half group pre-tax profit, excluding all business from newly
acquired US drugs group Marion Merrell Dow, surged 96% and was an
improvement on 1989's record half-year result, Hoechst said. The return
on sales jumped to 8.1% from 4.4%.

DON &amp; Low Nonwovens has announced an #8m investment to double the
production of non-woven fabrics at its Forfar factory.
The company produces a range of tough polypropelyne fabrics under the
Daltex trade name. These materials are used for a variety of purposes
such as protective clothing, roof underlay and covering horticultural
crops.
The new investment should create more than 20 jobs at the Forfar
factory, which currently employs 70 people.
Don &amp; Low is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Montell Polyolefins, a joint
venture between Shell and the Italian chemicals giant Montedison which
is based in the Netherlands.
It manufactures the Daltex range of materials by feeding polypropylene
granules into machinery that converts them into long fibres. These are
are then bonded into sheets by heated rollers.
Once the new machinery becomes fully operational next year the
company's turnover should rise to about #20m.

AMERADA-HESS has begun commercial oil production from its Fife field
in the North Sea. Oil started flowing on Wednesday night and output is
expected to peak at more than 40,000 barrels per day within a few
months.
The Fife field, located 211 miles South-east of Aberdeen, is expected
to yield 34 million barrels over its planned seven-year life.
Instead of being piped ashore, the crude will be pumped into a tanker
moored permanently alongside the production platform. This has been
converted to serve as a Floating Production and Offloading Vessel.
US-based Amerada Hess is the third largest oil producer in the UK
after Shell and BP, with gross output of 300,000 barrels per day.
It has an 85% stake in the Fife field. Premier Oil of the UK holds the
remaining 15%.

A FALL in the retail price index had been expected in July, the main
month for summer sales in the High Street. But prices fell by more than
had been expected, largely because of the large drop in seasonal food
prices, which knocked 0.2% off the RPI for the second month in a row.
All the main measures of inflation were unchanged, but the annual
rates were sharply higher than last summer. Headline inflation is now
3.5% against 2.3% in July last year. Over the same period, underlying
inflation has risen from 2.2% to 2.8%, taking it into the upper half of
the Government's target range of 1% to 4%.
A number of factors suggest that inflation will rise further between
now and the first half of next year, though it may taper off thereafter.
The recent sharp drop in seasonal food prices is likely to reverse
itself with the exceptionally hot weather threatening to restrict
supplies. Potato prices, which fell by almost half in July, are rising
again.
So yesterday's benign figures may have to be paid for later in the
year when prices will come under pressure from other factors, such as
higher prices at the factory gate and an easing of competitive
pressures.
Figures earlier in the week showed that the core rate of factory gate
price inflation, excluding the food, drink, tobacco, and petroleum
industries, was running at 5%, its highest rate for four years, and
substantially above the headline rate of inflation.
It takes time for factory gate price increases to feed through to the
High Street, but the expectation is that in the first half of next year
underlying inflation will be around 3.25% or higher. Some economists
fear that it could continue rising until it is above the 4% upper limit
of the target range, but at this stage they are in a minority.
Headline inflation could hit 4% within the next few months. As this is
the measure generally used in pay bargaining it could result in second
round inflationary effects through higher labour costs, which would
frustrate hopes that inflation would peak next year and then gradually
decline.
This is the Bank of England's big fear and explains the persistance of
the Governor, Eddie George, in pressing the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Kenneth Clarke, to raise interest rates.
The argument has been going Mr Clarke's way, however. Yesterday's
unchanged inflation rates followed the first rise in seasonally adjusted
unemployment for 23 months. The partial recovery in sterling, sparked
off by the new-found strength of the dollar, has mitigated one of the
Bank of England's biggest concerns.
To some extent both inflation and unemployment data are lagging
indicators as they reflect economic events that have taken place. For
this reason the most significant figures this week were those for retail
sales.
For most of the period since last autumn retail sales have been
falling away gently, but have picked up smartly recently, with rises of
0.4% in both June and July. In the latest three months sales were 0.7%
higher than in the previous month.
Discounting in the summer sales and the warm weather, which has
boosted trade in clothing and footwear, have been positive factors, but
even after allowing for these influences it does seem that the consumer
is coming back to life.
The effects of the National Lottery, which ate into traditional areas
of retail spending, are beginning to be absorbed, and the tax increases
and higher interest rates, which have held back spending, will soon
become part of economic history.
Most independent economists envisage consumer spending picking up over
the next two years and the first signs of this may be in evidence.
Welcome as this will be to the sorely tried retail trade, it will have
the effect of reducing competitive pressures. More of the factory gate
price inflation in the pipeline will be passed on to the consumer as a
result.
The evidence of yesterday's inflation data was that discounting in the
summer sales was shallower than last year, except for clothing and
footwear, where there may have been a weather-related overhang of stocks
from the spring. Discounting of household and leisure goods were
noticeably less this summer than last.
Goods sector inflation picked up from 2.4% in June to 2.8%. Food price
inflation was a little easier, thanks to the sharp fall in seasonal
foods.

THE retail price index fell by 0.5% to 149.1 (January 1987=100) last
month, the first time that it had dropped since July of last year. As a
result, the headline inflation rate was unchanged at 3.5%, a slightly
better outcome than the City had expected.
Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, was
also unchanged at 2.8%, as was the new RPIY rate at 2.3%. This measure
of inflation, favoured by the Bank of England, excludes indirect and
council taxes as well as mortgage payments.
Though benign, the figures had little impact on financial markets
where it is recognised that activity indicators and movements in
sterling are likely to be the main determinants of interest rate policy
in the short run.
The July figures benefited from a further sharp decline in seasonal
food prices, which fell by 6.6% after a drop of 7.7% in June. This had
the effect of reducing the RPI by 0.2% for the second month in a row.
Potato prices, which had risen sharply earlier in the year, fell by
the better part of 50% between June and July. Overall food prices fell
by 0.8%, but there was a slight increase in the price of non-seasonal
foods.
Housing costs dropped by 0.3% between June and July, mainly because of
the fall in house prices. Household service costs declined by 1.1% on
the back of lower charges for telephone calls.
The summer sales were a major factor in reducing the retail price
index. Clothing and footwear prices fell by 4.6%, their largest fall in
any July. Last year prices declined by 4.2%.
But overall discounting in the High Streets was shallower than last
year. Household goods prices fell by 1% against 1.7% last year.
Moreover, leisure goods dropped by just 0.2% compared with 1.4% last
year as prices of books and newspapers rose sharply in contrast to falls
last year when the price-cutting war was getting under way.
The main increases came in alcoholic drinks, fares, and travel costs,
leisure services, and personal goods and services.
Underlying inflation is currently in the upper half of the
Government's 1% to 4% target range and is expected to rise between now
and early next year before falling gradually.
According to the Bank of England, the Government will miss its target
of reducing inflation to 2.5% or less by the end of the current
Parliament in the spring of next year.

INDEPENDENT Insurance electrified the insurance sector yesterday with
its attack on the rate-cutting now taking place with scant regard to the
quality of risk or the source of the business.
Chief executive Michael Bright said it was his firm view this will
result in casualties in the market, so Independent is prepared to work
only with those brokers and clients looking for a consistent approach,
and who are prepared to take responsibility for controlling their risks.
He is speaking from a position of considerable strength, with the
Glasgow-registered company chaired by former Ivory &amp; Sime director Garth
Ramsay increasing half time profits by 58% to #16m.
Even if investment gains and losses are excluded, the underlying
improvement is 48% on a 53% rise in gross premium income at #201m.
Almost all the motor account business is non-standard, such as
insuring the Stagecoach and Greater Manchester Buses fleets, multi-axled
transporters and specialist cars where the rate is less important than
service and advice as far as the purchaser is concerned.
It also insures the Williams Formula One motor racing team for
everything apart from the track driving.
As for general car insurance, Independent reckons rates will fall
until this time next year, with the market confused by the emergence of
about 50 direct selling companies.
This contradicts what the industry majors are saying, although on
Tuesday the largest insurance broker Sedgwick was inclined to be on
Independent's side of the fence.
It acquired the UK business of Aegon last autumn, which brought in
valuable affinity group insurance such as static caravan business which
brings in a useful #15m of annual premium business.
Property insurance again is at the specialist end, although there was
a heartstopper earlier this week, but Government House in Bermuda was
unscathed by the hurricane.
Full year profits should increase by #10m to #33m. The interim
dividend has been raised 15% to 4.6p with 11p likely as a total for a
4.2% yield, with the shares at a new peak of 328p.

THE Opposition SNP group on Falkirk District Council is to ask the
Accounts Commission to investigate the proposed sale of four
council-owned business parks by Labour-controlled Central Region.
Earlier this week, a judge at the Court of Session refused to grant
Labour-controlled Falkirk District Council and the new Falkirk Council
an interim interdict to stop the move to create a joint-venture company
with John Laing Property Ventures Ltd.
Under the deal, the region would own 50% of the new company and
councillors would be represented on a new joint-venture board.
SNP group leader Councillor David Alexander said the private company
concerned had been very closely associated with Central Regional Council
in the past, having done major projects such as the extension of the
Thistle Centre.
''It concerns us that it was the only company invited to participate.
We believe that may be in conflict with the principle of tendering and
if it is not outwith the letter of the law, it is certainly outwith the
spirit,'' he claimed.
The two councils had argued in court that the change of status for two
of the parks, in Falkirk and Larbert, could limit significantly the
freedom of the new unitary authority..

FIFE Council will have a management and decision-making structure
which its leaders believe is unique in Scottish local government.
A full meeting of the 92 members of the Labour-controlled council is
expected to approve the proposals in outline later today.
The structure is designed to end empire building and in-fighting
between different service departments. To achieve this, it puts them in
various strategic groups headed by corporate managers.
For example, social work, housing, education, and leisure and
recreation will be pulled together by a social strategy. The new
council's Labour leader Alex Rowley said they had taken their time to
draw up a new model and had consulted very widely because they were
determined the new council would not be a re-vamped version of the
regional council with the district services bolted on.

BANK of Scotland has replaced corporate finance guru John Berry, who
was poached by the Clydesdale Bank, from its own ranks.
Dumbarton-born Peter Cummings, 40, has moved from Carlisle to take up
the post of director of corporate banking (west) at Bank of Scotland's
Glasgow chief office.
He will head one of the bank's three structured finance teams. The
teams, established in 1990 in Glasgow, Edinburgh and London, allowed
Bank of Scotland to become the market leader in the provision of bank
debt for management buy-outs.
Mr Cummings, who joined Bank of Scotland in 1974, spent 10 years with
the UK banking corporate division in Glasgow, working on the larger
credits as well as management buy-outs and buy-ins.
He was also responsible for the bank's special duties department in
the West of Scotland, which involved him in major corporate
restructurings and receiverships, as well as substantial property
transactions.
Most recently, he was a regional manager in Carlisle, where his remit
included business development in Cumbria, with particular emphasis on
the medium and large enterprise sector.
Stewart Henderson, head of branch operations at Bank of Scotland's
Glasgow chief office, said: ''We are probably fortunate to have someone
as strong as Peter to replace John Berry.''
Mr Cummings said: ''It is indeed a privilege and a challenge to be
working with the structured finance team in Glasgow, who have earned
Bank of Scotland the reputation in the market for projecting a
pro-active, sensible and commercial approach to getting the deal done.''
During Mr Berry's time, the nine-strong structured finance team in
Glasgow participated in more than one deal a month. The average deal
size was about #3m.

SOUTHERN Water is risking the wrath of its drought-hit customers by
planning a share buy-back campaign, when they would undoubtedly want to
see the money spent on further improvements to their water and sewerage
systems.
Chairman William Courtney pointed out to shareholders at the annual
meeting that two-thirds of Southern's post-tax profits had been ploughed
back into the investment programme.
Through innovation and financial control the group had made savings in
investment spending which would produce a customer dividend of extra
works, such as reducing the risk of foul flooding of homes.
This would be balanced by the buy-back of up to 10% of the group's
shares to benefit shareholders.
Southern's decision follows a trend by other water companies.
Anglian Water bought 10% of its equity this week for #162m, and
Yorkshire and Severn Trent have obtained shareholder permission to do
so.
Southern shares gained 10p to 688p and the water sector as a whole
moved ahead.
But customers are likely to take a dim view of the proposed buy-back,
even though Southern's investment plan calls for the expenditure of
#1200m over the next five years.
Sussex has seen the driest summer since records began in 1727, and
Southern says demand for water has been three times the previous peak. A
hosepipe ban is in force.
Mr Courtney said current year trading had started well and he was
confident for the future.

Last month, the Wolverhampton-based minerals to construction group
disclosed plans to sell or float off the business as it no longer
regarded housing as a core division.
Tarmac yesterday expressed its appreciation of Mr Lovering, who joined
the group in 1993.
Chief executive Neville Simms said: ''John has helped me in the
re-alignment of the group and in improving its performance.
''Our decision to divest the housing division clearly offers the
opportunity of a fresh challenge for him to pursue, and we wish him
well.''
Mr Lovering said: ''I have thoroughly enjoyed my spell at Tarmac. I
came to help Neville Simms set a new strategic direction for the group
and to contribute to a real improvement in performance.''

BRITISH holidaymakers will have to pay less to find a place in the sun
this winter.
Several top tour operators yesterday launched a price war by
drastically cutting the cost of overseas holidays.
The Thomson group admitted it is having to make the price reductions
to attract business.
But even with big discounts, holidaymakers are booking at the last
possible moment.
''While Thomson Tour Operations expects to achieve a modest increase
in bookings for the summer 1995 season as a whole, in a market which is
unlikely to show any growth, a higher-than-expected level of price
discounting in the market is proving necessary to achieve late sales,
resulting in significantly lower tour operating margins,'' said the
Canadian-based parent group Thomson Corporation.
The company said winter bookings had started well and were 7% higher
than those for the winter of 1994/95 at this time last year.
The group's travel agent Lunn Poly was faring well and Britannia
Airways was operating at near-maximum capacity.
Lunn Poly, Britain's largest travel agency, is offering a 10% discount
on anyone who registers for a 1996 summer holiday before brochures are
released on September 1.
For a #5 deposit, customers can tell the travel agent where they want
to go, when, for how long and whether they want a hotel or self
catering.
Then when the tour operators like Airtours and First Choice release
their brochures, Lunn Poly will fix a break according to those details.
AT Mays, the UK's third-largest travel agent, also pitched itself in
the summer 1996 price war yesterday with discounts of up to 10%.

PEARSON provided a boost to British Sky Broadcasting's share price
yesterday after it confirmed it is preparing to sell all its directly
owned shares in the satellite broadcaster. This represents 9.75% of the
equity and is worth #577m at last night's closing price of 345p.
The end result will be that the BSkyB shares will be included in the
FTSE-100 Index and be automatically bought by investment funds tracking
the index.
The publishing and entertainment group has brought its half-time
figures forward to this morning. Pearson's share price yesterday fell
11p to 622p in anticipation of a disappointing outcome.
BSKyB's own pre-tax profits for the full year jumped 67% to #155m on
turnover 41% ahead at #778m. While the impetus at present is coming from
rising subscriber income with another 686,000 signing up in the year to
June for a total of 4.16 million, the medium term will see increasing
benefits from new products such as digital satellite broadcasting and
joint ventures with other companies including cable operators.
Chief executive Sam Chisolm said he was looking at extending services
beyond entertainment into business areas such as banking.
He took a swipe at Channel 5 aspirants. ''I would be feeling a little
queasy at present. It will be a test of their bottle to pay a lot for
the franchise when we pay nothing.''
Because of past losses, BSkyB can accumulate well over #450m of
pre-tax profits before it need pay mainstream UK corporation tax -- not
bad for a foreign-owned company deriving almost all its income in
Britain.
Revenue per subscriber rose 20%, helped by last October's price
increase. Mr Chisolm would not comment on to whether there will be
another rise this autumn on the back of a hefty promotional push
including a plethora of sports programmes where Sky has acquired the
rights. These include rugby tours and Scottish football.
Programming costs jumped 42% to #328m although this is an area which
can provide a substantial amount of profit flexibility.
The churn rate or the proportion of subscribers dropping out has been
reduced to under 13% which compares with almost 40% for cable users.
Income was boosted by an overall 19% rise in advertising revenue with
second-half growth increasing by 23%. The quality of earnings is
underlined by subscriber income amounting to 75% of the total at #582m
and having made the investment in a dish, people are usually reluctant
to give up.
Cash generation is substantial and this has enabled the company to cut
debt by #120m to #780m in the last six months and, as well, it supports
the contention that BSkyB will have a high payout ratio to the benefit
of the parent company, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
There is a first final dividend of 2.5p following last December's
flotation at 256p.

SCOTTISH factories have won the lion's share of a massive BT order for
computer equipment worth up to #180m.
Compaq's Erskine factory near Glasgow will supply up to 30,000 DeskPro
desk-top personal computers and servers to BT over the next three years,
worth an estimated #60m.
IBM's Greenock factory picked up a #50m order for 25,000 Pentium
desk-top computers and 13,000 Thinkpad lap-tops.
Toshiba won a third order for 22,000 notebook computers worth more
than #30m. These will be supplied by its factory at Regensburg in
Germany.
Computacenter -- an information technology services company which
arranged the BT order -- said it was ''potentially the largest of its
kind in Europe''.
The deals with US-based Compaq and Japanese-owned Toshiba are the
largest contracts ever signed by these companies.
But the #110m of new orders for Compaq and IBM will not automatically
create more jobs at their Scottish factories.
''We have no plans to increase our head count as a direct result of
this order,'' a Compaq spokeswoman said.
She noted that the Erskine plant had already taken on 300 staff over
the last six months, boosting its total workforce to 1300. The factory
produces 80% of Compaq computers sold in Europe.
A spokesman for IBM's Greenock plant, which employs 3000 people, also
ruled out the automatic creation of new jobs as a result of the BT
order.
The Greenock factory is the main supplier of IBM computers to Europe,
Africa, and the Middle East. IBM is based in the United States.
BT launched a tender for desktop computer equipment to serve both
front office and back office functions in January, and eventually
ordered equipment from three different suppliers in order to serve a
variety of needs.
''No single manufacturer could supply the best product in technical
and value terms across the board,'' said Marina Hinchcliffe, the head of
BT's Desktop Project.
''We did not want to compromise our standards and therefore chose the
supplier we thought best for each of the different ranges,'' she added.
Computacenter said the overall BT contract was potentially worth #60m
per year over three years -- a total of #180m.
But the three equipment suppliers were more conservative, estimating
the total value of the deal at about #140m.

COMPUTER giant Sun Microsystems, which is gearing up to satisfy the
clamour for access to the Internet information superhighway, yesterday
announced its biggest-ever expansion in Scotland.
It is investing #5m in state-of-the-art technology for the manufacture
of printed circuit boards at its European headquarters at Linlithgow.
Sun is taking on another 150 employees at the plant -- the largest
single increase in staff since the California-based company came to
Scotland six years ago.
Linlithgow, Sun's sole supplier of the European and Japanese markets,
made nearly $3000m (#1952m) worth of products in the year to end-June.
It is responsible for about half of Sun's worldwide production.
The manufacture of Linlithgow's two main products, desk-top
work-stations and servers, will be boosted by advances in the production
of their component printed circuit boards.
Powerful ''gateway'' servers, which allow users to access the
information superhighway, are made at Linlithgow.
Sun's recruitment of engineers, materials specialists, and technicians
during the next few months will allow the plant to ramp up production to
meet increased demand. Linlithgow is also moving to seven-day working.
The group as a whole has produced more than half of the gateway
servers in use around the globe. Three-quarters of all Internet
applications rely on Sun technology.
Because of the Internet's nature, its rapid growth is almost
impossible to chart. However, according to one estimate, 27.5 million
people could send an e-mail message on the Internet at the end of last
year. By the spring, this figure was believed to be in excess of 32
million.
Sun employees generate more than one million messages each day on
their internal Net.
California-based chief executive Scott McNealy credited the Internet
and its associated technology with driving much of Sun's current
momentum.
Sun recently announced an 81% increase in annual net profits to $356m
(#232m), on turnover which was 26% higher at $5900m (#3838m). The
average revenue generated by each of Sun's 14,500 employees was more
than $400,000 (#260,230).
Bob Coe at Linlithgow, who is vice-president of European operations
and worldwide manufacturing, said: ''This is the kind of performance
which gives us confidence to keep investing in our future.''
The latest #5m technology upgrade will take total investment in the
Scottish plant to more than $75m (#49m).

A VERY embarrassed newspaper yesterday admitted an article highly
critical of Mr Tony Blair's leadership, purporting to be by former
Shadow Cabinet member Bryan Gould, had in fact been written by the son
of the Tory Home Secretary.
The London Evening Standard offered profuse apologies and launched ''a
full-scale inquiry'' to discover how the mix-up of articles came about.
The apparent attack by Mr Gould was all the more wounding because it
coincided with expressions of discontent about the Blair leadership from
other parts of the Labour Party.
The article that appeared on Monday under Mr Gould's by-line was the
work of Mr Nick Howard, the 19-year-old son of Home Secretary Michael
Howard.
It appears his uncommissioned faxed article arrived in the offices of
the Standard before Mr Gould's office faxed over his commissioned
article and was taken to be it. So a fierce critique of Mr Blair's
leadership hit the streets under the wrong name.
Mr Nick Howard is waiting to go to Oxford University and has written
the occasional piece for the Standard about being young and living in
London.
Mr Stewart Steven, the Standard editor, offered a whole-hearted
apology to Mr Gould and said he wished to assure him and the Labour
Party that ''there was no malign intention''.
This first article had no name on it, according to Mr Steven. When the
genuine article arrived later it was never put into the system, as it
was apparently assumed that it was just a re-run of the earlier one.
Labour's deputy leader John Prescott suggested that Nick Howard
perpetuated the lie that his piece was Mr Gould's piece. However,
Conservative Central Office said the Howard family had gone off to
France on holiday before the article appeared and did not know about the
mix-up.
Mr Gould, back from New Zealand where he now lives, to speak at
various venues including the Labour party conference fringe, went on
radio and television to complain: ''There is not a single word that I
wrote.''
Mr Steven said it was a genuine mistake but ''during the flurry of
edition time with faxes flying in every direction there is always the
risk of this sort of thing happening''.
He added that the Nick Howard piece showed ''something of the
political maturity of his father''.
Labour leadership sources who have not had a great week, with
complaints about the Blair style of leadership emanating from various
quarters in the party, were jubilant and referred the media to the first
paragraph of Mr Gould's genune article: ''Tony Blair has had a brilliant
first year as Labour's leader. He looks like a racing certainty to take
Labour to their first General Election victory in over 20 years.''
However, later, he writes about ''a more serious underlying
dissatisfaction'', not so much with the leader as with his ''safety
first'' strategy and asks: ''How much reason would there be to celebrate
a Labour victory if it were won by abandoning anything recognisably
Labour and by pretending to be a sort of sanitised Tory Party?''
*The report on the attack on Tony Blair which appeared in Tuesday's
Herald was based on information supplied by the Press Association news
agency and was published by The Herald in good faith.

THE drycleaning business remains slack and reorganisation costs have
again bit into Johnson Group Cleaners. The company is the largest
drycleaner in the UK and US and one of Britain's leaders in textile
rental.
Johnson, whose Scottish drycleaning outlets operate under the Pullars
banner, disappointed the market with half-year profits down from #8.23m
to #7.2m before tax after a #863,000 charge for reorganisation in the
US.
Interest charges also took their toll, rising from #473,000 to
#592.000. Aside from this, though, the drycleaning businesses, which
have been rejigged on both sides of the Atlantic, continue to be flat.
Textile rental, in contrast, is performing well but, overall, sales
rose only 1.9%. Operating profits ahead of costs and interest barely
crept ahead from #8.59m to #8.68m and then only with the help of
#463,000 from Stalbridge Linen Services, acquired in March 1995.
Chairman Tony Greer and his team are working to improve the return
from dry cleaning but said there is no sign of any ''feel good factor''
returning to the High Street. The interim dividend stays at 2.8p.
Johnson had hoped for better things but goals for the drycleaning
sector at home and in the US remain stubbornly unfulfilled. There was a
reasonable start in the UK in the early part of the year but, as was the
experience of many retailers, it proved to be a false dawn though UK
profits at the operating level did advance from #7.2m to #7.65m.

SOUTH AFRICA: President Nelson Mandela is to divorce his estranged
wife Winnie, four months after firing her from his Cabinet, reports said
yesterday. A South African radio station said lawyer Ismail Ayob
confirmed he had been retained by Mandela to arrange a settlement.
He said he has been told to open discussions with Winnie's lawyers and
to handle the issue ''sensitively''. Winnie's spokesman, Alan Reynolds,
said: ''They were hardly married. They had two years of marriage before
he went to prison and they were together a year before they separated.''

I DECIDED to trade in my soon-to-be five-year-old car and a month ago
went to my local dealer from whom I had purchased and had my cars
serviced for the last 15 years.
Over a cup of coffee I wept with him as he described how his margins
had been cut over the last years.
As a ''loyal and valued customer'' he offered me top price of #5000 as
a trade-in. Out of curiosity I visited another two dealers who offered
#6300 and #6500 respectively.
Taking the latter, I subsequently collected my new car on August 1 and
noticed my previous car in his forecourt at #6995. No complaints about
this #495 mark-up, but at how much would my original dealer have priced
it?

STUART TROTTER'S article on the Labour Party's chances in the next
General Election contained references to the possibility of Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton losing his seat.
Two elections have been fought within the boundaries of the new West
Edinburgh parliamentary constituency in the past two years. On both
occasions all four parties fought every ward.
In the 1994 regional elections the Liberal Democrats polled 36%
compared to the Conservatives' 25% with Labour in third place on 20%.
This April, with the Labour Party at an all time high in the opinion
polls, the Liberal Democrats once again outpolled the Conservatives
while the Labour Party remained in third place.
From the glum look on Lord James's face at the count on April 6 there
was no doubt that he realised the threat in his seat was from the
Liberal Democrats who have been a close second at the last three General
Elections and now hold five of the council seats in the new West
Edinburgh compared to the Conservatives' two.
Labour Party claims that they can leapfrog the Liberal Democrats to
take the seat have been shown to be without substance in the past and
should have been dismissed in this analysis of possible gains under new
parliamentary boundaries.

FORMER Far East prisoners of war yesterday called off an appeal to the
British public to boycott Japanese goods as they prepared for a sombre
weekend of commemorations to remember those who never came home.
The historic apology by Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama this
week has given hope to the 16,000 survivors that a compromise on
compensation payments can be agreed.
The veterans called on Mr Murayama to set up a compensation fund so
that Japanese companies which benefited from Allied slave labour can
contribute.
In a letter to Mr Murayama, solicitor Martyn Day, representing the
Japanese Labour Camps Survivors' Association and the Association of
British Civilian Internees Far East Region, suggested that the Japanese
Government pay a large sum into the fund, which victims could claim
against.
''If you were to set up such a fund, there would be no question, in my
view, that the world community would see this as an appropriate
gesture,'' he said.
''With the events of the last few days, the PoWs and internees had
thought of encouraging a boycott of Japanese goods here in Britain to
try and press you into resolving the compensation issue.
''Having thought more about this, and having considered further the
strides you have taken to have your government and country come to terms
with its past, it has been decided that such a step would be
inappropriate.''
Meanwhile, Scotland's biggest commemoration of the end of the Second
World War 50 years ago takes place in Edinburgh on Sunday.
The Sunset Ceremony on the Esplanade of Edinburgh Castle will be the
climax of events north of the Border and will be attended by 9000
veterans.
Preparations for this and many other events in Scotland have been made
by a dedicated team at Army HQ Scotland at Craigiehall, South
Queensferry.
Major Selby Macduff-Duncan, projects officer, and his staff of six
have overseen participation from all three Services in 166 events
throughout Scotland to mark the anniversary of VJ Day.
One of the unit's biggest tasks has been issuing all the tickets for
the Sunset Ceremony. There has been a huge demand and there is a reserve
list.
Major Macduff-Duncan says it was not as simple as going to the theatre
and paying for a ticket. Veterans were asked to complete a form in which
they gave their former units.
The result is that veterans with a common bond will find themselves
with old comrades. Associations have been grouped together.
Typical of the problems the team is having to deal with are details of
medals. A wife cleaning her husband's medals called frantically because
she got the ribbons confused. Some medals have been lost and need to be
replaced; ribbons have become frayed and some veterans are struggling to
get into the uniforms they wore during the war.
A Tartan Jumbo airlift has been organised to take 373 veterans to
London on Saturday for the ceremonies there and bring them back to
Edinburgh that evening.
The Tartan Jumbo travellers will then attend the national service at
St Giles' Cathedral on Sunday afternoon and the Sunset Ceremony. Both
events on Sunday are to be attended by the Princess Royal and Commander
Tim Laurence.
More than 600 serving soldiers will take part in the musical
commemoration on the Esplanade and it will be followed by a fireworks
display.

I NOTICED the junior Transport Minister, Steven Norris, informing us
the other day that questions of rail safety are ''a matter for
Railtrack''. As a streetwise fellow, Mr Norris at least knows when he is
talking nonsense.
We are used to the Tories hiding behind quangoes and agencies which
they have created largely for that purpose. I object, for instance, to
writing to Michael Forsyth about a serious problem in Scotland's prisons
and getting the reply instead from a civil servant whose vested interest
is in defending the record of the service which he runs.
Similarly, complaints to Peter Lilley about the crassness of the Child
Support Agency -- and of which he is the single parent -- are replied to
by the chief executive of the agency itself. The idea of the Minister
initiating inquiries about the effects of his own policies is a thing of
the past. Nothing to do with us, guv, is the standard response.
But I draw the line at rail safety. No quango, agency or
pre-privatisation PLC can carry the can for the dreadful things that are
now going on in the railway industry. Even bungling Bob Horton, chairman
of Railtrack and disappointingly absent from our screens this week, is a
target scarcely worth shooting peas at.
Tory Ministers alone have fragmented the railways, with all the risks
to services and safety which that entails. And if, heaven forbid, the
chickens come home to roost before this madness is called off, then only
Tory Ministers will be held accountable. They are playing for high
stakes and it is too late for them to leave this table.
The leaked Railtrack documents which Henry MacLeish has been
publicising this week add up to an indictment which soothing words do
not begin to counter. The rhetorical question is whether we should give
credence to what alarmed railway managers are telling one another, as
opposed to what their bosses are now telling the public. Take your pick.
It is the language of these documents which is so startling. Senior
managers involved in safety are accustomed to speaking and writing in
measured tones. To find one asking his colleagues ''whether at some very
short time in the future they really want to stand in the dock following
a major disaster'' is extraordinary. A cri de coeur, I would say.
If I were Steve Norris (or Sir George Young or Brian Mawhinney), I
would listen to that cry rather than bluster or buck-pass. The dock will
be big enough for all of them.
Most of the problems which are identified in the documents were
foreseen and described in a seminal report by the Health and Safety
Executive on rail privatisation in 1993. It was this crucial issue, the
fragmentation of ownership and therefore responsibility, which deeply
concerned its authors.
Their conclusions were chilling: ''There can be no confidence that
risk will be effectively controlled right from the start and that
important matters do not fall between the safety arrangements of the
various parties. The consequences of failing to achieve adequate systems
of control will be seen in increased risk on the railway system and the
likelihood of an increase in the numbers, and possibly also the
severity, of accidents.''
A bigger man than John MacGregor might have been sufficiently alarmed
by that warning to reconsider the wisdom of creating a fragmented and
therefore inherently less safe network. But MacGregor saw the report as
a political irritation, accepted its 38 recommendations -- he could
hardly have done otherwise -- and claimed this as an exoneration of the
safety case for rail privatisation.
It was no such thing. The continuing truth is that these 38 measures,
and probably quite a few more, are required in order to make the new
fragmented railway as safe as the former integrated railway. Where is
the gain in that? Even then, accepting these crucial safeguards in the
House of Commons is a lot easier than implementing them on the ground.
The difficulties are compounded by the zeal to privatise just about
everything. So we find, in the case of the potentially disastrous
incident at Hitchin, that the maintenance project was not being managed
by railway personnel (as in the past) but by a company called Alistair
Graham Associates which none of the people I know in the railway
industry has hitherto heard of.
To railway professionals, details of the Hitchin report makes almost
unbelievable reading. ''The Project Manager does not have a full rule
book . . . His understanding of operational safety is in doubt (to say
the least)'' . . . There were three different versions of the times on
which the contractors would have possession of the track.
As every railway manager knows from his first day in the job, the
question of ''possession'' -- the formal taking over of the track by
contractors -- is fundamental to the running of a safe railway. Everyone
involved has to be absolutely clear about where and when it begins and
ends.
''The advice of the Solicitor has been sought,'' the report continues.
''His opinion is that although agency personnel are employed by their
agency, they are controlled and directed by Railtrack . . .
Consequently, the Solicitor is of the opinion that it is Railtrack's
duty to ensure that the personnel they use are totally competent . . .''
That, along with much else in these reports, should give potential
investors in Railtrack a good deal to think about. Less than nine months
before the Tories intend to sell off Railtrack lock, stock and
signal-box, one of their own managers is ''strongly suggesting that you
take immediate and professional safety advice from competent safety
professionals''. Very reassuring!
I also wonder how many incidents there have been that we don't know
about. One report states for instance: ''We have already had two very
serious incidents at Bow which, but for the final link in the chain,
could have been another Clapham. Recent incidents in Scotland, among
other places, add to the above list of near misses.''
Details please -- from Ministers, preferably, rather those in
Railtrack who are merely implementing the daft and dangerous dogma of
fragmentation for privatisation.

<HEADLINE>New heart warning for smokers</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976830550</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE-AGED smokers are far more likely to suffer heart attacks than
had previously been thought, according to a major new report.
Five times as many smokers in their 30s and 40s suffer heart attacks
as non-smokers, it was claimed. Doctors had believed smokers in this age
group faced a three-fold greater risk.
The findings, published in the British Medical Journal, emerge from
the largest study of heart-attack survivors yet carried out in the UK.
More than 10,000 hospital patients who had suffered heart attacks were
questioned about their smoking habits.
Smokers in their 70s had twice as many heart attacks as non-smokers,
the study found, and heart attacks were three times as common among
smokers in their 50s.
However, there were five times as many smokers in their 30s and 40s
who had heart attacks as non-smokers, with the figure more than six
times at the lower end of the scale.
Smoking low-tar cigarettes did not diminish the risk of a heart
attack, the study found.
Dr Rory Collins of the British Heart Foundation, a senior research
fellow at Oxford University, said: ''The risk of a heart attack in a
young middle-aged smoker compared with a non-smoker is much greater than
we had previously thought.
''We are talking about a five-fold increase and, because the study
involved very large numbers, the estimate is a reliable one.
''It is particularly important in middle age. In terms of years of
life lost, smoking has an enormous effect.''
The research was conducted jointly by the British Heart Foundation,
the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, and the Medical Research Council.
Dr Collins, who helped organise the study, said an estimated 20,000
people under the age of 50 suffered heart attacks in Britain each year.
He warned that the figures for smokers suffering heart attacks in
future may be even more alarming.
''It could get even worse than this,'' said Dr Collins. ''In 20 years'
time, when we see the effects of smoking among the young today, the risk
factor could be even greater.''
He said it was now more important than ever to educate people about
the dangers of smoking, adding that he was in favour of raising tobacco
tax and banning tobacco adverts.
''The good news is that, if you give up, the risks drop away very
rapidly. In five years, you are some way back towards the risk level of
a non-smoker,'' he said.
Professor Richard Peto, of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's unit at
Oxford, said: ''If you happen to survive your first heart attack, then
stopping smoking still makes you much less likely to have another.
Stopping before you have had a heart attack is even better.
''Overall, about half of all persistent cigarette smokers eventually
get killed by tobacco. But those who manage to stop smoking before they
have developed any serious disease avoid most of their risk of being
killed.''
The findings showed that between the ages of 30 and 39, heart attacks
were 6.3 times more common in smokers as in non-smokers. At ages 40-49,
the ratio was 4.7; at 50-59 it was 3.1; at 60-69 it was 2.5; and at
70-79 it was 1.9.

THE public archives are secret, at least for 30 years, and even then
some documents remain unavailable. The arguments for such a policy are
often rehearsed but it is not just designed to cloak the state's
activities in secrecy (or frustrate historians): civil servants might
not be as free with their advice if it were soon to be open to public
scrutiny, something which might, for similar reasons, apply to private
volunteers. The 30-year rule did not apply before to the documents
concerning the Information Research Department, first established in
1948 by Clement Attlee, but many have now been released, though some are
still suppressed or suffer from deletions, so sensitive are their
contents.
What they show is how lively the post-war Labour Government and its
successors were to the challenge of Soviet propaganda and techniques of
infiltration of British institutions, notably our unions. The British
Communist Party itself was almost as spectral as Marx's famous
description in the Manifesto of 1848. It had fewer than 40,000 members
(a total swollen in the 1940s by respect for the achievements of the
Russian people against the Nazis) and won only two seats in Parliament
out of 21 contested in 1945. Yet, according to the findings of the IRD,
it controlled two of the largest unions in the country, the Engineers
and the Electricians, and was very strongly placed in the Transport
Workers, the miners, railwaymen and the main teachers' union. (The other
bodies' vulnerability to communist penetration was well known but that
the teachers were too is something of a surprise.)
The IRD sought to make such facts known, as well as the existence of
the enormous chain of Soviet slave labour camps -- the notorious Gulag
authoritatively and comprehensively exposed later by Solzhenitsyn. Its
efforts were aided by distinguished individuals like Stephen Spender,
Bertrand Russell, Vic Feather and particularly Denis Healey, whose own
left-wing credentials meant they could not easily be dismissed as
''lackeys of the capitalist class''. Many were still misled by communist
lies, now exposed beyond doubt by revelations from Russia itself. It is
good to know that they were well-countered at the time by the truth,
though not all ears chose to hear it.

Washington
US forces have started building up in and around the Gulf after
unusual Iraqi military moves toward Kuwait.
A Pentagon official said: ''We cannot afford to delay action in
response to what we perceive to be challenges by Iraq.''
The official line was concern but not alarm at what was called a
pattern of unusual training and other movements. It began five weeks
ago.
The Pentagon said that the pattern was continuing and it involved
elements from all of Iraq's armed forces, including air force, army, and
elite Republican Guard units.
The US is moving pre-positioned equipment closer to the Gulf and
heightening readiness in case of a need to deploy quickly to counter any
''escalation of the challenges'' from Iraq.
Home-based troops who would be the vanguard of any sudden Gulf
deployment are being told to stay aware of developments.
''We're not putting forces on alert,'' a senior military official
said. He would not estimate how many personnel were involved.
The US already has about 20,000 troops in the Gulf region, including
2000 Marines on a training exercise with Jordanian troops near Jordan's
border with Iraq.
The Pentagon was said to be shifting closer to the Gulf shiploads of
equipment kept permanently afloat in the Indian Ocean.
The ships have enough tanks, ammunition and other equipment and
supplies to sustain a Marine Expeditionary Force of about 17,000 plus an
Army combat brigade of up to 5000 soldiers, the official said.
Kuwait said it knew of no unusual troop movements despite the US
reports.
''Until 20 minutes ago there was not anything unusual in the south of
Iraq,'' defence minister Sheikh Ahmad Hamoud al-Sabah said in brief
remarks to Reuters.
''The usual forces which are there were already there some time ago.
We have not seen anything (unusual).''
''We are keeping our eyes open but we have not seen anything. They
have not come (across the 32nd parallel),'' he added.
Kuwait's government shares American S. satellite and other
intelligence information on Iraq, according to diplomats.

AN eminent world environmental chemist has backed an Edinburgh group's
fears over industrial pollution in the Firth of Forth.
Ms Tania Tavares said after meeting Pilton Environment Group that she
was ''surprised'' to find such a problem in the city.
She also expressed fears about the apparent traces of cancer-causing
chemicals on the beach at Pilton, which the group blames on a local
chemical plant.
''This is quite unacceptable,'' she said.
Ms Tavares offered the support of her internationally recognised
Interdisciplinary Environmental Centre at the Federal University of
Bahia in eastern Brazil in the group's fight for action.
The centre is recognised as the first major source of independent
evaluations of industrial pollution risks.
The Brazilian scientist is on a three-day visit to Edinburgh as a
guest of the Scottish Education and Action for Development (SEAD) group.
She also plans to meet members of Friends of the Earth Scotland during
her stay.
Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth Scotland claimed yesterday to have
further evidence to prove a link between toxic pollution of the Firth of
Forth and a company at Western Harbour, Leith Docks, writes Christopher
Reekie.
The group said it had located several chemicals which could be related
directly to the activities of British Pipe Coaters Ltd.
By studying public records, they had found notes of the disposal of
substances including butoxylethanol, toluene, xylene, and naphthalene.
The records showed also that the company had no consent to discharge
any trade effluent into the waters.
In June, Friends of the Earth used canoes to obtain samples of an
outflow from a pipe at the works. Analysis showed the samples contained
toxic substances.
An investigation into the complaint by FoE Scotland was begun by Forth
River Purification Board.
Dr David Holloway, the board's chief pollution prevention officer,
said yesterday the investigation was continuing. The company had stopped
discharges from the pipe on July 10 when the matter was raised and they
had not been restarted.
No-one from the company was available for comment yesterday.
* Mr Alasdair Paton, currently director and chief engineer of the
Scottish Office's Engineering, Water, and Waste Directorate, yesterday
was named chief executive of the new agency which will regulate all key
forms of industrial pollution in the country from April next year.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency, with an annual budget of
more than #22m and a workforce of around 600, will bring together the
functions of HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate, river purification
authorities, and councils in respect of waste regulation and some air
pollution controls.
Mr Paton, will receive an annual salary of #70,000 with scope for a
performance related bonus of up to 10% of salary in the first year and
up to 15% for subsequent years.

Paris
A BOMB packed with nails and bolts injured 16 people, three seriously,
when it exploded today near the Arc de Triomphe, in an area crowded with
summer tourists.
A 60-year-old Briton was peppered with shrapnel. The unnamed woman was
said to be in a ''relatively serious'' condition in a Paris hospital.
Four children were among those injured by the bomb, packed with nails,
which rocked the heart of the French capital, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
As well as the British woman four Hungarians, four Italians including
a four-year-old girl, and a German woman were caught by the vicious
blast.
Hospital sources said three of the 16 injured were seriously hurt, but
none was in a critical condition.
Police said the rush-hour blast appeared to have been caused by a
gas-canister bomb of the kind that killed seven people in a central
Paris metro station last month.
Today's device had been left in a rubbish bin just outside another
metro station at the corner of Charles de Gaulle Square and Friedland
Avenue, beside the Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs Elysees.
More than 100 police blocked off the area and red and white police
tape was put up to keep back crowds.
Four-inch-long nails were found scattered around the area as
ambulances rushed to the scene and doctors set up a field hospital in a
shop in a side street.
Dominique Kassongo said he was waiting for his children to come out of
the station when the explosion occurred.
''There was an enormous amount of smoke and people ran and screamed. I
panicked,'' he said.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe rushed to the scene, where blood was
spattered on the pavement.
He told reporters there were many foreign tourists in the area at the
time.
No-one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but police
suspect Algerian Muslim guerrillas of being behind last month's bombing
at the Saint-Michel underground station.
Two Iranian diplomats, held and questioned as witnesses, were later
released and police confirmed they had nothing to do with the bombing.
The Iranian embassy, located near the scene of the blast, denied any
involvement.
Controls have been stepped up in major French cities since the deadly
July 25 bomb explosion, with thousands of people stopped for identity
checks.
All rubbish bins situated on the Paris Metro have been sealed to
prevent more bombs being hidden.

A POOLS jackpot winner accused of turning on his friends and refusing
to pay their share of a #1.8m fortune told a court yesterday that he had
no gentleman's agreement with them.
Mr Paul Pitt, 28, denied he owed three former friends #25,000 each as
part of a deal to share the money if any of them won #1m or more.
Mr Martin Foulds, 27, Mr Graham Ware, 27, and Mr Andrew Sullivan, 30,
claim Mr Pitt still owes them their share after his Littlewoods payout
two years ago.
Mr Pitt told Portsmouth County Court yesterday: ''The only talk we
ever had about sharing money was in the syndicate. Nothing at any time
was said about splitting winnings on an individual coupon.
''
Mr Pitt said that his former workmates at the Pall Europe engineering
firm in Portsmouth, Hampshire, were either mistaken or lying when they
had told the court they knew about the agreement.
The three claimants, who are suing Mr Pitt for breach of contract,
claim that he won the #1.8m on a coupon which was covered by the
gentlemen's agreement they had all shaken hands on.
This meant any member of the group who won more than #1m would pay out
#25,000 to each of the other men.
The case continues.

THE unpalatable truth is that most of us spend our lives on our knees,
our horizons bounded by mortgages, the need to maintain a lifestyle or
the struggle to remain in employment. Urban life as the millenium
approaches has become, for most of us, a war of attrition. That is why
people like Alison Hargreaves attract us; they illuminate our own lives
with their raw courage, and their ability to break the pressing bounds
of convention. That, and her engaging personality, is why many people
this morning will feel an almost personal sense of bereavement if
reports of her death are confirmed. There is also immediately apparent
in the discussions following yesterday's breaking news a strong
undercurrent -- that Alison Hargreaves might have been better employed
at home looking after her children, that the world's toughest mountain
was no place for the mother of two vulnerable youngsters. That thinking
is, of course, flawed in that there is absolutely no difference between
Alison Hargreaves going to the high mountains and any of the tens of
thousands of men who climb and leave behind their families in the care
of their wives. Personal experience tells us that the men and women who
climb on the highest peaks are different and special and that these
mountains are special places. Many of us only reach the summits of the
high Alps by ski lift but that does not detract from the vaunting thrill
of such surreal beauty. And even at the level of the recreational skier
there is a considerable sense of achievement to be had from acquiring
and executing the techniques which bring exhilaration coupled with
safety. Each year tens of thousands of us expose our own children to the
attendant risks.
These are much the same for everyone from the humble hillwalker to the
tigers who can be seen every weekend in winter clinging like flies in
the snow gullies or on the ice walls of Glencoe. Much of the thrill
comes from practising a dangerous sport safely; even Ben Lomond can be a
nasty place in winter when the weather closes in and earlier this year a
man slipped to his death on Dumgoyne, the horn at the end of the Campsie
Fells, only yards off the main road. Safety was almost an obsession for
Alison Hargreaves. It was possible to detect from the way in which she
returned to the subject in interviews that she was concious of the
criticism levelled at her because of her two little sons back home. But,
of all people, she was acutely aware of the history of K2 and she was
fully attuned to the risks. If she perished, she died at the height of
her powers and instead of censure we should celebrate her memory. Her
achievements elevate all of us.

THE decisive outcome of the Bermudan referendum on independence will
seem quixotic to the world's anti-imperialists. By a huge margin --
easily surpassing a 40% rule similar to that affecting the famous
Scotland Act in 1979 -- the electors, nearly two thirds of whom are
black, voted to remain under British rule. It is a vote of confidence in
a very long-standing connection -- the 138 islands in the group were
originally acquired in the seventeenth century -- but the fact is that
the islanders for all practical purposes already govern themselves
through a very generous measure of home rule. Formal independence might
anyhow not really be on for a such a tiny population (just under 60,000)
and the alternative to the British link would probably be an American
one. Even the modest exotic element conferred by the British connection
helps the islands' tourist trade. Yesterday's vote was as much an
exercise in calculation as nostalgia and affection; though it is not to
be despised for that when hard-headed calculation has the habit of
surviving for longer than mere sentiment.
The islands enjoy the sort of off-shore status that makes for
financial havens around the globe. Their law is not lax, and it seems to
be firmly applied. Many companies find its attractions, and proximity to
America, appealing as well -- so that the islands have some claim to be
the fifth richest place in the world. But yesterday's three-to-one
majority for the status quo was composed of far more humble folk than
millionaires: at the very least an intriguing outcome.

<HEADLINE>Golf deal would not bring any benefit to town, claim hoteliers</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ROW over the recent signing of a #5m contract between St Andrews
Links Trust, which administers the town's golf courses, and a
London-based hospitality company, the Keith Prowse Agency, has taken
another twist.
The controversial deal, which involves the sale of starting times on
the Old Course, has raised objections from the tourist industry, local
hoteliers, and tour operators.
Now, after a meeting between senior officials of the St Andrews
Hotels' and Guesthouses' Association and representatives of the Keith
Prowse concern, the association's executive is recommending to its
membership not to participate in the scheme.
The organisation maintains that discussions with the company have
confirmed fears that the agency's executive packaged deals will contain
a substantial premium payable to the links' administrators -- plus the
company's own commercial profit.
The association, which has 35 members, considers that it does not wish
to be associated with the artificially inflated prices as a matter of
principle.
As a result, the association considers that it cannot endorse the
arrangement between the trust and the hospitality company, or recommend
participation in it by its membership.
The association's president, Mr Derrick Armitage, said yesterday: ''We
have already questioned the assertion by the trust that the deal will
benefit the town as a whole. We do not believe it will.''
He claimed that the deal had been aimed at the high-spending and
corporate management sector, which would have no incentive to spend
money in the town itself.
There are real fears from many sections of the golfing and tourist
trade that, as a result of the deal, St Andrews could be set to become
one of the most expensive places in the world to play golf -- a claim
already made in a golf magazine in the US after the announcement of the
deal.
Unconfirmed reports recently have highlighted costs of around #4000
for a deal with the agency, with a similar golfing package from local
operators at around one-quarter of that figure.
Hotelier Brian Hughes, who is the chairman of the golf group section
of the hotels and guesthouses association, said yesterday: ''The
corporate incentive packages will sell to companies and wealthy
individuals, who will pay an obscene amount of money for them.
''They will not be the normal golfing tourists and they will not use
local shops and restaurants.
''Instead, they will be chauffeur-driven to their hotels, play golf on
the Old Course, dine in the trust's new clubhouse, receive a free bundle
of goodies, and then leave St Andrews again.''
The golf administrators say that the 10-year deal will secure the
financial future of facilities at St Andrews into the next century.
The times purchased (amounting to several hundred and approximately 7%
of the starting times on the links' course) will all be taken from
existing visitor times. The trust has said that local times and the
traditional ballot will be unaffected by the new contract.

RESEARCH which could save police in Scotland from injury and death in
knife attacks has had to stop, it was revealed yesterday.
Lack of testing equipment is holding up the development of stab-proof
vests.
Scottish police forces are desperate to see production of protective
vests that are light and flexible enough to wear under uniforms.
Safety experts at Strathclyde University were confident that they were
well on the way to a breakthrough, but the project has been shelved.
''It's tragic that we've had to stop now,'' said Professor Tom Gray,
head of mechanical engineering, ''but it's just no longer economical for
us to continue without further funding.''
Since last November engineers have tested titanium, plastic and even
ceramic vests with the use of a ''knifing machine'' -- a contraption
simulating knife attacks in which a blade shoots into the vest at 30mph.
Further research is needed to make the vests ultra knife-proof. And
Professor Gray reckons that it could cost #100,000 just to get it off
the ground.
''The police weren't happy to see the vests going into operation
without passing some sort of test, but so far we've been unable to get a
proper standard,'' he said. ''Some pass the machine test but fail the
manual test, and vice-versa.''
In Strathclyde alone last year there were more than 3000 assaults --
many involving knives -- on police officers.
And in June last year Constable Lewis Fulton died from stab wounds in
Glasgow.

A GIRL of three has been admitted to Mensa, the exclusive club for the
brains of Britain.
Rhiannon Linington-Payne, from Farlow, Shropshire, was admitted after
undergoing special tests conducted by an independent psychologist.
She is said to have an IQ of 155 and a reading age of
seven-and-a-half.
Mensa could not confirm reports that she was its second youngest
member but revealed that her intelligence was in the top 1% for children
of her age. General manager Dave Chatten said about 2500 of the
organisation's 37,000 British members were under 16 and a few hundred
were under 10.

Stephen McGinty writes that this weekend's pop chart figures will
decide if Blur or Oasis, who each released new singles last Monday, to
the surprise of the music industry, are the current champions of rock
IF IT was a fight, you would immediately assume it was fixed. But the
decision by pop bands Blur and Oasis to go head-to-head and each release
singles last Monday seems set to cause a real rammy. The Rolling Stones
and the Beatles were never so stupid. Mick Jagger would often meet John
Lennon to carve up calendar dates -- one for you, one for me -- knowing
that a fight was fine if you didn't have to climb into the ring.
It would seem that after only a year of good-natured, media-friendly
rivalry between Blur's middle-class boys from London and Oasis's
self-proclaimed working-class heroes of Manchester, the gloves have come
off.
Derogatory quotes will always secure column inches in the tabloid
press and papers like the New Musical Express, but a battle for singles
sales can produce only one winner, to be announced on Sunday's Radio 1
chart countdown.
Music industry analysts believe the battle resulted from the severing
of a rumoured gentleman's agreement between Andy Ross, who runs Blur's
Food Records, and Alan McGee, founder of the Creation label who signed
Oasis.
In the past the bands have avoided releasing singles at the same time
to prevent the hassle of a cluttered market. But it was the speed with
which Noel Gallagher of Oasis writes that ended the status quo.
Since January, Blur had scheduled a single for an August release as a
lead-up to their new album The Great Escape, due for release in October.
But as Oasis took only 18 days to record their latest album, Morning
Glory, also due for release in October, they decided to release the
single last Monday.
Both labels now claim it was a fluke, however Creation had to beat the
clock to deliver their properly-packaged single in time.
There is little doubt that with the failure to produce a climbdown by
either band, both record companies have made the most of a glorious
moment for the media.
Top slots in bulletins by ITN and BBC news, through to tabloid
coverage, Times leaders, and write-ups in the FT have followed this
battle of the bands.
Tommy Udo of New Musical Express said it was unintended hype that had
become a case of lads playing mine's bigger than yours. ''It's not
collusion as much as the breaking down of a consensus. Creation jumped
the gun and brought forward their release date by a week, and then Food
Records brought their's forward by a week and they decided to go
head-to-head.''
When Damon Albern, lead singer of Blur, heard the news he was quoted
as saying: ''It's that Manchester thing of 'come and have a go if you
think you're hard enough'.'' Obviously both bands feel rock hard.
In the blue corner Blur, who are classically trained, are armed with
four Brit awards and a recent number-one album. While Oasis, whose
songwriter Noel learned to play the guitar on probation after robbing a
shop during a glue-sniffing high, have one Brit award and a debut album
which was the fastest-seller ever in Britain, with current sales at more
than one million. The lucky horseshoe in their glove is Some Might Say,
their previous single which came in at No. 1, selling more than 250,000
copies.
Martin Talbot of Music Week said: ''It's not a hype because somebody
is going to lose. You would be daft to do this intentionally. It's going
to be a real blow for the loser. But the attitude of both bands is
bolshie, so neither one can be seen to pull out. In saying that, I have
never seen such coverage.''
Vanessa Cotton at Creation said: ''Whatever the outcome this week has
been great for singles.'' Singles are seldom successful money-spinners,
requiring the same promotion and artwork as an album with little
financial reward unless you're Wet Wet Wet or Take That. Today's bands
follow a prescribed pattern of releasing a single, followed by an album,
followed by singles lifted from the album. Oasis ignores this trend,
releasing new songs as singles every three months.
In 1994 the singles market had a retail sales value of #156.6m with 63
million singles produced, the biggest year since 1987. Singles sales in
1995 are expected to produce the most successful year in the past
decade. Singles now seem to be bucking the downward trend.
Between them Oasis and Blur have pressed about 600,000 of their
current two singles.
The recent shake-up in Radio One's play-list has been partly
responsible for the introduction of newer bands to listeners, who are
then more likely to purchase a single. In the past few months bands such
as Supergrass and Gene have achieved notable success with recent
singles. Statistics reveal that slightly more women than men buy
singles, and 42% of all singles are bought by those aged between 16 and
24.
Both Oasis and Blur have utilised databases, mailing information on
new singles to fans as encouragement to buy in the crucial first week.
It's thought that Oasis has the biggest database with more than 100,000
names and addresses but Blur's fan base extends further across the age
range.
A spokesman for Tower Records, Glasgow, said: ''On Monday morning
Oasis were outselling Blur four to one. Now it's evening up with Blur
nudging ahead. The whole thing can only be good for the industry.
Whoever thought it up is a genius. If the managers got together over a
beer, good luck to them.''
Of course, it will be Sunday at 7pm before Britain knows if it is Blur
or Oasis who are the champions of pop.

THIS is storytelling for the eyes as well as the ears, with music and
movement helping to carry forward the narrative of a small pueblo and
the family at the heart of it.
The Brian Collective claim inspiration from the writings of Marquez,
Allende and Lorca and there is, certainly, a mystical whiff to their
account of a close -- even incestuous -- community destroyed by an
outside world which stamps its rule, roughshod, on their quiet lives.
There are some uneven patches in the performances, and the movement
doesn't always gel but the story itself has charm and humour as well as
an absorbing if sombre resonance, while the live guitar music with its
flamenco feel adds considerably to the atmosphere.

A SCULPTOR was reunited yesterday with a piece of his work he believed
he would never see again.
Valentin Znoba's #24,000 bronze statue, Football Supporters, was
stolen from an art gallery in Haddington, East Lothian, 14 months ago.
On Sunday, acting on information, police officers discovered it face
down and buried in grass in woodlands about a mile from the town.
Mr Znoba is mounting an exhibition of works during the Edinburgh
International Festival. Yesterday, he arrived from his home in the
Ukraine, accompanied by his wife Tatiana Golembievska, a painter, and
their son Nickola, 20, a student of sculpture.
They wanted to see the statue as soon as possible after touching down
in Scotland. They were ''overwhelmed'' to see the 26in bronze, which was
in good condition but ''a little bit scruffy''.
The work has three figures, two sitting on a bench and another
standing behind.
Mr Znoba, through Scots friends, paid tribute to Lothian and Borders
Police, as did Mrs Gill Bethell, the director of the Sands Gallery, from
where the statue was stolen. She had feared it might have been taken out
to the country to the Middle East or the United States.
Last year, there was a series of thefts involving statues in the
Lothians and police did not rule out the possibility that they were
''stolen to order'' raids.
After signing for the statue at Haddington police station, Mr Znoba
travelled with his family to Morningside in Edinburgh.
There they put the final touches to the exhibition in which Football
Supporters will now have pride of place. It is to move to London later.
The Ukrainian Ambassador, a friend of Mr Znoba, is expected to visit
the Edinburgh exhibition.

THE managing director of Scottish Television, Mr Gus Macdonald,
yesterday warned that any move to move the annual Edinburgh Television
Festival to Glasgow could lead to Scotland losing the event altogether.
Mr Macdonald, whose company is the major sponsor of the event, was
commenting amid suggestions that the organisers of the three-day
festival, which takes place next weekend, are considering pulling out of
the capital because of the soaring cost of hotel accommodation.
Glasgow, effectively the broadcasting industry's Scottish centre,
appears to be the favourite alternative and the city's tourism officials
have been actively courting the festival's administrators, offering
discounts and other incentives.
With some Edinburgh hotels currently charging premium rates of as much
as #160 a night and with many of the 1200 delegates on increasingly
tight budgets, the organisers will canvass those who attend and ask them
if they would prefer a change of venue or a change to a different time
of year.
However, Mr Macdonald, who is a senior member of the festival's
executive, urged caution. He said Edinburgh was the event's natural
home. It had started 20 years ago as a spin-off from the international
film festival and it always had been regarded as both an Edinburgh and a
Scottish event.
''I understand that the cost of accommodation has gone up and that it
is quite difficult to get,'' he said. ''But, on the other hand, the
festival belongs to Edinburgh and that has always been one of its great
attractions. I think it would be dangerous to move it away from the
city.
''If it went to Glasgow then it might be the beginning of a move which
would see it going to other cities outside Scotland.''
However, there remains a strong feeling that Edinburgh at festival
time is becoming too expensive. Full-time officials of the television
festival say this year in particular has proved to be, not only costly,
but particularly difficult to find sufficient rooms for delegates. This
is partly due to the fact that, with the official arts festival, the
Fringe, the book and the film festivals all experiencing record
attendances, the city can no longer cope with such a huge influx of
people.
Mr Tom Harvey, Television Festival director, admitted that there was a
very serious problem and that Glasgow was being considered as an
alternative.
''We battle to keep delegates' fees low so that younger programme
makers can come to the festival.''
Another option is to continue to hold it in Edinburgh but at a less
busy time of year.

THERE were two supreme moments last night in the Kirov Opera's concert
performance of Glinka's opera, Russlan and Ludmila. One was the
overture, the only part of the piece that is well known today, where the
staggering virtuosity of the Kirov Orchestra -- with almost
indescribable articulation from their string section -- was utterly
breathtaking. And the other came just before the end, when the same
music returned, this time amplified by the robust, 80-strong Kirov Opera
Chorus at full belt.
That apart -- and this, given the ecstatic response of the capacity
house, will doubtless be a contentious statement -- the rest of Glinka's
opera never really measured up; basically it didn't amount even to the
sum of its parts, despite the committed and ceaselessly energetic
conducting of music director Valery Gergiev. Bluntly, it's not too
difficult to see why it has never become an established part of the
repertoire.
The story, about the quest of a knight to rescue his bride who has
been snatched by a couple of witches, is tosh. What opera isn't? That
wasn't the problem. The real problem lies within the composition, much
of which, from vocal writing to orchestration and including a couple of
sets of otherwise amiable dances, is pretty undistinguished.
It wasn't helped by some po-faced performances, from Alexander Morozov
as Russlan, cavernous-voiced, but wooden in delivery, and from an
anonymous-sounding Evgenia Tselovalnik as a faceless witch. In the
second act they were put in their place by the marvellous Georgi
Seleznev, who had a rollicking Russian-Rossini type number.
There were highlights too from the coloratura soprano Marina Shaguch
in the female title role, and especially from the gloriously
laser-voiced Galina Gorchakova as Gorislava. Again and again the eye and
ear were drawn to the orchestra, notably its cello section, which is
astounding.
But it was hard not to think that the real residency of the Kirov
Opera at the Edinburgh Festival begins tonight when the company moves on
to the stage of the Festival Theatre. What we could have done with,
instead of last night's Glinka, was a straight Usher Hall concert from
the fabulous Kirov Orchestra alone -- they have their repertoire with
them, and are performing it elsewhere in Britain. Ah well.

James Traynor talks to the hero of Wednesday's football international
against Greece, Ally McCoist, the Rangers ace who can transform a game
when he turns on the style and a smile
GROWN men from all walks of Scottish life rose with the thousands of
schoolchildren who were at Hampden the other evening to acclaim the same
hero. Businessmen, boxed in their hospitality suites, professional
people, office workers, and the unemployed joined forces and with one
voice chanted: ''Super Ally.''
There are times when Ally McCoist has to step back and catch his
breath. Sometimes he wonders how a plain, smart, but not uniquely
academic boy from East Kilbride could have scaled such heights of
achievement and made such an impact on the national psyche. Sometimes it
scares him that so many people rely on him every time he goes to work.
''It is almost like a power, but I have it and don't ask me how
because I'm not quite sure,'' he said. ''It is, though, a responsiblity
which can be heavy. Every time I play I know I have to do something to
please so many people.''
He is, after all, only a footballer, albeit one who happens to have a
penchant for scoring goals, and occasionally in the most dramatic style.
McCoist's fame and popularity are testimony to the country's almost
incomprehensible preoccupation with football, but also proof of his own
appeal. McCoist has been called the acceptable face of the people's
game, and his appeal is not confined to the male species, nor
significantly one set of supporters in a country divided by appalling
bigotries.
Perhaps in these harsh times when it isn't always easy to raise a
smile, McCoist can be seen as the feelgood factor. It can be one of his
off-the-cuff quotes which fly over the heads of many of his fellow
professionals, who converse through the cliches of the sporting arena,
or his unbridled enthusiasm.
Then again, maybe we are trying to analyse the McCoist phenomenon too
deeply. Perhaps his appeal is born out of a powerfully infectious
enthusiasm which can be transmitted in one of his floodlight-bright
grins, but whatever McCoist is about it is more than any of us think. It
could be something to do with the Scottish persecution complex which
makes us believe we are a downtrodden nation which one day will rise
again.
''I think patriotism has something to do with it,'' McCoist himself
will tell you, ''but maybe it is more basic. It could be that everyone
would love to score a goal at Hampden for Scotland and when I do it,
like the other night for instance, I was doing it for everyone in the
stands because we all want to see this country triumph.''
McCoist's re-emergence in the headlines after he had scored the
winning goal against Greece in a European Championship qualifying tie
marked the end of a frustrating spell of inactivity caused by a variety
of injuries which lasted more than two years. It was a long time without
the public's adulation, but his wife, Allison, knew he had scored even
though she hadn't heard.
She was asleep when he arrived home after the match -- it is perhaps
understandable that the partners of heroes become a shade blase after
time -- and over breakfast the following morning she asked: ''Did you
score? I think you must have because the phone has started ringing
again.''
McCoist says his wife has been a rock, a steadying influence
throughout his difficult times and she is about the only person allowed
to see the real man, the one behind the smile. Allison and their
seven-month-old son, Alexander, will be the ones who will have to live
with McCoist's next choices as he contemplates an existence off the
football pitch.
Money will not be a factor since he is not terribly far from being a
millionaire, although he would have been that twice over through
transfer deals had he wanted to move from Rangers. The resigning fees,
the pension plans of top footballers, and a testimonial year which
earned him approximately #300,000, mean he won't have to extend his
playing career beyond his sell-by date.
He may appear as something of an airhead -- joking with Dundee
United's Billy McKinlay minutes before he was given the nod to go on to
the pitch, he said that he would score and then, by way of celebration,
would jump the advertising boards and crawl from one end to the other
through the huge SFA tarpaulin behind the Greek goal -- but the
32-year-old is more than a joke.
Only one goal short of 300 competitive goals for Rangers, he wonders
when people will take him seriously. After all, no-one could be lucky
300 times and he asks when it will dawn on others that his work is all
about intelligent runs and sensing openings.
In the past few weeks, as he eased himself back into first-team
action, he has played 20 minutes against Steaua Buchrest and scored, 45
minutes against Sampdoria, scored again, and 20 minutes against Greece
-- and we know what he did during that time. These are top-class
football sides and skill is required to breach their defences.
McCoist has been bemusing defenders for the greater part of his life,
but all too soon it will come to an end. McCoist, the footballer will be
no more, and another function will have to be sought.
His wife planted the thought in his mind and the more he thinks about
it the more he wants to stop while still at the top, and his thoughts
already have turned to a second profession. Already he has a business
interest with Alan Ferguson, an influential figure in the PR world, and
the thought of becoming a sports agent appeals greatly.
There is no doubt he would attract footballers to his stable with
ease, but the developments in the world of rugby also interest him. He
could never become a football manager, the path many players attempt to
follow when they become too old to kick the ball, because he will always
be too much of a player.
He sees the game from their perspective; he always will, and contrary
to popular belief, he is the thinking man's player. Then he smiles
again, and you wonder.

RECORD attendances are being predicted for Edinburgh's arts festivals
this year, amid the heatwave.
The International Festival, the Fringe, Film and Book Festivals have
already reported dramatic increases in ticket sales. Record ticket sales
have already been recorded at the book festival.
Figures for the first five days show some 22,000 visitors flocked to
the literary jamboree. A spokeswoman for the book festival said box
office sales were up by 35%, with many events already sold out, thanks
to the 40,000 tickets already sold.
Among the most popular attractions have been talks by Joan Lingard and
Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh. Children's activities, including a
Thomas the Tank Engine Tea Party and a storytelling session by Katie
Morag authoress Mairi Hedderwick, have also proved among the best
sellers.
The Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival revealed there had been a 110%
increase on advance ticket sales, while 35% more tickets had been sold
since the festival was launched last weekend.
The International Festival and Fringe are also doing well, with an
increase of between nine and 10% on ticket sales.
The Fringe revealed it had passed the half-million mark on ticket
sales earlier this week. ''That was a couple of days earlier than last
year. The weather keeps bringing people in. Let's hope it continues,''
said a spokesman.
Meanwhile, Fringe organisers may have to consider a future no-smoking
policy on a number of venues, in the wake of an EC directive -- due to
come into operation next year -- which will ban smoking in all public
places.
The decision to issue a directive was taken amid concerns over the
dangers of passive smoking.
The Fringe, already at the centre of controversy over free cigarettes
being doled out by sponsors at one show, admitted the bulk of complaints
about venues tended to centre around the smoke-filled air.
Mr Stuart Buchanan, marketing manager of the Fringe, said: ''Most of
the complaints we receive are about mainly cabaret acts, which tend to
be in small, enclosed spaces.''
* Seventy extra cleansing staff have been recruited by Edinburgh
District Council to keep the streets of the city clean during the
summer.
The workers, who were taken on in April and will remain until next
month, are currently working flat out as a back-up to regular staff in
the battle to keep the capital tidy.

OR The Midge, as it appears to have mutated into on its arrival in
Scotland from Belgrade. Not that the fly has anything but a passing
reference to do with this knockabout comedy by 16th century writer
Angelo Be Oclo Ruzzante, but it's that kind of a play.
Z Theatre is that rare thing, a company that looks like it knows how
to cope with commedia dell'arte in the 1990s. True, some of the jokes
are arch and -- distressingly -- the attempt at contemporary satire on
the war in the Balkans falls flat, but at its best, it is admirably
physical, and even the genitally-obsessed bawdy comedy gets good laughs.
A lively intermittent English translation keeps it spontaneous, and
vigorous performances keep it highly watchable elsewhere.

Hamilton
BERMUDA Premier Sir John Swan resigned today after residents voted
overwhelmingly to reject independence from Britain.
With 57% of Bermuda's 38,000 registered voters turning out, 73% voted
to keep their ties with Britain and 25% voted for independence.
Swan, who championed independence, had said he would step down if the
move was rejected in yesterday's referendum.
Deputy Premier John Irving Pearman, who is Minister of Labour and Home
Affairs, normally would step in for Swan, officials said.
However, a ministry official said Pearman also had pledged to resign
if Swan left office because of the vote.
Officials said an interim government would be established. Political
observers said C.V. ''Jim'' Woolridge, Minister of Tourism, was a
leading candidate to succeed Swan.

THERE'S a musty old aroma down the Cheese Shop: Essence de Student
Japery. It emanates from the Cheese Shop's six enthusiastic young
comedy-salesmen. They shout and run about a lot, making silly noises,
pulling faces, and singing songettes which advertise little beyond their
own cleverness.
Less-than-hilarious misunderstandings fail to enliven time-worn
sketches about police identity parades, police interrogation-rooms, and
western shoot-outs. You need understand only one thing about the Cheese
Shop's comedy-scent: it grates.

SPANISH Foreign Minister Javier Solana had his second close call in
Bosnia in two days when an airport was shelled minutes before he touched
down.
The UN said two shells landed within 500 metres of the airport at the
southern town of Mostar 15 minutes before Solana landed in a helicopter.
No-one was injured.
''The shells hit at 1400 (1200 GMT) and Mr Solana's helicopter landed
at 1415,'' said UN spokeswoman Major Myriam Souchaki in Sarajevo.
Mostar airport is within artillery range of Bosnian Muslim, Croat, and
separatist Serb forces.
On Wednesday, a vehicle carrying Solana, whose country is current
president of the European Union, was hit by small arms fire as it
entered Sarajevo and UN officials said Bosnian Serb forces appeared to
be responsible.
Solana was visiting Bosnia as part of a fresh international diplomatic
effort to broker a peace settlement.--Reuter

THE Balkan conflict, and its consequences, spread alarmingly today
with a warning from Budapest that ethnic Hungarians in rump Yugoslavia
were being evicted from their homes by Serb refugees who had been forced
out of Croatia.
Hungary demanded that Belgrade act to stop the attacks.
''The government of Hungary calls on Yugoslavia to stop Hungarians
from being chased away from their homes, whether such actions are
spontaneous or organised,'' said a brief statement read by government
spokesman Elemer Kiss.
He warned of the damage to ''the relationship between our two
states''.
The United Nations reported earlier this week that the Serbs who had
fled Croatia after its army retook their homeland of Krajina were
forcing ethnic Croats in Yugoslavia from their homes.
The UN reported attacks throughout Vojvodina, the Serbian province
that has been home to Hungarian and Croatian minorities numbering nearly
half a million and about 200,000 respectively for a millenium. Rump
Yugoslavia is made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
The UN report said that the authorities were stopping some, but not
all, of the attacks against the Croats.
Budapest has been trying to keep out of the Balkan conflict since it
broke out in 1991.
However, Hungary recently stepped up its border guard forces along a
section of Croatia held by rebel Serbs because of increasing tensions
there.--Reuter.

COUNCIL leaders in Edinburgh are to appeal to the US government over
the proposed closure of the American consulate in the capital.
The district council agreed unanimously yesterday to write to Senator
Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to urge
a change of policy.
Congress is due to decide next month whether to close the consulate
and break a 200-year diplomatic link.
The reasons are said to be strictly financial and reflect the
rationalisation of US consulate services and the need to strengthen the
US presence in Central and Eastern Europe.

BRITISH Gas has claimed there will be no losers from a
multi-million-pound plan to hive off its computing services, saying both
customers and shareholders will reap the benefits.
Under the plan, 1500 British Gas computing staff will be offered
payments averaging nearly #20,000 each to do the same job, on the same
terms, for a new firm.
However, Labour Consumer Affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths said Energy
Minister Tim Eggar must study the company's plans and it should not be
allowed to proceed until he was satisfied the customer would not foot
the bill.
''British Gas appears to have more money than sense and the money is
all the customers' money,'' he said.
''Plans to hive off key areas of work have come to grief in the past,
caused companies more work, and costs have been passed on to the
consumers.''
The 1500 staff -- who deal with all British Gas's computing needs,
including customer bills, from centres throughout the country -- have
until 5pm today to decide whether to accept the deal to transfer to
London-based computer services firm Hoskyns.
The spokesman said the move was part of a huge streamlining operation
which would see 25,000 jobs lost over three years and would benefit both
consumers and shareholders.
''It's bound to be a better deal for the consumer. It will be a good
service and it will be good in the long term for the people who transfer
to Hoskyns. There will be no losers in this,'' he said.
Staff who chose to stay with British Gas would be redeployed, he
added.
Some staff reportedly net pay-outs of up to #70,000 but a spokeswoman
for the public sector union Unison said the average would be less than
#20,000.
''It's a redundancy package and there are always risks attached to
redundancy packages,'' she said.

THE last sawmill on the Isle of Arran is threatened with closure
because of the failure of the Forestry Commission to provide enough
timber to keep it in business.
Despite the fact that the island is almost one-third covered in trees,
sawmill owner Murray Boal has received just a fraction of the 400 tons
of timber for which he signed a contract in May.
The workforce at the Cladach sawmill, in the shadow of Brodick Castle,
has been cut from 10 to four, and financial advisers have said the doors
should be closed.
Mr Boal said: ''I can't believe it has come to this. I thought I was
dealing with an organisation that knew what it was doing, but now I have
my doubts.''
As well as the shortage which has seen customers waiting weeks for
orders of fencing and other wood supplies, and some looking to the
mainland for supplies, Mr Boal has seen costs rise due to the needs of
major customers like Caledonian Paper at Irvine for Sitka spruce to make
pulp.
He added: ''I could live with the high costs if I could just get my
hands on some timber. I have been offered wood which I have to go and
cut myself and transport it to the sawmill. But it is not of the
standard I need and with just the four of us it is time-consuming and
takes us away from the essential work of cutting and preparing the wood
for the customers.
''It will be a sad day if we have to shut up shop. There has been a
sawmill on this site for over 50 years.''
Mr Boal praised the efforts of local Forestry Commission workers to
help his business but added: ''It seems their hands are tied by the
people in offices far away from here who lay down the rules and
regulations. I have had less than 60 tons since signing the contract and
have been left scrambling around, sometimes getting timber which is only
good for firewood. I can't keep a business going selling bags of
firewood.
''I was even told at one point they would bring timber over from the
mainland to keep me going. With all the timber on Arran that's just
plain daft.''
After inquiries from The Herald the Forestry Commission stepped in to
offer Mr Boal an alternative supply of timber but by last night he had
been unable to view the areato see whether it met his needs.
He said: ''Things seem to be happening now after weeks and weeks but
until I can get a look at the area they are talking about I won't know
if we are any better off.''
A Forestry Commission spokesperson said that the contractor who had
been harvesting timber on Arran had pulled out unexpectedly and had
failed to complete the contract.
She added: ''We have already retendered the contract and hope to have
signed a new contractor by September 1. In the intervening weeks, to
ensure Mr Boal continues to get a supply of timber, we are arranging a
small standing sale of timber for him.''

NEW housebuilding by the private sector this year has continued to
reflect the overall improvement shown in 1994, according to figures
released by the Scottish Office yesterday.
There were an estimated 4903 starts (the start of the construction of
a house) in the first quarter of 1995 -- a 22% increase on the
corresponding period last year.
Private sector completions (when a house is ready for occupation) also
showed an increase of 261 on the first quarter of 1994 to 4120.
Mr Raymond Robertson MP, the Minister for Housing at the Scottish
Office, said the increase in the number of starts indicated a growing
confidence in the Scottish housebuilding market.
Scotland was performing relatively well, compared to the rest of the
UK, he said.
However, the National House Building Council claimed the figures were
out of date and said the Government should do more to encourage people
to buy new homes.
NHBC records show there was a 10% reduction in starts and an 11% fall
in completions in the private sector in the first six months of 1995.

A TORY who lost a one-vote election victory in the courts in June
swept to victory in the history-making rerun last night.
Frank Hodge, 70, took the Laurmont East seat at Polmont on the new
Falkirk unitary council with almost 200 more votes than Labour's Moira
Fitzpatrick.
The rerun was ordered after a sheriff court ruling that the first
result in April was void because of unfranked voting papers.
In that election, Mrs Fitzpatrick lost by one vote. Two of her voting
papers had not been stamped by polling station officials.
There were four recounts before the unfranked papers were discarded,
giving victory to Mr Hodge.
Mrs Fitzpatrick raised an action at Falkirk Sheriff Court, and Sheriff
Principal John Maguire made history by ordering a rerun. A similar
decision came 30 minutes later over the outcome of an election in
Jedburgh, and that too was resolved last night with the original victor
being returned.
The Laurmont East turnout of 1726, at 54.6%, was well up on the 40.9%
first time round.
Mr Hodge said: ''I'm immensely relieved that it's all over because
it's been a long slog since the last null and void election.''
Mrs Fitzpatrick, who attracted 100 more votes than April's 427, said
last night's defeat was a ''more acceptable way'' to lose.
She added: ''I don't regret the court action. This was the democratic
way to do it.''
The full result was: Frank Hodge (Tory) 721; Moira Fitzpatrick
(Labour) 527; Diane Williamson (SNP) 400; Jim Johnston (Independent) 46;
Ron McArthur (Lib Dem) 32.
The make-up of the new council which takes power next April is now
Labour 23, SNP 7, Independent 4, Tories 2.
In last night's rerun of the Borders council election, Mr Tom Dobson,
Independent, took the Southdean, Jedburgh, seat with a majority of 121
over Liberal Democrat Patricia Miller. It was her who succeeded in
having a sheriff declare the original result void.
Mr Dobson's majority in the original vote in April was also one.
A sheriff ordered the rerun because two ballot papers which would have
given Mrs Miller victory had not been franked by election officials and
were not counted.
The voting last night was: James Brown (SNP) 165; Thomas Dobson
(Independent) 339; Patricia Miller (Lib/Dem) 218; Thomas Tubb (Scottish
Conservative) 49.
Mr Tubb was the only candidate not involved in the original contest.
After the new result Mrs Miller said: ''I think it was worth having
another election. One good thing that has come out of it is that we have
got a good clear result this time.''
The new councillor said he felt that Mrs Miller's court action had
resulted in a ''pretty big backlash against her''.
He added: ''I feel it has been a great waste of time and money for
everybody.''
The percentage poll was 52.2%.

Alison Hargreaves was a family woman first and a climber second.
Kirsty Scott looks at the ups and downs of a committed climber
THERE are those who will never understand Alison Hargreaves, just as
there are others who have seen beyond the hype and the how-could-she and
glimpsed the spirit that has driven her to the risks and rewards waiting
on the roof of the world.
We generally like our heroines to be feisty Girl's Own types, strong
and resourceful, but with a subtle shading of vulnerability, a trace of
frailty. Alison Hargreaves was never going to fit that mould.
When she returned from her solo and oxygen-free ascent of Everest in
May, the climbing community was awestruck at the sheer willpower and
mental and physical strength that had propelled her to the top. ''This
climb was truly world-class,'' said one colleague. ''It was not just
good for a Brit, or a woman, it was genuinely world-class stuff.''
Born in Belper in Derbyshire 33 years ago, Alison made her first
acquaintance with the mountains when her counterparts were toying with
hop-scotch or skipping.
''I have been a mountaineer since I was knee-high to a grasshopper,''
she said in a recent radio interview. ''My parents used to take me
hillwalking when I was six or seven years old. . . I got the love of
climbing to the top and standing on top looking around and thinking,
wow, I have achieved something.''
She graduated on to Peak District rock faces in her early teens and it
was here, says her husband, Jim Ballard, that she was hooked and her
Everest ambition born. ''When you see her going on a mountain, she
changes,'' he said. ''She is what used to be called a child of nature.
She looks as though she has always been at one there.''
She became Britain's only professional woman climber, making her
living from sponsorship, articles, lectures, and a book -- A Hard Day's
Summer.
Everest may have brought her untold riches but a couple of years ago,
she was so strapped for cash that she had to think twice about buying a
bottle of shampoo to wash her hair after scaling the Matterhorn.
It was in the Alps that she started to show the dedication and genius
which would take her to the top of Everest. Six years ago she scaled the
north face of the Eiger while six months pregnant with her son, Tom, and
she became the first person to climb the six classic north faces of the
Alps -- the Eiger, Matterhorn, Grandes Jorasses, Dru, Badille, and Cima
Grande -- in 1993 solo and in one summer. She also climbed the Croz Spur
in the French Alps alone and unroped.
She had made one previous, unsuccessful attempt on Everest last year.
Going in from the Nepal side of the mountain, she got within 1500ft of
the summit before blizzards drove her down. But it was her dream and she
wanted it badly.
Her second attempt was blessed by relatively good weather and on May
13, in brilliant sunshine, she reached the top.
She said later: ''I just felt this overwhelming surge of emotion and
burst into tears.'' She stayed for 45 minutes and left a silk flower in
memory of those who had gone before and not survived the attempt.
Calling base camp she sent a message to the family: ''To Tom and Kate,
my two children. I am on top of the world and I love them dearly.''
Back in Spean Bridge, where the locals know her as the Spiderwoman,
husband Jim said she was ''as near to a genius as one can be,'' and it
is acknowledged that she could be the greatest climber ever, regardless
of gender.
Amongst her colleagues she is known for her supreme technical skill,
her guts, her fitness -- both mental and physical -- and her
determination not to take unnecessary risks.
In the wider public she was known as a mum of two who had climbed the
world's highest mountain, and that is probably how she would have wanted
to be seen. She has always been unequivocally clear about her commitment
to Tom, six, and Katie, four, and has patiently explained her family
ties to those who had poked and prodded about her climbing and its
compatibility with being a mother. On the day that Tom was born, she and
Jim had been bouldering near their home when she calmly informed him
that her waters had broken.
''Climbing is part of my life, obviously a very important part of my
life, but I'm not absolutely totally obsessed with it,'' she said
recently. ''At the end of the day my children are the most important
thing to me, so probably you could say that I am obsessed with them.''
She was well aware of the risks that were facing her on K2. ''It's got
this incredible aura about it, K2 the Killer Mountain people call it,
and it has taken a lot of lives, but so has Everest.
''I am just praying for the weather to be all right as I prepare for
my actual bid for the summit. I had luck with me on Everest but the law
of averages says that I should not get such a good break on K2.''
Yesterday, Jim quoted her favourite proverb in a tribute to his wife:
It is better to have lived for one day as a tiger than one thousand
years as a sheep.
Whatever the outcome over the next few days, and whatever the
prejudices and preconceptions that some amongst us hold, the least
anyone can do now is pay similar tribute to a true heroine; a dazzling
and dedicated climber, a warm and engaging personality and a loving and
much-loved partner and parent.

AN American visiting Stirling was robbed of 20p by a man wielding a
crowbar, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Martin Spizman, 33, who had arrived in the town only hours earlier,
was heading for a youth hostel on Wednesday when he was approached by
Robert McDougall, 25, who was swaying about and bleeding from a head
wound. McDougall said: ''Give me 20p or I'll kill you.''
Mr Spizman, who works in electronics in California, said last night:
''I've lived all my life in LA and never been attacked or mugged and
I've been all over Europe and this is the first time anything has
happened to me.
''But it was a mugging out of Disneyland -- when somebody approaches
you covered in blood and waving a crowbar and demands 20p, what do you
do? I had to ask him twice because I thought I'd misheard.''
The attack happened less than half a mile from Stirling Castle where
guests will assemble after the European premier of Mel Gibson's film,
Braveheart, in a fortnight's time.
Stirling Sheriff Court heard yesterday that although the street was
crowded and it was the middle of the afternoon, no-one went to Mr
Spizman's aid. However, one driver did stop to suggest that Mr Spizman
should phone the police.
McDougall, of Bruce Street, Stirling, was arrested a short distance
from the scene, still swinging the crowbar.
He admitted menacing Mr Spizman with the crowbar and robbing him.
He also pled guilty to shouting, swearing, and being disorderly on the
way to Stirling Police Station after being apprehended.
Sheriff Robert Younger refused bail and remanded McDougall in custody
to be seen by a psychiatrist. Sentence was deferred until September 7.
Defence agent Alisdair Mackie said McDougall had got locked out of his
flat after consuming ''a huge quantity of drink''. He had been using the
crowbar to try to get back in and when he could not he decided to make a
phone call. He had approached Mr Spizman for money for the telephone.

'Climbers greatly enjoy life. After all, they have many more climbs
left to live for, so part of the satisfaction is minimising the risks,
and as every good girl guide or boy scout knows, the trick is to be
prepared.
'Mountains can be big and grand, and when you're on your own they can
be very daunting. Leaving the hut in the dark hours of the early morning
can be a strange experience. But the mountains are there to be climbed
and enjoyed, not conquered. I feel when solo climbing more attuned to
the elements than at any other time and without external influences to
sway you, a sixth sense seems to come into play. If everything is right,
you may be allowed to climb your mountain'

A family waits in hope for the return of a loved one. David Ross,
Highland Correspondent, reports on a day of extraordinary courage at
Aonach Mor
ALISON HARGREAVES wrote a touching letter to her husband, Mr Jim
Ballard, and their children soon after arriving at K2 at the end of
June.
In it, she urged six-year-old Tom and his four-year-old sister, Katie,
to ''be good for Daddy, have a lovely summer and enjoy your holiday''.
The letter, sent from base camp on K2 more than six weeks ago,
includes a simple line drawing of the fearsome peak.
Alison writes: ''Jim, how's things? We arrived at base camp yesterday
-- after five days bad weather. Now is perfect -- but metres of fresh
snow.
''Hope you and the children are well and that you all enjoy a great
summer. We'll keep you as updated as possible.
''Could you please encourage Tom to read below:
''Tom and Katie,
''We have arrived at our Base Camp. The trek was difficult -- it
snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2, it
looks like this.''
The letter ends: ''Be good for Daddy, have a lovely summer and enjoy
your holiday. With lots and lots of love from Mum.''
Later, during her climb, she sent further letters, faxes and sketches
to her family.
At Aonach Mor yesterday, as tourists ascended the mountain on Nevis
Range's gondola, Mr Ballard, 49, a public relations consultant, emerged
from the gondola station every two hours or so to tell the waiting media
that there was still no confirmation that his wife was dead.
With extraordinary courage and forbearance, he allowed the world into
his family's confused tragedy, as he prepared to tell his young children
that their mother might not be returning.
Throughout, he tried to talk in the present tense, but every so often
it slipped. The respect he held for his wife and her achievements never
did.
''She had climbed the mountain. She was the first woman to climb
Everest and K2 without supplementary oxygen, and in classic style. She
was on her way down, so at least inside she would have had the happiness
of having reached the summit.''
He bridled only at the suggestion that perhaps his wife should not
have been climbing dangerous mountains when she was the mother of such
young children.
''Nobody told the athletes at Gothenburg that they shouldn't run
because they were mothers and might hurt themselves. Nobody says to men
that they shouldn't climb because they are fathers.''
His news conferences were conducted just yards from where he had said
goodbye to Alison just a few weeks earlier. ''I said, have a good time,
lass, and keep in touch if you can. See you when you come out.''
When asked how he might remember his wife, he said: ''If I had to keep
one mental picture of her, it would be her stood on the summit of
Everest dedicating her unbelievably successful climb to her children.
''If one has to have an epitaph, it is the finest one can have; to
have climbed the highest mountain on earth in the most simple and
perfect style, no artificial oxygen, no help.''
The staff of Nevis Range were with him all day yesterday as some had
been throughout the previous night, good friends of the couple,
beavering away all day in the background trying to get hard information,
sad in their work.
All the time, a helicopter was working outside delivering pylons up
the mountain for a new ski-lift.
The sounds of a helicopter are common, but they normally mean that a
climber is missing on Ben Nevis, and one onlooker observed: ''How often
have we written off climbers lost for three days up there for them to be
found safe and well days later? It could happen again.''

D J MacLeod poses the question as to whether local authorities have
powers to prevent cyclists cycling on the pavement (Aug 10).
The answer is probably No but the police do. According to the Highway
Code it is an offence to do so under the Roads (Scotland) Act, 1984.
In Rothesay there is more cycling done on pavements than on the road.
As a beat policeman is such a rare sight it is not surprising. I think
the local inspector must be known only to his colleagues.
The same applies to the litter and dog-fouling laws.

THE International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said today that
Croatia had brought in buses to an area near 30,000 stranded Muslim
refugees and feared they would forcibly repatriate them to Bosnia.
The agency also called on Croatian authorities to allow trucks
carrying clean drinking water to reach the refugees near Vojnic, close
to the Bosnian border.
Earlier, the United Nations accused Croatia of barring access to the
refugees, followers of rebel Bosnian Moslem leader Fikret Abdic who fled
from the Bihac pocket into Croatia this month when Bosnian troops struck
at his forces.
Croatian police also turned back a UN medical convoy bound for the
refugees, saying the area was threatened by diehard Serb rebels who took
to the hills during Croatia's reconquest of the breakaway Krajina region
this month.
''The Croatian authorities are severely restricting our access to them
at a time when the situation among these displaced people is
deteriorating considerably,'' UN spokesman Chris Gunness said.
Gunness said disease was breaking out among the refugees, with 500
cases of diarrhoea so far. Many people were camped in the open.--Reuter

<HEADLINE>Army doubles its force and makes ready bomb shelters around Dubrovnik. Croatia prepares for new offensive. Milosevic meets US peace envoy</HEADLINE>

CROATIA doubled its military strength and readied bomb shelters around
the Adriatic port of Dubrovnik today in preparation for a possible
confrontation against rebel Serbs in nearby hills.
The Croatian army has moved in 2000 more troops to the area since
Wednesday morning, bringing the total number of soldiers to 4000, a
United Nations spokesman said.
The UN believed an offensive could begin within days, spokesman Chris
Gunness said.
While war loomed over the historic city, pounded by Serb gunners in
1991, a senior United States envoy met Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and appeared to have won his support for an American plan to
end the war in former Yugoslavia.
After five hours of talks with US Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Holbrooke, Milosevic praised Washington's efforts.
''We could see from the talks that the government of the United States
wishes to help in this as much as possible to achieve urgent peace and
stability in the Balkans,'' Milosevic told reporters in Belgrade.
Milosevic, often blamed by the West for fueling the ethnic wars which
erupted when Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, said that the two men had
agreed on the ''dire urgency'' of ending conflict in Bosnia and Croatia.
Holbrooke, who planned to resume discussions with Milosevic this
morning, described his talks as ''extremely useful''.
He was due to travel to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo to meet President
Alija Izetbegovic.
He has already met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian
Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey.
Western politicians are keen that Milosevic help negotiate a
settlement to the war while his government is under increasing strain
from the thousands of refugees flocking into Serbia after fleeing from
Krajina in Croatia.
Milosevic has made it clear that his priority is to get United Nations
economic sanctions on his country lifted, and he has advised Bosnian
Serb separatists to cut a deal.
As US envoys toured former Yugoslavia in a round of shuttle diplomacy,
the Croatian army was concentrating its troops and armour around
Dubrovnik for a possible assault to push Bosnian Serb artillery out of
range of the walled town.
''We are increasingly concerned about a Croatian offensive,'' Gunness
said.
Workmen boarded up artefacts in the seaside town and local radio
advised residents to stay close to bomb shelters in case fighting
erupted.
Dubrovnik was pounded by Serb gunners in a 1991 siege during Croatia's
war for independence from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia.
Bosnian Serb shelling over the past few days set off brush fires
around Dubrovnik, just three miles from the historic old town.
Firefighters managed to put out the blaze on Thursday afternoon and
shelling had subsided.
The old town has not been directly targeted recently but its
hinterland, including the airport, has been shelled this month from
Serb-held Trebinje in Bosnia, nine miles inland.
Diplomats say Croatia, confident after seizing the Krajina from rebel
Serbs two weeks ago, appears poised to fight to secure Dubrovnik -- the
last segment of coastline still under threat from Serb guns.
In Sarajevo, senior Bosnian government officials refused to meet
European Union peace envoy Carl Bildt on Thursday, saying the peace
process he represented was dead.
Neighbouring Croatia has also said it will have no more dealings with
Bildt after the former Swedish premier criticised Zagreb for shelling
civilian targets.
Bildt arrived in Belgrade and met Milosevic on Thursday evening.
Meanwhile, a power struggle between the military and civilian leaders
of Bosnia's separatist Serbs appears to be coming to a head.
The rivalry, centred on political leader Radovan Karadzic and army
commander General Ratko Mladic, is certain to have an effect the new
regional peace initiative being pushed by the US.
The Bosnian Serb army, in a statement from its general staff today,
accused Karadzic of deception.
It said he was intent on demoting Mladic, a popular hero in the
Bosnian Serb ''republic'', but was trying to buy time so that widespread
opposition to the move would die down.
Karadzic reshuffled the BSA command two weeks ago, shunting Mladic to
a dead-end post. BSA generals rejected the move and Mladic refused to
go, forcing Karadzic into embarrassed retreat.
The general staff statement said Karadzic had backed down for now only
because ''he does not have support in the basic levers of our society -
the people and the army.''
The root of the problem is Karadzic's mistrust of Mladic and his close
ties to Karadzic's arch-foe Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Milosevic has trying to oust Karadzic for the past year. He broke with
Karadzic after he repeatedly rejected an international peace plan for
Bosnia.
The latest warning by the generals suggested that the matter may be
brought to a head by negotations over the American peace plan.

SHOULD ''Buckfast be in the dock'' (August 17)? This dreadful case
provides an extreme example of mistaken -- and frequent -- assertions
about the power of alcohol to remove choice in relation to personal
behaviour. Buckfast is only one of many essentially similar alcoholic
drinks.
A more important issue is that the public interest is not well served
by claims that alcohol is a direct cause of violence. Such claims simply
perpetuate widely held myths that people are less capable if
intoxicated.
The balance of evidence demonstrates that (some) people are aggressive
when intoxicated because of the social influences that have shaped their
behavioural repertoire, their personal beliefs about alcohol, and their
personal beliefs about how they should behave -- not simply because
alcohol controls behaviour.
There is a pressing need to reinforce the message, wherever and
whenever possible, that people are responsible for their actions when
intoxicated. The more people believe that alcohol can be blamed for
their actions the more likely that reprehensible behaviour will occur.

THE Rev James Small is guilty of using misleading statistics to try to
make a point (August 15).
He says that the real drop in Scotland's population from 1981 to 1991
is 15.7%. He does this by excluding 12.4% of the 1991 population who
were born outwith Scotland.
What he does not seem to have done is subtracted a similar figure from
his 1981 population figure to provide a correct comparison. His
speculation that follows about what Scotland's population might have
been is therefore invalid.
I find it amazing that Mr Small wishes to exclude from his figures the
612,397 people who were born outwith Scotland but have chosen to make
Scotland their home. Not only is it somewhat insulting, it demeans the
positive benefit that immigration has brought to Scotland, whether it be
internal movements of people within the UK or people coming to Scotland
from overseas.
Scotland now has a lower unemployment rate than the UK average for the
first time in many years and exports more per head than Japan. For a
country that has about 9% of the UK's population, it manages about 25%
of the UK's pension funds and is one of Europe's biggest computer
producers.
Hardly a case of the ''continuous destruction of the Scottish economy
since 1707''.

D J MACLEOD writes of the increasing danger of pedestrians being
knocked down by cyclists making use of pavements (August 10).
Local authorities have done well in extending cycleways and relieving
cyclists of the stress of competing with motor traffic. But with more
relaxed cycling attitudes pavements are included in the cycletrack
network and pedestrians now take the strain on the resulting stressways.
D J Macleod would like to see local authorities enforcing rules to
ensure the safety of pedestrians. What are the rules? What are the
penalties for breaking them? Do cyclists pay compensation for injuries
inflicted on the pavement?
Children of all ages use pavements as speed tracks -- seemingly with
the approval of their parents. Cycling proficiency courses are now a
regular feature of the school curriculum. Are they aimed only at
increasing skill and confidence? Is there any mention of responsibility?

YOUR correspondent John Kennedy hits the nail on the head today in
saying that the menace of cyclists on pavements is a growing problem
(August 15).
Further, it is almost certainly a serious accident waiting to happen.
Every day now I observe instances of schoolchildren on their large
''grown-up'' cycles dashing along narrow suburban pavements while the
more mature cyclists speed through city centre pedestrianised areas
luckily rather skilfully dodging pedestrians by millimetres.
Indeed, Glasgow's prestigious pedestrian precincts are rapidly
becoming a nonsense in this respect.
Only this morning pedestrians had to scatter for their lives in the
Sauchiehall Street area as a courier came down the hill at high speed on
a heavily loaded cycle.
Bells on cycles -- at one time considered to be an essential
precaution -- are now conspicuous by their total absence. So much for
adult common sense.
At one time a bobby on the beat would have dealt with such dangers but
how often does anyone see a bobby on the beat these days.
That leaves the council . . .

JOHN McKay writes on socialism with the enthusiasm of the true
ideologue. He says it has never been genuinely implemented. If it had
been, the world would be a better place (August 9).
So too would the world be a better place if Christianity (pick a
sect), Islam (likewise), Humanism, Buddhism, or just about any other
''ism'' was implemented at the expense of all others.
The trouble unfortunately is that human beings are too diverse in
nature and character to subscribe wholly to one perfect theory.
The alternative is to force people (for their own good, of course) to
embrace one's own version of the New Jerusalem, which is where people
with impeccable socialist credentials such as Benito Mussolini, Joseph
Goebbels, and Oswald Mosley step in.
And that's where I (among most others, I think) step out.

ALTHOUGH I do not wish to comment on the specific planning
applications mentioned in your leader (Open-cast destruction, August
15), the escalation in numbers of proposals for open-cast mines
demonstrates the weakness in the Government planning guidance covering
the topic.
This guidance purports to take a sustainable approach to the
development and extraction of mineral resources but, while paying lip
service to the need to promote alternative materials and the need for
recycling, it starts from the standpoint that the level of mineral
extraction is a consequence of customer demand, is a matter for market
forces, and that planning authorities therefore should not attempt to
become involved in attempting to influence this demand.
It should therefore come as no surprise that the approach taken by the
Scottish Office has led to the growth of proposals for mineral and
aggregate extraction throughout Scotland.
Surely if our environment is to be viewed in a sustainable manner it
should first look at how best to minimise demand for these aggregates
rather than merely attempt to cope with this demand in the best possible
way.

I AM afraid the otherwise interesting pieces on literary feuds were
rather spoilt when you rehearse the background to the flyting of William
Dunbar and Bishop Kennedy (Weekender, August 12).
The Kennedy in question was Walter Kennedy, third son of the first
Lord Kennedy of Dunure, who graduated from Glasgow University in 1478
and was at various times examiner at that university, Provost of the
Collegiate Church, Maybole, and Depute Baillie of Carrick. It was his
uncle, James Kennedy, who was the Bishop of St Andrews.
This flyting should not be taken at face value for, as Roderick Watson
has recently pointed out, ''It is a mock-serious genre undoubtedly
derived from the Gaelic tradition''. He was held in high regard as a
poet by his fellow makars, Gavin Douglas and Sir David Lindsay.
His erstwhile victim, William Dunbar, in his Lament for the Makars
pays Kennedy the final accolade by giving him alone amongst all their
contemporaries a whole stanza to himself in this stately elegy:
Gud maister Walter Kennedy

YOUR editorial and article on open-cast mining will have struck a
chord in many parts of rural Scotland (August 15).
Tillietudlem in Clydesdale faces similar intrusion by a proposed
open-cast mine. The area attracts large numbers of tourists and other
visitors and Craignethan Castle is a well-known local feature. This area
is on a major tourist route to New Lanark.
It is very unlikely the mine will create a single local job. Past
experience of open-cast mines is that the labour force is imported.
The inhabitants of Draffan and Tillietudlem face not only loss of
amenity and environmental damage but also long-term harm to the local
economy. Home owners may well find the value of their property falling.
The only winners are the private mining companies.
If Scottish Office ministers are puzzled by their unpopularity this
example can tell them why. The local community, and I as their
councillor, oppose the development. The Scottish Office will, as always,
back the quick-buck merchants.
They can rest assured that the Clyde Valley, like Ormiston, will fight
every inch of the way in defence of its environment and the local
economy.

Alexander Linklater confronts the good and bad faces of public
lecturing
THE Post Office Lecture this week should have been a mainstay of the
Book Festival. When a major British author gets together with a big
audience which includes many of her peers, the reasonable expectation is
that the occasion will focus the concerns which make literature worth
celebrating: the function of reading and writing, the projects of
fiction, contemporary conditions, the future.
Rose Tremain gave her audience almost nothing of this. She spoke
exclusively about her historical novel, Restoration, and its recent
adaptation for cinema. Very carefully she picked her way through the
book's central relationships and critical moments, explaining how they
were indispensable to the logic of her story. The film was failing, she
said, because it couldn't accommodate the symbolic transitions of
fiction.
This all took quite a long time to explain without being remotely
revealing. The whole scenario is so familiar. Stories about films which
ruin books are as old as Charlton Heston's Moses. And it wasn't even as
if this particular one sounded that bad. Rose Tremain was clearly quite
tickled by the idea of Hugh Grant and Robert Downey Jr playing her
characters.
Here was a talk about film-making by someone who didn't know much
about it. (Anyone who can say ''cinema is a literal medium'' can't have
seen that many films). The end result being that nothing much was said
about either movies or novels.
Which made it, by contrast, all the more exciting to listen to two
historical biographers who so profoundly understood the nature of good
fiction. Yesterday morning Claire Tomalin and Richard Holmes dug deep
into the private passions which lead them to search among a detritus of
letters, documents and historical fact for the hidden human story.
George IV's mistress, Mrs Jordan, gave him 10 children before she was
dumped. She had already had three. And yet no previous biography goes
into the domestic realities of her life. Claire Tomalin looks at history
through a line of mothers to pursue the secrets of such a character.
She had to know what it was that made someone like Mrs Jordan endure
her life with such wit, professionalism, and generosity. In between the
lines of official history such stories can be exhumed if you have the
investigative patience and a good narrative nose.
Richard Holmes told a story which was in itself a perfect explanation
for the storytelling obsessions of biography.
In Edinburgh, the city of Burke and Hare, Deacon William Brodie led
the double life of cabinetmaker and burglar. When he was caught they
hanged him on gallows made to his own design. But another of his
creations, a peculiar double-doored cabinet, found its way into the
possession of one Robert Louis Stevenson. This cryptic piece of
furniture and the split life of its maker gave Stevenson the dreams
which led to Jekyll and Hyde.
In talking about the personal secrets of the dead, Holmes was utterly
engrossing. He refuted the notion that biography is a Freudian process
that seeks jealously to destroy the reputations of past heroes.
Fieldwork, dreamwork, empathy and trust are his guiding principles,
along with a quotation from Voltaire: ''To the living we owe respect,
but to the dead we owe nothing but the truth.''

GOVERNMENTS worldwide reacted angrily to an underground nuclear blast
by China, saying it flew in the face of an undertaking in May by all
nuclear states to exercise utmost restraint in nuclear testing.
Diplomats said its timing was at the very least tactless, coming just
days after the 50th anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing, at
Hiroshima in Japan.
China argues it needs to conduct more tests because its technological
know-how lags behind the big four nuclear powers: the United States,
Russia, Britain, and France. Military experts believe the aim of China's
tests is to create lighter, more powerful warheads.
The explosion, equivalent to 20 to 80 kilotons of TNT, took place at
the Lop Nor nuclear test site in western Xinjiang at 2am British time
yesterday and created a shock that registered 5.6 on the Richter scale,
the Australian geological survey said in Canberra.
The United States said the test could harm efforts to reach a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
''The United States deeply regrets this action. All of the nuclear
weapon states agreed at the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review and
extension conference to exercise 'utmost restraint' in nuclear
testing,'' a White House statement said.
Japan threatened the strongest retaliation, hinting at aid cuts, while
New Zealand said the test was reprehensible.
A Greenpeace activist, who helped pull off an unprecedented if brief
anti-nuclear protest in Beijing on Tuesday, called the test a disaster
for international efforts to pass a comprehensive test ban.
''What they've just done is an act of tremendous international
provocation,'' said Ann Dingwall, who was deported by China to Hong Kong
on Wednesday.
Dingwall said France, which is under international pressure to cancel
its own test plans at Mururoa Atoll, was likely to be the only nation
which would not be upset by China's action.
In London, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament condemned ''the new
nuclear nightmare of the 90s''. A spokeswoman said the Chinese test
would only encourage the French to stick to their own plans to resume
nuclear testing.
CND said there were increasing fears that testing by China and France
and the deployment of Trident by Britain are early signs of a new arms
race.
It called on Mr Major to unequivocally condemn the latest test and to
support growing demands for the French to abandon their planned test.
Britain said it was not surprised by China's latest underground test.
''You could characterise our response as resigned to the fact that there
will be one or two tests from various parties such as the Chinese or the
French,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Australia, which has angrily condemned France's decision to resume
testing in the South Pacific, said the China test could lead to a
serious threat to world peace and regional security.
Prime Minister Paul Keating said the blast might reinforce aspirations
by non-nuclear states to develop nuclear arms.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger called the tests reprehensible
and disturbing.

Washington
THE Clintons are on holiday in Wyoming, but politics have followed
them there. They have to decide by next week whether Hillary Clinton
will attend the UN conference on women in Peking next month.
Relations between the United States and China are now worse than at
any time since President Nixon went to China to meet Mao Tse-tung in
1972. The Chinese were enraged when the president of Taiwan was allowed
to visit America earlier this year, and disputes over human rights in
China and Chinese trade practices continue to roil the waters.
A noted Chinese dissident, Harry Wu, now a US citizen, was arrested in
China this summer: he had smuggled himself into the country to
investigate abuses in the prison system. China continues to supply
long-range missiles to North Korea, Iran, and other countries and has
carried out naval manoeuvers near Taiwan.
The women's conference will bring 50,000 people to Peking from
September 4 to 15. China has tried to limit the number of unofficial
visitors and even some unsympathetic official delegates have encountered
long delays in getting visas. The fringe of the conference has been
banished to a town 50 miles from the main event.
If Mrs Clinton goes, she will be bitterly criticised by, among others,
Harry Wu's wife, who has written to her urging her to boycott the event,
the Republican Party, and those who most openly criticise China's
lamentable record on human rights.
They all say that China would use Mrs Clinton's presence to its
propagandistic advantage, whatever she had to say to the conference.
The White House hopes that China will release Mr Wu. It insists that
there would be no connection between his release and a decision to send
Mrs Clinton to Peking, but it would obviously be much easier.
Mrs Clinton herself wants to go. She says that the conference ''is an
important opportunity to focus attention on women'', that the US
delegation ''should play a very big leadership role in shaping the
agenda'', and ''the United States should do all it can to make sure that
barriers to women's participation are broken down and that training and
credit and political involvement and health care are available to all
women''.
State Department officials are keeping their heads down. This is a
matter Mrs Clinton will decide with the president. They say only: ''It's
a conference that's not about China, it's about women.''
All the same, they are aware of the difficulty of the choice.

THERE seemed to be a fairly clear division of opinion yesterday at the
packed recital given by Austrian baritone, Wolfgang Holzmair: you were
either for him or agin him.
The polarity of views stems directly from Holzmair's performing
manner. Simply, if you view the performance of Lieder and chansons as a
cerebral experience, Wolfgang Holzmair might be the ultimate turn-off.
He is famous for the intensity of his singing, but what I didn't
realise until yesterday was that his involvement in delivering the goods
is total. And physical.
Everything he performs is given the theatrical treatment; none of your
standing still at the piano, hands elegantly folded into each other.
Holzmair is of the whole body school of singing. In a set of Lieder by
Schubert, each clearly interpreted as a miniature music drama, and also
depicted as such by pianist Gerard Wyss, he veered -- in gesture and
delivery -- towards the operatic. Some listeners visibly retreated from
this approach; for me it meant even greater involvement.
His voice -- with occasionally suspect tuning at the top of the range
-- is handsomely equipped for his style. He can float a phrase as though
it is weightless, and, when he surges into power, he unleashes a volume
of sound that is appropriate to the operatic stage.
And what it did mean, in the glorious sequence of French chansons by
Duparc and Faure, was that -- though he could never match the subtlety
of the greatest native French singers -- he was unabashed about tapping
directly into the exquisite sensuality of this ravishing music.

* OK. Are you sitting down? I think the diary has cracked it. I think
we are talking the complete solution to Scottish Opera's current fiscal
crisis no less. And his name is Peter Llewellyn-Jones.
To recap for new readers, Scot Op's overdraft is in a parlous
condition and its chorus of 50-plus (excluding weans) has been in a
mutinous condition these many months. On to which running sore some
temporary Elastoplast has been applied allowing the Festival production
of The Jacobin to go ahead and prove to us that your man, Antonin
Dvorak, knew more about fine tunes than even that nice Mr Anderson.
Which brings us to Mr L-J. Modestly clad in black trousers and
open-necked shirt, he appears on stage throughout the entire three acts
giving the plot his dramatic all as befits a chap who has regular
employment with the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Mr L-J, you see, signs productions great and small for the deaf. So
for the three hours of this opera he plays, well, just about everybody.
At one juncture he appeared to be signing on behalf of seven soloists
and the entire chorus. So we have to ask ourselves if Scottish Opera,
with the services of such a uniquely versatile performer to hand, really
needs anyone else.
PS. British Telecom has sponsored signed interpretations of 18 Fringe
shows this year. Details on 0131-226 5138.
PPS. Scottish Opera's chairman Sandy Orr, attempting to get away from
it all for a spell, rented himself a quiet little villa plus pool in the
wilds of Tuscany.
Except that when he got there he found the owner ensconced in an
annexe. A gregarious owner who had a party for some two dozen of his
close relations on the first night around what Sandy had fondly imagined
was his private poolside.
In the circumstances he did what a West Coast boy does in times of
trouble. Fled to Mull. Better weather too.
* MORNING coffee and much agreeable reminiscing with Mr Maurice
Roeves, here on a flying visit from Los Angeles to join the ever more
glittery cast-list assembled by Andrew Byatt for his Scottish Actors'
Studio workshops.
Twelve years in Luvvytown has not dimmed the Glasgow accent or the
straight talking even though his other regular base-camp is London.
He's just back from filming a new version of The Ten Commandments with
Ben Kingsley in Morocco where he plays Zerak -- the Edward G Robinson
role in the original Heston version. Happily the screenplay has
undergone something of a linguistic facelift in the interim.
Roeves, the recipient of the 1994/95 Best Stage Actor Award from the
LA Times, clearly hasn't been neglecting his board skills either,
although he tells me he's now suffering from a serious writing bug and
plans to spend the next 18 months chained to the word processor. However
he has a longer-term plan to keep him in suitably solvent style which
involves his enviable collection of original Levis.
Although the boyish features and ever lean body defy you to believe
it, Maurice is only a year distant from hitting the big 60. At which
juncture he plans to offer the jeans company a current snap of himself
poured into 30-year-old denim with the accompanying slogan . . . In His
Sixties He's Still In His Sixties!
* FRINGE-GOERS still baffled by the new-look Fringe Brochure now have
a visual aid to combat terminal indecision.
Now showing at a video screen near you, one-minute extracts from
scores of shows, made by the artistes themselves and knocked into
seamless shape by Scottish Television.
However Fringe director Hilary Strong did feel impelled to view every
foot of the rough cut in case these naughty thesps had inadvertently
offended against public decency. Which, of course, they hadn't.
Well, all right, there was the shot of that odd young man having
toilet paper set alight in close proximity to his hindquarters. But so
coy are this year's youth that he kept his Y's on all the while. Sweet
really.
* BEING a right on, PC sort of lot, Poulter and Duff invited several
groups who had been working in the public health field to their A-Z of
Drugs at the Assembly Rooms. Including Crew 2000 which works with young
people on harm-reduction schemes. Crew 2000 gave the anxious cast a
reasonable review afterwards.
And a list of currently popular substances they'd missed out!
* A WORLD first. This week saw the queues for the official Festival
tickets outgun the queues for the Military Tattoo. Or so alleges a
usually reliable eyewitness.
On the other hand, Brian McMaster probably isn't the most objective
source of comment.

FOR a sum of money which would barely meet the cost of the catering
bill for your average Hollywood movie, director David Hayman and
producer Len Crooks have created a work of immense style, outstanding
quality, and exceptional depth. Quite simply, The Near Room is a
close-to-perfect example of what a contemporary film noir should be.
Armed with a potent storyline from writer Robert Murphy (the man has a
rare talent to deceive) which, though complex, never once loses its way
amid its dark twists and sinister turns, Hayman has removed the safety
catch and shot a tense and genuinely menacing thriller which is,
occasionally, rather startling in its execution.
The performances, particularly from Adrian Dunbar as the central
character Charlie Colquhoun, a hard-bitten tabloid hack, and David
O'Hara as Harris Hill, a too-good-to-be-true lawyer who specialises in
social causes, are both strong and peculiarly compelling.
The remaining cast (which includes James Ellis, Julie Graham, Sean
Scanlan, Robert Pugh, Hayman himself, and that great Scots actor Tom
Watson in particularly fine form) are faultless and do no mean justice
to the excellence of the script.
The Near Room is a story about demons. Not a horror tale; no fantasy
monsters here. In this, the monsters are all too human and the demons
are the personal ones which lurk in the minds of all of us should we
delve deep enough into our psyche to shake them into life.
When Charlie Colquhoun was a teenage schoolkid he fathered a child; a
little girl called Thomasina Stirling. They called her Tommy and they
placed her in care. Or maybe she was adopted. Or fostered. Colquhoun was
young; it was all the same to him.
But now years later, working as an investigative reporter in Glasgow
and answering to a foul-mouthed tyrant of an editor (Hayman), Colquhoun
gets a call from Clegg, an underworld contact. He's got a story. It's a
scandal about a kid. Her name is Tommy Stirling.
Dark memories return to haunt Colquhoun. Terrible thing, guilt. The
child is his. Must be his. He abandoned her and now she's in trouble; if
Clegg knows her then it's a dead cert she's in soapy. But then he finds
Clegg dead, his throat cut, his mouth permanently shut before he can
tell his story.
And so Colquhoun embarks upon a journey into the heart of his
darkness. Towards his own near room. And what is the near room? It's the
place ''where snakes scream and alligators play trombones''. The door to
the near room is there for everyone to open; go through it and you enter
your own personal hell where past demons reappear to raise their ugly
heads.
But Colquhoun is not the only person knocking on Hades' door. There's
Hill, his former schoolfriend, now a charismatic lawyer with a
conscience so pure that it just has to be suspect. What is his
connection to the affair? Why should he be so interested in a little
girl long-abandoned?
The journalist's search for his daughter leads him into the city's
disturbing demi monde, a place where it's always night and the people
you encounter are whores, pimps, and junkies. And here we find the real
star of the movie: Glasgow. Not the chocolate-box city of pretty parks
and sophisticated cafes. This is the squalid underbelly. Welcome to the
real world, its dangerous edge suffused in murky shadows (the lighting
is one of the movie's greatest strengths).
The dreadful truth emerges that Tommy was involved in a sordid
blackmail ring involving paedophiles. The finger of guilt trembles and
begins to point in Hill's direction.
Then there's a second murder, that of a shady policeman (Robert Pugh),
and suddenly Colquhoun emerges as the prime suspect.By chance, he speaks
to a terrified Tommy on the telephone and, finally, he drives to a
remote country house, home to a group of New Age tree-huggers, where the
child has sought refuge. Finally, he discovers the truth and returns to
the city with Tommy, intent on confronting the vile fiend who has abused
his daughter.
But en route Colquhoun turns his back for a brief moment and the child
is abducted at a roadside cafe. Now there is only one way to save her.
He has to face Harris Hill and, together, they must enter the near room.
Naturally, there is a sting in the tail, the ubiquitous denoument which
no self-respecting thriller should be without.
The Near Room is a wonderfully nasty piece of work which reeks of
low-life atmosphere. It is violent, but not excessively so. Faults?
Well, perhaps a small one. The F-word -- with which I seldom have a
problem -- is grossly over-used. To the point of distraction, in fact.
Okay, I know that it's simply an attempt to reflect the reality of the
Glasgow parlance. But when we hear it repeated with monotonous
regularity in a cinematic setting it tends to become far too
conspicuous.
Finally, a word of praise for young Emma Faulkner who plays Tommy, a
child much older than her years. Her performance will haunt you.
Outwardly she is tough and in-your-face but inside there is a
desperately sad and fragile little girl aching for a love she has never,
in her life, been allowed to find.
* The Near Room opens tonight at the Glasgow Film Theatre as part of
the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival.

<TEXT>
WAR hero Lord Lovat wrote his will on his death-bed two weeks before
he died, it has been revealed.
The 82-year-old veteran, once described by Winston Churchill as ''the
mildest man to ever scuttle a ship or cut a throat'', showed his
compassion for commoner and aristocrat alike.
He made many small bequests to Army comrades, estate workers, and
family friends but one of the largest was to Myra Freed, the woman who
nursed him when he had a near-fatal heart attack in 1951. She has been
left #3000.
He had been kept informed throughout his lengthy illness of the fate
that awaited his once-proud and vast estate and knew that it would have
to be sold to pay off the family debts.
However, in one final stance of defiance, Lord Lovat tried to ensure
that at least Balblair House, the mansion where he spent his final days,
would remain in the family.
He left it to his wife, Rosamund, and subsequently to their oldest
surviving son, Hugh. However, he also left strict instructions that if
Balblair House had to be sold, the current Lord Lovat, now his grandson,
Simon, should have the chance to buy it.
The contents he also left to Lady Lovat and in a further effort to
ensure she spends her final days in some comfort, he left permission for
the contents to be sold by her, if necessary, for her own benefit.
Lord Lovat gave up administering the huge family estate 26 years ago,
handing it over to his son, the Master of Lovat, Simon, who died from a
heart attack, aged 54, almost exactly a year before his father.
What the founder of the Commandos retained has been valued at #1.9m.
Around #1m of that is the value of Balblair House and other heritable
estate, while the remainder comprises mostly paintings, furnishings,
shares, and bank accounts.
One poignant remark logged in the document is a #500 gift to his
former Commando colleagues.
Lord Lovat instructed: ''To my old comrades in the First Commando
Brigade, men I once had the honour to command, I bequeath #500.'' The
money will be distributed by the Old Comrades Association.
Workers at Balblair House, where Lord Lovat lived with his wife, were
also remembered. Gardener Donald Jack, who still lives in staff quarters
at the house, was left #1000.
Forestry worker Ivan Stuart, who knew Lord Lovat for more than 30
years, was left #500 and his wife Janice was left #300.
Mr Stuart, of Millcroft, Kilmorack, said: ''We were pleasantly
surprised to find out about the inheritance. We were not expecting it.
But Lord Lovat was a kind man and a friend to many.''
In total, #16,000 was left to friends and staff.
Lord Lovat's favourite sport, shinty, was also recognised with Lovat
and Beauly Shinty clubs each receiving #500 to ''keep up and maintain
the manly and martial traditions of the Aird and Clan Fraser County''.
Highland Hospice and the Roman Catholic churches at Beauly and
Eskadale, where the funerals of Lord Lovat and his two sons took place,
also each received #500.
A #2000 account has been opened for the benefit of ''old friends from
the past who helped run the estate''. They are seven former heads of
staff who helped manage the once-massive Fraser lands, which are now up
for sale for more than #6m.
Closing date for offers was last Thursday but there has still been no
announcement about the eventual buyer. It is likely the estate will be
split among a host of purchasers.
One who has been tipped to buy the family seat of Beaufort Castle is
Lord Lovat's daughter, Tessa Keswick. She has been left a Raoul Millais
painting which hung over her father's fireplace.
Balblair House, its contents, and the remainder of the estate go to
Lord Lovat's widow, and the house will be passed on to his oldest
surviving son, Hugh, on her death.
Lady Lovat is already planning to move out of the house so that her
favourite son can make it home for his family now.
Hugh has also been given several areas of woodland and shooting
rights. He said yesterday: ''Although my father was dying, he was still
in possession of his faculties right up to the end. He rewrote his will
every year to ensure he was able to cover the many people he was close
to.''
The new Lord Lovat, 18-year-old Simon, son of the late Master of
Lovat, has not been forgotten. He has inherited the woodlands and
shooting rights of Eskadale Wood.
If a film is ever made of the life of one of the bravest and most
famous landowners in the country, his other daughter, Fiona Allen, will
inherit the rights of broadcasting or filming the book of his memoirs,
March Past.

THE prospect of Caledonian Publishing, owners of The Herald, mounting
a bid to buy Scotsman Publications and Aberdeen Journals, publishers of
our great rival, The Scotsman, and its sister title, the Press &amp;
Journal, has stirred up a foaming froth of speculation in the rest of
the media and in Scottish business circles.
The facts of the matter are simply stated. The Connecticut-based
Thomson Corporation, having sold its English regional newspaper chain to
Trinity, has hung For Sale signs round its two Scottish newspaper
businesses. It has indicated that it would prefer to sell the papers in
a single package. Caledonian, together with a large number of other
media groups, has registered its interest in that sale.
Once Caledonian and its advisers have studied the books of the
Edinburgh and Aberdeen-based businesses -- and remember, it is two years
since either filed separate accounts, following their consolidation into
the Thomson Regional Newspapers UK accounts -- a firm offer to acquire
may follow.
These are the unvarnished facts. But already the mere prospect of
three of Scotland's four morning daily broadsheets being owned by a
single publisher has sent the hares of speculation, indignation, and
malice scampering through the heather, acting for all the world as if
this were March not August.
It is suggested, notably by former Scotsman editor Sir Alastair
Dunnett, that a Glasgow-based company isn't a fitting owner for
Edinburgh's established broadsheet. It is alleged by another former
Scotsman editor, Englishman Andrew Jaspan, that Caledonian's management
is hardly up to running the titles it's got, let alone a stable boosted
by Thomson's Scottish portfolio.
There is the absurd charge that Caledonian wants to buy The Scotsman
simply to shut it down. There is the widespread assertion that, for
Caledonian, frustrated so far in its ambitions for a stock market
listing, this deal represents ''double or quits''. And there is a
knee-jerk reaction, in some quarters, insisting that any plan to put The
Herald, The Scotsman and The P&amp;J under the same Scottish-based ownership
would automatically fall foul of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The heat already generated by the news of Caledonian's interest in the
Thomson titles suggests the outcome of this sale matters deeply to a
great many people. But why is who owns these papers so important? I
believe Herald readers have the right to have the key arguments
rehearsed. That is why this article is devoted to matters very close to
home, here in Albion Street.
I do not write as a mouthpiece for Caledonian. I offer, as I always
try to do, my own perspective. But first, let me declare a small
personal interest. I own 169 shares in Caledonian Publishing, around the
same number as most other members of staff. I do not expect to make my
fortune from that holding, no matter how successful Caledonian proves to
be. So, what follows is not motivated by the glint of future gold.
I have worked in newspapers since 1981, first on the late-lamented
Sunday Standard, then, for nearly three years, with The Scotsman and,
since November 1986, here at The Herald. In all that time the indigenous
Scottish broadsheet market has remained as balkanised as ever it was.
Excluding the tabloids, Glaswegians predominantly read The Herald. The
Scotsman dominates Edinburgh's breakfast tables. Dundonians take DC
Thomson's Courier. And in Aberdeen, The P&amp;J reigns supreme.
Management strategies to break into each other's core markets have
come and gone. But, while small circulation gains have been made at the
margin, local reader loyalties have, on the whole, held firm. When
Edinburgh acquaintances have occasionally expressed dissatisfaction with
The Scotsman, I have always inquired why more of them don't switch to
The Herald. Their answers are strikingly consistent.
''You don't list the Edinburgh births, deaths and marriages.'' Or
''You don't carry enough east coast classified ads.'' Or ''I couldn't
sell my house through The Herald.'' Only when these social and practical
concerns are out of the way have we ever got down to debating editorial
issues, like the relative coverage of local news.
In recent years that balkanised stand-off has been shaken from the
outside. London-based newspaper groups, after years of neglect and, in
some cases, effective withdrawal, have rediscovered the Scottish
marketplace. The Sun has reinvented itself, embracing the nationalist
cause, but only north of the Border.
The Murdoch papers, The Mail, and The Express, have exploited modern
production technology to launch Scottish cover versions of what you can
buy in London, printed here and introducing a leavening of local news
stories, Scottish columnists and Scottish sport to the mix. Even The
Financial Times now prints in Leeds, bringing later-breaking financial
news to its small Scottish readership.
I have no quarrel with that increasing competition for Scottish
readers. It stimulates all of us to try harder and produce even better
newspapers than we did yesterday. But this reawakening of interest in
the Scottish newspaper market has coincided with a protracted
cover-price war which does carry with it worrying implications.
Rupert Murdoch started it. Conrad Black's Telegraph responded, as did
The Independent. The Scottish version of The Mail is, thus far, a
cut-price offering too. Even The Scotsman and its Sunday stablemate,
Scotland on Sunday, have had to respond with cut-price coupon offers.
There is clear evidence that slashing the cover price does attract
extra readers. The Mail has nearly doubled its Scottish readership. The
Scottish circulation of The Times is up almost 50%. Indigenous Scottish
titles, lacking the resources to respond in kind, have borne much of the
pain.
When I was at The Scotsman 10 years ago, its daily circulation was
knocking on the door of 100,000. Today it stands at barely
three-quarters of that. The Herald has fared better, but has still lost
4.5% of its average daily sales in the latest Audit Bureau half-yearly
figures.
Bluntly, the indigenous Scottish broadsheet press is facing the
fiercest battle for readers in its long history, against expansionist
southern rivals with much deeper pockets who can and will price their
product well below the cost of production. Ironically, this battle is
joined at the very point where Scotland -- assuming the opinion polls
are correct -- is poised to receive a significant measure of home rule
and its own elected assembly in Edinburgh.
In the midst of this bitter fight for readers, the Thomson Corporation
decides to put its Scottish papers up for sale, a once-in-a-generation
opportunity. A management buy-out of Scotsman Publications, similar to
that which brought control of The Herald back to Glasgow, has been ruled
out. There is talk of other consortia bids to keep control of the titles
in Scotland. There is also talk that the DC Thomson empire in Dundee is
interested in the Aberdeen titles. But so far the only concrete
expression of interest which would keep the Thomson titles Scottish has
come from Caledonian.
Mr Jaspan, who was so dismissive of that interest on Radio Scotland
last week, was responsible, in his brief tenure of the editor's chair at
North Bridge, for a radical revamp of The Scotsman. That revamp
coincided with a further significant fall in Scotsman sales.
Mr Jaspan, who purports to care about the continued vitality of an
independent Scottish press, but who failed to tell his radio listeners
that he has been encouraging his new employers, Guardian Media Group, to
bid for Thomson's Scottish titles, might care to answer one simple
question.
If Caledonian does not pursue its interest in the Thomson papers, what
stands between them and control by a London or overseas newspaper group?
And if a deep-pocketed outsider buys The Scotsman and unleashes another
round of the cover-price wars north of the Border, what prospect The
Herald's continued independence, as well?
He is vituperative about Caledonian's management. But neither he, nor
anyone else at the time of the Caledonian buy-out, could have foreseen
how protracted the recession would be, the prospect of a damaging
cover-price war or the rocketing price of newsprint. Caledonian's
management is not perfect. No management, in my experience, ever is.
But the commercial challenges our parent company faces are the same
ones facing the Thomson titles and every one else in the industry. The
fact that Caledonian has not yet achieved a stock market listing is more
a matter of luck and timing -- key factors in the success of any
leveraged buy-out -- than anything else.
The Midland Independent buy-out in Birmingham did make it to market.
But their shares today trade at a significant discount to the offer
price, effectively spiking the appetite of investors for more of the
same.
If we follow through the logic of a deep-pocketed London group buying
The Scotsman and then buying readers by slashing the cover price, it is
not difficult to sketch a scenario in which a Scottish Assembly opens
for business with all the main Scottish broadsheets, with the exception
of The Courier, controlled by newspaper groups with decidedly
London-dominated agendas.
Even if the Tories recover and win the next election, and the prospect
of devolution recedes, a Scottish press controlled by major London
newspaper groups would mark, in my view, a seriously retrograde step,
one which ought to concern Scots of every political persuasion.
With The Herald owned by Lonrho and The Scotsman and The P&amp;J owned by
Canadians, the proprietorial hand on the editorial tiller was light. If
Scotland, with or without an assembly, has any real pretensions to
maintaining its distinctive national identity, it needs a responsive
press with the freedom to reflect Scottish aspirations and priorities,
Scottish concerns and choices. That objective cannot be achieved by
inserting a Scottish supplement here, an opportunist change of political
allegiance there, or a tartan wrap-round everywhere. It would be
extinguished if every major broadsheet ended up being owned by London
press barons.
There has been a lot of ill-considered talk about a Caledonian bid
creating a monopoly in the Scottish newspaper market. Even if The
Herald, The Scotsman and The P&amp;J were all owned by one company, total
daily sales of the three titles at present account for no more than 17%
of all morning newspaper sales in Scotland. And, as I've already pointed
out, there is modest overlap in their respective circulation areas. If,
as it should do, Caledonian gives firm guarantees of editorial
independence to each title, there should be little to worry the MMC in
such a deal.
The real prize, at a time when other Scottish companies, like
ScottishPower and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, have been turning the tide of
hostile takeover which so eroded Scotland's corporate base in the 1980s,
is a Scottish media company of sufficient size and diversity to add
further weight to that renaissance. A company which, once listed, we
could all invest in.
If it matters to have a Scottish system of justice and a distinctive
educational tradition, Scottish banks and churches and our own solutions
to issues as diverse as economic development and water and electricity
privatisation, it matters that Scotland retains a Scottish-owned press
which reflects that diversity. That's what is really at stake in the
bidding for The Scotsman and the other Thomson titles.

TO THE trenches, boys, the Abbey is coming -- the stage management at
the King's Theatre must be crying this week. For the second year in
succession the Abbey Theatre Company is making an assault on the
Edinburgh theatre.
Abbey director Patrick Mason makes a full confession: ''Last year we
filled the theatre with mud for The Well of the Saints, they're probably
still finding clumps of peat in the pit, and now we're taking a big hole
out of the stage.''
Staff at the King's have been furiously digging to prepare the massive
10ft by 3ft 6in trench for the Abbey's production of Frank McGuinness's
Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards The Somme, part of the
International Festival programme.
The play was first produced 10 years ago by the Abbey and Mason
restaged it last year to mark the Northern Ireland ceasefire. At a press
conference yesterday McGuinness explained his motivation for writing a
drama which, in celebrating the blood sacrifice of Ulstermen during the
First World War, might seem at odds with his own Nationalist background.
''I felt a challenge to try to enter the Protestant experience and
imagination,'' he said, emphasising that: ''the play is more about
recognition than reconciliation. If we are going to redefine our culture
then we have to make massive acts of recognition.
''The Protestant people in Ireland have a story and a history and I
wanted to tell it.''
Festival director Brian McMaster is hoping the Abbey will also be
making an assault on audience figures -- and with over 50% of tickets
already sold and with a near-capacity crowd for tonight's opening
performance, he is confident that ticket bookings will escalate through
word-of-mouth acclaim.

THE Sutherland village of Brora is being ''held to ransom'' by a hard
core of local youths, according to a senior police officer.
Members of the public are said to be afraid to report witnessing
assaults and vandalism because of fear of reprisals.
Inspector Donald Oliphant, based at Dornoch, said at a community
council meeting that the police were unable to solve the problem without
public support.
He said: ''We have a hard-core element of about 12 who are basically
holding the Brora community to ransom. They are dictating the level of
behaviour. Police officers get involved with them but our problem is we
are lacking witnesses to incidents.
''People will phone us and complain about this particular group but
they do not wish to become involved. The moment they say that to us, our
hands are tied because we cannot progress it any further.
''Unless people are prepared to stand up and be counted, they will get
the level of behaviour in the community which they deserve because they
are not standing up for their community.''
Mr Oliphant was told, however, that many people would be afraid of
giving evidence in court because they felt that they would be victimised
by the youths.
Community councillor Margaret Jaffrey said elderly people in
particular were afraid to come forward.
She said: ''Part of this element have quite a widespread family
network in the village and it is causing problems. People are scared to
speak out.''
Mr Oliphant said intimidation was ''totally unacceptable'' and would
be treated more seriously than any original offence.
The community council's vice chairman, Mr John MacDonald, agreed that
people had to be ready to report incidents to the police. He warned that
a serious or fatal injury could happen if something was not done soon.
He said: ''Unless we all support the police, we will all be hostages
to this problem, and if it goes on it won't be long before something of
an appalling nature happens.''
Community councillors are to look at the possibility of setting up a
neighbourhood watch scheme and of inviting a crime prevention officer to
meet them.

A 13-YEAR-OLD girl who ran away to Scotland after hiding under a bed
from her mother has been ordered by a judge to go back to Ireland.
Lord Dawson decided that Victoria Marshall should return to Kinsale,
in County Cork, despite the opinion of a psychologist that she should be
allowed to stay with her father in Fraserburgh.
The judge took the view that there was a ''degree of exaggeration'' in
Victoria's reasons for being unhappy in Ireland.
The girl's mother, Mrs Mary Marshall, asked the judge at the Court of
Session for an order under the Child Abduction and Custody Act for the
return of her daughter. This was opposed by the girl.
Lord Dawson was informed that Mrs Marshall and her husband, Paul, were
married in 1974 and had five children. They lived in Kinsale until June
last year, when they separated and Mr Marshall moved to Scotland.
Mrs Marshall formed a relationship with another man and Victoria
alleged that the couple were more interested in going out drinking than
caring about the children.
This claim was denied by the couple, who disputed that they went out
or drank to excess.
Victoria said she had become more and more unhappy and confided in her
aunt for whom she babysat on a regular basis.
In April this year, she decided that she had had enough and, with her
aunt's help, caught a plane to Edinburgh after telephoning her father.
Before she left, her mother had been searching for her all night and
had gone to the aunt's house. She was told that Victoria was not there
but, in fact, she was hiding under a bed.
Under the Hague Convention on which the Child Abduction and Custody
Act is based, a child is normally returned to where he or she has been
living, for the courts there to decide on custody.
However, that may not happen if the child has a valid objection to
being returned and the judge is satisfied that he or she is mature
enough for these views to be taken into account.
Lord Dawson said he had not found it an easy case to decide.
''Victoria was clearly unhappy with her life in Ireland. I was quite
satisfied that her objection to returning was genuine and heartfelt. I
was also satisfied that she was happy to remain in Scotland and was
under no pressure from her father to remain.''
The psychologist who interviewed Victoria had also told the court that
Victoria was old enough and mature enough to understand what she was
doing.
The psychologist said: ''It is my opinion that her wishes should be
respected, that she would not agree to live with her mother and would
return to Scotland at the first opportunity.''
Lord Dawson said there had to be good and valid reasons for the girl's
objecting to being sent home.
He had heard evidence from her mother, the boyfriend, and Victoria's
older sister as well as independent witnesses who contradicted
Victoria's version of events.
The judge took the view that she was exaggerating her reasons for
being unhappy in Ireland.
He pointed out that her father, who lives in Mid Street, St Combs,
Fraserburgh, had not noticed that Victoria was unhappy during his visits
to Ireland shortly before she ran away.
Lord Dawson added: ''I therefore hold that it has not been established
that, standing the age and maturity of Victoria, there is sufficient
substance given for her objection to returning.''

THE grim list of K2 fatalities was first compiled for one of the
classic books to stem from the mountain, The Endless Knot by Kurt
Diemberger, and it was reprinted by Jim Curran.
The first death was on July 30, 1939, when an American, Dudley Wolfe
died of what now looks like high altitude sickness and exhaustion at
7550 metres on the Abruzzi Spur. Wolfe was a strange figure, a wealthy
playboy with yachts, power boats, fast cars and much enthusiasm for
mountains coupled with a near-total lack of ability. It reportedly took
two guides to haul his bulk up easy climbs while he could only descend
safely under constant supervision.
Chosen probably for his funds in a highly-unbalanced American team, he
died a miserable and appalling death in a tent beyond any hope of relief
and rescue, the lowest point of a doomed attempt which led to endless
recriminations throughout American mountaineering. It is almost a
footnote to that episode that three Sherpas also lost their lives.
It was August 1953, before the next death, that of another American,
Art Gilkey -- a fatality around which legend has grown. Gilkey, who had
developed blood clots in the veins of his left leg at around 7800
metres, certainly knew he was doomed. After a traumatic fall which
almost wiped out the whole expedition as they tried to bring Gilkey
down, did Gilkey cut himslef loose to save the others?
No one will ever know, but the Hunza porters built a memorial cairn on
a spur above the confluence of the Savoia and Godwin-Austen Glaciers.
Others have been buried close by over the years.
The first famous British climber to perish was Nick Estcourt, in June,
1978. Estcourt was slab avalanched while crossing an exposed snow slope
at 6500 metres on K2's West Ridge. Doug Scott, on the other end of the
rope, was saved when his heavy rucksack anchored him, snapping the rope.
The deaths continued sporadically through the 70s and early 80s,
including heart attacks to a Pakistani climber and a Pole. Then came the
climactic events of 1986 which began with the deaths of Americans John
Smolich and Alan Pennington in an avalanche at 6000 metres on the SSW
Ridge. Three days later the French couple Liliane and Maurice Barrard
were killed while descending the Abruzzi Spur. On July 10, 16 days
later, the famous Polish climber Tadeusz Piotrowski, fell while
descending the Abruzzi, and six days later the Italian Renato Casarotto
fell into a crevasse at 6500 metres.
The grisly roll call continued with the death of Wojceich Wroz, a
Polish climber who fell while descending on August 3 and a Pakistani,
Mohammed Ali, the following day -- killed by a stonefall low down on the
mountain. Three days later came the death of Julie Tullis, an event
still attended by controversy. Tullis died apparently of exhaustion
after a fall, having reached the summit late in the day with Kurt
Diemberger.
Alan Rouse, another famous British name, died of high altitude
sickness and exhaustion three days later, the same day that the
Austrians Alfred Imitzer and hannes Wieser and the great Polish woman
climber Dobroslawa Wolf also perished from the same causes. Then
followed a pause in the deaths as K2 saw fewer exhibiitions in the
following five years. But 1993 saw five more climbers die and last year
a similar number as the rate of expeditioning picked up once more.
Of those who reached the summit in the fateful year of 1986 and
survived the descent, five subsequently died -- Michel Parmentier and
Petr Bozik on Everest, Jerzy Kukuczka on Lhotse, Gianni Calcagno on
Denali, and Wanda Rutkiewicz on Kangchenjunga.

A TRAVEL company was fined #1000 yesterday for using false information
in its holiday brochure.
Airtours claimed that the Club Tahiti apartments in Costa Teguise,
Lanzarote, were air-conditioned. However, Glasgow couple Kevin and Alice
McDaid arrived to find that this was not the case.
Airtours, of Helmshore, Lancashire, pleaded guilty at Glasgow Sheriff
Court to a contravention of the Trade Descriptions Act.
Sheriff Craig Henry said it was important that tour operators ensured
the information in their brochures was correct.
Miss Diane Turner, prosecuting, said the McDaids, of 3 Central Path,
Mount Vernon, booked a holiday in Lanzarote for July last year. Two days
before they were due to leave, they were told by their travel agent that
the apartments had been overbooked, and were offered alternative
accommodation.
Mrs McDaid got the firm to fax her the brochure page describing the
Club Tahiti, which said the apartments were air-conditioned and were
rated three keys, and then accepted the new location.
Mr Michael Ritchie, defending, said the company very much regretted
what had happened and had taken steps to tighten up its system of
checking accommodation.
The lawyer said that normally Airtours double-checked the brochure
descriptions were correct. ''Normally, if a mistake is made, the second
check ensures it is corrected and rectified before it appears,'' he
said.
Mr Ritchie said the company had compensated the couple.

AN ICE cream manufacturer admitted last night that it was rationing
its products to cope with unprecedented demand.
Birds Eye Wall's said that, despite round-the-clock production at its
Gloucester factory, it was ''allocating'' supplies of ice creams to
retailers.
Ice lollies have been the big sellers.
A spokeswoman for Birds Eye Wall's said: ''Soft drinks manufacturers
are in exactly the same position. We supply shops, petrol forecourts and
leisure outlets and we are allocating stock to make sure everyone gets
some.''
It meant that ice cream outlets would not necessarily receive all the
products they ordered.
She said ice cream sales in August were forecast to be double that of
the same month last year while Wall's sales in July soared to 100
million portions -- or two ice creams for every man, woman and child in
the UK.
''The unprecedented and prolonged hot weather has caused huge demand
in a short space of time, especially for the refreshment lines
(lollies).
''We are working full-pelt 24 hours a day to keep up with demand.''
* Mushrooms are the latest victims of the heatwave. They don't like
the heat and are refusing to grow and there is now a nationwide
shortage.
Supermarkets and restaurants are having to buy the Dutch variety at
more than double the price.
A spokesman for Scottish Mushrooms said yesterday that even a week of
cooler weather could have production back to normal.
''But while the hot weather continues we don't stand a chance'' he
said.
* With the royal family in residence, the area around Balmoral -- with
temperatures hitting 82F -- was one of the hottest in the country
yesterday. Nearby Aboyne boasted the highest officially recorded
temperature of the day in Scotland.
The only places to rival Deeside were a few sheltered Highland glens,
and Glasgow and Dumfries came close with 81F.
Weather forecasters promised a hot and sunny weekend almost everywhere
in Scotland, with the dry spell showing no signs of ending.
A spokesman for the Glasgow Weather Centre said: ''The charts show it
will stay fine right into next week. There may be a little cloud in the
North-west, but the high pressure will continue.''
* Experts say the bookmakers' money is safe -- the odds are
lengthening against the temperature hitting 100F.
Boookmakers stand to lose a fortune if that happens.
However, after shortening the odds last week, they are breathing more
easily.
Met Office experts now say it is unlikely that temperatures will go
above the 98.9 degrees recorded in Cheltenham in August 1990.
The days are starting to shorten as the sun sets earlier and earlier,
reducing the chances of it getting any warmer.
* AS lawns remain parched in the dry spell, Woburn Golf club in
Bedfordshire admitted pouring 65,000 gallons of water a day for the last
three months on their greens and fairways.
Automatic sprinklers have been pumping water every night to prepare
the 18-hole Duke's course for today's Women's British Open.
The club -- which is owned by the Duke of Bedford -- made an agreement
with Anglian Water to use its entire quota watering the championship
course.
Mr Alex Hay, managing director of Woburn Golf and Country Club, said
the company was spending about #200 a night on watering the course.

BRITISH hostages Paul Wells and Keith Mangan may be the victims of a
secret Indian Government ''dirty tricks'' operation to discredit
militant Kashmiri separatist movements, according to military sources.
It is also understood that New Delhi has so far resisted an offer made
earlier this week by Whitehall to provide an SAS assault team for a
rescue mission to free the four surviving captives by force.
They were reported yesterday to be ''quite healthy''. Mr K V Krishna
Rao, governor of India's Jammu and Kashmir state, said a government
intermediary had contacted the Al-Faran militants, who killed a fifth
hostage by beheading him.
He said that while a rescue raid would be risky, it remained an
option. However, a senior military source claimed last night it was
increasingly probable the little-known Al-Faran faction was being armed
and funded by India and may even be led by undercover Indian commandos
or Afghan mercenaries. Some of its hard-core members may not even be
aware who was controlling them.
He said: ''The events of the past week have all the hallmarks of a
covert Indian 'black' operation aimed at isolating Islamic militants in
Kashmir by turning international opinion against them. The hidden agenda
is an end to criticism of New Delhi's military repression in the region
and freedom of action to take decisive military steps.
''The fact that the four remaining hostages are British, American, and
German -- drawn from three of the most influential Western nations -- is
no coincidence.
''The beheading of the Norwegian captive earlier this week was a
classic terror tactic calculated for maximum shock effect. His
decapitation was a deliberate and cruelly cynical attempt to grab world
attention and shape opinion.
''Al-Faran has also been communicating remarkably freely and directly
with both the Indian Government and its state-controlled media. No other
genuine Kashmiri resistance group has done so in more than five years of
armed conflict.''
Pakistan also accused India of being behind the kidnappings to raise
tension in the disputed region for political ends. Foreign Minister
Aseff Ahmad Ali told a news conference his government believed New
Delhi's aim was to defame what he called the Kashmiri freedom struggle
and give a political boost to Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. India
and Pakistan have fought two full-scale wars over the disputed state
since 1965.
The overwhelmingly Islamic state is the centre of growing resistance
to rule by Hindu India. More than 100 liberation groups, with up to
40,000 men, are fighting the Indian administration.
Al-Faran has demanded jailed militants be freed in exchange for the
hostages.

K2, the ultimate test, can exact the highest price from a climber.
James Freeman looks at the history of a formidable challenge and those
who have perished in an attempt to conquer it.
WHEN the next chapter in the history of K2 is written, the name of
Alison Hargreaves will inevitably figure large in what has become an
epic of human endeavour punctuated by tragedy.
Alison's name will join a lengthy roll call of illustrious climbing
legends who conquered the planet's highest mountains yet failed to
survive the conquest of K2.
Among those who have perished are some of the leading woman climbers
of the post-war period, including such as Julie Tullis, the
Englishwoman, and the Pole Dobroslawa Wolf -- both figures whose lives
and deaths attracted more controversy than that of Alison Hargreaves.
There are bound to be other books about what is becoming known,
tabloid-style, as The Savage Mountain. The second highest point on earth
and the toughest of the 8000-metre peaks, it has always attracted the
best climbers. As recently as 20 years ago, it still awaited a second
ascent and fewer than 120 people have attained the summit compared with
more than 600 who have stood atop Everest.
K2 is special: Everest may be 237 metres higher but K2 is the ultimate
test, the greatest prize. This theme -- the unique cachet for
mountaineers of K2 -- comes through strongly in the latest book on the
mountain, Jim Curran's K2, The Story of The Savage Mountain*, published
last month.
The physical beauty of the mountain, a mighty symmetrical cone
dominating the remote peaks and glaciers of the Karakoram range in
Pakistan, 300 miles north-west of the Himalayas, has something to do
with its attraction.
That must necessarily be superficial, however, since Curran notes that
K2 is like the Matterhorn in this respect, the familiar outlines
disappearing in a mass of shattered buttresses, ribs, and gullies the
closer you get.
Although less remote than it was, K2 is still a difficult and exacting
mountain to reach -- much more so than Everest. Despite this and despite
its formidable reputation for prolonged poor weather, people such as
Alison Hargreaves seem driven to try an ascent.
Jim Curran was on K2 in the summer of 1986 when the death toll reached
absurd levels and the world looked on in disbelief at what appeared to
be collective climbing madness.
In his new account, he dismisses any attempt to ''look for patterns
where there are none, to find blame where that does not exist. . .'',
preferring the summation of one magazine which recorded the tragic
events as the result of numerous ascents by disjointed groups meeting in
the wrong place at the wrong time.
Early in 1986, the Pakistani Ministry of Tourism, driven by the need
for foreign currency, gave permission for no fewer than nine expeditions
to attempt K2, concentrated on a tiny handful of main routes.
Many of the individual climbers involved were top drawer but by
summer's end 27 people had climbed K2 and 13 perished in the process
including three famous woman climbers, Liliane Barard, Julie Tullis, and
Dobroslawa Wolf. Of these 13, seven died on the descent and the bare
figures disguise the sheer magnitude of the efforts by which others
achieved survival.
By the end of last year's climbing season, the number of ascents had
reached 113 but K2 had claimed 38 lives in the process -- a figure,
Curran says, worth pondering on by future would-be ascensionists.
The Pakistanis have, however, reined in, allowing only six expeditions
a year and Curran expresses the hope that the days of the great caravans
of the past with 600 porters and 20 climbers fixing ropes up the routes
are historical relics. He acknowledges the dangers of pure Alpine-style
ascents, asking what possible value there can be in using a sledgehammer
to crack a nut.
K2 is still not at the evolutionary stage of Everest, which has been
climbed by practically every face, ridge, buttress, and gully plus all
their variations. The majority of the main ridges of K2 await ascent and
will undoubtedly fall in the next few years.
However, Curran makes a plea that smaller teams and less environmental
impact are desirable. The criterion of success, in the light of the
appalling statistics, should be the safe return of all team members. He
asks: ''Is there so much commercial gain and self-interest around the
climbing world that mountaineers value their lives less highly than they
did. . .''
He also expresses doubts on the wisdom of guided ascents on the
toughest 8000 metre peaks (although, as he says, the tradition of guided
Alpinism is as old as climbing itself), pointing out that on K2 of all
mountains there is no way a guide could assume total responsibility for
his client.
While there have been notable solo speed ascents on K2 and parapente
and ski descents from the summit are inevitable, K2, unlike Everest, has
been mercifully free from gimmicks and stunts.
It was on September 10, 1856 -- 138 years ago -- that Lieutenant T G
Montgomery of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India climbed to 5000
metres above the Vale of Kashmir with his theodolite and turned north
towards the unknown Karakoram.
He noted the two highest peaks, sketched them, and named them K1 and
K2. K1 turned out to have a local name, Masherbrum but K2 did not,
Montgomerie's appellation becoming over the years a byword for danger
and impersonal savagery.

FORTY-four jobs are to go at two clothing factories in Annan and
Dalbeattie.
Kastix Ltd employs more than 200 at the two factories. When the job
cuts are achieved, it will have 175 people on its books at Silverlaw,
Prestonfield Road, Annan, and the larger plant at High Street,
Dalbeattie.
A spokesman for the Yorkshire-based firm, which also has factories at
Holmefirth and Methil in Fife, said 25 jobs were going at Dalbeattie and
19 at Annan.
The decision in the main was caused ''by a reduction in styles for
United Kingdom manufacture for the spring and summer 1996 season''.
Kastix said one of the problems it had been facing was difficulty in
recruiting skilled labour, which had led to an imbalance in the
workforce.
The firm, mainly involved in the production of casual wear, is one of
the leading employers in the south-west of Scotland.
Director Laurence McArdle said voluntary redundancy was being sought
but this would not cover the whole number involved.
''We have been involved in talks with the union representatives about
the job losses and there will be further talks with senior union
officials. We hope that some of the older workers may take advantage of
the terms on offer,'' said Mr McArdle.

Grace Franklin and the small band of Scottish representatives who will
attend the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing find that poverty
begins at home, and many women fighting deprivation here cannot get the
money to go to China to debate the issue and push for reforms
POVERTY is one of the major issues to be examined by the United
Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing next month. The
irony of that has not been lost on women in Scotland. For poverty is
what is preventing more of them attending this global planning meeting.
At most, half a dozen women from Scotland will have to speak on behalf
of the two million living in this country. They include women
representing ecumenical sectors, black and migrant workers and refugees.
And though they are few in number, they have put their best foot
forward. As well as lobbying for their causes, they will be
demonstrating Scottish country dancing.
''It is one way of flying the Scottish flag,'' said Margaret Anderson,
a past-president of the Church of Scotland Woman's Guild.
Stepping out on the long journey to China with Anderson will be her
guild colleague Jane Osborne, Mary Shanahan representing the NEWS
ecumenical women's group of Action for Churches Together, Cassandra
McGrogan of Edinburgh Film Workshop, Sana Sadolla as an individual
representing refugee women, Mucami McCrum representing black and migrant
women, and myself going as a journalist reporting for The Herald and
also representing the Scottish Joint Action Group.
The main business on the agenda in Beijing is women and how countries
can make sure their women citizens enjoy equality, development and
peace. Cassandra McGrogan has made a film with Cathy McCormack about the
plight, and fight, of poor women in Scotland.
''I was going to Beijing to show that film and to make one of Cathy as
she worked her way through the United Nations processes to get the
action she wants written into the agreement which comes out of the
conference,'' explained McGrogan. ''But I'm going alone.'' While she got
funding from the British Council, she could not get money to pay Cathy's
fare. ''It seems incredible, but the one person who should be there
won't be.''
Anderson and her guild colleagues had discussed sending a
representative to Beijing when it was first known that was to be the
location of the UN Conference on Women.
''The cost was prohibitive -- over #1500 -- but the more we heard
about the agenda for women, the more we thought we should be there,''
said Anderson. The only reason the guild is able to send her and Osborn
is because a woman left the guild a legacy.
''When we first applied for accreditation we did not have a lot of
faith we would succeed. There was so much confusion about the process.''
Apart from having attended preliminary meetings held in New York,
Vienna and other places in Europe, an organisation had to be acceptable
to the United Nations and the Chinese Government. An intricate process
eventually produced, for some, a vital registration number from the UN
in New York which was the key to the Chinese Government allotting
accommodation in Beijing. Proof of those two elements have to be
presented to the Chinese Embassy in the UK where visas are issued. But
there is no automatic right to a visa.
Anderson also expressed disappointment that more women and women's
organisations in Scotland have not put their money where their mouth is.
''How can we expect our Government to respond to our demands when we
don't seem to have support at home?''
As chair of the Scottish Joint Action Group, Lorna Ahlquist knows how
hard it was to raise money to send delegates. ''We combined with SEAD
(Scottish Education and Action for Development) and worked very hard to
get money to send women to Beijing. My organisation sent out 500 letters
and got back #60. Those donations came from the women's organisations
who could least afford it -- Dumbarton Women's Aid, Strathclyde Rape
Crisis and the like. The UN conference may seem as dry as dust to people
but the document which will come out of it will be ratified by our
Government and we can use it as a tool to achieve our objects to improve
life for women.''
A similar lack of support has been felt by Sana Sadollah, who works
for the Scottish Refugee Council. ''I am paying my own way because the
council does not have a budget to send people to conferences. Funding is
a serious obstacle. I have tried many places -- including the Scottish
Office -- but have received no financial help. It seems as if women's
issues are not important enough to be supported.''
Originally from Kurdistan, Sana has lived and worked in Scotland for
almost 20 years, and she, with the few from Scotland who are heading for
Beijing, will join with an estimated 30,000 other women to get their
action points on poverty, health, housing, violence and other issues
important to women written into the United Nations Action Plan.

INVERNESS residents were assured yesterday that it is OK to wash out
their wheelie bins with bleach. The district council was responding to a
claim made in leaflets by Highland Cleansing and Hygiene, which offered
its own wheelie-bin cleaning service at #18 a year.
The leaflet said: ''It is an offence to wash out bins into drains. The
maximum fine is #25,000.'' Denying this, the cleansing department
accused the firm of ''scaremongering''.

<HEADLINE>Smith's Iona grave to be walled off</HEADLINE>

SO MANY tourists are visiting the grave of Labour leader John Smith
that the cemetery is to be walled off.
More than 1000 visitors a week go to Iona and many take the chance to
make for the corner of the ancient graveyard where he is buried.
They are trampling over the graves of kings, destroying thirteenth
century pathways, and angering islanders by damaging the graves of
relatives.
Now a wall is to be built at the area where Mr Smith and islanders are
interred, separating it from the ancient graveyard.
The entrance to the section will have a padlocked gate to prevent
further damage.
The decision to spend #10,000 to secure the site was taken yesterday
after Mr Sandy Taylor, deputy director of Argyll and Bute's
environmental services department, reported ''significant damage'' to
plots where islanders have been interred.
Access to the walled-in section, he said, would be given ''only to
local residents and, perhaps, to one or two visitors''.
Stone for the 12-metre long wall will have to be shipped from nearby
Mull. ''You cannot place a tent peg on Iona without disturbing some
historical artefact,'' said Mr Taylor.
Councillor John Wilson, who represents Iona and Mull, said the
trampled ancient cemetery became ''like a quagmire'' when it rained.
''The residents on Iona are complaining and I think we have every
right to protect their interests and address their fears,'' he said.
Mr Smith lies only yards from the holy site of Tor Abb, where St
Columba, who landed on Iona in 563 AD with a dozen followers, is
believed to have prayed.
Mr Smith's family were given permission for the burial because he was
raised in Argyll and led a main political party.
Mr Smith's widow, Elizabeth, has several times urged tourists to show
more respect for the island.

TO those who tune into the World Service every night it will come as a
bit of shock that BBC executives were full and willing participants in a
top-secret Government scheme to flood the world with anti-communist
propaganda as the Cold War got under way.
However, that is the unmistakable message leaping out of the newly
released papers covering the establishment of the clandestine
Information Research Department within the Foreign Office.
''I know that we have no detailed control over the BBC with regard to
shaping its programmes; nevertheless our situation is now such it seems
essential that we should approach the BBC in these matters and cause
them, by persuasion if possible, to undertake such programme
developments as might help us in the task imposed on us by the new
policy,'' one secret document declares.
The new policy was that, after some initial reluctance, Prime Minister
Clement Attlee accepted the necessity for a propaganda exercise to
counter-balance tirades coming out of Stalin's Soviet Union, intent on
undermining Western power and influence.
It resulted in the establishment of the Information Research
Department, which was to continue under secret funding until it was
abolished in 1977.
While the public at large knew nothing of what was going on, some of
those in the know -- including Lord Healey, then working in the
international department of the Labour Party -- were kept fully informed
and were keen and willing participants in the exercise.
The folders enclosing the papers covering the unit's birth leave no
question or doubt over what it was all about. Each one of them blasts
the message ''anti-communist propaganda''.
It is those concerning the BBC that caused most interest yesterday.
There can be no doubt about it -- the BBC went into this arrangement
with the special unit with its eyes open.
Initial contact was through Major-General Sir Ian Jacob, a BBC
employee who held the title, Director of Overseas Service.
The papers suggest that, while it was argued in certain quarters that
there should be editorial direction within the BBC over this issue, that
was finally overruled.
''The corporation should remain independent in the preparation of
programmes for overseas audiences, though it should obtain from the
Government Departments concerned such information about conditions in
those countries and the policies of His Majesty's Government towards
them.''
An early meeting in London's Cafe Royal was arranged between Mr Ralph
Murray, the man in direct control of the new propaganda machine, and the
two most senior BBC executives involved in the World Service --
certainly those in control of the key target areas outlined by the
Government -- Mr R McColl, controller of overseas services and Mr E
Tangye Lean, editor of European services.
One paper described how it would be unlikely that BBC chiefs would
ignore suggestions coming from the new unit.
The author was confident that the BBC would accept suggestions for
features that would get the British message on international labour
problems that would be of interest to the working classes in the target
areas -- particularly in Italy and France, under threat from an upsurge
in communist sympathy.
''It would then follow automatically that they (the BBC) would echo
the developments of policy expressed in Government statements, or any
information officially issued either by HMG or by eg the Labour Party or
TUC and would indeed create a market for our own information and our
exposure of the reality of communist pretensions.''
Another official thought the BBC would probably prefer to be adopt an
oblique rather than a direct technique.
''That is to say they will probably prefer to get in their digs at
communism by reflecting opinion in this country rather than by engaging
in direct commentaries of their own.''
The Ministry of War put in its own suggestions. The Army in Germany
thought that the condition of PoWs returning from the Soviet Union
compared with that of Afrika Corps PoWs sent home from Britain would
make a brilliant propaganda piece.
''There is little sympathy in our target areas in Western Europe,
which have recently been under German occupation, for what happens to
German prisoners of war,'' was the response to that one.
There was constant communication across the Atlantic to ensure that
our anti-red propaganda efforts were not conflicting with the
Americans'.
At one such meeting it was suggested that there might be a tie-up
between the BBC and the CIA-funded Voice of America.
However, the Brits thought the American operation was too obvious and
robust.
''The BBC takes the greatest pains to ensure that it is not regarded
as a propaganda organisation . . . There is a large gap between the BBC
'reflecting the policies and views of HMG' and material just
broadcasting anti-communist propaganda.''

THE discovery of the badly-decomposed body of a woman started a murder
inquiry in Edinburgh yesterday.
The find was made by plumbers sent to clear the drains in gardens
behind a block of tenement flats just off the Meadows after local
residents reported a bad smell.
Plumber Kenneth More described his shock at opening the manhole cover
and finding the remains of the woman three feet under water in the
drainage shaft below.
Entrance to the flats at 100 South Clerk Street, just a few minutes
from the festival's main venues, were sealed off immediately by police,
around midday yesterday.
Forensic teams were called in and uniformed officers combed the
surrounding area for clues. Door-to-door inquiries were carried out as
police tried to identify the victim.
A Lothian and Borders Police spokesman last night appealed for
information as a post-mortem examination on the body was being carried
out.
The man leading the murder hunt, DCI Iain Cowden of Lothian and
Borders Police, said: ''It appears the body has been in the common green
area for some time but at this stage of our inquiry it is impossible to
say for how long.''
Police were searching their missing persons file to find a match for
the murder victim but said no local woman had been reported missing
recently.
Locals living in the area, a popular bed-sit area for students, were
shocked at the discovery.
Carpet shop owner Cathy Scales said she had noticed a bad smell over
the past few weeks. ''This is a real shock,'' she said. ''The drain
where the body was found is level with the basement of the flats on the
way to the garden. I knew there was a bad smell but just put it down to
the warm weather.''
An Edinburgh District Council spokesman said last night there had been
complaints about the smell in the general area around the common green
in South Clerk Street.
He said after a site visit there on August 9, discarded rubbish was
found in the general area by environmental health officers.
Afterwards, local residents were reminded about the procedures for
disposing of household waste and reminded that any complaints about the
drains should be reported to Lothian Regional Council.
It is not clear whether any complaints about the drains were ever made
to the regional council.

AN anonymous woman caller to a Strathclyde Police hotline might hold
the key to a 17-month-old inquiry into the murder of a motorway
prostitute.
Detectives from Leicestershire travelled to Glasgow yesterday to
appeal to the woman to come forward.
The caller, who might be a prostitute in the Glasgow area, contacted
the Crimestoppers line on July 24. She left a message on an answering
machine saying she had information about the death of Tracy Turner, 30,
from Stafford, who was murdered in March 1994.
She spoke to same answerphone again on July 31, promising to call
back, but has since made no further contact.
Police believe the calls were in response to publicity surrounding the
murder of 22-year-old Glasgow prostitute Leona McGovern in June,
although they are not connecting the two murders.
Leicestershire Police re-issued an appeal to help trace the driver of
a meat lorry, called Gary or Gavin, who is believed to be based in
Strathclyde and was once Ms Turner's boyfriend.
Tracy Turner was found dead on the grass verge of a narrow lane in
Bitteswell, Leicestershire, a short distance from the M1, on March 3,
1994. Her body was naked and she had been raped and strangled.
She was last seen at a Stafford service station 60 miles away on the
previous evening. Police believe she was picked up by a vehicle
travelling north.
Detective Superintendent David Cox, in charge of the investigation,
said yesterday: ''I would appeal for the woman caller to get in touch.
She obviously knows something about Tracy Turner and I can appreciate
that she may be scared.
''If she rings us we promise that her call will be dealt with in the
utmost confidence.''
Mr Cox and a colleague will be based at Glasgow's Cranstonhill police
station over the next 48 hours in the hope they can speak to the woman
personally.
He said that Ms Turner had led ''a very private and very lonely life''
in which her hobby had been to befriend and travel with lorry drivers
along the nation's motorways.
She was ''an occasional prostitute'' he said, who operated in North
London and in service stations along the M6 and M1.
Blonde, and always wearing Walkman headphones which were connected to
a hearing aid, she was also a constant feature at lorry stops along the
routes, where it is believed she may have met Gavin/Gary.
Early calls received during the murder hunt suggested she had
travelled to Glasgow several times with the lorry driver, whose vehicle
is described as bearing a ''Scotland'' logo, and had stayed in hostels
in the city, occasionally operating as a prostitute.
The Crimestoppers message detailed some of her visits to Scotland and
it is believed the caller knew Ms Turner and possibly Gavin/Gary.
Mr Cox said: ''The inquiry is 17 months old and there are few avenues
left for us. It could be that this caller is the key to the
investigation.
''If we don't catch the killer it is very possible they might kill
again. It was a particularly nasty murder, involving abduction and rape,
and once a person reaches such a level of crime, they seldom regress to
less violent ones.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police stressed that the murder was
''entirely dissimilar'' to that of Leona McGovern, but said: ''It is
very unusual for someone to telephone following one murder with
information about another.''
Those who have information about Tracy Turner can contact MR on 0141
532 3200, or the Crimestoppers hotline on 0800 555 111.

THE London Underground last night was facing the threat of a one-day
strike after two unions joined forces in disputes over pay and
conditions.
Aslef, which represents most Tube drivers, voted by a three-to-one
margin in favour of a stoppage, and later RMT members, representing a
range of Tube workers, also backed strike action.
The RMT's first stoppage has been called to coincide with Aslef's,
next Friday, threatening chaos to commuters and travellers the day
before the Bank Holiday weekend.
The RMT also announced two further one-day stoppages, from 7.30pm on
Thursday, August 31 and from 7.30pm on Sunday, September 3.
A London Underground spokesman said: ''The result is a big
disappointment. We are deeply saddened for our customers.''

THE BBC World Service was recruited as the main vehicle to distribute
anti-communist propaganda during the Cold War by a top secret Government
unit, official papers released yesterday reveal.
The unit was set up especially for the purpose by the post-war Labour
Government and the documents are a severe blow to the long-term boast by
the BBC that its service is the most impartial in the world.
Because of their sensitivity, the papers have been delayed beyond the
normal 30-year rule for withholding official documents.
From the outset, the BBC was swamped with anti-communist propaganda by
the clandestine Foreign Office unit, the Information Research
Department, set up by Clement Attlee's Government in 1948. It remained
in existence until 1977, when it was scrapped by the then Foreign
Secretary Dr David Owen. Finance came from a secret MI6 budget.
The documents also reveal how Lord Healey, former Chancellor of the
Exchequer, offered his full support to the unit when in charge of the
Labour Party's international organisation. Others who assisted the unit
included philosopher Bertrand Russell, poet Stephen Spender, traitor Guy
Burgess, and Vic Feather, later to become general secretary of the TUC.

WHEN news filtered through that Alison Hargreaves would not be
returning from K2, Nicola Tannahill, in common with many other Scottish
climbers who knew and liked her, felt an immediate sense of personal
loss.
''Like many others, I had met her at functions and presentations. Like
everyone else, I followed her exploits. Through it all, she was totally
sincere and genuine. I felt as though I had lost a sister,'' she said..
Ms Tannahill, 26, works part-time in a Glasgow leading climbing shop,
and, with her partner, runs Outdoor Discovery, based in Wishaw. In that
capacity, she works with parties who want to learn to hillwalk, ski,
climb, canoe or mountain-bike -- all with the emphasis on performing
these activities in safety.
In summer, she climbs rock to a good standard in Glencoe and in the
Cairngorms; in winter, she can be found on the classic snow and ice
climbs in the same areas.
''I came to climbing through hillwalking which is how most people
start,'' she said.
''The motivation is very strong. Once I have done a route, all I want
to do is to get back into the hills to do something else. That is the
key to people like Alison -- it is the adrenalin flowing that takes you
back again and again.
''I admit that sometimes the same adrenalin buzz pushes you into a
situation where you end up saying to yourself: 'Hey, wait a minute. I
don't like this'. Common sense then dictates that you get off that point
or out of that situation.
''There is another element coming in all the time and that is the
male-female thing. If I am leading a party and I make a map reading, I
often see men in the party turning to another one of the fellows and
checking what he thinks -- even though I have employed the guy to work
for me. I always have to be the first to volunteer to carry the heavy
rope, or the big first-aid pack in my sack because otherwise they would
be thinking I was shirking because I am the only woman. It is good
natured, but the undercurrent is there.
''You have to make sure that the need to prove yourself does not
affect your judgment.
'' I climbed a couple of years ago with people who were out of my
league and it scared the wits out of me.
''It is good on the other hand to climb with people who are at the
same level as yourself or just above your level. That way you can
improve at a good pace. If you try routes that are too hard for your
ability at that point you simply end up scaring yourself and that can
set you back.
''I fell on a glacier in Iceland and it put me off for quite a few
weeks. I am very concious of the stereotyping that goes on -- that
climbing is seen as a male world and no place for women.
''The flaws in that thinking are obvious.    ''There is no difference
between a man leaving his kids behind to climb than a woman doing the
same thing. At the same time, there is always an element of having to
prove yourself to be one of the boys.

THE body of Alison Hargreaves has been seen by a fellow climber
hanging from a ledge on K2 after an avalanche. It was ''out of reach''.
The words of New Zealander Peter Hillary, son of Sir Edmund Hillary
and a member of her expedition team to K2, ended all hopes she could
have survived the storm on the mountain. Six fellow climbers were also
feared dead.
Mr Hillary gave his account to the expedition organiser, Mr Nazir
Sabir, who said the bodies would have to be left on the slopes of the
mountain, close to the peak, as they were ''almost impossible to
reach''.
Mr Sabir said: ''There is absolutely no chance at all for any of them
to have survived but I don't know yet in what circumstances this has
happened.''
He said he had spoken to Mr Hillary, a survivor of the ferocious storm
and avalanche, by satellite phone.
Ms Hargreaves's two young children had been told earlier their mother
may not be coming home from her successful conquest of K2, the world's
most dangerous mountain.
Six-year-old Tom and his sister Katie, four, last saw their mother
nine weeks ago when she left Spean Bridge to mount an assault on K2 in
Pakistan's Karakoram range, only 17 days after her return from becoming
the first woman mountaineer to conquer Everest without oxygen
assistance.
Husband Jim Ballard, a mountaineer, photographer, and public relations
manager, told his children an avalanche is thought to have killed their
mother.
''I have told them there had been a big storm, they had seen big
storms, they have been in them, and that their mum was missing and we
didn't know where she was, and it was possible that she would not be
coming home,'' he said at the Aonach Mor ski resort, which his wife had
used as a climbing base for the past year.
''Tom said he wanted time to think about that as we sat on the floor
in the board-room, the only place where there weren't other people and
the phones weren't going. He just cuddled up to me. Katie had a little
cry and a cuddle and said she would be brave and do her best to help.
''It is probably the most difficult thing I have ever done.''
He went on: ''The children have gone home now, but they have had a
splendid day on the hills up Aonach Mor. It is where I think their
mother would have liked them to be.''
As for himself, he said: ''I have been rehearsing this scene for 10
years, but it was one I hoped I would never have had to do.''
Before her departure in June, Ms Hargreaves rejected claims that her
job as Britain's only female professional mountaineer was cruel to her
children, but she did concede that she was no stay-at-home mother.
''I've got an ego as big as Mount Everest,'' she once said.
Yet, her first thoughts when she reached the top of Everest were for
her family. She radioed the message: ''To Tom and Kate, my two children,
I am on top of the world.''
Just before she left on her latest expedition, she said that although
she believed she had the technical ability to reach the summit of the
world's second peak, she was ''going into this expedition as I always do
-- with my eyes wide open and fully aware of the risks''.
She added: ''I believe it is the weather, rather than my climbing
abilities, that will hold the key as to whether I succeed. I had luck
with me on Everest, but the law of averages says that I should not get
such a good break on K2.''
Throughout yesterday he had refused to accept that all hope had gone,
saying: ''If anyone can do a Houdini, Alison can.'' He said: ''What
appears to be nearly certain is that Alison climbed the mountain
sometime on Sunday followed by Rob Slater from America and Bruce Grant
from New Zealand. They radioed back and this was heard by an American
team.''
It emerged yesterday that Ms Hargreaves, 33, had decided to change
climbing partners for the K2 attempt last month.
A Tyneside-based mountaineer, Mr Alan Hinkes, 41, said he had walked
with her to the base camp of K2, they had shared the same tent at Camp
2, and she had been due to partner him on his attempt on the summit. But
then she decided to team up with a member of an American expedition on
the mountain, and Mr Hinkes prepared to make the ascent with other
climbers.
On his descent he met Ms Hargreaves again at Camp 2, at 22,500ft, on
July 18. With the weather worsening she returned to base camp, 6000ft
lower, and he last saw her there on July 23 when he left to return to
the UK.
Mr Hinkes said yesterday: ''Inevitably, I can't help feeling that if
she had not decided to change partners this would not have happened.''
Another former member of the K2 expedition, Mr Kevin Cooney, told how
a 100mph wind had blown across the mountain ''with brutal cold'' as Ms
Hargreaves and fellow climber Rob Slater made their way from the summit.
Ms Hargreaves' parents, John and Joyce, had been waiting for news at
their home in Belper, Derbyshire.
Mr Ballard summed up the feeling of the climbing community: ''Alison
was a genius as a climber and if she is dead she has at least died where
she wanted to be, and she was on her way down after becoming the first
woman to climb the two highest peaks on earth without oxygen and in pure
style.''
He quoted a Tibetan saying which was a favourite of his wife's: ''It
is better to have lived one day as a tiger than a thousand years as a
sheep.''
