 "Stones From the River" reminds you what a novel is supposed to be: epic, 
daring, magnificent, the product of a defining and mesmerizing vision. It is a 
long book that you don't want to end because once you begin, every page is a 
sure step along a path, a milestone that simultaneously evokes where you've 
been and brings you further toward a conclusion you have to reach. It is a book 
you yearn to read all night but don't because you choose to save it to savor 
tomorrow. It teaches us, broadens our experience, entertains, challenges our 
assumptions and confirms our deepest intuitions. It is, in a word, remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ursula Hegi, whose fine first novel, "Floating in My Mother's Palm" (1990), 
announced her as a major novelist writing in a minor key, is a German who came 
to America when she was 18. Clearly, she continues a process of mining the 
profound, paradigmatic and paradoxical questions that arose for her during 
childhood: How could the holocaust have come about? How could otherwise "good" 
people coexist with it? What are the lingering effects on those who watched 
silently, passively, following implicit cultural orders not to make a fuss, not 
to protest, not to notice? 
</P>
<P>
 Hegi tackles this daunting question -- as relevant to the contemporary world 
of Bosnias and Burmas and Somalias as it was to central Europe half a century 
ago -- by confining her attentions to a tiny but exquisitely meticulous 
canvass. Bergdorf, a typical small town, is the site of both her books, and 
under her guidance, we come to know intimately its geography and populace. 
</P>
<P>
 The central intelligence of "Stones From the River" is Trudi Montag, a woman 
Hegi follows from birth through early middle age. Born in 1915, Trudi's life 
coincides with the traumatic period of German history that culminated in the 
rise and eventual fall of national socialism. Through her sharp, intelligent 
eyes we watch the incremental impact of Nazism on a disparate group of ordinary 
townsfolk: hat designers and grocers, farmers and librarians, well-do-to and 
poor, Christian and Jewish, male and female, young and old. With an impressive 
narrative sweep, Hegi creates indelible individuals, people so well realized in 
the undramatic minutia of their daily lives that by the time they become actors 
on a larger stage -- perpetrators of horror, its witnesses or its victims -- we 
care about them, are as shocked by or proud of their deeds as if they were our 
own neighbors. This hard-to-achieve technique has an enormous payoff: We are 
not absolved by the distance of time and must therefore ask ourselves the hard, 
impossible questions. . . . What we would have done in their place? 
</P>
<P>
 Trudi happens to be a dwarf, a zwerg , and as such she is an ideal 
ethnographer. By nature an outsider but linked inexorably to her community by 
kin and history, she achieves her status not by beauty, marriage or motherhood 
but by self-consciously becoming the central repository of gossip. She is the 
person to whom people bring their scandalous tales, and she alone decides when 
and with whom to share the secrets with which she has been entrusted. It is the 
reader's great good fortune to be her principle confidant. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, because of its time frame and the affliction of its protagonist, 
"Stones From the River" invites comparison with Gunter Grass's "The Tin Drum." 
Of this issue, only two points need be noted: 1 -- In its quiet way, it's every 
bit as good; and 2 -- Trudi's gender perspective and personality render Hegi's 
novel completely original and unique. "Being a zwerg ," Trudi explains, "means 
carrying your deepest secret inside out -- there for everyone to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Trudi, as heir to Bergdorf's pay library, sits at the crossroads of the book's 
many plots. As she vicariously follows the vicissitudes of parents, friends, 
enemies and lovers, a chorus of stunning magnitude arises. The intermingled 
voices of two generations argue among themselves, shifting and balancing 
morality and safety, greed and kindness. In Hegi's hands, nothing is 
predictable and yet, in retrospect, all personal choices seem somehow 
inevitable. Fate and character are inseparable, and bonds of love -- of 
country, of family, of self -- are neither easily broken nor mended easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stones From the River" deals with grand themes, with war and peace, guilt and 
absolution, but it never succumbs to didacticism or facile coincidence. The 
novel succeeds so brilliantly precisely because of its jumbled complication -- 
but for the same reason its "story" is difficult to summarize in a review. In 
the most simple synopsis, Trudi Montag evolves from being the adored child of a 
kind, widowed father, through a bitter and disappointed adolescence, into a 
formidable and passionate woman. She suffers more than her share of betrayals, 
but through them learns to rely on herself, trusting implicitly her innate 
sense of right and wrong. No matter what she confronts, she is ultimately too 
smart to be fearless, too tough to be a coward, too empathic to be cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambitious theme and provocative character alone, however, do not make a good 
novel great. Wonderful writing is required as well, and Hegi consistently 
proves herself to be a master of prose, even though English is not her natal 
language. When, early in the book, Leo Montag goes searching for his mentally 
ill wife (who has refused to even look at their deformed child after giving 
birth), he finds her beneath the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a few moments before he could make her out, cowering among the weeds 
and boulders, her face half hidden by her hair. Leo didn't know why he did what 
he did next -- didn't even know he was doing it until he found himself holding 
his daughter in front of him, much like a priest extending the sacrament. 
Suspended in the beams of pearl-gray light, he kept Trudi there though his arms 
began to quiver with her weight, held her there between him and his wife for 
what seemed the span of an entire lifetime, her round infant hands stirring the 
layers of air like tropical fish, until his wife scuttled toward them with a 
sob and snatched the child from him with her smudged hands, enveloping the 
three of them with the musty smell of earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Listen as Hegi describes the days following a night of terror aimed at the 
Jewish community: 
</P>
<P>
 "For weeks, the smoke hung above the town, getting into your lungs with each 
breath, making you cough; and after the rubble was cleaned up, you would still 
come across slivers of glass far from the areas of destruction as if they'd 
been carried there by the smoke. You wouldn't see them unless you'd step into 
one of them, say, or catch the reflection of a shard of sun in a bare tree limb 
while reaching up to hang out your laundry in the frosty winter air, making you 
feel as if you and your neighborhood, the world even, were held in the eye of a 
splintered mirror." 
</P>
<P>
 And here is a portrait of a long-married couple, in their apartment, awaiting 
arrest: "Together, they lifted the tablecloth from the bed, shook out its 
creases, and stepped toward each other to fold its length like so many decades 
of desire until the gap between them had waned to the thickness of the folded 
square of embroidered linen." 
</P>
<P>
 In her art, through the poetry of such simple, aching moments, Ursula Hegi 
illuminates and immortalizes a history we cannot afford to forget.

A CHANGE IN PERCEPTION; MAKES ME WANNA HOLLER: A YOUNG BLACK MAN IN AMERICA, BY 
NATHAN MCCALL (RANDOM HOUSE: $23; 404 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Edward J. Boyer, Edward J. Boyer is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His girlfriend -- the mother of his child -- had been threatened right in 
front of his face. Such disrespect called for swift retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The inevitable confrontation followed, culminated by a bullet that wound up 
only an inch from the offender's heart. The next shot would surely have been 
fatal had not a friend intervened and persuaded him not to fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a drama played out daily in the desperate lives of so many young black 
men in America. And because it is so commonplace, this carnage goes 
unchronicled for the most part now, except in street lore, which compounds the 
tragedy by elevating the shooter to new status. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular shooting would have remained unremarkable had not the gunman, 
Nathan McCall, taken hold of his psyche while serving a prison sentence for 
another crime. After being paroled, McCall returned to college, earned a degree 
in journalism and now works as a writer at the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 In his angry, eloquent and powerful biography, "Makes Me Wanna Holler," McCall 
remembers that when he fired that bullet into his rival, "I felt like a God. I 
felt so good and powerful that I wanted to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 In a world where young men from America's ghettos and barrios perceive avenues 
to anything remotely resembling power as irretrievably closed, McCall's 
reaction is all the more ominous, given the swelling tide of would-be deities 
slouching toward gun dealers to be born. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall's story is a painfully familiar recitation of a promising black child's 
descent to street fights, burglary, penny-ante stickups, gang rape. But 
somewhere in a far corner of his consciousness, the spark of his own humanity 
refused to succumb to the sociopath. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after he had moved beyond his old life of violent crime, McCall's prison 
record hampered his attempts to move into the American mainstream. He believes 
the Louisville Courier-Journal changed its mind about hiring him after he told 
them he was an ex-con. He landed a job on the Virginian Pilot-Ledger Star, 
where he had interned, after "a tough, close vote" on whether to take him on 
despite his record. He kept his secret later when the Washington Post decided 
to take a good look at him, but lost out on that job when Post editors 
discovered his record on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 He also didn't tell interviewers at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about his 
record when he moved there from Virginia. Living in fear of discovery, he set 
about building a solid track record as a reporter, covering city hall and local 
politics, traveling abroad on assignment with then-Mayor Andrew Young, looking 
behind the facades of civil rights leaders Hosea Williams and Coretta Scott 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 After he mustered the courage to tell editor Bill Kovach that he had served 
time for armed robbery, Kovach's only response was: "Is that all? . . . If 
anybody gives you (expletive) about it, let me know." End of nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later he found himself with another chance at the "big time," 
winning a spot on the Washington Post's staff on his second try. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as "Holler" is the story of McCall's life, it is also an essay on race 
-- that most enduring of American dilemmas -- and the crippling images that too 
often burden African American youngsters early on with self-hatred. McCall also 
passionately challenges a whole litany of simple diagnoses for urban ills, such 
as the absence of black fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the working class Cavalier Manor neighborhood of Portsmouth, Va., where 
McCall grew up in the 1960s, families owned their own homes and the fathers 
were present. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never heard my friends say they wanted to be like their fathers when they 
grew up," McCall writes. "Why would we want that when we knew our fathers were 
catching hell? . . . A two-parent home is no better off than a single-parent 
one if the father is (expletive) up in the head and beaten down. There's 
nothing more dangerous and destructive in a household than a frustrated, 
oppressed black man." 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers accompanying his stepfather to do gardening in an affluent suburb 
and realizing that America has two distinct worlds -- one white and "full of 
possibilities of life," and the other "dark and limited." 
</P>
<P>
 McCall traces the assault on his own self-image to television commercials, 
racial taunts and fights with white bullies at a newly integrated junior high 
school. He couldn't understand being hated at school simply for being black and 
alive. "I wondered, Where did those white people learn to hate so deeply at 
such a young age? I didn't know. But, over time, I learned to hate as blindly 
and viciously as any of them." 
</P>
<P>
 For all of his conflict with whites, he packed his hair with pomade and 
brushed it mercilessly in a vain attempt to make it look more white. And 
dark-skinned girls were avoided in favor of the more desirable, 
light-complexioned "redbones." 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that we thought we loved sisters but that we actually hated them," 
he writes. "We hated them because they were black and we were black and, on 
some level much deeper than we realized, we hated the hell out of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of that racial confusion escaped him as a youngster. He might 
have made the honor roll in grade school, but he was increasingly a child of 
the streets as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 He survived shootouts, burglaries, robberies and gang fights during his high 
school years and actually made it to Norfolk State University before he shot 
the street thug who threatened his girlfriend. His sentence: 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when he was sentenced to 12 years in prison after robbing a McDonald's, 
he reflected: 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot and nearly killed Plaz, a black man, and got a 30-day sentence; I 
robbed a white business and didn't lay a finger on anybody, and got 12 years. I 
got the message. I'd gotten it all my life: Don't (expletive) with white 
folks." 
</P>
<P>
 In prison he embraced Malcolm X's philosophy that you can change your behavior 
if you change your self-perception. He also met Jim, an important mentor and 
role model -- the first black man he had met who understood that manhood is 
more the result of intelligence than some twisted notion of machismo. 
</P>
<P>
 And he read everything he could get his hands on in the prison library where 
he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Paroled after three years, he returned to Norfolk State, graduated with honors 
and crossed over into a mainstream world far more predatory than anything he 
had experienced on the street -- professional journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 After being hired at the Journal-Constitution, he quickly identified the 
hypocrisy of newspapers with virtually all-white staffs being so quick to 
condemn racism. His first assignment: cover a watermelon-eating contest. 
</P>
<P>
 No less hypocritical were his reporting colleagues who may not have recognized 
just how desperately they struggled to cover their own insecurities with 
tattered cloaks of arrogance. At the Journal-Constitution he also met Danny 
Baum, a free spirit whose honesty and fairness made McCall think for the first 
time that there are fundamentally decent whites. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall has written a relentlessly honest book, filled with pain, triumph, rage 
and humor -- high and low. His biography will no doubt disturb many readers who 
might harbor more idealized notions of how one makes a successful journey up 
from the marginalized existence of urban streets. For all of his concessions 
and appearances of success, McCall still sees himself as "just a tourist in the 
white mainstream." And instead of easy answers, he offers this sobering 
reflection for a nation caught up in hysteria over crime: 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his closet, collecting dust, are a pair of prison brogans and a 
pair of penny loafers -- symbols of choices he has rejected. He has put the 
brogans that could have been his to wear for a lifetime behind him. Yet he was 
no more comfortable trying to fake it as a preppie in penny loafers. The 
loafers, he thought, might make white colleagues stop staring at him so much if 
they could see that "I'm not so different." But he felt "goofy" in the loafers 
and keeps them "as a testament to the time I almost lost my way in the white 
mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of McCall's journey from the mean streets to the newsroom amounts to the 
difficult process of recognizing, inventing or exercising choices. Far too many 
young black men don't see any choices -- no redemption from the devalued lives 
to which they are assigned. And when there is no redemption, can there be any 
sin? 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I chose the gutter, I always had a frame of reference for a better 
life," McCall writes. And he knows that the African American street thugs in 
Washington who "treat each other like targets on a shooting range" may not have 
such a reference. Too many give in to what McCall calls that "inner hatred that 
drives them to self destruct." 
</P>
<P>
 McCall doesn't pretend to have answers for that self destruction. He's fully 
aware that there is a "younger, meaner generation out there now -- more lost 
and alienated than we were, and placing even less value on life." He found 
himself frightened by younger guys in his old Portsmouth neighborhood, knowing 
that "if they saw the world as I once did, they believed they had nothing to 
lose, including life itself."

WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON; UNDERSTAND THIS, BY JERVEY TERVALON (WILLIAM MORROW: 
$20; 271 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Sipchen, Times Staff Writer Bob Sipchen is the author of Baby Insane and 
the Buddha, recently released by Bantam in paperback. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Put yourself in Francois' head. One moment he's idly tossing a football with 
his pal, burning up the tail end of his childhood the way American kids are 
supposed to do. Next thing, boom boom , his friend's dead, killed by a 
crack-addict girlfriend, and it looks as though Francois is going to be stuck 
in a narrative that reads like tired gangsta rap. 
</P>
<P>
 Jervey Tervalon's "Understand This" does cover some familiar of the lyrical 
turf of the Ices -- T and Cube. The plot and subplots spin off the interlocking 
questions: Who's gonna get killed, get jailed, get sprung on rock, punk out or 
flip out -- and who's gonna get out (which is, ultimately, the only way to 
survive as most of these characters see things). 
</P>
<P>
 But Tervalon never slips into the standard-issue Angst that drives so many 
recent urban rite-of-passage tales, fiction and non. Instead, he promptly steps 
back from Francois' perspective, and pushes readers into the minds of the sort 
of African American Angelenos that most books and movies and hip-hop music 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Tervalon is not casual about this. The boy Francois sees killed in the first 
chapter -- the "wannabe high roller got gotted by his G," -- is named Goines, 
after, perhaps, the late Donald Goines, whose "ghetto realist" novels are still 
cellblock favorites, and antecedents to the powerful but increasingly 
monotonous Snoop Doggy Dogg strain of social commentary. But Tervalon seems 
eager to bury that genre with the character. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrugging off the de rigeur overlay of rage and recrimination, resisting the 
peer pressure to posture macho, he is freer to flex his wit, work out his fine 
observational skills, and inject his warmth into the yarn. Likewise his 
characters are freer, and hence more compelling than those who inhabit 
narratives positing a deterministic "system" of white oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois' girlfriend Margot, for example, is a sexed-up scholar with an 
attitude, a hyper-protective father and a clear escape plan that nothing and no 
one is going to thwart. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann, Francois' mother, is a nurse at King hospital. She discerns a trace of 
her son in each young black man who gets wheeled in on a gurney, and sees the 
bullet holes and stab wounds she patches as symptoms of a more pervasive force 
she calls simply "the disease." So fragile is her hope that Ann bursts into 
tears upon hearing that the scrappy Margot has scratched her way into UC Santa 
Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels is the hip young teacher at a high school whose true colors are Crip 
blue. He digs working at "this outpost, this foothold of civilization in the 
vast barbarity of the inner city," yet he despairs for his students. All except 
Margot, who wraps him around her finger and tests his values and willpower with 
her sophisticated charms. 
</P>
<P>
 Tervalon switches points of view among these and other characters -- a 
wanna-be gangster, a middle-class crack-head. His interior monologues lack the 
virtuosity of a Robbe-Grillet ramble, but the technical glitches fade fast as 
the characters blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 In one masterfully heart-wrenching scene, for example, Margot and Ann go 
together to a bail bondsman, after the floundering Francois gets busted on a 
charge for which he is largely innocent -- but increasingly prone. At the last 
moment, Ann, who has already planned her family's escape to Atlanta, can't 
bring herself to put her hard-earned home up for her son's bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to explain anything to me," Margot says gently, as they drive 
away through a bullet-pocked cityscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Many writers these days put a poetic patina of nobility on their ruthless 
young hustlers, players and gangsters, in some cases imagining them a 
revolutionary vanguard that will lead the wretched of the earth. But as 
Francois, Margot, Michaels, Ann and other characters see it, most of these 
dudes are either narcissistic creeps or simply dumber than Play-Doh. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that resisting the street life is easy for anyone, and 
even the smart and well-nurtured too often find themselves in the grip of the 
life's powerful reverse pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of this book's best scenes unfold in moments when the characters have 
slipped the claustrophobic bonds of their urban environment and ventured, as if 
on taut bungee cords, into alien California turf. 
</P>
<P>
 When a morose Francois heads to Santa Barbara with a partner who wants to tap 
the lucrative white drug market there, his disorientation and homesickness is 
palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few missed opportunities. In one Santa Barbara scene, for 
instance, a bikini-clad beach Betty softens the tough young dealer, then slips 
him a pamphlet for a cultish "Life Form" seminar. It would have been hilarious 
to watch the hustler get ambushed by a roomful of touchy-feely, 
psycho-babbling, self-esteem seeking zombies. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, though, Tervalon's take on this beach town is dead on. And Margot's 
visit to Santa Cruz is even fresher in its honest and sometimes caustic 
observations of dorky white kids, snooty African American princesses and a 
Rastafarian musician from Connecticut who never had to create the hardened 
facade demanded by the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some readers may accuse Tervalon himself of being "soft" in this sense. He's 
not. He's daring. And "Understand This" explores more difficult landscape -- 
geographic and interior -- than many of its angrier and grittier brethren.

RICHARD EDER: A WAKE FOR THE CITY; THE BROOKLYN BOOK OF THE DEAD, BY MICHAEL 
STEPHENS (DALKEY ARCHIVE: $19.95; 228 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is Jack Coole's wake, but when his 16 children drop in at the Brooklyn 
funeral home to sit with the remains of the retired customs inspector, there is 
not a lot of mourning. "He's dead. The old man's dead. Poor old bastard," is 
the way the word was spread through the long-disused family network, and it is 
about as close as we come to explicit grief. It is echoed in the corpse-side 
prayers delivered by the daughters; for example: 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen: "Dear God be kind to this mean old fart." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Ann, a nun: "Grant him a touch of salvation because he was a rotten 
old bastard but he doesn't deserve to burn in hell forever just because of his 
character flaws about which he was helpless to do anything. Amen." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stephens uses an Irish and Irish-American literary convention -- a 
comically quarrelsome wake not so much to remember the dead as to settle scores 
with the living -- and he uses others, and very well. But he grasps them as a 
diver grasps the last rungs of the boat-ladder, preparing to cast off into deep 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Brooklyn Book of the Dead" has a kinship with recent novels by Alice 
McDermott and Mary Gordon, in that it too treats of change over several 
generations of a New York Irish-American family. The troublesome, turbulent 
Coole clan, present and past, is the book's foreground. Yet its deeper theme is 
the change and passing of urban neighborhoods and communities. That is why -- 
though there are few tears for the frequently mean and violent Jack Coole, and 
though what we see of his 16 children ranges from an equivalent violence to 
something more neutral but not especially lovable -- Stephens has nevertheless 
written a book that is both loving and sad. 
</P>
<P>
 Dying is not necessarily sad. Profound sadness lies in the death of a place 
and its culture. Witness the millennial Diaspora lament for Jerusalem, and the 
great Moorish laments for lost Granada. East New York is tiny, gritty and 
squalid by comparison. "The Brooklyn Book of the Dead" gets the constriction 
and squalor, but it too is a lament. It is a mark of Stephens' writing that he 
voices it without embellishing the roughness or admitting the least jot of 
sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start, there is a jumble of voices, interruptions, jokes, insults. Only 
the five older sons have arrived; given the bitter recollections in the family 
and the fact that they are almost all out of touch, it is not certain whether 
anyone else will come. Perhaps the sisters are too angry; perhaps -- given some 
of their shady occupations and associations -- the younger brothers are in jail 
or reposing in concrete shoes at the bottom of Gravesend Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The five oldest are battered enough. There is Leland, a Vietnam veteran who 
has been in and out of mental hospitals and is now tranquilized on lithium and 
grossly fat. There is the wired, pugnacious Emmett, a cabdriver, former thug 
and crack addict: "Emmett . . . of the medallion cab leases, and the rubber 
hose jobs in back streets around the Gowanus Canal, Emmett of a little muscle." 
</P>
<P>
 There is Mickey Mack, a would-be writer grown bald and middle-aged in the 
mediocrity of failure; the blither Paddy, a painter who restores antiques and 
grows pot Upstate; and Terry, a dim derelict who lives in an abandoned school 
bus. His dimness, one of the many rambling recollections suggests, may have 
come from a childhood game. Leland and Emmett practiced repeated 
near-strangulation upon him; just as they used Mickey as a punching bag, 
knocking him out once and reporting to their distracted mother that he was 
asleep in the garden. "Well, wake him up," she answered. "It's not time to go 
to bed yet." 
</P>
<P>
 When the sisters arrive and, later, the five younger brothers, there are other 
memories of violence and cruelties. Francis, a drug dealer, recalls his drunken 
father putting his cat in the freezer; later, the boy tried to set the old man 
on fire. Brian, a hideously burned fireman, recalls sexually abusing one of his 
sisters. It is a world of rough struggle. We only get glimpses of the father, 
but they make a clear portrait of a cold, purposeful man who made his way up to 
his dockside customs post from which, it is suggested, he was able to do 
profitable favors for Manhattan's West Side Irish gangs. He supported his 
family, thrashed his sons and taught them to fight dirty, and pretty much 
ignored them otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosy, the mother, came from a well-off Irish family, but was thoroughly 
silenced in the male-dominated household. She only asserted herself once, and 
it was to encourage Paddy to become a painter. It is one of the book's many 
quietly managed triumphs -- suggesting the many things we are being told 
without realizing it -- that the only real tears shed at the wake are Paddy's, 
and that it is his mother he is weeping for. 
</P>
<P>
 Rough and even appalling as much of this sounds, Stephens is portraying 
people, not freaks. There is artistry in accomplishing it, and there is 
compassion, though I hesitate to use the word. If God must love the common 
people since he made so many of them, Stephens' feeling for his characters is 
of the same order. The Coole clan has been the victim and author of many awful 
things; Stephens loves them, nevertheless, having made -- what with aunts and 
uncles -- two dozen of them. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, though, he loves something that is a city. It has been common 
to call cities jungles. But given the erosion of our planet's variety, we think 
of jungles differently nowadays. We call them rain forests and try to preserve 
them. Mitchell is not trying to preserve the rain forest of East New York, but 
he does manage to bring back the turbulent variety of a neighborhood that, 30 
years ago, still worked. Its Irish, Jewish, Polish, West Indian and other 
residents were a mix of shopkeepers, and blue-collar and city workers. It was a 
struggle to be there, and most were struggling to get out; still, there was a 
lively vitality in it. With boarded-up shops, drug gangs and few jobs, the 
newer black and Latino arrivals struggle in more isolation and against worse 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
 The real wake in "The Brooklyn Book of the Dead" is not the altered-state fug 
of bickering and disjointed story-telling -- the Cooles are variously into 
alcohol, coke and pot -- that goes on in the funeral parlor. It is the section 
of the book that recounts Emmett's journey by subway and on foot to get there. 
What he sees now -- he is followed by a posse of knife-wielding teen-agers who 
wonder what he is doing in their neighborhood -- is engraved with what he 
remembers from before. His voice, cynical, hopped-up and disjointed, scores 
like the engraver's needle. The wake of Jack Coole and of East New York has the 
deceptively austere implication of a steel-plate drypoint.

A TRAIL OF BREAD CRUMBS; THE CHILDREN IN THE WOODS: NEW AND SELECTED STORIES, 
BY FREDERICK BUSCH (TICKNOR & FIELDS: $21.95; 338 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patrick McGrath, Patrick McGrath's most recent book is the novel Dr. 
Haggard's Disease. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the strongest stories in Frederick Busch's new collection, "The 
Children in the Woods," is "Berceuse," and one of the strongest moments in 
"Berceuse" comes when an awful Jewish woman called Miriam tells her goy 
sister-in-law Kim that Kim's recent miscarriage occurred because of the 
Holocaust. "Oh yes," she said, "Your baby died because you murdered us. Every 
one of you murdered our dead. Ask your priests. Ask your dead God. The fruit of 
your womb is death." 
</P>
<P>
 Miriam is one of the few monsters in the book. But she is thematically central 
in that she tells Kim the story of "Hansel and Gretel," who are of course the 
eponymous children in the woods. The fairy tale has a charged significance for 
Holocaust-obsessed Miriam in that the witch in the gingerbread house wanted to 
cook Hansel in an oven. For Frederick Busch the tale has a much broader 
application: His characters are all children in the woods, the woods being life 
in general, marriage and childhood in particular. Some are Jews, some not; some 
stories take place in New York City, more often the setting is a small town 
Upstate, where the winters are hard and men can be better at understanding 
plumbing systems and the innards of pickup trucks than the minds and hearts of 
their wives. Not that the women are much clearer about why relationships 
survive and why they fail. In Frederick Busch's world everyone is looking for 
the trail of bread crumbs that will lead them out of darkness and into the 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the stories here depend on a sort of loose, suggestive symbolism -- 
they pivot on an object, or an idea, or a small but crucial incident meant to 
transform the tangle of experience in which it occurs and so give resonance and 
design to the whole. A good example is "My Father, Cont.," in which a child 
(Busch is never afraid to tell a story from the point of view of a child or a 
woman) describes how his parents in their unhappiness bicker about some books 
the mother wants the father to donate to a sale. The family goes for a drive in 
the country, the car gets stuck in snow and the father uses the books to try to 
get traction under the tires. The books are shredded by the spinning wheels, 
but to no avail. The child cries and is hugged. A sort of peace is restored. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a vignette of family life in which the story's weight and meaning 
reside almost entirely in its few symbolic motifs: a family dynamic is 
established, but all that actually happens is the drive in the country and the 
car getting stuck. The great risk with such fiction is that if alchemy doesn't 
occur -- and too often with this type of story it doesn't -- what's left is 
slight and inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 When Busch establishes a strong dramatic structure, however, and uses that as 
the housing for his insights, the result is often fiction of a very high order 
indeed. A good example is "Ralph the Duck," the sort of rich, dense, tightly 
constructed piece of writing that reminds you that perfection is possible, if 
not in the novel, at least in the short-story form. This is Frederick Busch at 
his best, managing the country he knows, the season, the characters, the 
themes, bringing them into exquisite, understated harmony in a story whose 
narrative accelerates to a powerful and vivid climax, and then segues 
delicately into a haunting, pathetic resolution; a story with heart that fits 
together like a piece of fine machinery. It's about a security man at a campus 
near a small town somewhere in the Northeast in winter. Busch brings his 
character to life in a few deft strokes, establishes a rich inarticulate 
emotionality in him, and then constructs in an utterly unforced and flowing 
manner the events that will draw out his vulnerability, sorrow and physical 
courage in what culminates literally in a life-and-death drama. In the end a 
man who's lost a child is able to save a child, and the power rests in the 
story's utter lack of sentimentality, the tone of quiet irony that has the 
effect, paradoxically, of lending it an almost unbearable pathos. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally powerful, though more formally complicated, is "Dog Song," which 
begins with a scene of utter horror. Police break into a mobile home whose 
owners are suspected of cruelty to dogs. They find the place "alive with 
excrement and garbage. . . . Madness crawled the walls. Lloyd, the husband, had 
written with dung his imprecations of a county and state and nation that 
established laws involving human intercourse with beasts. Twenty-six dogs were 
impounded, and the couple was heavily fined by the judge." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dog Song" is told from the point-of-view of the judge, Snuyder, who wakes up 
soon after in a hospital bed, having apparently attempted suicide by driving 
his car into a telegraph pole. His terrible predicament is his inability to 
remember who the woman with him in the car was. She certainly wasn't his wife, 
and his wife knows it, and she's in the process of leaving him as he lies there 
in his shattered, pain-racked body. But what irks him as much as any of this is 
that the case of the couple in the filthy trailer -- who have since taken 11 
hostages in the county building in an attempt to get their dogs back -- has 
been given to another judge. "It was a case he had wanted to try. They were 
accused of a dozen public-health violations and twenty or more violations of 
the civil and criminal codes. And they were so innocent, Snuyder thought. No 
one should be allowed to be so innocent." The story ends soon after this, with 
Snuyder still in the hospital. "The police would come soon with questions. He 
was held together with pins. He was going to die, but of natural causes, and 
many years from today. He knew it. He smelled the dark air of the trailer, and 
he heard the gaunt dogs whine." 
</P>
<P>
 This is alchemy. It's difficult, and ultimately unprofitable, to say quite why 
the various elements of this story cohere, why they cross-resonate life a 
complex chord and give out a wholly satisfactory but inexplicable ring of 
truth-of-experience. It's the highest form of literary pleasure, and Frederick 
Busch delivers it with several of the stories in "The Children in the Woods." 
</P>
<P>
 The one real criticism is that too many of the stories fail to come off, in 
other words that the book's too long. If fiction is the meaningful arrangement 
of incidents in time, too many of the pieces here are lacking in sufficient 
incident to generate the rich, crashing cymbals of meaning that hang in the air 
long after a story like "Ralph the Duck" or "Dog Song" is over. Frederick 
Busch's best moments come when he harnesses what he knows about people and 
families and marriage with his strong storytelling talents, and avoids the more 
minimal, sketchy epiphanies.

CAN PUBLISHING GO GLOBAL?; WHEN INTERNATIONAL MEDIA CONGLOMERATES BUY BOOK 
COMPANIES, IT IS NEITHER GOOD CULTURE NOR GOOD BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD J. BARNET and JOHN CAVANAGH, Richard J. Barnet is the author of 11 
books including (with Ronald E. Muller) Global Reach. John Cavanagh is a fellow 
at the Institute for Policy Studies and the Transnational Institute in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The beginning of the 1980s was a time of unprecedented book sales and 
extravagant talk in the publishing world. The business press and financial 
analysts burbled about the synergies that would result from combining books, 
book clubs, magazines, music, video and films all under a single corporate 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The "information revolution" had arrived, and communication, so Wall Street 
promoters promised, was becoming the principal human activity. Any enterprise 
without a powerful communications capability would not make it in 
"postindustrial society." Billion of dollars were raised for the merger of 
Warner Communications and Time Inc., which also owns Book-of-the-Month Club and 
Little, Brown, much of it by luring investors with the magic of synergy. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 1980s the production of general books of fiction and 
nonfiction in the United States had been substantially taken over by the global 
entertainment and mass-media conglomerates. But putting books, movies, 
magazines and clubs under one corporate roof has produced few miracles. By and 
large, books have to make it on their own. An order from conglomerate 
headquarters to its film company to make a movie of one of its literary 
properties that would not otherwise be selected is obviously not good business. 
It is not a good way to keep talented people who are employed for their 
intuition about what will and will not sell. In the book business, synergies 
have been most successful in the children's market. Disney's trade-marked 
characters can serve equally well in books, films, T-shirts and theme parks. Of 
the 10 best-selling children's paperbacks of 1990, eight had "Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles" in the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Owning publishing properties in several countries is no different from owning 
other commercial operations in a variety of places, except that it encourages 
dreams of turning books into global products. Despite the difficulties, the 
need for translation being only one of them, a few books such as Alex Haley's 
"Roots," Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose," and books by John le Carre and 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez have sold in large quantities all over the world. The 
same could have been said for "Anna Karenina" over a century ago, but the 
difference now is that global distribution is greatly speeded by co-publishing 
arrangements and near-simultaneous launchings in a number of countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Steele is a prolific and successful Bertelsmann author, along with 
two or three other authors the closest thing to a global bestseller machine 
there is. But Dell, the Bertelsmann subsidiary in the United States that is her 
primary publisher, does not have the power to require this producer of yearly 
blockbusters to publish with Bertelsmann-owned presses in other countries nor 
to turn over the foreign rights. She herself is a global industry, and there 
are many agents and publishers waiting in line for a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of manuscripts that turn into global books is exceedingly small. 
Film and music can be easily marketed as global products because their chief 
attractions are action, sound and beat. A Pakistani audience can watch an 
action-packed Arnold Schwarzenegger film with Urdu subtitles and come away with 
just about everything the film has to offer. The essence of a book, on the 
other hand, is language. A translation is a reflection of a literary work as 
perceived by a translator who is usually not the author. Inevitably, a book 
displaying literary artistry or complex thought will be read by foreign readers 
as if reflected in a glass darkly. Even a brilliant translation is a different 
book. This reality sets limits to global marketing. Books do not travel well in 
their original language, unless it happens to be English, and even then only a 
tiny fraction of the world's Coke-guzzlers or Madonna fans is likely to pick it 
up. (Madonna's "Sex" was launched simultaneously in five languages, but what 
sold the book needed no translation.) 
</P>
<P>
 A few books are now conceived from the start as global products. Mostly they 
are slices of American life written for a huge mass audience around the world, 
modeled on earlier blockbusters and marketed like any Hollywood fairy tale. 
Indeed, such books are either inspired by a film or designed to whet appetites 
for the major motion picture that is soon to be. "Scarlett," the sequel to 
Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind," published by Time Warner's Warner 
Books, was released simultaneously in 40 countries in the fall of 1991, but 
this unprecedented global launching, which resulted in phenomenal sales, was 
possible only because 100 million readers had already read the original and 
hundreds of millions more had seen the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Even books from Britain encounter problems in the American market, despite the 
common language. Occasionally, the story lines of British novels are altered to 
accommodate American readers. In Jeffrey Archer's novel "First Among Equals," a 
tale of British politics, the book was "recast" for the American audience. As 
Joni Evans, the editor of the American edition, explained, "The person who 
ended up being elected prime minister was not the same man who won in the 
British version. It was all with Jeffrey's approval. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As the publishing business became more international, more and more foreign 
media companies considered it essential to acquire major publishing properties 
in the United States. It is the largest national book market in the world, 
college-educated, middle-class, affluent. But the U.S. market has a built-in 
limitation. Most Americans are not avid book readers. In 1988, according to 
Jason Epstein, editorial director of Random House, Americans spent about $3 
billion on "consumer" books -- about as much as they spent that year "on 
turkeys and apples." (According to the Economist, it was more like $6 billion, 
a discrepancy attributable to wildly different understanding of what a "general 
fiction and non-fiction book" is and to the notorious state of record-keeping 
in the industry.) The Assn. of American Publishers reports that only 13% of 
Americans buy books. 
</P>
<P>
 However, what Americans read still sets fashions all over the world. A book 
that is popular in the United States is likely to sell well in Europe and 
Japan. It rarely works the other way around. The American market is not only 
huge but it is, as Alberto Vitale, the head of Random House, puts it, 
"homogeneous." Popular attitudes are more "monolithic," he argues, because 
lifestyles are shared across class lines. The millionaire with 45 acres and the 
clerk with a patch of green behind his tract house both care about their 
gardens in the same way. This makes it easier, he says, to sell books to a wide 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 The dreams of the global media conglomerates have changed the culture of 
bookmaking, broadening, and frequently cheapening, the understanding of what a 
book is. Trade-book divisions are at the mercy of customers' whims, changing 
fashions and the competition from a variety of entertainment enterprises 
skilled in luring prospective readers to easy listening or mindless viewing. 
Publishers know that Samuel Butler, the great English novelist who was not 
hugely popular in his day, had it right: "God will not have any human being 
know what will sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Good books in ever greater quantities are being published by the 
conglomerates, but they are overwhelmed by much greater quantities of ever 
trashier books. The danger is that because trade publishers "are in the fashion 
business," as Simon & Schuster chairman Richard Snyder puts it, they are using 
their market power, whether or not they intend to do so, to reinforce orthodoxy 
of ideas, styles and forms at a moment in human history when new ideas and 
unconventional approaches are desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a certain irony in all this. Just as state control over the printed 
word appears finally to be weakening around the world, market forces are 
establishing their own orthodoxies, not by suppressing thought but by drowning 
it out. 
</P>
<P>
 This piece is excerpted from the recently published book, "Global Dreams: 
Imperial Corporations and the New World Order" (Simon & Schuster), which 
examines the cultural impact of an increasingly global economy.

 After watching "Against the Wall," you may want to check out some of John 
Frankenheimer's best feature film and television work at the local video 
outlet. Two of his finest aren't yet on video, though can be caught on TV from 
time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdman of Alcatraz (MGM/UA): Wonderful 1962 drama chronicling the true story 
of Robert Stroud, who became a world-renowned authority on birds while serving 
time in Alcatraz. Sensitively directed by Frankenheimer, the film features 
Oscar-nominated performances from Burt Lancaster as Stroud, Telly Savalas as a 
guard and the great character actress Thelma Ritter as Stroud's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Days of Wine and Roses (MGM/UA and Wood Knapp): Frankenheimer cut his 
director's teeth during the 1950s doing live television. This 1958 "Playhouse 
90" penned by J.P. Miller is one of his best. Cliff Robertson and Piper Laurie 
star in the harrowing drama about a young couple who become hopeless 
alcoholics. Four years later, Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick starred in the 
acclaimed feature film version. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Prix (MGM/UA Home Video): A huge international cast, including James 
Garner, Yves Montand, Eva Marie Saint and Brian Bedford, star in this 
entertaining race-car drama. Though the film is overlong and predictable, 
Frankenheimer keeps the action moving with spectacular race sequences. With a 
wonderful Maurice Jarre score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manchurian Candidate (MGM/UA Home Video): Simply one of the greatest 
movies ever made. Frankenheimer directed this 1962 political thriller within an 
inch of its life. Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh and Angela 
Lansbury, in a chilling Oscar-nominated performance, star. Bizarre and 
frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Playhouse 90: The Comedian (Video Yesteryear): Frankenheimer directed this 
live TV classic from 1957. Rod Serling penned the disturbing drama about a 
popular comic who mistreats everyone around him. Mickey Rooney gives one of his 
best performances as the egomaniacal comic, and he's matched every step of the 
way by Mel Torme as his weakling brother. Edmond O'Brien and Kim Hunter also 
star. The opening sequence is amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Days in May (Paramount Home Video): Frankenheimer followed up 
"Manchurian Candidate" with this equally inspired 1964 political thriller about 
a secret military plan to overtake the U.S. government. Kirk Douglas, Ava 
Gardner, Burt Lancaster, Edmond O'Brien and Fredric March head the cast. Rod 
Serling penned the intelligent script. 
</P>
<P>
 The Train (CBS/Fox): High-speed excitement. Frankenheimer directed this 1965 
action-adventure about the French resistance trying to stop a train carrying 
art treasures to Germans. Burt Lancaster, Paul Scofield and Michel Simon star. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iceman Cometh and Seconds: Two of Frankenheimer's best movies are not 
available on video, but are definitely worth taping when they air on TV. "The 
Iceman Cometh" is Frankenheimer's inspired 1973 version of Eugene O'Neill's 
landmark play. Though Lee Marvin doesn't quite work as the salesman Hickey, the 
film features amazing performances from Robert Ryan and, in his last film role, 
Fredric March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seconds," an offbeat 1966 thriller, features Rock Hudson's best performance. 
A middle-aged businessman (John Randolph) gives up his old life for a new 
identity (Hudson), but soon discovers his new life isn't what he expected. 
Excellent black-and-white cinematography by the legendary James Wong Howe. 
"Seconds" airs Saturday at 2 p.m. on the American Movie Classics channel.

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authors of very good first mysteries become their own hardest acts to follow. 
Abigail Padgett's "Child of Silence" last year was a very fine debut indeed. It 
introduced Bo Bradley, a San Diego social service worker assigned to 
child-abuse cases. Padgett's second book, STRAWGIRL (Mysterious Press: $18.95, 
245 pp.), confronts her with the rape-murder of a small girl, a ghastly crime 
with Satanist overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 The new novel, like the first, is an engrossing work -- sensitive, colorfully 
populated and carrying the authority of an author who knows the territory, the 
work, the subtleties of the splayed psyche and such useful side colorations as 
Indian legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley as protagonist is doubly interesting because she suffers from 
manic-depression and, along with the stresses of the case, must fight to keep 
her balance without the dulling-out of drugs. Padgett, who was a court 
investigator in San Diego and is now an advocate for the mentally ill, has been 
exposed to manic-depression in a family member. 
</P>
<P>
 An early suspect (boy friend of the victim's mother) is arrested. But it's 
quickly clear to the reader, more slowly to Bradley, that there's a real and 
clever weirdo in the vicinity. The story's rising tension is to identify him 
and free the innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting cast includes Bradley's hateful female boss, plus a pathetic 
but helpful hermit, the victim's surviving sister and the remarkable woman who 
runs a commune across the country deep in the Adirondacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with its virtues of an implicit concern for society's losers and its 
presumption of enduring values, Padgett's is also as thrilling as thrillers 
get. 
</P>
<P>
 In his highly unusual MIRROR MAZE (Villard Books: $21; 338 pp.), William Bayer 
acknowledges his debt to the dazzling, dazing house of mirrors finale in Orson 
Welles' "The Lady From Shanghai," with its shootout amid infinitely repeating 
images of Rita Hayworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayer's detective, Frank Janek, checking out the murder of a visiting 
businessman in a New York hotel, is led at last to a ravishingly beautiful 
woman who lives, hermit-like and deeply disturbed, above a mirror maze her 
father built on a now-abandoned carnival site in the New Jersey flatlands. (It 
may be the most forbidding location since the House of Usher.) 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Gelsey, forays out to pick up males in posh hotels, drug them, rob 
them and leave sexually humiliating messages (in mirror writing) on their 
chests. Murder is not customarily part of the action but the victim, in town on 
a criminal errand, is indubitably defunct. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayer's novel is refreshingly offbeat, but not only in its setting. The 
whodunit and whydunit of the crime are really used only as means to decipher 
the mind and the past of Gelsey, haunted as she is by childhood memories of a 
maze-dwelling monster. A bizarre but ultimately poignant work. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize for the year's best first private-eye novel has introduced a 
succession of good new authors. The latest is E. C. Ayres, whose HOUR OF THE 
MANATEE (St. Martin's Press: $21.95, 296 pp.) is set on Florida's Gulf Coast, 
which is beginning to match Southern California eye for eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres' Tony Lowell is a semi-dropout and loner who does a little 
investigating, teaches a little photography at the local college and does a lot 
of work restoring a wrecked boat he rescued. An elderly woman, just out of an 
asylum, wants him to investigate a rich man's drowning several years before. 
</P>
<P>
 She's killed before he collects his retainer; more killings follow. Somebody 
wants to let sleeping corpses lie. An unfriendly and suspicious policewoman 
becomes friendly; two hostile federal agents stay hostile. A judge and a 
senator probably know more than they'll say. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not exactly ground-breaking stuff, but Lowell is an attractive figure; 
events move swiftly and Lowell is an attractive protagonist, earnest but not 
solemn and blissfully innocent of forced wisecracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Albert is working his through the calendar as Sue Grafton is through the 
alphabet. "The January Corpse" and "February Trouble" have begotten BURNING 
MARCH (Dutton: $18.95; 244 pp.), featuring a disbarred Philadelphia lawyer 
named Dave Garrett. (He took the bar exam in his wife's name but she split 
anyway.) 
</P>
<P>
 His old firm hires him to check out the death by fire of Miss Emily, its 
longtime bookkeeper. She had called Garrett to say she was on to something, but 
was silenced before he got to her. The something includes a palace coup, 
skeletons in the closet and fraud in unexpected quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert's book is a tidy, non-police procedural, leading to a quite unexpected 
and melancholy end. 
</P>
<P>
 In MURDER IN A MINOR KEY (Carroll & Graf: $18.95, 224 pp.) , David A. Grossman 
introduces an endearing figure, an absent-minded composer named Albert, whose 
brain so teems with hemidemisemiquavers that ordinary reality blurs into 
incomprehensibility. He appears to live on sardines, peanut butter, Ding Dongs 
and beer. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert on the Etruscans is bumped off at the college where Albert teaches, 
and his friend Tewksbury is the principal suspect. In Grossman's 
mystery-as-farce, Albert sequesters Tewksbury, keeping them one stumbling step 
ahead of their nemesis, Inspector Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel is an exercise in the comic style, defying disbelief. To his credit, 
Grossman (said to have had an award-winning career in advertising) brings it 
off nicely. Albert is clearly a survivor, likely to be heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Gulf Coast stars again in Geoffrey Norman's DEEP END (Morrow: $20, 
302 pp.). His hero, Morgan Hunt, has done time for murdering a man who was 
assaulting his sister. He's an ex-Navy SEAL who does a lot of diving (you get 
the feeling the author has, too). 
</P>
<P>
 Norman has been compared to John D. MacDonald in his gift of muscular 
story-telling. It's a fair comparison; Norman makes action (the diving 
sequences) almost palpable, and he creates richly satisfying confrontations, as 
when Hunt's shrewd old lawyer confounds a sleazy and villainous young lawyer. 
All that's missing are MacDonald's magisterial pronouncements on what ails the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 A financially troubled Navy pal comes to Hunt for help on a dive. Sunken 
treasure becomes a sunken plane full of contemporary money that powerful people 
want back. Like Travis Magee, Hunt renders justice in no uncertain terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest L.A. be forgotten as private-eye turf, there is David Debin's THE BIG O 
(Carroll & Graf: $19.95; 254 pp.), with Albie Marx, a deep-dyed Dodger loyalist 
and '60s drop-out and nostalgist who once wrote a bestseller, "Roger Wellington 
Rat," about a rodent who overcame a negative self-image. 
</P>
<P>
 Albie now writes for a local weekly specializing in exposing the bad guys, and 
is doing his best to demolish a crooked banker. A beating in a parking lot is 
intended to discourage him. Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Debin evokes the city with what might be called affectionate contempt and 
blazes a trail through oversexed wives, widows and mistresses, pals gone bad, a 
desert cult that sees UFOs and whose adherents include Albie's ex-wife and a 
post-Fernando Dodger rookie. The denouement is a true stopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in mystery-makers themselves is strongly commended to 
Rosemary Herbert's THE FATAL ART OF ENTERTAINMENT (G.K. Hall: 39.95; 351 pp.), 
with a forward by Antonia Fraser. It's not the first but by a long way the best 
and most thoughtful collection of interviews with crime writers. The 13 
subjects include P. D. James, Sue Grafton, Tony Hillerman, Patricia Cornwell, 
Barbara Neely and Jonathan Gash. 
</P>
<P>
 How good are the best crime writers? In a deeply-revealing conversation 
prompted by Herbert's long and challenging questions, Julian Symons, English 
dean of the form, says candidly, "They are as good novelists as almost any of 
the novelists who are around now, but they are not in the same league as great 
novelists, e.g., Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, of whom there aren't all that many."

 THE NEW WELL-TEMPERED SENTENCE by Karen Elizabeth Gordon (Ticknor & Fields: 
$13.95; 148 pp.) Ah, punctation. You can't live with it, you can't live without 
it.Does it really matter? You bet your brackets. Take a simple declarative 
sentence: "My wife doesn't understand me." Now toss in a couple of punctuation 
marks: "My wife doesn't; understand me?" But moving right along, for those of 
us who've never been sure where to put the damn semicolon, when to hyphenate, 
whether to dash or colon-ize, here's Karen Gordon again, updating and expanding 
her "Well-Tempered Sentence" of 11 years ago. Generally making life easier for 
the ink-stained wretch in all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon cozies up to the little squiggles -- "the rakish slash," the 
pirouetting period, "the promiscuous hyphen" -- with contagious affection, and 
she'll teach you either way. If you can grasp that "a comma comes between two 
independent clauses joined by coordinating or correlative conjunctions," more 
power. If you can't, there are examples: "You crossed my mind, but you didn't 
stay there." For every gerund or appositive or transitional conjunctive adverb, 
there's " 'Gosh, the moon looks like something from outer space,' breathed 
Heidi in cosmic awe," or "Om, Om on the Range: Cowboys and Meditation," or 
"Begone, foul water sprite, and take your panties with you!" An eye-opener for 
the ignorant; a terrific wake-up call for the commatose.

 THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF GHOSTS AND SPIRITS by John and Anne Spencer (Trafalgar 
Square: $39.95; 416 pp.) President Coolidge's wife saw Abraham Lincoln in the 
Oval Office.So did visiting Queen Wilhelmina. His funeral train annually passes 
through Albany, the local newspaper reports. Goethe saw himself eight years in 
the future. Dylan Thomas throws stones at the Old Boat House in Wales. An 
entire Paris street scene appears regularly in Haiti. A motorist killed in a 
tunnel collapse in Italy's South Tyrol still tools about in his gray Audi. A 
poltergeist pours water on a just-completed tax form. (Try that on the IRS.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the above are authenticated; most are not. It's the not that draws you 
into the book. The somewhat stodgy tone, the skepticism, the disclaimers of 
John and Anne Spencer lend credence to what they have found to be valid. One 
report on ghosts is "good drama but far too neatly tied up." In another it is 
"difficult to separate reality and legend." An entire chapter is "likely to 
contain no genuine ghosts." As a matter of fact, they write, 98% of reports of 
"haunting" can be attributed to "something quite mundane." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but the 2%! 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever your prepossession, the encyclopedia is a compelling guide to 
dopplegangers and vardogers, presences and poltergeists, "omens of death" and 
"time slips" (who is out of time? us or the ghosts?) and even provides a list 
of ghost-hunting equipment. Don't forget batteries! In at least one instance, a 
revenant agreed to be photographed. Alas, "The spirit was willing but the flash 
was weak."

 ROBERT CREWS by Thomas Berger (William Morrow: $20; 256 pp.) Alone and palely 
loitering is Robert Crews, who finds himself on the unfamiliar shore of an 
unknown lake with nothing but the clothes on his back.The sport plane of Dick 
Spurgeon has crashed into the lake en route to a fishing weekend. Spurgeon and 
two others have gone down with the wreck. Only Crews has survived -- Crews who 
was asked along by wealthy, supercilious Spurgeon only as comic relief; Crews, 
39, thrice-married, a failure, a drunk; Crews, bailed out all his misspent life 
by a rich father; Crews who has never worked a day in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 No alcohol here, no food. No tools, no search parties, no landmarks; only 
forest primeval as far as Crews can see, and deer and beavers -- and bears. How 
will Crews survive? Does he even want to? You can hear the whir as author 
Thomas Berger's imagination kicks in. This is grand stuff, man against nature, 
armed only with a three-pound brain. 
</P>
<P>
 The primitive in us resonates to Berger's chords as Crews, initially helpless, 
slowly reboots his innate animal cunning. He catches fish in his shirt, makes 
an ax from rock, fashions crude shoes from bark, acquires fire. In the 
wilderness, where no one knows he's a failure, or cares, he succeeds. 
Inevitably, as he grows to like himself, Crews finds a companion. Inevitably, 
she calls herself Friday. ("Robert Crews," eh?) Why she is there and what 
happens to them we will leave to Berger. A few loose ends, but a minimum of 
improbability in a novel that is atavistically satisfying.

 PLAYBOY STORIES: The Best of Forty Years of Short Fiction edited by Alice K. 
Turner (Dutton: $24.95; 609 pp.) It comes in a black cover, like the Bible.And 
like the Bible, its contents have rarely been plumbed. Now's your chance to 
atone for all those lies about buying Playboy for the stories. And painless 
penance it is. Here is some of the sweetest, sharpest prose between covers, one 
piece for every Playboy year, and not what you may have been expecting. Nothing 
hard- or even soft-core, save for one spoof. Very little aimed specifically at 
men, except Norman Mailer ("Better to love a dead woman than to obey a live 
one"), and that's just the way he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadine Gordimer is represented, and Shirley Jackson with a brilliant, scathing 
account of literary raptors at an author's deathbed. Ursula Le Guin recounts a 
revolutionary day in an East European capital when the paving stones turned to 
rubies, and Laurie Colwin, who died too young, bequeaths a grumpy, irritable 
mistress with a humor dry as a well-built martini. There's a vignette with 
valentines by Thurber, a Picasso drawing on the sand by Bradbury, a Kerouac 
blond whose bracelet is "as damaging a sight as Cleopatra on her poop of gold," 
and from Updike, "bats that moved on the wall like intelligent black gloves." 
There's Baldwin and Nabokov; Marques, Oates and Roth; Murakami, Singer, Shaw, 
Cheever, Dahl, Borges and the great, rolling Irish prose of Sean O'Faolain that 
begs to be read aloud. Oh, and the book also comes with one of those attached 
ribbon bookmarks. Just like the Bible.

 SECOND-STORY THEATRE AND TWO ENCORES by James Brown (Story Line Press: $16.95; 
192 pp.) A has-been, a still-is and a might-be inhabit James Brown's 
Hollywood.Respectively, they are irascible, acerbic Henry, who ran afoul of 
HUAC and never made it back; Evelyn, mature and generous, holding her own in a 
TV series; Linus, once a child star, now working on his second wind. Top 
billing, though, goes to the wrecking ball that is changing not only 
Hollywood's face but its character as well. The old Royal Hotel -- once 
glorious, now derelict -- is razed to accommodate a new freeway. Henry's house 
is next, the one with the little theater on the second floor. One last 
performance is all Henry asks before he plays out Act 3 in a rest home. It's a 
touching story -- flush with nostalgia for the Brown Derby, Schwab's, the high 
holy days of Clifton's Cafeteria -- but a flat one. Brown's people are in 
character but not of character. 
</P>
<P>
 Faring a little better are the players of the two short stories that pad out 
the book. "The Rat Boy" is a disturbed Vietnam vet who lives in one of the L.A. 
River's drainage tunnels. "The Friend" is a drug user who wants to pull a buddy 
down with him. Like "Theatre," they're both good yarns. Also like "Theatre," 
they both could use a personality pump.

<P>
 During the Arts & Entertainment channel's "Spies" series (week of Feb. 27), an 
episode was shown telling the story of a Spanish man who was a British double 
agent against the Germans. I was particularly interested in that portion which 
told about the "Overlord" deception by the First United States Army Group 
(FUSAG). 
</P>
<P>
 My unit, 507 Q.M. Car Company, was attached to Headquarters, FUSAG, located in 
Bryanston Square, London. I was a platoon sergeant with the 507th in command of 
the motor pool that supplied transportation for the FUSAG staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement by the series' narrator that FUSAG was commanded by Gen. Patton 
is incorrect. FUSAG was commanded by Lt. Gen. Omar N. Bradley and after the 
Normandy landing it became the 12th U.S. Army Group under the command of 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton was in command of the 3rd Army.

 I'm angry at Fox for canceling "The Mo Show." I think it was one of the most 
innovative and lighthearted talk shows since Oprah. Mo Gaffney is the most 
inquisitive, humorous and refreshing host on TV today. I just hope that a

 My thanks to the "powers that be" for having "Three's Company" (KTTV) and

story line, premise and cast of these sitcom reruns and hope they are never 
canceled.

 Mentally tough athletes not only view stress as a challenge but also thrive on 
successfully overcoming pressure ("Comeback Man," by Pat Jordan, Feb. 13). The 
comeback attempts of previous Olympic stars Brian Boitano and Katarina Witt -- 
like Michael Jordan's flirtation with a career as a major-league baseball 
player -- are testimony that top performers revel in the "flow" of a peak 
performance and often try to create new challenges for themselves.

<P>
 Duel (KTLA Sunday at 6 p.m.) is that tense 1971 Steven Spielberg TV movie with 
Dennis Weaver as a businessman in a rented car inexplicably menaced by a 
tractor-trailer truck. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Dustin Hoffman who won the Oscar for his performance as an autistic 
middle-aged man, but it's Tom Cruise who carries the 1988 Rain Man (ABC Sunday 
at 8 p.m.). Cruise plays a wheeler-dealer brother to Hoffman who becomes a 
changed man after their cross-country trip together. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 The Blob (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is another overblown remake of a 
'50s horror movie, changing the lean and mean original into a stomach-churning 
production of splashy color. It also tries, without much success, to bring out 
political, sexual and psychological undercurrents that had been buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird on a Wire (NBC Monday at 8:30 p.m.), a frenetic and witless 1990 comedy, 
stars Mel Gibson as a former counterculture roustabout, now in the Federal 
Witness Relocation Program. He is working in a gas station when he's recognized 
by his ex-sweetheart Goldie Hawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a disappointing 1985 Tom Hanks comedy 
co-starring the late John Candy. Hanks plays an arrogant rich boy in Yale's 
class of '62 who wings off to the jungles of Thailand with the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 Marked for Death (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is a smart piece of 
hard-action -- and ultraviolent -- filmmaking in which a fed-up undercover 
agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration (Steven Seagal) is reluctantly 
drawn into taking on a Chicago-based Jamaican drug gang. 
</P>
<P>
 John Carpenter's 1988 horror picture They Live (KTLA Saturday at 6 p.m.) is 
uneven but can be forgiven everything because of the sheer nasty pizazz of its 
central concept: America is run by an oligarchy of outer-space ghouls who have 
clouded everybody's mind through subliminal advertising in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 TV movie Four Eyes and Six-Guns (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.) is that 
rare comedic Western that doesn't trash the Old West, instead delicately 
balancing a love for the myth of the West with low-key humor that serves rather 
than detracts from that myth. Judge Reinhold, in a rich variation on the 
greenhorn who turns into a reluctant hero, plays an earnest, almost fastidious 
optometrist who flees the dull East for Tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Gremlins 2: The New Batch (ABC Saturday at 9 p.m.), the ferocious 1990 sequel 
to the 1984 chuckle-and-scream hit, lets loose those icky dragon-rats in the 
belly of the mass consumer beast, mid-town Manhattan.

 James Bond Retrospective (TBS Sunday) offers three of the earliest and best in 
the series: Dr. No (7:35 a.m.), On Her Majesty's Secret Service (10:05 a.m.) 
and From Russia With Love (4 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (Bravo Monday at 8:30 a.m.), the Michael 
Powell-Emeric Pressburger 1943 classic, stars a superb Roger Livesey as a 
kindly, aristocratic career officer, a symbol of British fair play who finds 
himself obsolete with the outbreak of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancing for Mr. B: Six Balachine Ballerinas (A&E Thursday at 10 p.m.) is rich 
in anecdote, emotion and insight. Anne Bell's 1990 documentary illuminates the 
careers and personal lives of major artists to get at something larger -- the 
creation of American masterpieces and a company to perform them.

THE LOVE SCENES, BY JOHN ASHBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After ten years, my lamp 
</P>
<P>
 expired. At first I thought 
</P>
<P>
 there wasn't going to be any more of this. 
</P>
<P>
 In the convenience store of spring 
</P>
<P>
 I met someone who knew someone I loved 
</P>
<P>
 by the dairy case.All ribbons parted 
</P>
<P>
 on a veil of musicks,?? wherein 
</P>
<P>
 unwitting orangutans gambled for socks, 
</P>
<P>
 and the tasseled nemy?? was routed. 
</P>
<P>
 Up in one corner a plaid puff of smoke 
</P>
<P>
 warned mere pleasures away. We 
</P>
<P>
 were getting on famously -- like 
</P>
<P>
 "houses on fire," I believe the expression 
</P>
<P>
 is. At midterm I received permission 
</P>
<P>
 to go down to the city. There, 
</P>
<P>
 in shambles and not much else, my love 
</P>
<P>
 waited. It was all too blissful not 
</P>
<P>
 to take in, a grand purgatorial 
</P>
<P>
 romance of kittens in a basket. 
</P>
<P>
 And with that we are asked to be pure, 
</P>
<P>
 to wash our hands of stones and seashells --  
</P>
<P>
 my poster plastered everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 When two people meet, the folds can fall 
</P>
<P>
 where they may. Leaves say it's OK. 
</P>

 65 YEARS OF THE OSCAR: The Official History of the Academy Awards by Robert 
Osborne (Abbeville Press: $59.95; 352 pp.). No sooner does a film reference 
book establish itself as essential than, more often than not, it either becomes 
outdated or goes out of print.So it is a special pleasure to welcome the 
up-to-the-minute third edition of this handsome volume by Hollywood Reporter 
columnist Osborne. Not only does it list every nominee and winner from 1927 
through last year (all included as well in a massive 27-page, 7,000 item 
index), it is unique among inclusive Oscar reference books by virtue of the 
number and quality of its hundreds of illustrations, including reproductions of 
the poster for each year's Best Picture winner. Turning these pages is easier 
than fighting the traffic to Monday night's awards ceremony, and even more 
rewarding. Kenneth Turan

EARTHQUAKES AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We ought to feel helpless about earthquakes, since we know so little about 
them and have to deal with them partly on the basis of erroneous, incomplete or 
outdated information ("Living in the Red Zone," by Michael Ventura, Feb. 13). 
The human race has tended to take any new knowledge and run with it, past the 
limits of practicality: splitting the atom without considering nuclear waste; 
hybridizing seeds that wear out the soil while the native stocks face 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 What the recent earthquake should have validated in our thinking is that we 
always reach further than our current knowledge out of the hubris of human 
consciousness. Sometimes the results are beneficial, sometimes disastrous. But 
we'll always build beyond our limits in the joy and excitement of building, 
live to evaluate the results and, it is hoped, learn from them.

 It is hardly surprising to read that our freeways' landscape-maintenance costs 
may have exceeded those of earthquake retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has been remarkably progressive in recent years in its landscape 
design. However, it must be paying daily for its mistakes: choosing the wrong 
plants for medians, for example, and overwatering them into enormous vegetation 
that must be trimmed, chopped and mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
 As a landscape designer who, regrettably, has at times made wrong selections, 
I am waiting for major growers to introduce a greater selection of dwarf 
plants. Our increasingly smaller urban and residential planting areas require 
it.

 Ventura has put into words what we all feel about earthquakes. I read it over 
and over again, laughing out loud and feeling somewhat compensated for my 
frustration with the news media for having provided us with insufficient 
relevant and meaningful information.

 "Picture This" (Palm Latitudes, Feb. 13) was a test, right? Did I pass? What's 
my prize? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the first thing I did was "find" the leaping dolphin in the NVision 
Grafix print.When I did, I couldn't believe it -- the dolphin was leaping away 
from me "into" the page. Then, when I looked to the side and saw that you had 
printed the "real" picture of the dolphin, it was leaping in the opposite 
direction. Someone on your staff (who probably also believes there is nothing 
there) obviously flopped the picture inadvertently. I love it! Do I get a 
prize?

 My wife always drags me away from "holusion" prints before the image reveals 
itself. "It's a hoax," she says. "Nothing's there." Then the magazine gave me 
the opportunity to discover this miracle in the privacy of my own home, rather 
than crossing and uncrossing my eyes amid a crowd of strangers. But after 45 
minutes, my eyes got dry and I began to doze off. Then, suddenly, I did get a 
revelation, but not the one I expected. My wife is right; it is a hoax. Unless 
those who see the images are on drugs, one approach I haven't tried yet.

 The Mexican drug wars continue: In late December, Edwin Bustillos, the 
environmental and human rights activist featured in "The Drug Lords Vs. the 
Tarahumara" (by Alan Weisman, Jan. 9) was severely beaten by five men, 
including two Mexican police officers, outside of Chihuahua City.The officers 
were jailed for several hours and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks after the story appeared, federal and state attorneys general 
issued warrants for the arrests of as many as 75 people, including Artemio 
Fontes (also featured in the article), on charges ranging from drug trafficking 
to murder. As of early this month, there had been no arrests.

COMMENTARY; THE UPHILL FIGHT OF A DOWNBEAT COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT WILLIAMS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bulletin: Thomas Pynchon, great American novelist, has served as a script 
consultant for "The John Larroquette Show," a bleak, mordantly funny sitcom 
wasting in the lowlands of NBC's Tuesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a weird way, we got him to rewrite the script," says Larroquette, who 
plays John Hemingway, an existential hero-schlemiel-alcoholic-night manager of 
a St. Louis bus station to which the adjective "sleazy" is a high compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, both Hemingway and Larroquette collect rare first editions of 
Pynchon, the reclusive author of "Vineland," "Gravity's Rainbow," "The Crying 
of Lot 49" and 'V." 
</P>
<P>
 Pynchon has a special love for the losers lost on the wayside of the American 
dream. So co-executive producer Larroquette decided to feature Pynchon in a 
script and sent the work-in-progress to Pynchon's agent for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made up a novel that he hasn't written -- and he gave us permission to say 
that he had written 'Pandemonium of the Sun,' " Larroquette says. 
</P>
<P>
 The mysterious, never-photographed Pynchon refused, however, to let a 
"Larroquette" extra, in a plaid shirt, be videotaped from the rear and 
represented as Pynchon. 
</P>
<P>
 One scene called for Hemingway's antagonist, the lunch counter operator, 
Dexter (Daryl "Chill" Mitchell), to reveal, quite casually, that he's a 
longtime pal of the much-traveled writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must have seen him, he was sitting here last night!" Dexter insists. The 
script says Pynchon was wearing a T-shirt with the picture of a certain, 
obscure musician. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pynchon, through his agent, wrote back and says, 'Would you please make it a 
picture of Rocky Erickson on the T-shirt?' " Larroquette says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up Rocky Erickson. He was a psychedelic rock 'n' roll musician in 
the '60s who was institutionalized shortly thereafter and spent most of the 
rest of his life in an insane asylum. Somebody that Pynchon liked, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Larroquette owns uncorrected proofs to "V." and "Gravity's Rainbow" and even 
one of two signed copies of "V." -- the first British edition. He also has 
collected more than a thousand volumes of Samuel Beckett's works. 
</P>
<P>
 But Larroquette never wrote the author of "Waiting for Godot," "Malone" and 
"Krapp's Last Tape." "I started writing a letter to Samuel Beckett," he says, 
managing a dry, existential chuckle. "And I thought, 'What for? To tell him, "I 
like your work"?' I mean, he needs that? He cares?" 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Larroquette's literary excursions are circumscribed by his intense 
desire to make a go of his series, which NBC offers each Tuesday night on the 
sacrificial altar opposite ABC's monster hit "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
 He saves a special, icy contempt for the programmers who staked his fledgling 
show's success against one of ABC's best performers. "It wasn't brave and 
daffy, it was stupid," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since March 8, NBC has been airing back-to-back episodes of "Larroquette." 
Critics, fans and lovers of Thomas Pynchon hope this double-pump strategy will 
boost the show into a strong second season. Larroquette wants nothing more than 
a different time slot or a different night. "There's no way I can compete" with 
"Roseanne," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying she's not an actress. I'm -- and I use the term loosely -- an 
actor, and my whole purpose is to hide my personality. "Roseanne's life is her 
act," he adds. "That's where she gets her humor from, the things that happen to 
her. I don't want people to know things that happen to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got this great platform that she's very comfortable with, exposing 
herself. As I said ... on the 'Today' show, the only way I could compete with 
her is if I started drinking again and rekindled my affair with Prince."

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; THE PUPPET WHO CRIED WOLF ... ON 
DISNEY'S 'UNDER THE UMBRELLA TREE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to huddle Under the Umbrella Tree, since it's raining on the show's 
parade. After seven years on the Disney Channel, production of new shows has 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too Many Pranks," the first of the show's final three episodes, airs this 
week. But fans still will be able to catch reruns on the premium cable channel 
"for the next couple of years," producer Noreen Young reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular and colorful show focuses on an artist (Holly LaRoque) and her 
puppet roommates, Jacob the Jay Bird, Gloria the Gopher and Iggy the Iguana. 
The quartet live in a treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the show is aimed at preschoolers, fans are up to 8 years old. "The 
youngest viewers, who can be 1 1/2 years old, love the colors and the puppets," 
Young says. "The older kids like the jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Each episode, Young says, "discusses problems familiar to kids. The problem 
gets solved. We try not to be preachy. We always try to show the humorous side 
of things. We want something that will make them laugh and help them cope in a 
domestic situation they might encounter and how they relate to adult figures." 
</P>
<P>
 Adults, she adds, are always shown in a nice light. Holly -- the actress' real 
name is used for her "Umbrella" character -- "likes to have fun and has 
childlike qualities to her. But the puppets are the real kids in the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Previous shows have dealt with death, sportsmanship, sexism, envy and careers. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's half-hour show -- most weeks two 15-minute segments air back to 
back -- offers a contemporary twist to the classic tale of the boy who cried 
wolf. The puppets learn an important lesson when Iggy's practical jokes go 
awry. Iggy thinks his antics are funny, but the others disagree. When he 
finally tries to tell them about something that has really happened, no one 
believes him. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard for Young to believe that her show is ending, that it encountered 
budget problems that made it "not viable from a business perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Disney Channel reruns, parents will be able to find "Umbrella 
Tree" on video this winter: all 270 15-minute episodes, as well as 15 half-hour 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the Umbrella Tree" airs Saturday at 11:30 a.m. For ages 2 to 6. More 
Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 It's springtime in Paris for France's famous schoolgirl in Madeline and the 
Easter Bonnet (Sunday 6-6:30 p.m. Family Channel). With the flowers in bloom 
and the Eiffel Tower sparkling, everything is new except for the mangy bonnet 
worn by the milk-wagon horse. Madeline and her 11 school pals refurbish the 
bonnet, which sets a fashion trend. The "Madeline Easter Bonnet" becomes a 
must-have on the spring fashion scene for both horses and humans. For ages 2 to 
9.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" star Alfonso Ribeiro is the celebrity guest this 
week on Bill Nye the Science Guy (Friday 8:30-9 p.m. KCAL). Ribeiro helps Nye 
crawl through "The Food Web." The first 50,000 viewers who write in to the show 
-- an address will be provided at the end of this week's episode -- will 
receive "Bill Nye the Science Guy's Amazing Box O' Science." Paid for by a 
grant from the National Science Foundation and created by Disney for kids 8 and 
up, the free kit offers a Nye-style hands-on approach to scientific mysteries. 
Scientific facts and three safe-and-simple experiments, complete with tools, 
are provided. For ages 8 and up.

THE BIBLE AS RADICAL DIET PLAN; MILLROY THE MAGICIAN, BY PAUL THEROUX (RANDOM 
HOUSE: $24; 448 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Terry Tempest Williams, Terry Tempest Williams' new book, The Unspoken Word 
(Pantheon), is due out in April. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "My name is Millroy and I am a messenger, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He leaned his wide bright face into the bigness of the TV screen.  
</P>
<P>
 I was once so fat I was imprisoned in the darkness of my body -- trapped in my 
own fatness. Every day was a living hell, and I suffered just like you. But the 
Lord spoke to me saying, 'Change your ways, Fatso!' "  
</P>
<P>
 So begins one of Millroy the Magician's evangelical diatribes in Paul 
Theroux's new novel. This is a book about food, religion and the manipulation 
of power in America. It is not altogether appetizing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Theroux's classic novel, "The Mosquito Coast," Allie Fox had given up on 
American culture and moved his family to the jungles of Central America to 
begin anew. Millroy, however, is committed to social change at home through 
diet. Millroy the Magician is well drawn, a dangerous and irresistible prophet. 
His medium is television. His approach is religious. His temple becomes "The 
Day One Diner." 
</P>
<P>
 The story begins at the Barnstable County Fair. The narrator is Jilly Farina, 
a 14-year-old girl under 5-feet-2 who wears size 4 1/2 sneakers. Her mother is 
dead. Her father is a drunk and she lives with her abusive grandmother, Gaga. 
Jilly left home to find a little magic. Millroy changes her life, and before 
she realizes what has happened she is his assistant Annette dressed in a slinky 
bathing suit, a sequined cape, wearing red lipstick and high heels. (This book 
will make any feminist or children's rights advocate cringe.) "We were lost 
souls, though we didn't know that until we met. Now we are one complex 
organism," Millroy tells Jilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 24 four hours of their new relationship, Millroy makes an elephant 
disappear, pulls an eagle from the folds of the American flag, then privately 
pokes a rubber tube up his nose in order to pump sledge out of his stomach to 
see how his food is digesting. "People are obsessed by the way they look," he 
was saying. "But that's the exterior. What about the inside, which is much more 
important? You have to know the condition of your stomach and gut." Millroy the 
Magician has one agenda: to make America regular. "Bowels are more important 
than vowels." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Theroux's critique of America through our dietary intake is a provocative 
one. Our panoply of fast-food outlets, from McDonalds to Taco Bell to Bub City 
Crabshack to Carmina Burrito, given the frequency of our visits, our propensity 
as a people to "eat and run," is in direct relationship to the quality and 
thoughtfulness of our lives. "Every meal should be a spiritual experience." 
Millroy tells his television congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 We can believe but who has the time? 
</P>
<P>
 As readers, we get Millroy's point almost immediately, but then we must suffer 
through page after page of endless stomach pumpings and intestinal preachings, 
arduous bouts on the toilet and his impassioned plea to produce "at least two 
pounds of waste a day." All these gastronomic details are folded into a 
religious-right narrative with Millroy gaining celebrity status as America's 
nutritional preacher. He develops enemies. Other jealous zealots from other 
TV-evangelist programs believe he is fouling the Bible by plugging it as 
"America's cookbook." Eventually, they run him out of town and try to have him 
arrested on charges of tax evasion and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Jilly Farina once again. Millroy disguises her as his step-son, Alex. He 
relies on him/her for his personal salvation. What unfolds is a storyline that 
resembles the evolution of a cult, with Millroy the Magician as its charismatic 
leader.Millroy opens the Day One Diner and staffs it with dozens of "Day One 
Sons and Daughters." They become both disciples and missionaries, transforming 
fat Americans into health conscious citizens by serving them Ezelial bread, 
carrot juice and bean cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Theroux has a good eye for characters. His perceptions as the astute 
traveler serve him well in fiction. Jilly Farina as the vulnerable devotee of 
Millroy is not only sympathetic but empathetic in her understanding of her 
mentor. Millroy is as complex and paradoxical as his magic. On one hand he 
produces doves and on the other, a sliced index finger that he commands his 
employees to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension that Theroux creates between Millroy and Jilly keeps the narrative 
moving. Millroy depends on Jilly for spiritual and psychic support. Jilly 
depends on Millroy for the physical safety and nourishment she never had. Jilly 
begins to recognize the twisted nature of Millroy, how dark and deep his 
manipulations have become. "A person with so many surprises had to be full of 
secrets." Celebrity has become both his possession and paranoia. She makes 
brave attempts toward her own sovereignty but can never quite break free. 
Millroy knows why. "Once you have healed a person they are related to you. Once 
you have fed a person, they are part of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux repeats a theme found in "The Mosquito Coast" in which the 
protagonist, in his desire to find alternatives to a failing society, 
re-creates the social corruption from which he separates himself. Disengaging 
from the status quo is never easy. Ideals are rarely brought into practice. But 
the old adage "Absolute power corrupts absolutely" stands up and stares Millroy 
in the face. No magic can save him from his human frailties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millroy the Magician" has enough power to consume the reader, might even get 
us to rethink our relationship to food. One can imagine this book assuming cult 
status on college campuses. It could even do some good. It is an imaginative 
fiction that exposes the power and manipulation of media in our culture and the 
effect it is having on our psychological as well as physical health. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the narrative turns pale when Theroux insists on replacing one 
orthodoxy for another, brutalizing the reader with excessive and repetitive 
imagery, platitudes and an arrogance of style that ultimately becomes 
distasteful. It is in this context that "Millroy the Magician" loses its magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Millroy has a way of getting inside you. I must confess while reading 
this book I gave up sugar, reopened the Bible if only for recipes and began 
imagining a country less constipated.

 One of my favorite parts of Los Angeles used to be that sunken scrap of 
flatland near Temple and Virgil where half a dozen major streets come together 
in a maddening welter of honking horns, where the best way to reach your 
destination may be to close your eyes and point your car in a direction 90 
degrees from where you think you want to go. Before it was cemented over in the 
'20s, the area was something like marshland, and by the '40s some people were 
already waxing nostalgic for the days when you could fish for crawdads off 
streetcar bridges. Until the developers showed up a few years ago, the general 
area may have been one of the bits of central Los Angeles least changed since 
the days of Nathaniel West and Raymond Chandler, a romantic, swampy noir ish 
sort of place, all anonymous repair shops and sleepy Art Deco facades, 
veterinarians and florists, even when the street choked with automobiles and 
baked in radiant asphalt heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The mega-intersection, which some people call the Bermuda Triangle because so 
many get lost in it, is a natural demarcation between Downtown and Midtown, 
Hollywood and the Wilshire district, neighborhoods that are predominantly 
Spanish-speaking and neighborhoods also fluent in Tagalog, Korean and Japanese. 
Some cities build public squares in busy places like these, or at least 
old-fashioned traffic circles around a statue of a horse-mounted general or 
something: an obelisk, a fountain, a plaque honoring Pio Pico. In the triangle, 
a gas station was about as close to a monument as they got, and even that was 
razed a couple of years ago in favor of a semi-permanent hillock of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The triangle was full of attractions: an auto repair place where the mechanics 
were at least as intent on telling you what was wrong with Castro as what might 
ail your brake drums; a Mexican beer bar -- its sign advertised "Beautiful 
Babys" -- that featured pool tables and Tecate (and, presumably, child care); a 
(still functioning) garage called the Car-O-Practor with a facade that once 
looked stippled with sequins. One restaurant served delicate French-Japanese 
lunches at prices that rivaled the Sizzler's until county inspectors discovered 
the lack of a health permit and closed the place down. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Mexican Village burned in the riots, that restaurant was packed with 
garishly painted Aztec-style statuary and couples who danced to a cool, though 
cut-rate, live salsa band. The place may have served some of the blandest 
Mexican food in the city of Los Angeles, but that never kept people away. Next 
door, a taco stand still looks like a set from a colorized '30s 
South-of-the-Border farce. 
</P>
<P>
 Above it all, a squadron of yellow neon mice, part of the sign for a local 
pest-control company, is visible for miles, as much a part of the landscape as 
the Coca-Cola sign used to be on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress marches on: Mexican Village looks almost rebuilt this week, and the 
owners seem to be restoring some of the statues, too. But though the new 
mini-malls have brought the standard wonders of entry-level capitalism that 
mini-malls tend to do -- a few splendid South American cafes, doughnut stands, 
travel agencies, Kentucky Fried Chicken -- the neighborhood seems somehow to be 
losing its special mood, to be slouching into the convenience-store, one-world 
sameness that makes some commercial strips in Ecuador or New Hampshire look as 
though they were on the outskirts of San Bernardino. There may not be a 
building in this area that would make any architect's short list of things 
worth preserving, but I already miss the character of the place, and it's not 
even half gone yet.

 THE CARVING OF MOUNT RUSHMORE by Rex Alan Smith (Abbeville: $19.95; 416 pp., 
illustrated). The monumental busts of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and 
Roosevelt constitute the largest sculpture in the world: Each head is as tall 
as the Sphinx. This seemingly stolid piece of Americana had a colorful origin, 
as Rex Smith recounts in this surprising history. In prose that has a 
pleasantly old-fashioned ring, he details how and why the flamboyant sculptor 
Gutzon Borglum proposed the grandiose project, how he chose the site, why he 
included Roosevelt and how the titantic sculpture was financed.

 ZAP!: How Your Computer Can Hurt You -- And What You Can Do About It by Don 
Sellers (Peachpit Press: $12.95; 150 pp., illustrated, paperback original). The 
Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 4.4 million Americans suffer from 
computer-related CTD's (cumulative trauma disorders). Sellers examines some of 
the causes of these problems and offers solutions that range from reducing 
stress to installing ergonomic work stations. Although an interesting overview, 
"Zap!" is hardly the definitive book on the subject. The chapter on glasses 
omits the radiation-blocking properties of some plastic lenses; the discussion 
of lighting mentions problems associated with fluorescent tubes, but fails to 
assess the merits of incandescent and halogen bulbs.

 I MARRIED A DEAD MAN by Cornell Woolrich (Penguin: 154 pp.) and X REAR WINDOW 
AND OTHER STORIES by Cornell Woolrich (Penguin: 169 pp.; $6.99 each). Out of 
print for over a decade, these two books will acquaint a new generation of 
readers with the bitterly ironic work of one of the masters of noir detective 
fiction.In "Rear Window," a man who stares out a window realizes a murder has 
been committed; his efforts to prove his discovery lead to a deadly game of cat 
and mouse. In the more intense novel, "I Married a Dead Man," the narrator 
finds herself down on her luck: Woolrich describes her as "A leftover, 
marked-down doll, with no bright ribbons or tissue wrappings. . . . A doll with 
no donor or recipient. A doll no one bothered to claim." Mistaken for the bride 
of an accident victim, she finds love and luxury for the first time in her 
life, only to have this artificial paradise threatened by the specter of her 
past. Readers who believe the noir genre began and ended with Dashiell Hammett 
and Philip Marlowe are in for a darkly engaging surprise.

 BATTLEFIELD: Farming a Civil War Battleground by Peter Svenson (Ballantine: 
$11; 246 pp., illustrated). When Peter Svenson purchased a 40-acre hay farm in 
Virginia's Shenandoah Valley in 1985, he was surprised to discover he had 
bought part of the site of the Battle of Cross Keys, where Stonewall Jackson 
scored a minor victory over the Union in 1862.As Svenson built his home, he 
researched the battle, juxtaposing his efforts to create a new life for his 
family with a growing desire to understand the past: "I am balanced on the cusp 
between agriculture and history. Every step I take seems to reverberate on the 
empty husk of time, and time itself often stops when I find myself thinking 
about that long-ago Sunday in June." National Book Award finalist.

 KITCHEN by Banana Yoshimoto, translated from the Japanese by Megan Backus 
(Washington Square Press: $8; 152 pp.). The title novella and the short story 
"Moonlight Shadow" offer American readers a pleasant introduction to this 
popular young writer.After the death of her grandmother, Mikage, the narrator 
of "Kitchen," finds herself "tied by blood to no creature in this world. I 
could go anywhere, do anything. It was dizzying." Lonely and dislocated, Mikage 
allows herself to be adopted by Yuichi, a shy boy, and his glamorous mother. 
Their comfortable menage proves to be far less conventional than it initially 
appears, but the mismatched trio settles into a curious domesticity that 
redefines the notion of home. "Shadow," which describes the emotions of a young 
woman learning to bid farewell to her dead finance, represents a modern 
retelling of a traditional ghost story.

 GET YOUR TONGUE OUT OF MY MOUTH, I'M KISSING YOU GOOD-BYE! by Cynthia Heimel 
(Fawcett: $10; 179 pp.). Heimel offers her waspishly funny comments on life, 
love and feminism in this collection of essays.Many of these subjects have been 
covered by other writers -- love in the '90s, the search for commitment as men 
and women vie for the title of victim, New York vs. Los Angeles. What sets 
Heimel's work apart is her delightfully snide style. Although she pokes 
well-deserved fun at contemporary problems, describing America as "a 
dysfunctional country in search of a 12-step program," Heimel is not afraid to 
expose a more vulnerable side, as she tries to warm herself by the ashes of her 
'60s idealism.

 PAGAN BABIES by Greg Johnson (Plume: $9.95; 312 pp.). Johnson's novel traces 
the lives of brooding, artistic Clifford Bannon and defiant Janice Rungren from 
the optimism of the Kennedy Administration to the chilly, disillusioned era of 
AIDS.Two misfits, Clifford and Janice are drawn to each other when they meet in 
a parochial elementary school in rural Texas. Their emotionally tangled 
relationship reflects the problems of growing up Catholic in an era of 
rebellion: The doctrinal rigidity of the Church, provides a target for young 
people chafing at the strictures of authority. Janice and Clifford pursue paths 
that separate and cross as they struggle to forge lives for themselves. Their 
ties compel them return to each other, sharing joy, sorrow and, to their 
considerable surprise, a sexual partner.

PALM LATITUDES: CREATURE FEATURE; FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS DIVE DRUNK

 They found Harry out in the woods by a Northern California winery passed out 
drunk. His rescuers took him to the nearest medical facility, where the staff 
gave him something to settle his stomach, and then let him sleep it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Tales from an AA meeting? Nope. Harry is a red-tailed hawk. And the drunk tank 
was a cage at Santa Rosa's Bird Rescue Center, whose all-volunteer staff treats 
3,000 injured or poisoned birds a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vineyards occasionally use mulch made from pressed grapes and the stuff can 
ferment. Blackbirds and starlings are usually the first to get into the sauce. 
Then the hawks start eating the party birds, not realizing that these guys have 
booze-filled centers. And because drunk birds look like poisoned birds, the 
Bird Rescue Center, which treats about 30 drunken hawks a year, gets the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat offenders are a problem. A few winters ago, center staffers tried 
driving the dried-out birds 30 miles away before releasing them. But, says 
Karen Krone, the center's director of medical care, "The very next weekend they 
brought in another drunk bunch and I swear they looked like the same hawks." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, the center is seeing fewer boozed-up red-tails. 
"Moderation," says Krone, "appears to be in with hawks." Michael Tennesen

 While the big boys in Hollywood talk the multimedia talk, self-described 
"homey cyber-babe" Jaime Levy is already walking the walk: The third issue of 
Electronic Hollywood, her made-for-Macintosh magazine, is coming out next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 This fanzine-on-a-floppy, which 28-year-old Levy started in 1991, is a 
potpourri of articles with a techie slant: Hollywood's underground film scene, 
new media technologies, as well as graphics and sampled music from L.A.'s most 
happening bands, all neatly packaged in one $7.50, 3 1/2-inch disk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be seen as an independent publisher, sort of a cross between a 
record label and a magazine, because I get to use music and graphics along with 
text," says the paperless publisher, who put the cyber in Billy Idol's 
"Cyberpunk" by creating the interactive floppy that came with some of the CDs. 
She's also a contributor to Digital Popcorn, a new L.A.-based on-line service. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two issues of Electronic Hollywood -- which is available at two L.A. 
bookstores, Amok in Silver Lake and Big & Tall on Beverly -- each sold about 
2,000 copies. Reaction has been positive. "Being able to click on a picture and 
get more information is really cool," says David John Etzen, a Pasadena offset 
printer and founder of a local arts collective. "The potential of combining 
hypertext music and all those other elements can have so much more depth than a 
paper magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy says her Bay Area friends "were mouthing off about how San Francisco was 
going to be the multimedia capital, the new electronic Hollywood." So the 
born-and-bred Hollywood native dubbed her digital publishing company Electronic 
Hollywood to spite them and bring the name home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, however, she's been putting together Electronic Hollywood and doing 
her Digital Popcorn report from virtual L.A. -- meaning an East Village loft in 
New York. "You know, work," she shrugs, explaining that a teaching position at 
NYU and a megabuck multimedia-development job at IBM were too tasty to pass up. 
"But all that's temporary," she promises. "I'll be back as soon as I can make 
it happen." Mark Ehrman

 "I want my Booknet!" Or, in keeping with the enterprise's mission, perhaps "I 
must needs have my Booknet!" IL. Doctorow gets his way, this cry could soon 
resound in cable households all across the country. Less than a year from now, 
he and his partners plan to launch Booknet, the only 24-hour cable television 
channel devoted exclusively to books of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctorow has few peers in his ability to place titles on bestseller lists and 
college reading lists with equal ease. Best known for novels set in America's 
past ("Ragtime," "Billy Bathgate," "World's Fair"), Doctorow now hopes Booknet 
can help assure the future of the dwindling American reading public. "I've 
grown more and more worried about the tremendous attraction and seduction of 
electronic and nonverbal communication," he says, "especially among young 
people. The idea of literate culture establishing a beachead on this new 
electronic planet is very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is to devise a round-the-clock cable network that will encourage 
reading without substituting for it. Thirty-five different program formats 
include profiles, reviews, readings, interactive conversations with authors, 
newscasts keyed to books and publishing, writing workshops, and screenings of 
films adapted from famous novels -- whose authors could then interrogate the 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably the most important programming on Booknet will be directed at viewers 
who can't read. "I think just the act of showing programs in which parents are 
reading to children is going to have an immense impact on family life in this 
country," Doctorow says. "There are millions of functionally illiterate adults 
in this country who will be able to study quietly in their own homes. Some of 
the people who can't read very well are quite embarrassed and can't bring 
themselves to go into a schoolroom to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Doctorow, "It's when you get into local tv coverage that you run 
into problems. A lot of times authors are treated as celebrities, and the same 
questions are asked of them as would be asked of Cher. 'Did you ever dream when 
you were sitting up there in your garret that you were going to make million?' 
It really has nothing to do with writing. We hope to have interviewers who are 
themselves literate writers." 
</P>
<P>
 Booknet viewers will be able to buy any of the books mentioned on the air just 
by picking up the phone. Local bookstores are expected to advertise heavily. 
Doctorow's not trying to put publishers or bookstores out of business -- just 
the opposite. "I happen to think that if this works, it's going to create a 
demand for bookstores where there is none now. We're very sensitive to the 
interests of independent booksellers. You know," Doctorow admits, "I love 
books. I like the feel of the book. The quality of the paper, and the design 
and weight of it, the heft of it -- it's shamelessly erotic. I also think 
they're pretty advanced. They're an ancient technology, but they don't require 
the use of energy once they're produced. They don't radiate, they don't go 
down, and they're interactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctorow has a book of essays ("Jack London, Hemingway, and the Constitution") 
out this month and a novel, "The Water Works," due in May, but he claims 
Booknet is cutting into his writing time. Two books may seem like plenty for 
one spring, but both were well along before he started moonlighting as a cable 
mogul last year, and he's anxious to get back to his day job full time. "Once 
this is set up," he says, "I'm out of here. One of the things that astonishes 
me is what I've learned about business in the past six months. You have to go 
to a lot of meetings and take a lot of conference calls. And as a person who's 
worked most of his life alone, and who's not had to rely on anybody to get 
anything done except himself and maybe his typewriter repairman, I've been 
educated." 
</P>
<P>
 Of late Doctorow has become an expert on literary entrepreneurs past. Joyce, 
he's discovered, "wanted to get into the movie business. He thought running a 
movie theater was a terrific idea. Jack London started a grape juice company. 
Lost his shirt on that one. Writers have these odd flights in different 
directions, so I'm gathering stories for my own solace and consolation, as I go 
to yet another meeting."

A PHILOSOPHICAL POET; MATERIALISM, BY JORIE GRAHAM (ECCO: $22; 146 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David St. John, David St. John's book, Study for the World's Body: New and 
Selected Poems' will be published by Harper-Collins in August. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The distrust between poets and philosophers is ancient, and like all disputes 
over turf and borders, each side usually views the other with deep and enduring 
suspicion. In her poetry, Jorie Graham has always stood a bit precariously on 
the narrow cusp of this barely civilized mayhem, siding with neither of the 
antagonists yet drawing her strength as a poet from them both. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's fifth collection of poems is a startling and commanding step forward 
for one of our most exciting younger poets. "Materialism" is a book-length 
meditation on the nature of the spirit and the nature of "matter" in our 
material world -- concerns that echo throughout her work. The destruction of 
our body and the loss of our cultural selves are at the heart of Graham's 
poetry, as are questions about the future of the modern soul. Graham has always 
been an intensely philosophical poet, as abstract and "difficult" in her own 
way as John Ashbery; yet like Ashbery she writes with such passion, beauty and 
sensual love of language that she is able to rescue even the most highly 
abstruse of poetic passages. 
</P>
<P>
 In her introduction, as editor, to "The Best American Poetry 1990," Graham 
reminds us that poetry "implicitly undertakes a critique of materialist 
values." In fact, "Materialism" could have sprung from a question posited in a 
poem ("Who Watches From the Back Porch") from Graham's previous collection, 
"Regions of Unlikeness," in which she asks, "Is it because of history or 
because of matter,/mother Matter -- the opposite of In-/terpretation . . . 
/that we feel so sure we lied/or that this, here, this thing/is a lie. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Materialism" is punctuated by a series of poems, all tellingly entitled, 
"Notes on the Reality of the Self," which contain some of the book's most 
compelling and searing self-questioning. In one instance, the speaker says, "I 
put my/breath back out/onto the scented immaterial. How the invisible/roils." 
Later, with both personal and poetic disquiet, this penetrating question 
follows, "Is there a new way of looking -- /valences and little hooks -- 
inevitabilities, proba-/bilities? It flaps and slaps. Is this body the one/I 
know as me? How private these words?" 
</P>
<P>
 With "Materialism," Jorie Graham has written many of her finest poems to date. 
The poem, "The Dream of the Unified Field" stands as one of her most dazzling 
accomplishments. Interleaved with these poems are passages drawn from what are 
described as some of "the great male voices of Western culture": Plato, Sir 
Francis Bacon, Emerson, Brecht, Wittengenstein, Jonathan Edwards, Walter 
Benjamin, Whitman, not to mention Leonardo da Vinci. Some are represented with 
selections as discrete as filets and others with whole slabs of philosophical 
beef. The project of "Materialism" is both to offer and to challenge these 
voices, from the the perspective of Graham's own poetic female "otherness." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorie Graham often has -- to my ear, at least -- the upper hand in these 
implied conversations, as her language is predictably more supple and sensual. 
Yet the sense of interchange is far more successful than one might at first 
imagine. And, having tuned her poetic satellite dish across time in this way, 
Graham makes it possible for us as readers to imagine we're overhearing those 
urgent whispers of thinkers and artists who can, she clearly feels, help to 
provide a kind of civilizing, meditative context for the brutalities and 
incongruities of our public and personal histories. 
</P>
<P>
 For some readers, Graham's work has often seemed too laden with philosophical 
and artistic allusions, as if the poems existed in a kind of echo chamber of 
traditional Western culture, invoking both its best and worst aspects with 
equal -- therefore suspect -- aplomb. To my mind, this resonance has always 
been a great virtue of her work, a shrewd way of reckoning with and revising 
those many influences and traditions that any artist inherits. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps to more fully appreciate the power and accomplishment of her recent 
poems, it might be helpful to back up a moment and take a brief overview of 
Jorie Graham's poetry. Her first two books, "Hybrids of Plants and Ghosts" 
(which takes its title from Nietzsche) and "Erosion," were also philosophically 
inclined, self-consciously invoking the likes of Voltaire, Plato, Montesquieu 
and Bergson. Yet even in this early work, the constant counterbalance to these 
philosophical heavyweights was the powerful influence upon her poetry of the 
world's great art, especially the works of the Italian Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 This combination of complex influences, as she moved from the more 
conventional stylistic gestures of her first two volumes to the far more 
expansive and discursive meditations of her next two volumes, "The End of 
Beauty" and "Regions of Unlikeness," served to help unlock Graham and her 
poetry. With these latter titles, she emerged as one of our most highly 
imaginative and innovative poets. 
</P>
<P>
 Stylistically, Jorie Graham has always employed a highly cinematic sense of 
movement. Her poems are theatrical and gestural, even a bit talky. In the past, 
Graham has even used a pocket tape recorder in drafting her poems, to help 
generate this conversational effect. It is important to Jorie Graham, as it has 
been for many other modern artists, that her work clearly reflect the act of 
its own making, its own fluid processes. In much of Graham's poetry, her 
speculative impulses, set free in self-conversations on the spiritual in nature 
and the nature of the spirit, are often posited against backdrops of Western 
religious iconography and Classical mythology. In "Materialism," she chooses 
the male "mythic" texts of our philosophical heritage to serve the same 
purpose. In this way, she has been able to consider and revise those very myths 
and/or inherited ideas that have propagated our understanding of ourselves -- 
or perhaps misunderstanding -- across time. It is this revisionary ambition 
that stalks the poems of "Materialism," allowing the hard, shifting edge of her 
lines to reflect the oscillations of a mind at work. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Visible World," a poem that appears late in "Materialism," the poet 
asks, "What heat is this in me/that would thaw time, making bits of 
instance/overlap/shovel by shovelful -- my present a wind blowing through/this 
culture/ slogged and clutched-firm with decisions, 
over-ridings,/opportunities/taken?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jorie Graham's speculative and sensual poetry exemplifies the poetic hallmarks 
of the most powerful writing of the late 20th Century: multiplicity, 
simultaneity and polyvocality.?? It echoes an aesthetic and cultural past but 
is, truly, like nothing we've seen before.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; SHAKING UP SHAKESPEARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Shakespeare was the ultimate gender-bender: Even within the confines of the 
Elizabethan era's ban on women actors, he contrived plots that had men 
portraying women and women posing as men. The Los Angeles Women's Shakespeare 
Company is keeping the unisex tradition alive, albeit on the flip side. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a lesbian fantasy on an Elizabethan theme," says Emilie Talbot, 
who played a servant in "Romeo and Juliet," the group's first production, 
staged last year at the Hollywood Actors Theatre. "We play men as they would 
traditionally be played. We speak as strongly, fight as hard and love as 
passionately as would any man playing the roles." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, whose second Shakespeare production will be "Othello" in July at 
the L.A. Theatre Center, drew its inspiration from the Boston-based Company of 
Women, the nation's only other all-woman Shakespeare troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men's roles have traditionally had more text and a wider spectrum of life 
experience," says Lisa Wolpe, the L.A. company's artistic director. "Woman as 
victim, as girlfriend, as wife -- it's really all we get to play unless we take 
the reins and say, 'Let me a play a general. Let me play Othello.' " R. Daniel 
Foster

SCARS AND SECRETS: THE ATOMIC TRAIL; ALONG THE NATION'S BOMB-MAKING CIRCUIT, 
ILLNESS AND POISONED LAND MARK THE COLD WAR'S LETHAL LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael D'Antonio, Michael D'Antonio's last article for the magazine was 
Sound and Fury, about cochlear implants and deaf culture. He is author of the 
recently published Atomic Harvest (Crown). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a dark winter day, five elders eat a quiet lunch in the tribal Chapter 
House in Red Valley, Ariz., a dry corner of the Navajo reservation where most 
everything is dusted with the windblown earth. The meal is traditional mutton 
stew. The conversation, shared in the soft sound of Navajo, is filled with 
grief. These men, who dug uranium that powered America's nuclear arsenal, have 
watched in anguish as more than 100 of their friends and family -- all uranium 
miners -- have been slowly killed by lung disease linked to radiation. And in 
the past week, lung cancer has claimed two more from their community of less 
than 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew what they were doing to us," says former miner Russell Jackson. A 
tall man dressed in drab coveralls and a baseball cap, Jackson sits on a 
folding chair and stares at the floor as he speaks. A translator turns his 
words into English. "They didn't tell us uranium was used for bombs. They 
didn't tell us it would make us sick. But they knew. We were expendable." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials knew of the radiation hazard in the mines as early as 1951, but 
strict regulations protecting miners were not set until 1969 after 
congressional hearings on the issue. "The doctors were told not to tell them of 
the dangers, and they didn't," says Dr. Louise Abel, who works for the U.S. 
Public Health Service on the reservation. "An entire generation of men in some 
villages was decimated for the country's nuclear effort. It's an epic tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar stories have echoed across the country in the communities that 
composed the front line of the Cold War. Uranium traveled thousands of miles as 
it was transformed from rock to bomb, and documents from inside the weapons 
complex indicate that at many stops along this route, radiation was released 
during accidents, deliberate experiments and routine operations. Though bomb 
production has ceased, all the major facilities are now toxic-waste sites -- 
among them some of the most contaminated places in the Western World -- and 
estimates for the 40-year task of cleaning up the pollution, which will be 
lethal for centuries, exceed $500 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to be certain about how the radiation releases will affect 
the health of the more than 1 million people exposed. But all along the atomic 
trail, which stretched from coast to coast, communities feel and fear the 
ravages of radiation-related illness. "Trust in the government and science has 
been a casualty for these people," says Dr. John W. Gofman, a former government 
expert in radiation and health who is now an outspoken critic of the bomb 
makers. "A terrible political betrayal has taken place," he adds. "Increased 
disease will occur because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1949, federal officials knew that radiation could be causing 
cancer in workers and people living near weapons plants. However, because 
virtually everything to do with atomic weapons manufacturing was classified as 
secret, much of the debate over radiation and health was kept from the public, 
which was, instead, reassured about radiation's safety. "We were in a Cold War 
that was real," says Newall Stannard, an expert in radiation and health who 
worked on many Atomic Energy Commission projects in the early years. Bellicose 
leaders of the former Soviet Union promised to "bury" the West, and the Soviets 
often matched or exceeded the United States in the race to build 
ever-more-horrifying weapons. The press reported on the competition to build 
better bombs and rockets as if it were an actual war. And to many people inside 
and outside of government, nuclear annihilation seemed possible at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a real sense of urgency," Stannard says. "People believed that 
things had to be done and done quickly to keep the effort going. And because of 
the pressure to do things fast," he says, "many of us in the health and safety 
area weren't listened to." 
</P>
<P>
 Data on radiation found in communities near the bomb facilities was not widely 
disseminated. Health studies were often not followed up on. After two decades 
of radiation releases at the Hanford nuclear weapons facility in Washington, 
for example, doctors examined 5,500 children who lived nearby, but did not 
monitor them to see if any radiogenic illnesses developed later. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were treated like guinea pigs," says Robert Schaeffer, a spokesman for 
the Military Production Network, a nonprofit national alliance that represents 
citizens groups at more than a dozen nuclear sites. "The government made an 
effort to study these people after they died, but did not protect them 
adequately from exposure. It looks like a massive experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 The contamination that poured from the bomb factories and test sites during 
four decades dwarfs the radiation exposures in the medical experiments -- many 
subjects were radiated without their knowledge or consent -- that have received 
wide publicity recently. The government's top nuclear weapons official, 
Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary, acknowledges that the lethal legacy of 
the atomic complex "is a much bigger problem." The Cold War warriors did 
provide defense during the decades of dread. But, adds O'Leary, they also 
failed to safeguard the public from the more immediate hazards created by the 
production and testing of atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought they could control it. They didn't recognize the danger," she 
says. And as more of the hidden history of the arms race is revealed, 
additional secrets -- about radioactive pollution and experiments -- may 
emerge. "There's more to be discovered," she adds. "That's the thing I most 
fear." 
</P>
<P>
 What is known about the sins of the nuclear past is frightening enough. After 
two decades of pressure, Congress acknowledged in 1990 that workers and 
innocent bystanders at the start and end of the atomic trail had been harmed, 
even killed, by radiation-linked diseases. Uranium miners who have certain 
cancers or lung disease, which can be caused by radon gases in mines, are paid 
$100,000 from a special federal program. Similarly, exposed soldiers or people 
who lived under the billowing mushroom clouds when aboveground nuclear tests 
were conducted in Nevada in the 1950s receive $50,000 if they develop certain 
cancers linked to the fallout. So far, more than $117 million has been paid to 
more than 1,600 of the sick and dying. But thousands of others who lived 
elsewhere along the atomic trail believe that they were irradiated, too. They 
also are seeking compensation through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five suits are pending and more may be filed by workers or neighbors 
at any of a dozen other sites. In each case, the lawsuits have been filed 
against the companies that ran the facilities. But the real target is the 
federal government, which, according to its contracts with the corporations, 
must pay all legal fees and any judgments. Legal fees alone are running in 
excess of $20 million a year.  
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, people exposed to radiation from the bomb complex generally 
allege only that they now have an increased risk of cancer. Experts seem to 
agree that whenever significant amounts of radiation are involved, risk is 
increased. But it is difficult to prove that an individual's disease was caused 
by a specific source -- uranium miners with lung cancer, for instance, may have 
used tobacco (which the miners' compensation program takes into account by 
raising eligibility requirements for heavy smokers). "Unfortunately, cancers 
don't come with a tag that says, 'I'm from Hanford,' " says Tom Bailie, who has 
helped organize a suit against the operators of the Hanford complex. "But I 
think we know enough to say when someone's risk has been significantly 
increased without their permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Health studies that can more precisely measure the effects of the radiation 
exposures have commenced in areas near atomic bomb factories, but the results 
are years away. Nevertheless, experts such as Gofman are certain that the 
nuclear enterprise has spread disease across a wide area. Gofman, now a 
professor emeritus at UC Berkeley, helped discover Uranium-233, founded the 
biomedical lab at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Northern California and was 
part of the Manhattan Project. But he gradually became one of the nuclear 
complex's harshest critics because, he says, his warnings were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no such thing as an absolutely safe dose of radiation," he says. 
"They took risks, risks they had no right to impose on people without their 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 "The best science takes place in a very open environment," adds Secretary 
O'Leary. And in the bomb complex, she says, "just the opposite occurred. 
Secrecy was the watchword of the day." With the Cold War over, O'Leary wants to 
declassify documents and open the agency to outside scrutiny.  
</P>
<P>
 Her openness has raised expectations along the bomb-making circuit, where many 
see her efforts to tell the truth about medical testing -- and the resulting 
public furor -- as a sign that their experiences will become the focus of 
national concern. "There are far too many people who have died and are sick now 
for them to just be ignored," says Janet C. Gordon, whose brother died of 
cancer in 1961, after repeated exposures to fallout near the Nevada test site. 
"There is a lot of attention being paid to the medical tests that were done, 
and they were serious. But I don't want people to forget what happened here. 
Multiply what they did to our family by thousands of families. They knew what 
they were doing. There's no excuse for it." 
</P>
<P>
 THE URANIUM MINERS AT the Chapter House in Red Valley, remember spending long 
days in the excavations breathing cool air that was filled with invisible, 
odorless radon gases. They recall eating their lunches in deep tunnels that 
branched in every direction and ended in large caverns where the "working face" 
was broken with tools and explosives. They drank the water that trickled out of 
exposed underground springs, and some went home to houses built from the 
radioactive rocks discarded from the mines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know what we were mining was for the military or the atomic bombs," 
says former miner Kelewood Yazzie, who is now almost 70. "We knew that 
production counted. That was it." 
</P>
<P>
 A prospecting frenzy had erupted in the Southwest in the 1940s and '50s as the 
government's demand for the raw material for atomic bombs soared. Soon after, 
studies funded by the federal government discovered radiation levels many times 
higher than what was considered safe. But decades passed before the government 
developed rules to protect the miners. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Chapter House, the miners say that in the late 1960s, many of their 
number developed lung cancer, virtually unheard of in Navajo territory until 
the uranium rush. It took about 10 years for them to surmise what was happening 
and pursue claims against the government, supporting their case with medical 
research that showed excess cancer for workers in their industry as early as 
1964. But the courts ruled that the government could not be sued because the 
mines were operated for national security purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the miners, led by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, 
subsequently petitioned Congress for compensation. In 1990, the miners and 
their families were included in the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, in 
which Congress admitted that they were endangered and agreed to pay $100,000 to 
each miner who could prove he had worked in the mines for an extended period of 
time and developed lung cancer or other respiratory diseases. The Justice 
Department, which runs the program, estimates that 18,000 miners, nearly all of 
them in the Southwest, were exposed to radiation and are potentially eligible 
for payment. But thousands who labored in the mills where the uranium ore was 
crushed and refined into what's called "yellow cake" are not covered by the 
act, though many claim that they, too, were exposed to radiation.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 3,000 Navajos who worked in the uranium mines, more than 400 have died 
of lung disease, reports Timothy Benally, manager of the Office of Navajo 
Uranium Workers in Shiprock, N.M., which helps the miners file compensation 
claims. Benally says that proving a miner's length of service has been a 
challenge. Documenting illnesses can be difficult because local health clinics 
still do not have equipment that will detect all types of lung ailments. "A lot 
of men die before they know their claim is going to be approved," says Benally. 
So far, only 133 Navajo compensation claims of 301 filed have been granted. 
(Fourteen hundred non-Native American miners have also been paid.) 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the children of deceased miners have taken up their claims. On 
the day the Navajo elders meet in the Chapter House, Helen Johnson, a former 
case worker for the Office of Navajo Uranium Workers, is out on the windswept 
reservation visiting her clients. As she drives down the rutted dirt roads of 
Red Valley, Johnson recalls the slow death her father suffered when he was just 
her age -- 31.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was always getting sick," she says. "Then a couple of other miners died 
and my mother got real scared." Johnson's father died in 1970, leaving five 
children between the ages of 3 months and 7 years. Her mother struggled to keep 
the family together as a single parent in a poor community. "She hasn't really 
been the same since my father died," Johnson adds, tears trickling down her 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dying has continued. Last month, Helen Johnson attended the funeral of her 
uncle, 64-year-old Ray Joe Sr., another uranium miner, another victim of lung 
cancer. The funeral and service took place in the shadow of the mountains where 
the uranium mines were dug. 
</P>
<P>
 THE URANIUM THAT WAS seized from the earth in the Four Corners area of the 
Southwest was shipped east to be processed into fuel for bombs. At various 
stages, the rock was turned into uranium hexaflouride gas, enriched and 
converted into a metal. Until 1970, most of this work was done at facilities in 
Kentucky, Ohio and central Tennessee, at two of the Oak Ridge plants.  
</P>
<P>
 Once a secret government-owned community, Oak Ridge was built to supply 
enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, a job that once consumed 
one-seventh of the electricity produced in the United States. Oak Ridge, 
population 30,000 in 1950, was protected by gates and fences until after World 
War II, when the city was opened to the world. Through the years, officials 
monitored many radioactive releases and traced contamination. But in a place 
where almost everyone's livelihood depended on the nuclear enterprise, few 
challenged the government's assertions that the public and atomic workers were 
perfectly safe. Yet last November, a state report noted that 1988-'90 cancer 
rates in Anderson County, where Oak Ridge is located, were "significantly 
higher" than the rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As she navigates Oak Ridge's winding roads to visit her doctor, Janice Stokes 
points to telltale landmarks that an outsider might miss: an incinerator that 
burns atomic waste, signs warning that creeks and ponds are poisoned, a ball 
field that was capped with extra soil to protect players from mercury 
contamination from an Oak Ridge plant. Stokes notes that some of the deer, 
frogs and even trees on the site are radioactive. (These problems have been 
confirmed by state and national officials.) She believes that Oak Ridge has 
contaminated her, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never worked near uranium, but I've got it in my urine," she says. 
Stokes, born and raised seven miles from Oak Ridge, suffers from lupus and 
osteomalacia, a painful degenerative bone disease. "I've gone steadily downhill 
for the past eight years," says the slightly built, soft-spoken woman of 47. 
"There's just too much unexplained illness around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes' doctor, oncologist William K. Reid, agrees. Reid joined the local 
hospital staff in 1990, and "right away I was dealing with five kidney 
cancers," he says. "I wouldn't expect to see more than one in a population this 
size." Medical literature and consultations with outside specialists led Reid 
to suspect that radiation and other pollution from Oak Ridge facilities 
contributed to the illnesses he was treating -- high rates of thyroid disease, 
immune disorders and cancers. (All of the kidney cancer patients were workers 
who had been exposed to radiation, he recalls.) But Reid says that every effort 
he made to raise concerns and conduct research in the hospital on Oak Ridge 
radiation and health was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years they had an unspoken policy that said doctors do not talk about 
this," he says. "Once I started talking about this, I stopped being the doctor 
that they had tried so hard to recruit."  
</P>
<P>
 Methodist Medical Center spokeswoman Nancy Harrison says Reid was never 
impeded in his research or discouraged from speaking his mind. And 
ophthalmologist Francis Reid (no relation), who was chief of staff until 1991, 
says that in his 15 years at Oak Ridge he saw no evidence that physicians were 
reluctant to discuss radiation and health. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some who believe that the medical community may have been 
conditioned to sidestep the issue. The city's only hospital was originally 
built and run by the Atomic Energy Commission. At the Department of Energy, the 
commission's successor, officials confirm that doctors in Oak Ridge were 
expected to adhere to the code of secrecy that began in Manhattan Project days. 
"In a system like that," says a senior policy adviser to the secretary of 
energy, "those who questioned the existing order were purged."  
</P>
<P>
 Documents do show that the Atomic Energy Commission was deeply concerned in 
the 1950s about any claims relating to radiation exposure and illnesses. Such 
claims were reported to headquarters, and information about the cases was 
strictly guarded. But today, people such as William Reid who have raised doubts 
about the record of the Oak Ridge facilities have some evidence to support 
their fears. A study of more than 8,000 Oak Ridge workers turned up elevated 
leukemia rates. The report, published in 1991 in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn., found a correlation between the cancer and radiation exposure 
and suggested that the risk associated with long-term, low-level radiation is 
higher than previously believed. Experts have long known that a sudden large 
dose of radiation can kill, sometimes quickly. But they have debated the effect 
of lower doses received steadily over long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the Tennessee Department of Health confirmed that Oak Ridge 
had frequently emitted radioactive elements and heavy metals into the 
environment. For decades, federal monitors had tracked the releases in the air 
and water off-site and even monitored the level of radiation in garden 
vegetables and milk collected near Oak Ridge. The state report included 
descriptions of numerous radiation releases that could, in the final tally, 
reach more than 1 million curies since the Manhattan Project. (In contrast, the 
Three Mile Island power plant accident involved about 17 curies and prompted 
the evacuation of thousands of people.) The Oak Ridge report recounts a long 
list of incidents in which radiation escaped from a nuclear reactor called the 
X-10 and from other facilities. But it did not estimate how those living 
downwind or downstream -- more than 46,000 people lived in the study area near 
the Oak Ridge plants in 1960 -- may have been affected. A follow-up study is 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 This research is of great interest to William Reid and his patients, who would 
welcome any new information. "As children, we went to the Museum of Atomic 
Energy they had here and they gave us all radioactive dimes. We laughed about 
it. The safety was just something you didn't question," says Shirley Harkins, 
39, who grew up 10 miles from Oak Ridge and suffers from thyroid disease. "We 
were told that there was no problem, but we can't trust that now."

 FARTHER ALONG THE ATOMIC TRAIL, IN FERNALD, OHIO, 18 MILES OUTSIDE Cincinnati, 
the innocuously named Feed Materials Production Center turned enriched uranium 
into fuel that was sent to atomic reactors for final conversion to plutonium. 
With its odd name, some locals thought the plant made feed for livestock. This 
impression was reinforced, no doubt, by the fact that a local dairy was allowed 
to pasture its herd on some of the plant's property. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rolling acres outside the plant may have seemed pristine, in fact 
the landscape was polluted with more than a million pounds of uranium. Inside, 
work areas were often contaminated by uranium dust. According to the documents 
of the company that ran the Fernald plant, officials were aware of the 
contamination and damage to the workers' health as early as 1952. One memo from 
that time called for an end to practices that allowed many workers to be 
exposed to radiation levels higher than the plant's own standards. A second 
referred to 17 workers who were exposed to uranium and reported that all 
"showed urinary damage" and was followed a year later by a report that 
conditions had "gone from bad to worse" because supervisors had focused 
"chiefly on production requirements." A 1960 report found workers exposed to 
radiation levels 97,000 times higher than the plant's limit. On the basis of 
such information, more than 6,000 former employees are suing the operators of 
the plant for endangering their health.  
</P>
<P>
 The workers' claim that radiation exposure frequently exceeded health 
standards and that they suffer excessive risk of cancer is contested by Kevin 
Van Wart, the attorney for Fernald's former operator, NLO Inc. The workers want 
a formal health program, but Van Wart says that it would be unnecessary because 
it would offer "nothing they don't already get from family doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 NLO no longer operates the Fernald plant and it exists only as a shell of a 
corporation. Its main activity is fighting the lawsuit, with its legal defense 
funded entirely by the federal government. Nevertheless Van Wart feels a moral 
commitment to defend the people who once managed Fernald. "These are real 
people who live in the Cincinnati area and they are emotionally affected by 
what has been said about them," he adds. He doubts that the government will 
agree to a settlement. "I want to go to trial," he says, "because I think we 
would win on the scientific merits." Van Wart says the plant was safe and that 
scientists would testify that the radiation to which the workers were exposed 
was not dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, federal officials admitted that Fernald had emitted thousands of tons 
of radioactive waste into the air, the ground water and a local river as part 
of routine operations. The revelations came as the government agreed to pay $78 
million to end a lawsuit filed by Fernald's neighbors. Under the terms of the 
settlement, people who live near the plant will be compensated for the loss of 
property value and the psychological pain of not knowing what effect the 
radiation may have on their health. Payments have started at $16,000 for 
distress and have topped $500,000 for loss of property values. As part of the 
settlement, the Department of Energy is also funding research to estimate the 
radiation dose received by the approximately 28,000 people who lived within a 
five-mile circle outside the Fernald fence. The particles of radioactive 
material released at Fernald could be dangerous if ingested, which is what 
Angie Supe fears happened to her husband, Terry, who was raised 2 1/2 miles 
downwind from the uranium plant. He drank rainwater from a cistern beside the 
farmhouse. Last October, he died of kidney cancer, the same cancer William Reid 
is treating in several Oak Ridge patients. Terry Supe was 40.  
</P>
<P>
 On the country lane where her husband grew up, eight cases of cancers have 
been found in six households. Terry "was healthy, had no risk factors, and they 
were putting uranium out all the time he was growing up near the plant," says 
his widow. "Now he's gone and my daughter is so young she's going to forget him 
pretty soon. If you ask why, you have to consider the plant."  
</P>
<P>
 A similar connection is being made by workers and neighbors at Ohio's other 
major atomic facility, the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant near Piketon. 
Hidden on 3,800 acres of trees and hills, the 10-million-square-foot plant is 
described by the Government Accounting Office as "among the largest industrial 
facilities in the world." Beginning in 1954, it had provided enriched uranium 
for Fernald, which closed in 1989. And thousands of pounds of uranium have been 
released into air and water around the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the residents of the Fernald area, the neighbors of the Portsmouth plant 
want compensation for contamination, declining property values and the 
potential health effects of the pollution. More than 300 people have signed on 
to yet another suit, which attorneys say is still more than a year away from 
trial. If a settlement similar to the Fernald agreement is reached, it would 
likely provide medical monitoring and compensation for more than 15,000 people 
who have lived near the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 THE HANFORD ATOMIC WEAPONS PLANT IN WASHINGTON STATE BECAME the world's 
largest nuclear complex after World War II, with nine reactors that turned the 
fuel from Ohio into plutonium, which was then refined and set along the atomic 
trail to be fashioned into bombs. The community surrounding Hanford, known as 
the Tri-Cities, takes pride in its Cold War role. One of the cities, Richland, 
was built by the government and embraced its image as an atomic city. People 
there still bowl at Atomic Lanes and shop at Atomic Foods. The Richland high 
school teams -- the Bombers -- still use the mushroom cloud as an insignia and, 
until recently, the symbol of the atom adorned the granite pillars at the 
entrance to the Richland cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Bailie and his family were less exuberant in their embrace of the 
region's nuclear identity. They didn't move into a home next door to the 
Hanford atomic weapons complex in Washington state; the bomb makers came to 
them. In 1942, as the Manhattan Project began its race to make the first atomic 
weapons, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers purchased the land next to the Bailie 
farm in the town of Mesa, along with acreage up and down the Columbia River -- 
a total of more than 560 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Bailie was born in 1947, three years before the first reactor began 
operating, at a time when local health authorities were recording an increase 
in stillbirths. Bailie was sickly as a child and suffered from respiratory 
problems. At age 5 he endured a mysterious paralysis and survived only with the 
help of an iron lung. Much later he discovered he was sterile. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Atomic Energy Commission assured the public that all was right at 
Hanford in the late '40s and early '50s, roughly 1 million curies of radiation 
were being released into the environment. Scientists have already determined 
that the Bailies and their neighbors, who lived directly across the Columbia 
River from Hanford, probably received the largest dose of radiation that left 
the site. It came in the air they breathed, the water they used to irrigate 
their farms, the local food they ate. Throughout its 40-plus years, Hanford 
technicians tested all of these "pathways," which carried the contamination to 
the human body, and found radiation in every one. No warnings were ever issued. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We were like guinea pigs," says Bailie, now 47. He has thick gray hair and 
bright blue eyes. As he talks, he looks out over hundreds of acres of apple 
trees and beyond to the Columbia River and then the hulking concrete carcasses 
of Hanford's now-defunct reactors. "I was given thyroid exams in school. And 
thousands of kids were put through whole body counters so they could check for 
radiation. Where are they now that people are sick?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, Bailie began to collect stories about deformed animals, 
stillbirths and cancers, and he began asking questions about Hanford. Activists 
from as far away at Spokane and Seattle joined the debate, met by intense 
opposition from Tri-Cities residents who'd drawn their identity from the atom 
and placed their faith in government assurances about the reactors' safety.  
</P>
<P>
 But even as the angry confrontations unfolded, the government began 
declassifying reports that showed the extent to which Hanford had irradiated 
the region's air, water and land. Accidents, routine dumping and experiments 
had poured radiation into the environment even as officials claimed that no 
pollution left the site. The Hanford releases included a 1948 experiment in 
which as much as 11,000 curies of Iodine 131, known to be especially harmful to 
children, was intentionally released into the air. Known as the "Green Run," 
this experiment was intended to simulate plutonium production methods in the 
former Soviet Union so that instruments used on spy planes to detect the 
enemy's production levels could be calibrated. The secret Green Run spread 
radiation as far north as Spokane and south into Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 A study similar to the ones under way at Oak Ridge and Fernald will attempt to 
tell citizens like Bailie precisely how much radiation they received. 
Preliminary reports suggest that as many as 20,000 children who lived downwind 
from Hanford were hit by a significant amount of radiation -- the equivalent of 
30 chest X-rays -- in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Another 250,000 people 
lived in the direct path of the radiation releases. A larger health study 
involving the actual examination of about 2,000 people who lived near Hanford 
during radiation releases, is also being conducted. In the meantime, plutonium 
production has ended. Hanford is now the country's largest environmental 
restoration project with a budget of about $2 billion a year and 15,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 people have joined a "downwinders" lawsuit that seeks 
compensation for those exposed to the plant's emissions. They want medical 
monitoring and compensation for pain and suffering. So far the federal 
government has paid $20 million for the lawyers defending the companies that 
operated Hanford and are named in the suit. It is not expected to go to trial 
until 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 THE NEVADA TEST SITE, 50 MILES NORTHWEST OF LAS VEGAS, WHERE ABOUT 100 bombs 
were detonated above the ground between 1951 and 1963, was the last stop on 
uranium's journey to oblivion. Before getting to Nevada, the material that had 
become plutonium at Hanford was milled at Rocky Flats, near Denver, and placed 
in a weapon at a facility near Amarillo, Tex. Rocky Flats has been the site of 
widely publicized radiation pollution and incidents in which workers were 
exposed to radiation. Local citizens also claim to suffer health effects caused 
by the bomb factory. In 1981, one researcher, Carl Johnson, reported elevated 
cancer rates in an area around the plant that includes much of Denver. Johnson, 
whose work has been challenged by other researchers, suggested that 
significantly higher cancer rates occurred in the neighborhoods closest to the 
facility, where about 40,000 people lived during the heaviest releases. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the people who live downwind from the Nevada test site who have 
become the symbol of all that went wrong in America's rush to build the biggest 
and best nuclear arsenal. They felt the rumble and saw the blossoming mushroom 
clouds produced by the tests. They were among the first to say that something 
might be wrong. And their struggle for recognition and compensation shows just 
how difficult it may be for other groups to win redress for what was done to 
them by the bomb complex. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than a decade of litigation and negotiation before the government 
finally admitted that it was the likely cause of Arlene Davis' breast cancer. 
Davis, who recently underwent a mastectomy, grew up under the clouds of 
radioactive fallout that drifted from the Nevada test site across southern 
Utah. Born in 1955, she and more than 60,000 others living in parts of Utah, 
Nevada and Arizona were exposed to significant fallout radiation from the bombs 
that were detonated, as Congress has acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to eat dinner on our back lawn to watch the fallout clouds roll in," 
Davis says. "They told us we were safe. And if we saw the clouds, we'd call the 
whole neighborhood to watch. I remember my mother taking her finger and drawing 
on the dust that fell on the cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Government documents confirm that the Atomic Energy Commission was made aware 
of the fallout hazard in 1946, before the testing began in Nevada. Reports by 
one of the commission's health experts, Dr. Stafford Warren, warned that even 
minute bits of fallout material absorbed by a person's body could produce 
cancer years later. "This is an insidious hazard and an insidious lethal effect 
hard to guard against," Warren wrote. He advised the commission to discuss the 
danger openly, but instead, officials conducted an extensive public-relations 
campaign, showing films to schoolchildren to calm their fears about the bomb 
blasts and distributing booklets to communities near the test site that 
described local citizens as participants in atomic science. "Your best action," 
one booklet advised, "is to not be worried about fallout." 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1961, studies of the downwind population suggested that Warren's 
predictions were coming true. Though held secret by the Atomic Energy 
Commission, the report found excess leukemia in the part of southern Utah that 
had received heavy amounts of fallout from the bomb tests.  
</P>
<P>
 Such studies fueled a landmark campaign that year in which a limited group of 
test-site downwinders, alleging that the government had been negligent in its 
atomic testing, sought damages for illness related to the fallout. If the case 
prevailed, it would establish government responsibility for the safety of 
people living near bomb-complex facilities and open the door for lawsuits all 
across the country. At trial, attorney Stewart Udall, the former Interior 
secretary, relied on a convincing expert witness, Dr. Joseph Lyon, a University 
of Utah epidemiologist who discovered a 300% increase in childhood leukemia in 
the fallout region. Udall also used testimony from a former Public Health 
Service officer, who told the court that the Atomic Energy Commission had 
doctored his reports on fallout to cover up exceptionally high radiation 
readings in populated areas in southern Utah and obscure the fact that 
schoolchildren playing at recess were exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial court judge ruled in favor of some of Udall's clients, but the 
decision did not stand. In 1988, an appeals court found the government was 
immune to downwinders' claims, as it had been to the uranium miners', under 
laws protecting its actions in the area of national defense. The Supreme Court 
agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated and angry, Udall went to Congress, where he had served as a 
representative in the 1950s, to make one last plea. And this time he prevailed. 
In 1990, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act became law, providing both an 
apology and $200 million for uranium miners and the downwinders. Anyone who 
lived in the downwind area during the Nevada tests and develops one of several 
cancers is eligible for the program. More than 800 claims have been paid since 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Davis submitted her claim under the act two years ago. "Last February 
(1992) I'm getting in the bathtub and I see this big lump," she says. "On April 
third I had the operation. My mother told me right away that I should get the 
papers together and file them because the fallout was probably the cause." She 
was paid $50,000, but "of course," she says, "it doesn't make up for what has 
happened to me, for losing a breast. You feel it every time you look in the 
mirror. Money can't make up for that." 
</P>
<P>
 THOSE LOOKING FOR A WAY out of the morass of legal and moral issues 
surrounding America's nuclear legacy may consider the approach used by Udall 
for the miners and test-site downwinders. In that instance, Congress was 
persuaded to act because of the moral weight of the historical facts. Energy 
Secretary O'Leary says that some people in Congress are interested in righting 
the wrongs done to others along the atomic trail. But aides to Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio), who chairs the committee that oversees weapons factories, say that no 
compensation is being considered now though they may be interested in the 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, O'Leary has held public meetings in the past few months with groups of 
downwinders, irradiated workers and whistle-blowers. She has also met privately 
with families who believe that they have been stricken by illness and death 
caused by the bomb complex. "Previous secretaries never met these people and I 
think that was a mistake," O'Leary says in an interview. Some of these meetings 
have been emotionally wrenching, she says, but she sees them as a necessary 
part of healing the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton recognizes this is a serious problem," she adds. "He has 
spoken to me about it several times."  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, one of the most seasoned legal minds in this arena remains 
skeptical. Stewart Udall began fighting for radiation victims in 1978, and he 
has found what he calls "a galling attitude toward this issue" in every 
administration since. All along, he says, "the Justice Department has played 
'smash-mouth hardball,' trying to deny the claimants everything they could." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hazel O'Leary may be sympathetic," he continues. "But the key department is 
the Justice Department. I have tried to get (Atty. Gen.) Janet Reno's attention 
but have not gotten a response."  
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary's spokesman, Michael Gauldin, says the entire Administration supports 
O'Leary's efforts to right the wrongs ot the nuclear past. "Secretary O'Leary 
and Atty. Gen. Reno and budget director Leon Panetta have talked about these 
issues and they are supportive of her," he says. However, Gauldin says, the 
compensation program for miners and test-site downwinders is "not a model" for 
resolving other claims "but something to learn from." The Administration is 
moving "methodically because we know people don't trust the government," he 
says, adding that any future attempt to help people injured by the weapons 
complex "will not be just monetary, but would include something like medical 
monitoring and something as simple as an apology." 
</P>
<P>
 Udall is pleased that a high-level committee has been formed by the White 
House to investigate the bomb complex, but he wonders "if they'll go into a 
closet for a year until all the furor subsides."  
</P>
<P>
 "There's an old saying in law: 'Justice delayed is justice denied,' " Udall 
says. "I'm afraid that is something that could easily happen in these cases. In 
a sense, it already has." 
</P>

 1. For 18 years, Navajo uranium miners in Red Valley, Ariz., were not informed 
by the government about the radiation hazards of their work. More than 100 in a 
community of less than 2,000 have died of lung diseases linked to their 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Uranium from the Southwest was shipped to sites including the Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory in Tennessee, where it was enriched -- refined and blended. 
Radiation releases from the site over three decades were 59,000 times higher 
than that at Three Mile Island, and officials are conducting studies to 
determine the effects on those who lived in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 3. In Fernald, Ohio, the uranium was processed into fuel that would be sent to 
atomic reactors and converted to plutonium. The government has admitted that 
the plant emitted thousands of tons of radioactive waste into the air, and 
current and former workers are suing the Fernald plant operators for 
endangering their health. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant near Piketon, Ohio, also supplied 
enriched uranium to Fernald. It, too, released thousands of pounds of uranium 
into the air and water, and 300 people are seeking compensation for potential 
health effects of the pollution, as well as declining property values. 
</P>
<P>
 5. The fuel from Ohio became plutonium at the Hanford Atomic Weapons Plant in 
Washington state. Though the government repeatedly told residents that there 
was no danger, recently declassified reports show that the plant released 
roughly a million curies of radiation. Cleanup cost for the site: $2 billion 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Plutonium from Hanford was milled at Rocky Flats, near Denver, which 
manufactured the balls of uranium and plutonium used to trigger the bombs' 
nuclear chain reactions.  
</P>
<P>
 7. Facilities around the country shipped parts to the Pantex plant in 
Amarillo, Tex., where the final assembly of nuclear weapons took place. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Aboveground nuclear tests at the Nevada test site exposed more than 60,000 
people to fallout radiation while the government reassured them that the blasts 
were safe. Childhood leukemia in the fallout region increased 300%.

HACKMAN, BEYOND IT ALL; ON THE SET OF HIS 62ND MOVIE, HOLLYWOOD'S TIGHT-LIPPED 
LONER CONTEMPLATES RETIREMENT -- EVEN AS HE FACES THE CAMERA FOR YET ANOTHER 
TAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

of Center Theatre Group producing director Gordon Davidson.

<P>
 There won't be a lot of talking, that is a given, but his taciturnity still 
comes as a surprise. "I might," he says, setting the terms of his availability 
with great economy, letting his blue eyes scan the room with that elusive, 
shuttered quality seen in his films. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it: Buck Barrow in "Bonnie and Clyde," Popeye Doyle in "The French 
Connection," Bill Dagget in "Unforgiven," even Avery Tolar in "The Firm," all 
men tight as safes, ulcers in the making. This much is true: That bottled-up 
quality girding all of Gene Hackman's performances springs from a deep personal 
reticence, a loathing of exposure. Talking to the actor, even over lunch in his 
trailer here in the Arizona desert, even at what is arguably the apex of his 
career, is like robbing a bank. Whatever goods to be gotten will be under 
duress and passed through a very small window. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, only because I don't like talking about myself," he says, pausing to 
swallow some ice tea, pensive in the winter light pooling on the little Formica 
table, on his restless, ruddy hands. "I just, I don't know -- I guess I'm a 
private person. For me, acting is a kind of private thing, and I just don't 
like sharing it." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who know him, this is nothing new. Hackman, they'll tell you, is one 
of the champion loners, hellbent on not keeping in touch. Acting is his escape 
and his solace, his craft, as he likes to think of it; he is happiest when he 
has some acting problem to resolve, but wary when his job is examined too 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm doing it, I think it's great and I like doing it," he says. "But to 
watch it or any of the other parts of the business is so alien to me, I don't 
get it. There is part of you emotionally that says, 'I don't know why they 
bother to ask me to work.' The intellectual part says, 'Well, you have a body 
of work and and you've done this, that and the other, so they'll ask you to 
work again.' " He grips the glass between his hands, staring into its blue 
plastic depths. "When I do see my films, I'll say to my son, 'I don't 
understand it, I don't understand why I'm doing this and why they keep asking 
me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 UNTIL HE MADE "THE FRENCH CONNECTION" IN 1971, GENE HACKMAN worried that he 
would never work again. This despite the fact that, at 40, he had starred on 
Broadway, made 13 films and been twice nominated as best supporting actor, for 
"Bonnie and Clyde" and "I Never Sang for My Father." But it wasn't until he won 
the Best Actor Oscar for playing the raging New York City police detective 
Popeye Doyle that Hackman crossed that line in his own mind. He was finally a 
star. "Once I got through 'French Connection,' I felt pretty good about what I 
was doing."  
</P>
<P>
 Hackman, now 63, with 60-plus films to his credit and a second Oscar -- for 
best supporting actor in "Unforgiven" last year -- is in demand enough to no 
longer fear unemployment, to even contemplate retirement. He is known for 
working a lot, maybe too much. "The Poseidon Adventure," "Lucky Lady," "March 
or Die," these he made for the money, he has said. Sometimes he regrets that, 
"but only for a minute or two, because it really doesn't mean that much." 
Mostly, he says, he doesn't want to become one of those guys who hang around 
"out of ego because they could not stop."  
</P>
<P>
 Not that that seems remotely likely. If his name no longer sells tickets on 
its own, you hear him described in hushed reverential tones as one of the 
greatest American actors, a modern-day Spencer Tracy. Warren Beatty, who hired 
Hackman to play his brother in "Bonnie and Clyde," considers him one of the 
best American actors working. So do Dustin Hoffman and Clint Eastwood. Robert 
Duvall has called him America's "Everyman." Even now, two of Hackman's co-stars 
on his current film, "The Quick and the Dead," Russell Crowe and Leonardo 
DiCaprio, agreed to do the film largely because of the chance to work with him. 
"I don't know when you get in the league of people like that," says DiCaprio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now he's at the top of his form," adds Sydney Pollack, who directed 
Hackman in "The Firm" last summer. "Almost at a Zen-like place in his acting 
where you don't see the effort, he's so comfortable with himself." 
</P>
<P>
 While many of his contemporaries resort to age-parodying comedies -- "Grumpy 
Old Men" and "Finding Ernest Hemingway" -- Hackman presses on, armed with an 
ambassador-like stateliness, playing generals, sheriffs and lawyers, regal 
tough guys. He had a less-than-happy experience on Broadway in "Death and the 
Maiden" in 1992. But his performance as the coolly cruel sheriff in Clint 
Eastwood's "Unforgiven" was a most-public rebound after a two-year film hiatus 
due to an attack of angina and subsequent surgery that left the actor and 
sometime sketch artist contemplating a move to Italy, to Carrara and its fabled 
marble quarries, where he would become a sculptor. But "Unforgiven" changed 
things, reminding Hackman how much he likes to shoot long, complicated, 
dialogue-rich scenes. And the Oscar brought renewed attention that was, 
predictably, seductive. "You're offered a lot of things," he says, "and it's 
attractive in a way, then you get tired and you think, 'I don't really need to 
do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He does, however. When friends tell him to cut back, be more selective like 
his pal Hoffman, Hackman rebuffs them: "Dusty doesn't like to act as much as I 
do." He can't sleep past about 5:30 anymore, so eager is he to attack some sort 
of artistic problem, some puzzle, redesign yet another house or build an 
aerobatic airplane with his 31-year-old son, Christopher. But mostly Hackman 
wants to solve the perennial challenge of bringing a script to life, finding 
those ideas, the behavior "that will convince the audience that this could be a 
real person. That's what interests me about acting," he says. "Playing the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Hackman has become a regular player in the current craze for Westerns, turning 
out four in the past two years -- including the upcoming "Wyatt Earp" and "The 
Quick and the Dead." In the latter film, co-starring Sharon Stone, Hackman 
plays Herod, an outlaw with a penchant for killing friends and family. If he 
doesn't think the genre suits him particularly well -- "I think the best scenes 
are always interior scenes. You have more control as an actor. Just by 
definition, Westerns have to be shot outside" -- it is not surprising, given 
his subtly shaded, emotionally dead-on performances.  
</P>
<P>
 When he started acting, an ex-Marine and fabled barroom brawler, Hackman's 
work was distinguished by a manic energy, a tangible unease. He was such an 
avid fan of Marlon Brando that he would play the bongos on the roof of the 
Pasadena Playhouse with Hoffman, a fellow student, "just because we knew Brando 
did," recalls Hoffman. His technique, too, was Brando-esque, seamless, 
invisible, slightly menacing, perfect for playing wired, instinctual men like 
Buck Barrow and Popeye Doyle, less perfect elsewhere. He was fired from "The 
Graduate" because he had "so much juice and vitality," recalls director Mike 
Nichols, energy that was all wrong for the burnt-out man he was supposed to 
portray as Mr. Robinson. Even when Hackman appeared in comedies, most vividly 
as the prissy Lex Luthor in the "Superman" movies, his mania was filtered 
through an implied sense of threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene always has an element of danger about him," says Pollack. "You're never 
completely sure of what he's going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was his less flamboyant roles, including his two favorite 
performances -- the paranoid surveillance expert in Francis Ford Coppola's "The 
Conversation" and the eccentric ex-con in "Scarecrow" -- where Hackman used his 
flinty unpredictability in subtle yet more daring ways, turning it inward on 
himself. Some have called it honesty, but it goes deeper than that, to that 
rare talent that separates him from the Jack Nicholson-Warren Beatty-Clint 
Eastwood school of bravado -- a willingness to show his characters' 
disappointment with themselves. An Everyman. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems to recognize it himself: "I figure that there is probably something 
in me that the camera sees that people relate to that says, 'This is an OK guy' 
or 'He's probably not that bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Off-duty on the set of "The Quick and the Dead," the line between the 
performer and the man blurs. It isn't that Hackman looks as imposing as one of 
his film performances -- although dressed in his fancy gunslinger's costume, 
the bleached white of his shirt spangled with gold studs and a few drops of 
fake blood, his sandy hair tousled and face flushed, Hackman resembles a 
19th-Century circuit rider or a wealthy homesteader just in from checking out 
his acreage.  
</P>
<P>
 That blurring has more to do with the psychic restlessness he evinces 
off-screen. Hackman has a reputation for being difficult, for having run-ins 
with directors that, if not quite legendary, are well known. His authority 
problem, as he still refers to it, dates to his troubled youth -- his mother's 
alcoholism, his father's desertion -- the source of the anger that colored his 
early years and still fuels his acting. Despite Hackman's aloofness, his 
demurrers about his personal life, there is a melancholy about him that 
suggests an ongoing ambivalence about his sepia-toned past in Danville, Ill., a 
lonely youngster caught in an unhappy household in a dead-end Depression-era 
town. While acting was his ticket out, it also became the lightning rod for all 
those turbulent memories.  
</P>
<P>
 Even now, when Hackman says he is more relaxed than at any point in his 
career, he still keeps his distance on a set. Production assistants on "The 
Quick and the Dead" whisper that the atmosphere grew sober the day Hackman 
arrived. "I've never worked with an actor of this caliber before," says 
director Sam Raimi, whose last film was "Army of Darkness" with Bruce Campbell. 
"I feel like a kid trying to hang onto a kite." 
</P>
<P>
 And the terms of this interview suggest a persistent uneasiness: two lunch 
meetings of approximately 30 minutes each and whatever other casual 
conversations on the set he is prone to. That's it. No dinner, no drinks, no 
rides in the limo. Not even a follow-up phone call. "Gene is the kind of guy 
who thinks a 10-minute conversation is too long," says Dick Guttman, the 
actor's publicist for nearly 25 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, privacy is what Hackman craves, whether on a film set or at home in 
Santa Fe, a modest two-bedroom adobe he restored himself that he shares with 
his second wife, Betsy Arakawa, a former classical pianist. He is selfish, he 
says, with his time. He doesn't see many people, mostly just his grown 
children, his son and two younger daughters, Leslie and Elizabeth, and he likes 
enclosed spaces, reading for six hours straight in his living room, hunkering 
down in a race car or the cockpit of an airplane. "He's not your basic 
extrovert," observes Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackman can be abrupt, given to awkward silences. Although he is courteous and 
not unkind, it is difficult to spend any time with him without feeling his 
impatience. Forget small talk; he is pained by attempts at false intimacy. Even 
obvious questions, like why so many Westerns now, are greeted with a sigh -- 
"Who cares anyway?" -- that devolves into laughter, not derisive exactly, but a 
pointed reaction to the silliness of trying to rope some larger meaning out of 
his life now. He doesn't care, he says, about his professional ups and downs, 
his reputation for being difficult or about being liked for his knotty, 
problematic characters. "I don't care if (a guy) is sympathetic or not, that's 
not important to me," he says, sounding almost angry. "I want to make you 
believe this could be a human being."  
</P>
<P>
 He says this, his eyes registering impatience, boredom and sorrow. For all his 
success and visibility, Hackman seems plucked from a John Cheever short story, 
a former star athlete resigned to a life of commuter timetables, alimony 
payments and golf outings. His real life exists just out of reach, in memory or 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 MID-DECEMBER ON THE HIGH DESERT JUST EAST of Tucson, the wind can really kick 
up, enough to drive cast and crew of "The Quick and the Dead" to don hats and 
parkas and transform the set's main street into a bitter, snowless winter 
resort. Not exactly ideal conditions for the complicated series of shots Raimi 
wants to get this day -- tricky, tilted close-ups of Hackman and DiCaprio 
drawing their guns, shots that require a special camera and motorized dolly and 
what seems like endless technical adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something Hitchcock used, and it will either be really cool, or they'll 
kick me out of the Directors Guild," says Raimi, scanning his storyboards. He 
has already shot several frames of Hackman, formally outfitted in boots, 
topcoat, silk tie and an enormous felt hat, drawing his ebony-and-gold-handled 
revolver. But actor and director are unhappy with the gun's position in the 
shot. "I'm going over to shoot a bit," says Hackman, turning from the camera 
and heading across the street.  
</P>
<P>
 Thell Reed, a champion quick-draw marksman and consultant on the film, is 
already putting DiCaprio through a few practice rounds beyond the corral when 
Hackman strides up, spurs jangling. "Hey, I want to check Gene out," says his 
slender 19-year-old co-star, pushing his corn-silk-colored hair out of his 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackman faces the distant mountains, plants his feet and squeezes off a few 
rounds, yanking his gun from the holster with a practiced thrust of his hips.  
</P>
<P>
 "When did you first start quick-drawing?" asks DiCaprio, squinting up at 
Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 "But you did it in 'Unforgiven,' right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I just drew that one time. There wasn't even anybody on the set."  
</P>
<P>
 Hackman fires in silence for several minutes, the shots echoing across the 
vast plateau. After the round, he probes Reed about cavalry draws, butt-forward 
twist draws, fancy stuff. Hackman's shots clock in at 35 hundredths of a 
second. "The fastest on film," says Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackman lets the remark pass, but the implication lingers in the stillness, 
that more than 20 years after "The French Connection," he has returned, in some 
measure, to the kind of violent films that first brought him prominence, the 
kind he wasn't going to make anymore. Because of his kids, or maybe it was his 
agent's advice, he says, he turned down the Hannibal Lecter role in "Silence of 
the Lambs," and when Eastwood came calling with "Unforgiven," he initially 
refused. "(His agents) didn't want him to do it," says Eastwood, "but I needed 
Gene because he can make an unsympathetic character sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hackman, taking a role has to do solely with the inherent acting 
challenges. "When I read a script and I think there is no way I can make it 
come alive, I don't do it," he says simply. He is famous for crossing off stage 
directions, finding his own ways to bring angry, inarticulate guys to life. He 
almost quit "The French Connection" because he couldn't figure out how to play 
the rage of a New York City narcotics cop. Now, on "The Quick and the Dead," he 
is playing an almost abstract portrait of evil for the sheer pleasure of being 
able to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look for something that isn't written down, some behavioral kind of 
business that my character can relate to and makes him emotionally accessible 
to the audience," he says. Oh yeah, he adds, and you have to be relaxed about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY , EMOTIONAL ACCESSIBILITY , RELAXATION , THESE ARE the 
buzzwords of a Method-trained actor. A disciple of the fabled Stanislavsky 
technique, Hackman as a young acting student would stand on Manhattan street 
corners with Hoffman and Duvall and argue technique. "We'd get into these huge 
fights about whose acting teacher was more right," recalls Hoffman. "Gene was 
always quite stubborn about what was acting and what wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 He was adamant because, after a frustrating year trying to master the 
by-the-numbers approach taught at the Pasadena Playhouse, he had blossomed 
under George Morrison, an alumnus of the Lee Strasberg Actors Studio in New 
York.  
</P>
<P>
 "Gene is a brilliant character actor," says Morrison, who currently teaches at 
his own school, the New Actors Workshop in Manhattan. "But when he first came 
to me, he was in that insecure place. He had virtually no education, couldn't 
pronounce a lot of words, and he was a little cowed by people." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison helped Hackman discover the usual Method tools. But his breakthrough 
didn't come, he says, until Hackman began to work in improvisational theater 
and Off-Broadway comedies in the early 1960s. "That's when he learned to use 
his own energy." By the time Hackman appeared with Sandy Dennis in the 1964 
Broadway comedy hit "Any Wednesday," he had become a star, eliciting Walter 
Kerr's famous line about his "wonderfully light-footed habit of stepping off a 
joke before it begins to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 His transition to tough-guy roles came later, in his first films, including 
"Lilith," where he met Beatty. Then came "The French Connection," a film that 
frightened Hackman, according to Morrison, "because he was afraid of playing 
his own anger." Sticking with the role, playing through his fears and 
subsequently winning the Oscar, Morrison says, "was the turning point for 
Gene." Hackman, he adds, is now "way beyond technique." The only classroom 
habit he consciously retains: "Before every shot, Gene sits in a chair and 
relaxes like he has done a thousand times before." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Hackman puts it now, having finished gun practice, "I guess I better 
get back there and concentrate a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the set, Hackman resumes his place in front of the camera. He is 
supposed to be squaring off in a gunfight with DiCaprio, who plays his son, but 
the younger actor is not in the shot, and Hackman, his face a mask, stares at a 
sea of milling crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 For several minutes, Raimi shoots take after take as Hackman scowls and draws, 
again and again. "This is unusually technical, a lot of waiting around for 
minuscule things to happen," says Hackman during a break. He is clearly 
frustrated by the day's hurry-up-and-wait pace, but the delay seems to loosen 
something in him. While Raimi huddles with his crew, Hackman stands off to one 
side, breathing lightly, his leather boots squeaking as he shifts in the wind. 
He is almost conspiratorial, whispering even, as the conversation becomes, for 
a few moments, intimate. "Most people think acting is doing something overt, 
but that isn't necessarily true," he says. "If you can make a character 
understandable, audiences perceive that as acting. To give you a for-instance, 
I might do a transference to my own son at a time when I was upset with him, so 
that would be a real thought of mine instead of some idea I had about the 
character.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a big emotional bank," he adds softly. "I think it's difficult 
for men; their emotions have more layers on them, so they're harder to get to." 
</P>
<P>
 He likes to keep his distance from other cast members. "I think it's better to 
stay alone or at arm's length. You're more apt to be easy with someone if 
they're a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for directors, he says. While he prefers to work with men of his 
own age and experience -- Pollack, Eastwood and Arthur Penn, who directed him 
in "Bonnie and Clyde" -- he says the relationship is never wholly comfortable 
for him. "I'm a funny guy," he says, chuckling softly. "I didn't have much of a 
dad, so directors are always authority figures to me." Even when they are, like 
Raimi, about his son's age? His chuckle deepens. "I always have a little 
suspicion about them. It's sick, but. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 "Gene?" Hackman is summoned back to the camera. Instinctively, he reaches up 
to adjust the brim of his hat. "You have to have a certain amount of ego in 
filmmaking because the camera will pick up a lack of energy quicker than almost 
anything. You have to get in front of the camera and think that it's all about 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 He gazes out at the crew, his face tightening, his eyes distant. "If you've 
done that, it's really hard to shift gears and be a decent person. Sometimes 
you just don't bother." 
</P>
<P>
 BECAUSE HE IS SO TALL AND STILL MOVES WITH THE ATHLETIC GRACE OF his Marine 
days, Hackman tends to walk on ahead. On the set, you can spot him striding 
along, either alone or with somebody dogtrotting along trying to keep up. You 
see a lot of his back, like now, when he leaps up the tiny aluminum steps into 
his trailer, some 35 minutes from being sprung for the weekend. When he emerges 
from the trailer bedroom a few moments later, Hackman is dressed in his own 
clothes, casual trousers and V-neck sweater with a logo from the Gleneagles 
resort in Scotland where he recently played in a celebrity golf tournament. He 
seems embarrassed by this admission, that even his hobbies are the source of 
scrutiny. But in his pastel-hued sportswear, he seems older, less exotic, less 
able to hide behind his film persona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played all the normal things in high school, football, track, basketball," 
he says, adding that in a lot of ways he takes after his mother's side of the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taller than his father, for one thing. And while they shared the same 
name, Hackman was known back in Danville as Gene Allen to distinguish him from 
his father, the first Eugene Hackman, a pressman at the local paper. Hackmans 
had staffed the Commercial News for generations; his uncle and grandfather had 
been reporters, but his father didn't carry that kind of rank. He worked the 
machinery in the back room, the hot lead needed to make the plates. "My Dad 
dropped out of school in the fourth grade or something like that," says 
Hackman. "He wasn't very well educated." 
</P>
<P>
 Danville was then a central Illinois border town of front porches, local 
factories and neighboring farms. But even by those modest standards, the 
Hackman household was a poor one. The family lived with Hackman's maternal 
grandmother. There were fights, he has said, among all the adults, and his 
father often took after him with his fists. Hackman spent a lot of time in the 
basement, trying to find some space for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would make up this little cardboard room that would be all contained and 
cozy," he says. "I had a little telephone system setup with a can and a string 
pulled taut with the guy across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturdays, he escaped to the movies, entranced by the serials and actors like 
Errol Flynn and James Cagney. He identified so strongly with what he saw on 
screen that he was shocked to see his own face in the mirrored lobby. "I would 
see this kid there. I would be so stunned," he recalls, "because I really felt 
I could do what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 If he treasured any dream of becoming an actor then, it would be a long time 
in coming, years in which Hackman would join the Marines, nearly cripple 
himself in a motorcycle accident, bounce around the country on the GI Bill and 
try his hand at various jobs -- radio announcer, TV cameraman. He even studied 
painting for a while in New York. Much of it now seems like a long, anguished 
prelude to the career that would eventually channel his restlessness, his 
anger, into art -- anger that crystallized when Hackman was barely a teen-ager, 
on the day his father drove by him as he was playing, gave him an odd little 
wave and never came back until after Hackman himself had left home at 16 to 
join the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mean to belabor that," Hackman says now, "but it was just a very 
vivid memory of him." His father had left behind a wife with a drinking problem 
and two sons, 13-year-old Gene and 6-week-old Richard. "Acting," says Hackman, 
promised the means "of finding some way to get this thing inside me out, 
whatever it was, or is, if it's art or energy or whatever. That's all I ever 
thought about and to some degree still do." 
</P>
<P>
 He won't say it, but that anger has served as his artistic ballast. He was 
busted in the Marines for fighting, a practice that continued to dog him years 
later when he was getting acting jobs in New York and working part time as a 
mover, hauling refrigerators strapped to his back up six flights of tenement 
stairs to support his first wife, Fay Maltese, and his baby son.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'd go see a movie, get some dinner, and then Gene would stand on a corner 
and say, 'I gotta go,' " says Hoffman. "He had to get in a fight. He'd go into 
some bar, and the next day I'd see him like nothing had happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when he was a successful movie star living in a succession of big 
houses in Los Angeles, he took up expensive, risky hobbies -- racing cars, 
flying airplanes. And like that kid in the basement, he would still withdraw. 
He took a two-year hiatus, moved to Monterey and painted in earnest after 
lackluster commercial receptions to "The Conversation" and "Scarecrow." Once, 
when his father, who had moved to Los Angeles and kept in infrequent touch with 
his son, rode a motorcycle to Carmel to see him on the set of "Zandy's Bride," 
Hackman never once spoke to him, never came out of his trailer.  
</P>
<P>
 There were even worse times. The suicide of Norman Garey, his lawyer and 
closest friend. His own divorce, a long time brewing. The death of his mother 
in a fire in 1972, set accidentally by her own hand. She died an alcoholic in 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Hackman will only speak about his children, the guilt of having worked so 
much and so far from home all those years. "That was selfish and unfair," he 
says. "But at this point there is nothing I can do about that." About the rest 
of it, his mother and father, his divorce, he is silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene's dealt with some of his past," says one longtime friend. "But not all 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those close to him think Hackman has finally found in his career a 
measure of peace, not only as an actor and an artist but also as a man who has 
unconsciously replicated his father's own peripatetic life. "Acting," says 
Morrison, "is Gene's way of being with others and yet still being alone." 
</P>
<P>
 That may explain Hackman's ambivalence about working as much as he does. 
"We're trained as actors, and maybe that's what we should think in terms of, 
that there is no retirement," he says. "But I really think it's time for me to 
stop. Films take so much out of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Hackman lets his voice trail off. It is near the end of the last lunch 
conversation he has agreed to. When he confesses he wants to get his hands on a 
"serious sailboat," it doesn't come as much of a surprise. Just so long as 
there is no crew. He did that once, on his first boat, a trip to the Bahamas. 
"The crew was sitting around drinking beer and having a great time," he says. 
"They were nice guys and all that, but it was not what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 So he will go alone, and you can picture Hackman that way: a solitary figure 
on his deck, content finally, unreachable.

 Great moments in Oscars music: 
</P>
<P>
 1974 -- Connie Stevens turns Paul McCartney's "Live and Let Die" into a 
C-grade Vegas lounge number, slinking around the stage amid explosions and 
flashes. 
</P>
<P>
 1985 -- While Phil Collins does a slow burn in the audience, actress Ann 
Reinking performs his song, "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)." 
Collins, who had specially planned a trip from England to be available for the 
show, was never asked to perform it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 1989 -- The crowing glory, as Rob Lowe -- that noted song and dance man -- 
duets with Snow White, leaving the attendees too stunned to show their true 
appreciation for what they'd just seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, there aren't likely to be any such scenes for the ages on Monday's 1994 
Oscar show. Instead, we're stuck with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Neil 
Young, Tony Bennett, Janet Jackson and a duet of Dolly Parton and James Ingram. 
At least Parton and Jackson have acting experience, so maybe one of them can 
bring us something to treasure alongside those earlier highlights. But it seems 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 All kidding aside, this telecast may prove low on corn and cheese, but it's 
arguably the meatiest musical menu in Oscar history. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask some in the movie music business, and watch the claws come out:  
</P>
<P>
 "No Disney film," is the summary judgment of one executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, though, the consensus seems to be simple: Bruce Springsteen and 
Neil Young, who will be performing, respectively, "Streets of Philadelphia" and 
"Philadelphia," the haunting musical bookends of Jonathan Demme's AIDS drama, 
"Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Tisha Fein, who for 20 years has produced and booked musical talent for many 
awards shows, including the Grammys and the American Music Awards, believes the 
presence of Springsteen and Young to be part of a positive trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "These artists were really affected by the material of the film, so they were 
inspired to do their best work," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Brunman, who as vice president of Epic Soundtrax helped supervise the 
"Philadelphia" soundtrack project, concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce's and Neil's songs are part of the body of the movie, not just 
closing-credit songs that were created primarily as marketing tools," he says. 
"They were really created to express the emotions of the movie in music, and I 
don't think that was lost on (the Oscar voters). And the songs really mean 
something to the artists -- they were the first two to say they would be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But they wouldn't be there if they hadn't been asked -- something that might 
not have happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The directors and producers of the show must be hipper than before," says Jim 
Mulay, vice president of creative affairs for Largo Entertainment, which made 
1993's "Judgment Night," featuring a (not nominated) soundtrack album pairing 
hard-rock stars with top rappers. "And the music part of the academy is 
probably becoming younger." 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe the Oscar folks have learned from their past embarrassments. Now if 
only that would happen with the Grammys.

 Ask members of the Costume Designers Guild about this year's Oscar nominees 
for the top costume design award and get ready to get an earful.  
</P>
<P>
 None of the five nominees is an American, or even a member of the guild. In 
fact, an American hasn't won the costume Oscar since Albert Wolsky did for 
"Bugsy" in 1991. And before that, it was Wolsky for "All That Jazz" a decade 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely is a picture set in contemporary times -- "Sleepless in Seattle," say, 
or "Indecent Proposal" -- nominated. Most nominees have traditionally been for 
period films, particularly this year: Italy's Gabriella Pescucci for "The Age 
of Innocence"; Australia's Janet Patterson, "The Piano"; and, from Britain, 
Sandy Powell, "Orlando"; Jenny Beven and John Bright, "The Remains of the Day," 
and Anna Biedrzycka-Sheppard, "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 It is "The Age of Innocence" nominee in particular that has annoyed some 
costume guild members. Says one, "If ever there was an American story it was 
'Age of Innocence' by Edith Wharton, the most American writer. It took place in 
New York, for Pete's sake, but (director Martin) Scorsese taps an Italian to 
design the piece!" Most American designers, she says, would have loved to have 
worked on that project, "which takes nothing away from Pescucci or her 
incredibly beautiful work." Pescucci, several guild members say, is favored to 
win the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, says designer Jane Ruhm, is that the best period costume pieces 
are generally found in European rentals. For pictures with sweeping ballroom 
scenes like "The Age of Innocence," most of the costumes have to be rented, 
with the designer concentrating primarily on creating new period attire for 
only the films' stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a misconception," counters designer Shelley Kamarov, who designed 
costumes for last year's "Lost in Yonkers." "A lot of people think Americans 
don't have enough costumes, that we only have enough for Westerns. But that is 
not true." (Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" did not have a costume designer, but 
a wardrobe built largely from rentals, says guild executive Sandy Jordan.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Kamarov, Ruhm and veterans like Wolsky and Elois Jenssen are not surprised 
that the nod generally goes to period pictures. The perception, particularly by 
the public, is that designers just borrow clothes off a store rack for films 
set in modern times. That is not necessarily the case. 
</P>
<P>
 What a character does for a living, his personality, his mood that is set by 
the color palette of their costumes -- all are factors in the design. 
</P>
<P>
 "Designers nominate designers for the awards and, like everybody else, they 
get caught up in the momentum of whatever is the most popular pictures at the 
moment," says Jenssen, who won an Oscar for "Samson and Delilah" in 1951. She 
was also nominated for "Tron" in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "With modern clothes, you don't notice them. The premise of good costume 
design is that costumes help the actor or actress make the character 
believable," says Jenssen. "While many designers are disappointed that some 
contemporary films never get the attention they deserved, they are more upset 
that the Americans were totally ignored this year. And that's pretty bad, when 
you consider that labor laws in other countries won't allow Americans to come 
there and design a picture. It simply isn't fair."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS 
ISSUE; FOR PRESENTERS, GREAT EXPOSURE, LOUSY PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Cruise may command $12 million per picture, but he has to work for free at 
the Oscars. Same for Sharon Stone. Ditto Clint Eastwood and Geena Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's one occasion where the "talent" can't -- and shouldn't -- expect 
their usual high fees, it's acting as a presenter on the annual Academy Awards 
show. The gig doesn't pay a red cent. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Cates, in his fifth year as director of the telecast, isn't kidding when 
he says: "Anyone naive enough not to know (it doesn't pay) would not be of 
sufficient stature to get on the show in the first place."  
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean his office doesn't have to address such an issue -- plus a 
myriad of others. The most common query is "What about me ?" and "What about my 
client?"  
</P>
<P>
 While the competition to be a presenter -- there are less than 40 slots 
available -- is intense, it's not because of the star perks. 
</P>
<P>
 The most the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offers, in fact, is 
limousine service, occasionally airfare to out-of-town presenters, and loaner 
gowns for the women. Otherwise, the locals are pretty much on their own -- two 
tickets to the show and Governors Ball included, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Cates insists, "Believe me when I tell you many more people call 
us than we call them." 
</P>
<P>
 No adage is more appropriate than "you can't buy this kind of publicity" when 
it comes to the Oscars. The telecast reaches an estimated 1 billion people in 
95 countries via satellite, a technical achievement only a network like ABC 
could handle (or afford). 
</P>
<P>
 And the jockeying for whom the Oscar show producers go after as presenters is 
one of the great untold behind-the-scene stories in Hollywood. What starts as 
Cates' initial "wish list," posted on a large bulletin board in the production 
office, ends up to be something else indeed by showtime. 
</P>
<P>
 In a cyclical business, the most oft-quoted reason for declining is that one 
is out of town working . Otherwise, agents and publicists would argue, only a 
fool wouldn't say "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 There are also the rare dropouts and, occasionally, last-minute substitutions 
and pinch-hitters, as happened when Charlton Heston got a flat tire on the 
freeway a few years ago and Eastwood nimbly stepped in to read Heston's Moses 
jokes on the TelePrompTer (to some laughter) before Heston bounded on stage 
mid-speech (to more laughter). 
</P>
<P>
 Those picked to walk down the red carpet into the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
all dolled up for their big scripted televised moments need to satisfy at least 
one of three requirements, Cates said. They must be stars who can help generate 
good ratings (celebs, in other words), newsworthy types who have won in the 
past or may win that night and, for the women, those who are sure to make some 
kind of fashion statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The statuesque Davis, known for her flamboyant and revealing outfits, for 
example, seems to have replaced Cher, known for her outrageous scanty numbers. 
Davis handed out the costume design award last year.  
</P>
<P>
 There's also the nod to political correctness -- Hollywood-style. Cates said 
that the producers try to satisfy age, race and sex quotas (not an easy feat in 
a white- male-dominated business) while attempting to mix and match presenters 
who work well as a team, though he himself would rather see just one person at 
a time at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to avoid the embarrassment of two people who don't know each other 
well trying to make small talk," he said. Two days of rehearsals the weekend 
before, apparently, isn't time enough to get acquainted. 
</P>
<P>
 The really big names get to appear solo to hand out the big awards like best 
picture and best screenplay. Up-and-comers often get technical duty. 
</P>
<P>
 One perk that Cates says definitely is not included in the gig is political 
grandstanding -- some antics of previous presenters notwithstanding. Last year, 
of course, several presenters ignored that dictum, including Tim Robbins and 
Susan Sarandon, who championed the case of HIV-positive Haitian refugees, and 
Richard Gere, who asked the viewing audience to beam good thoughts on behalf of 
the people of Tibet. None of them are presenting this year.

<P>
 Menswear designers have long licensed large corporations to produce 
accessories and moderately priced clothing bearing their names.Secondary lines, 
or fashions created by the designers' own in-house teams, are a more recent 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 With more direct input in these alternative lines, designers now bring 
elements of inventive, high-end fashion within reach of a younger, slightly 
less affluent customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers' collections will always set the pace, but this spring, secondary 
lines also provide some of the best styles of the season -- loosely woven 
sweaters, drawstring pants, vintage and workwear looks.

STYLE; LOINCLOTHS AND TUNICS AND SKIRTS? OH MY! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In my dream, Gauguin lies on a beach in French Polynesia, slurping breadfruit 
stew from a wooden bowl. I am standing at the ocean's edge, bright and 
one-dimensional, wearing a cloth skirt like those islanders in his paintings. I 
am free.  
</P>
<P>
 Recent television snippets and photographs in slick fashion magazines have 
caught my eye. Designers are pushing the skirted look for men. Jean-Paul 
Gaultier parades his long kilts with matching jackets. Donna Karan drapes her 
male models in paisley sarongs. You get the idea that Paris is swirling in 
every conceivable style of pareo , tunic and redingote. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, at a museum opening not so long ago, Anthony Kiedis of the Red 
Hot Chili Peppers stormed the room in a prairie skirt and Doc Martens, chatting 
with painter Robert Williams about the aesthetic depiction of women's breasts. 
He was cool. Defiant. An MTV commando. 
</P>
<P>
 But rock stars and haute couture have little to do with the real world, which 
is fortunate in so many respects. And for those of us without a hit record and 
adoring fans, the prospect of wearing a skirt is fraught with peril. 
</P>
<P>
 When I envision myself sporting a tropical wrap at, say, the Glendale 
Galleria, panic bubbles from deep in my cultural wellspring, dredging up with 
it the sludge of convention and traditional views of masculinity. I worry about 
how others will regard me. Lights flash. Sirens blare. I am haunted by visions 
of RuPaul. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if Gaultier ran a 30-second spot during Dodger games, between the ads 
for hot dogs and gasoline, guys like me would feel comfortable with hemlines. 
It worked for Dockers and ice beer. 
</P>
<P>
 But more practical considerations arise. What should I wear under my skirt?  
</P>
<P>
 Pantyhose are out of the question. I'm not even sure why women wear them. Same 
with high heels. Still, I'd have to learn to cross my legs. And there's the 
prospect of shopping. Until Nordstrom stocks its men's section with sarongs, we 
are left to pick through the big girls' rack. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more troubling, many skirts lack an essential ingredient in the male 
experience -- pockets. Nowhere to keep a wallet or car keys, nowhere to shove 
my hands. Now I am entering the domain of the purse, which is so much more than 
I had bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding, says a friend. She insists the most liberating thing women ever 
did was to start wearing pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I have this dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade winds blow to the beat of Tahitian log drums. I am tan and serene, my 
lava-lava rustling against my legs. I have that faraway look in my eyes. 
Anthony Kiedis is there, too, chatting with Gauguin about the aesthetic 
depiction of women's breasts. DAVID WHARTON

RESTAURANTS; COUNTRY AIRS; RUSTICA BRINGS A LITTLE BIT OF TUSCANY TO BEVERLY 
HILLS. BUT MAYBE NOT ENOUGH.

<P>
 It hasn't been easy getting across town at midday, and we're late for our 
lunch at Rustica, a new restaurant in Beverly Hills. Before we can get a good 
look at the dark, cool room, the athletic young hostess snatches up two menus 
and disappears at a power walker's pace down a long hall. We rush to follow, 
glimpsing a polished bar and a private room along the way. The garden room at 
the back is awash in sunlight. The day is warm. The potted lemons outside press 
their scent against the panes of glass. I'm half in sun, half in shade, and a 
cool breeze sweeps across the starched tablecloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon we're smearing a delicious rough paste of sun-dried tomatoes and olives 
on country bread, staining it the color of old roof tiles in Tuscany. Rustica, 
of course, is Italian for rustic, "of or pertaining to the simple country life" 
-- as the restaurant defines it -- which here includes tropical banana trees 
and feathery palms in terra-cotta pots and a white canvas market umbrella 
unfurled beneath the skylight. An enormous mirror framed in dark iron and 
oversized landscape paintings evoke the look of a raffish old villa. 
</P>
<P>
 We start with Rustica's refreshing chopped vegetable salad, a tall mound of 
sweet corn, radicchio, celery and carrots nicely dressed with balsamic vinegar 
and shavings of good Parmigiano. Linguini with wild mushrooms (really 
cultivated shiitake , oyster and crimini mushrooms) and shreds of radicchio are 
weighted down with too much cream, too much sauce. Saffron tortellini have a 
sticky-sweet potato filling, a strange contrast to the sauce of spinach leaves, 
capers, rosemary and watery tomatoes. Both pastas are too richly baroque to be 
really country. However, the free-range chicken breast with a lemon-lime butter 
and the swordfish topped with balsamic-infused tomatoes and shallots are 
beautifully grilled, presented with an array of almost painterly vegetables: 
very green snow peas, miniature carrots and turnips, and either tiny steamed 
red potatoes or glossy sauteed spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, Rustica becomes a very romantic restaurant. The corners are 
shadowed. The light is soft and mysterious. Tables are set comfortably apart, 
and it's quiet enough for murmured conversation. Swags of cloth sway across the 
walls. A series of alluring black-and-white pastel drawings are hung in the 
spaces between intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 To start, we order the house-cured salmon, a lovely plate of salmon paired 
with potatoes, creme fraiche and golden caviar and a good salad of arugula, 
baby spinach and radicchio. But it's the pizza that's a delicious surprise, 
topped with slices of fresh tomato and wild mushroom, three kinds of cheese 
(fontina, mozzarella and feta) and ribbons of basil.  
</P>
<P>
 Entrees are mostly grilled. Whatever it is -- Alaskan salmon, rack of lamb, 
free-range veal chop -- it comes out right. The red-wine-based sauces with 
several entrees taste remarkably similar, which wouldn't necessarily be a 
problem if they were more exciting. And every plate gets a similar array of 
vegetables. One may have mashed potatoes, another steamed potatoes, but all 
have the by-now-familiar snow peas, miniature carrots and turnips. I'm all for 
seeing more vegetables served with protein-rich entrees, but give us real 
vegetables, not these tasteless examples.  
</P>
<P>
 The grilled New York sirloin comes sliced and accompanied with a towering heap 
of crisp shoestring potatoes. The Maine lobster, cut in half live, I'm assured, 
is grilled and broiled in the shell and moistened with a mildly spicy tomato 
curry. Its sweet-potato "hay" turns out to be wonderful sweet-potato 
shoestrings, piled so high it's hard to find the halved lobster beneath.  
</P>
<P>
 The Valrhona chocolate torte, with hazelnut anglaise and squiggles of dark 
chocolate, is perhaps the best of the desserts here. (Valrhona is a superb dark 
chocolate from France.) The diced, spiced pear in the creme brulee succeeded 
only in making the cream watery. They had to have tiramisu, I suppose, but with 
Kahlua sauce? A plate of biscotti and fruit would be perfect, and perfectly 
Italian, served with vin santo (a Tuscan dessert wine), but the only vin santo 
available is by the bottle ($37), not by the glass. At that price, you may want 
to forgo dipping the hard cookies in the sweet wine. The one dessert that has 
both looks and taste is the mauve frozen plum mousse flanked with apricot 
coulis.  
</P>
<P>
 The food at Rustica is pleasant enough and handsomely presented. What it lacks 
is verve and imagination, and at these prices, it should have both. The 
restaurant is only a few months old and may be proceeding cautiously. My hope 
is that chef John Beriker, who owns the restaurant with his brothers, James and 
Timur, will soon venture beyond this restricted vocabulary of dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rustica, 435 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills; (310) 247-9331. Open Monday 
through Friday for lunch, nightly for dinner. Full bar. Lot and street parking; 
valet parking at dinner. Major credit cards accepted. Lunch for two, food only, 
$43-$71. Dinner for two, food only, $60-$100.

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Berger 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catching your eye first is the number of wines -- more than 150 selections at 
prices that are not unreasonable (considering Rustica's high-rent district). 
Another good idea: the dozen wines by the glass, most priced at one-fourth the 
bottle cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Best wines for the well-seasoned food here are 1991 Phelps Grenache Rose, $19; 
1992 Thomas Fogarty Gewurztraminer, $18; 1992 Frog's Leap Sauvignon Blanc, $19, 
and 1991 Ridge Zinfandel "Geyserville," $29. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as with all new restaurants in the shakeout phase, some things come 
off only with a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, at a restaurant that features rustic (i.e., hearty) food, I'd 
have liked more Zinfandels. Also, there are no red Rhone wines, no Beaujolais, 
no Alsatian whites, no Oregon Pinot Gris, no Loire Valley reds -- the sorts of 
wines that go best with rustic foods. In fact, the Conterno Barbera we ordered, 
which would have been great with the food here, was temporarily out of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Versatility was lacking. A third of the list (56 wines) is composed of 
Bordeaux-type wines from France or California; another 37 wines are 
Chardonnays. This isn't very interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, vintages are not always as listed, though to be fair, the list 
changes frequently and the staff alerts patrons when a vintage is different 
from what's printed. Dan Berger

STAGE WATCH: TAPER TURNS INTO A CHEKHOVIAN ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mark Taper Forum will sport a new look for Chekhov's "The Wood Demon," 
April 7 through May 22. And the cast itself will look different at virtually 
every performance. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time ever, the Taper will become an arena stage. Two rows of 
seats from front and center will be moved to the other side of the stage and 
backed up by a bank of 100 new seats, increasing total capacity to 850. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Ahmanson Theatre renovation next door, the changes at the Taper 
won't cost much. And they potentially could increase Taper revenues, should the 
show sell out in its enlarged configuration. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reason for going in-the-round has nothing to do with revenues, said 
artistic director Gordon Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer D Martyn Bookwalter had the idea to stage the play in the round for a 
1992 workshop production at Taper, Too. "It's a good way to get closer to the 
characters and the words," said Bookwalter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the round, added Davidson, "the actors are allowed to be three-dimensional. 
You can focus on the human interaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't this be true for any number of plays? Not for farces or Beckett's 
"Happy Days," Davidson said. The Taper won't become a permanent arena stage. 
But "if it has enough pluses and we can pick and choose which plays" to put in 
the round, "we'll find a way" to do it more often, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One potential problem with arena staging is that bad blocking can conceal 
crucial moments from the view of many in the audience. Davidson expressed his 
faith in director Frank Dwyer and pointed out that not everyone can always see 
every actor's face in the Taper's regular configuration, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookwalter added that his set design required particularly low-lying period 
furniture, "so you can see over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Taper subscribers who normally sit in the first two rows received a letter 
explaining that they will find their usual seats on the other side of the stage 
during "Demon." Audience development director Robert Schlosser said that he 
hopes they won't "wander in unknowingly and sit on someone's lap." 
</P>
<P>
 Taper officials hope that some people will want to see "The Wood Demon" twice 
-- and not just so they can see it from a different angle, but also so they can 
see it with a different cast. 
</P>
<P>
 From a company of 20, three actors have been assigned to each of the 15 roles. 
Five or six of these roles will be shared equally by two actors, with the third 
actor serving as a traditional understudy. For most of the rest of the roles, 
one "principal alternate" will do most of the performances, but another 
"guaranteed alternate" is guaranteed at least one week of performances, while 
the third actor will, again, be the understudy. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds complicated. But Dakin Matthews, manager of the Antaeus Company, 
which put together the production, said the plan enables cast members to take 
time off for more lucrative film and TV jobs and attracts better actors to the 
secondary roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The casting structure is similar to that at the Matrix Theatre -- and five of 
the actors were in the Matrix's production of "The Tavern." But the "Demon" 
actors are paid Actors' Equity scale, in contrast to much lower payments at the 
Matrix, which operates on Equity's 99-Seat Theater Plan. The unusual casting 
won't burden the Taper budget, Matthews said -- because actors who share the 
major roles make less than they would in a conventional production. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan may become ticklish when it's decided who will perform on April 6 -- 
when most of the critics are there. Davidson will make that decision, said 
Matthews. "Of course there will be some disappointment," he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the casts for the first 13 previews have been planned, and none is 
identical to another. The day's cast list will be printed separately for each 
performance.

ON THE RECORD: UPDATING PAIR OF LEGENDS: CASALS AND RUBINSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our most prolific labels, Sony and RCA, have devoted a good deal of recent 
activity to restoring to circulation their catalogues of the recordings of 
cellist and sometime conductor Pablo Casals (Sony) and pianist Artur Rubinstein 
(RCA), both of whom lived and recorded into ripe old age. 
</P>
<P>
 The Casals tribute consists of 11 separate, mid-priced volumes of material 
originating at the festivals Casals directed during the early 1950s at Prades 
and Perpignan in France, near the border of his native Spain, from which he 
remained in self-imposed exile to protest the dictatorial regime of Francisco 
Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 These are all-star affairs, gathering together some of the biggest names of 
the time in music dear to the heart of Don Pablo. Casals, then in his mid-70s, 
participates in all performances, occasionally as conductor but most often 
doing what he did best, playing the cello inspiritingly, unaffectedly and with 
tremendous gusto -- if hardly, at this late stage of his career, with elegance 
of tone or the most reliable intonation. 
</P>
<P>
 The artistic offenses are numerous here, but they are rarely Casals' doing. 
The principal villain is the late violinist Alexander Schneider, who feels 
impelled to load virtually every other phrase with line-destroying rubatos and 
Luftpausen , to most ill effect in the great Schubert Trios (B-flat, 58989, and 
E-flat, 58988). Casals is the cellist in both, with pianists Eugene Istomin 
(who brings his own set of distorting quirks) and, contrastingly, penny-plain 
Mieczyslaw Horszowski. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a hero besides Casals in this series, it's Isaac Stern, exhibiting 
the extraordinary musicianship so often overshadowed and overlooked in the face 
of his technical prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Stern, as first violinist, who brings the propulsive power to the 
series' highlights: the gruff, hugely dramatic reading of Schubert's String 
Quintet in C (58992) and a darkly affectionate Brahms Sextet in B-flat (58994). 
</P>
<P>
 Stern also shows that he was a Mozart stylist of rare and, for his time, 
perhaps unique insight with his solo in the Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364, in 
which he is ably partnered by violist William Primrose but struggles vainly to 
get the lead out of Casals' baton. The coupling is a small-scaled, 
intonationally sour Mozart A-major Concerto by violinist Erica Morini (58983). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bach program (58982) is musicologically primitive even for the early 
1950s, and the Mozart piano concertos and Beethoven trios had best been left on 
the shelf. But there's compensation in the glowing, still remarkably 
fresh-sounding set of Beethoven Cello Sonatas (58985, 2 CDs) that find Casals 
at his most communicative and energetic -- that great, growling tone under 
control most of the time -- in no small part due to the fiery partnership of 
pianist Rudolf Serkin, in one of his most memorable recorded outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1953 performance of the Schumann Cello Concerto, with Eugene Ormandy the 
helpful conductor, is usually remembered for the wrong reason, the huge groan 
Casals emits just before his solo entry. What comes after that groan is not one 
of the work's more refined interpretations, but for long stretches one that 
projects an unblushingly broad lyricism recalling not only a younger Casals but 
an entire, long-gone era of grandly expressive virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 The coupling, however, is another dud: Schumann's Trio in D minor, with 
Horszowski's playing at its most recessive, Schneider doing his baleful thing, 
and Casals' cello sounding rather like a mistuned double-bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Outstanding among recent reissues of 1950s and '60s recordings by Artur 
Rubinstein in RCA Victor's mid-priced Gold Seal series are three Beethoven 
sonatas -- the Sonata in G, Opus 30; No. 3, the "Spring," and "Kreutzer" -- in 
which the exuberant pianist and the patrician violinist Henryk Szeryng were 
able to find a richly satisfying interpretive middle ground (61861). 
</P>
<P>
 A mostly Liszt program dating from the early 1950s is also pure pleasure, 
highlighted by a "Mephisto Waltz" as curvaceous as it is diabolically driven, a 
sensuously elegant "Valse oubliee," and the most ripsnorting Hungarian Rhapsody 
No. 12 imaginable (61860).

 ELLA FITZGERALD 
</P>
<P>
 "Pure Ella" 
</P>
<P>
 Decca  
</P>
<P>
 * * * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Is that all there is to a song? 
</P>
<P>
 This naively superficial reaction could be applied, theoretically, to "Pure 
Ella," since the ingredients are basic: a vocalist, a pianist and 20 songs 
(nine of them by the Gershwins) drawn from the classic pop repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the singer is Ella Fitzgerald and the pianist Ellis Larkins, who for 
decades has been acknowledged as one of the world's nonpareil accompanists, the 
usual rules do not apply. Their collaboration began in 1950 and continued in 
1954; these were islands in a recording career at Decca marked by too many 
second-rate songs and big-band settings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Songs in a Mellow Mood" was the title given to the 12 songs on the second 
date, and indeed these two virtually define the adjective. Even the few cuts on 
which Larkins moves into a buoyantly swinging moderato have this quality of 
utter ease. Fitzgerald's sound is a tad lighter than it would be during the 
Verve years; she deals with the material with affection, adding only an 
occasional melodic twist or a few additional words. Only rarely, as in "Makin' 
Whoopee" and "Star Dust," does she take more than token liberties with the 
melody. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Gershwin once said: "I never knew how good our songs were until I heard 
Ella sing them." Nobody studying this album will dare to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). Five stars are reserved for 
retrospectives. LEONARD FEATHER

 Vincent Ward's beautiful and ambitious 1993 release is a startling epic of 
cultural seduction that tries -- and often succeeds -- to catch a massive chunk 
of our century in micro- and macrocosm, to chart the deep emotions of its 
people and to soar up and scan the landscape in which they're trapped. Two 
mixed-race Inuit bond as children in a Montreal Catholic hospital school, are 
separated, and then meet again in London during the last stages of World War 
II. There, Avik (Jason Scott Lee), who has become an aerial photographer, and 
the memorably sensuous Albertine (Anne Parillaud) continue what amounts to a 
lifetime of frustrated longing (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 p.m.) Michael Wilmington

 There's no wasted motion in this 1989 post- glasnost thriller in which an Army 
sergeant, wrongly wanted for murder, stumbles onto an international 
anti-disarmament conspiracy. The movie races from scene to scene, country to 
country, with the breakneck velocity of a motorcycle crashing through a 
computer room. Director Andy Davis ("The Fugitive") and his editors keep the 
film blasting along, from a brisk Berlin peace conference opener to a wild 
finish: Gene Hackman's Sgt. Gallagher (left, with Tommy Lee Jones) racing under 
the El, with a popeyed grimace that's a homage to "The French Connection."

 It's rare that two albums by hot alternative-rock bands like Soundgarden and 
Nine Inch Nails come out at the same time. But it's allowing alternative to 
dominate The Times' Southern California pop album chart. Still, pop princesses 
Celine Dion and Toni Braxton are so popular either might reclaim the top spot. 
Raunch is ruling the pop singles chart right now, with R. Kelly's sexy "Bump

CRITICS' PICKS: 'THE TRIALS OF OSCAR WILDE'

By Kevin Thomas

<TEXT>

 When it was released in 1960, this timeless British film only had minor 
distribution and was up against the near-simultaneous "Oscar Wilde," with 
Robert Morley.Morley resembled Wilde more closely than Peter Finch (pictured, 
with Yvonne Mitchell), but Finch here is remarkable. Written and directed by 
Ken Hughes, this is a captivating period piece that introduces us to Wilde at 
the height of his fame and fortune. Yet Wilde, at 40, was already in the thrall 
of a disastrous infatuation with the pretty wastrel, Lord Alfred Douglas (Jon 
Fraser). What ensues is both a crackling good courtroom drama and a powerful 
work of social protest (TNT Thursday at 10:15 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 Two breakup rumors circulating in recent days can be put to rest -- for now, 
at least. One had Linda Perry leaving 4 Non Blondes for a solo career, but the 
band (which is looking for a new guitarist) is preparing to begin a new album, 
expected to be released in September . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The other rumor concerned White Zombie.Singer Rob Zombie announced a split on 
stage during Rip magazine's concert/party at the Palladium last week, but what 
really happened was the group fired drummer Philo Buerstatte. With a 
replacement not chosen, the rest of the group is preparing for the follow-up to 
its Beavis and Butt-head-assisted hit, "Le Sexorcisto." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the tradition of the English Beat and the Charlatans U.K., the group Suede 
will now be known Stateside as the London Suede, the result of a settlement 
with a Washington, D.C., band that had been using the original name for several 
years. The English group has a new single, "Stay Together," out in the U.K. and 
plans to record its second album in the spring, for fall release. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Indigo Girls, with a new album titled "Swamp Ophelia" due in mid-April, 
guest on an album by the New Mongrels, an amalgamation of lesser-known Atlanta 
and Seattle musicians. The Mongrels' album will be released April 1 on Daemon 
Records, the label owned and run by Indigo Girl Amy Ray.

POP EYE: WILL 'LOLLA' BYPASS BLOCKBUSTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With such acts as Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins signed on, "Lollapalooza '94" 
shapes up as a blockbuster, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 Facilities owned by the Blockbuster Corporation -- including the Glen Helen 
Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore as well as Phoenix and Charlotte, N.C. venues -- 
have apparently been under consideration as sites for the cross-country rock 
'n' roll caravan this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the acts, including Nirvana, have reportedly expressed objections 
to playing sites owned by the Blockbuster video chain. Specifically, some 
artists and their representatives have privately complained about what they see 
as a "double standard" in Blockbuster's refusal to carry videos deemed 
unsuitable due to sexual content, while not banning violent videos. 
</P>
<P>
 John Silva, who manages Nirvana, had no comment, noting only that no sites had 
been set for the tour, which is expected to begin in early July. The lineup is 
expected to also include the Beastie Boys and the Breeders (also both managed 
by Silva), plus Nick Cave, George Clinton and a Tribe Called Quest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Lazareff, who books the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion, confirmed that 
there have been discussions about "Lollapalooza" playing there, but he said no 
political concerns have been raised. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter may end up being moot in Southern California, as most insiders are 
betting on "Lollapalooza" choosing the more open Cal State Dominguez Hills 
fields. Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre (the site in 1991 and 1992) is also a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lollapalooza" spokeswoman Heidi Robinson says that the tour's organizers hope 
that politics will not enter into the planning of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Lollapalooza co-founder Perry Farrell's idea, she says, "was to promote 
discussion, not to have 'Lolla' take a side. He wants to offer information on 
all sides of the arguments and let people make up their own minds." Steve 
Hochman

 AND THE WINNER IS . . . : Another music awards show? That's right. Frustrated 
by what they see as a neglect of the hip-hop world by the Grammy Awards and 
other honors, the management of New York-based Source magazine will inaugurate 
its own Source Awards on April 25 with a show at the Paramount Theatre in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not being done as a slap in the face to the Grammys," says Source 
publisher David Mays, who started the publication as a one-page newsletter in 
1988 and has seen it grow to a full magazine with a national circulation of 
more than 100,000. "But the mainstream has taken its time to recognize hip-hop. 
Even now, as big a force as it is, it still suffers from a stigma." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that stigma may be on display at the Source Awards, as the winners are 
expected to be drawn largely from gangsta rap, which has been under attack from 
a variety of organizations who contend that it celebrates and encourages 
violence. Snoop Doggy Dogg and 2Pac (Tupac Shakur) are almost certain to be 
among the nominees, which will be announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of rap came up when Mays approached television networks about 
broadcasting the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get a lot of positive feedback," he says. "So we said, 'Hey, let's 
do it without TV, do it as a major event and do it so well that we can use this 
as a springboard (for TV next year.)' " Steve Hochman

 BROOOOCE BOOT: Despite Sony Music's legal battle to stop a small British 
record label from releasing an album of Bruce Springsteen studio outtakes and 
unreleased songs from his pre-Columbia Records days, bootlegs of the tapes have 
already hit U.S. shores. 
</P>
<P>
 The British label sent out advance tapes to the press.Within the last week, 
the collection, titled "The Prodigal Son," turned up at several independent 
record stores in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Howard, editor/publisher of the CD collector's newsletter ICE, says that 
"because of the advance publicity," the new Springsteen disc has the potential 
for 15,000 in sales. "That's much better than the average bootleg," Howard 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Sony and of Springsteen had no comment. Bruce Haring

 AND ONE MORE THING: With some of the big players scrambling to get their 
music-oriented home shopping programs off and running, you might be surprised 
at who will actually be the first out of the blocks: John Oates. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, the dark-haired member of Hall & Oates is set to launch his 
"Maxmusic" program April 15, carried on the Jones Intercable service and the E! 
Entertainment cable channel."Maxmusic" will feature music videos and other 
entertainment bits, but the real purpose, of course, is to sell CDs and tapes, 
and eventually other music-related items. Three record companies -- BMG, Giant 
and Sony -- have already signed up to have their wares hawked on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates won't be an on-air figure, though, save for occasional cameo 
appearances. His role in this is as an entrepreneur and producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a lot of competition, some doing good jobs and some bad jobs, 
and the best format will win out," he says. "I feel good that we're out of the 
box first."

CRITICS' PICKS: 'HOUSEKEEPING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Wilmington

<TEXT>

 Scottish filmmaker Bill Forsyth's 1987 U.S. debut is a lovely, strange little 
film, and it says a lot of truthful, moving and scary things about small 
American towns in the '50s.Its outcasts are female: two little girls (Sara 
Walker, Andrea Burchill), left by their mother with relatives. Its outlaw is 
also a woman: their aunt (Christine Lahti, pictured), who takes over the 
household after a life spent on the road in hobo camps and on trains. Adapted 
from Marilynne Robinson's novel, it is a story about people whose rhythms are 
different from their neighbors, of spirits who can't be tamed, the dispossessed 
of a quietly tyrannical time (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.). Michael Wilmington

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; PETER BARTON'S LAW: 'LAUGHING IS GOOD,' WITH OR WITHOUT 
A SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE VILLASENOR, Anne Villasenor is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressed in a muted tie and jacket, Peter Barton patiently waits for the second 
take as the crew gets antsy for lunch and a Friday morning wanes down on the 
set of his latest series, "Burke's Law." 
</P>
<P>
 In the cool of the morning on the secluded Santa Monica sound stage, Barton 
seems as amiable and easygoing as his counterpart, Peter Burke. At 37, the man 
who plays the television son of Gene Barry seems to have found the secret of 
eternal youth, though he seems blissfully unaware of it. When the subject of 
age comes up, he's playful, not protective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both cheating on our age -- both Gene and I," he says, jokingly. "But 
it works. Fortunately, I look this way and I act this way," he says, recalling 
a time on "The Young and the Restless" where, at age 33, he dated a 
19-year-old. "It's all an illusion, " he says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the new version of the revival series in which Barry originally 
starred, close family ties are no illusion. Barton appreciates this "nice 
family thing that's going on" between him and Barry in the current series. He 
believes it makes the relationship between detectives a little sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're two detectives, the blood relationship makes it a whole lot 
stronger, and you're able to get away with it a lot more," he says from 
experience. "You're not going to do the same thing with your partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially inspired to become a doctor, Barton got that chance recently in his 
six-year stint as Dr. Scott Grainger on daytime's "The Young and the Restless." 
Back home in New York, he began chiropractic studies at Nassau Community 
College and eventually transferred to St. John's University in Queens, N.Y., as 
a pharmacy major. He recalls that his sister was dating a pharmacist at the 
time, which got him interested in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister's boyfriend looked like he had a pretty good life going; he made 
decent money," Barton recalls. "I just wanted to get a pharmacy degree, not to 
finish there -- but to have something. Then I was going to try and get into 
medical school and actually become a doctor, which I ended up playing on Y&R 
... so I got my dream." 
</P>
<P>
 At 21, he had earned extra money for tuition by modeling, but then his career 
got sidetracked. He ended up dropping out of medicine to pursue acting. After 
six months of modeling he moved to California and landed his first television 
series with Shirley Jones ("Shirley"), then "The Powers of Matthew Star" with 
Louis Gossett Jr. But after eight years, Barton turned his back on the camera 
and focused instead on real estate. He got a license and worked for Fred Sands 
Realty on Sunset Boulevard. He soon decided that real estate wasn't really for 
him, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I really made the choice of saying, 'I want to act.' The 
first time, I fell into it. I did it for almost seven years and plodded along. 
It was really kind of happenstance. The second time, after doing real estate, I 
said, 'You know what? I like to act.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Barton is happy being in a series that blends fun, adventure and 
banter. " 'Burke's Law' is a philosophy," Barton observes. "Amos and Peter 
Burke are fantasy characters who always seem to be in the right for the right 
side." With such aphorisms as "Never turn your back on a beautiful woman" and 
"If it was easy, everyone could do it" popping up throughout the show, one 
wonders if there's a "Barton's Law" as well? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I've learned is to try and laugh as much as you can, to really 
enjoy what you're doing," he says. "Laughing is so good for the soul. Kinda 
sounds like a Pepsi commercial, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Burke's Law" airs Fridays at 9 p.m. on CBS, though this week it is preempted 
by NCAA Tournament coverage.

ON VIEW; THE ACTING CURVE; FOUR OF THE 'WINNETKA ROAD' CAST EXPLAIN WHAT LED 
THEM TO THE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision to travel down "Winnetka Road" was an easy one for four of its 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Begley Jr. loved the script of the new limited series on NBC. So did 
Catherine Hicks. Meg Tilly was intrigued with the fact she could be creatively 
involved. Eddie Bracken was dying to have a TV series experience after working 
more than 50 years in movies and plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble comedy-drama from producer Aaron Spelling takes a rather tilted, 
offbeat look at the relationships among young adults and their families in a 
wealthy Midwestern suburb. Begley's nerd Glenn Barker has left his wife Jeannie 
(Hicks) and two kids for an aerobics instructor. Tilly's George Grace is a 
mysterious photographer married to a wealthy older man. And Bracken's Father 
Burke is a blind priest who dispenses wisdom and comfort to the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no distinction now for me between TV and films," says Begley, who 
played Dr. Erlich on the Emmy Award-winning series "St. Elsewhere" and is 
currently appearing in the feature film "Greedy." 
</P>
<P>
 "You see Robert Duvall and Anjelica Huston doing TV. You see people of that 
ilk doing material they think is compelling, whether it is big screen or small 
screen," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley also happens to be friends with the series' creator/co-executive 
producer John Byrum, who wrote and directed the controversial films "Inserts" 
and "The Razor's Edge" and was co-creator and executive producer of the CBS 
series "Middle Ages" and the ill-fated "South of Sunset." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great writer," Begley says with enthusiasm. "I was just happy to be 
part of it. It's funny stuff. There's some laughs and some pathos. It dares to 
be different." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hicks, Jeannie and Glenn are based on Byrum and his ex-wife. "His 
expression comes through us," Hicks says. "He is friends with his ex-wife, 
that's why he writes it well and it's funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Byrum directed Hicks in "The Razor's Edge," which starred Bill 
Murray. Hicks recalls that she didn't think Byrum liked her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first film, so I was very nervous," she says. "I think they just 
pitied me, so I was surprised when he, through my agents, insisted I come in 
(to audition). I'm sure he didn't write her for me, but I was very much on his 
mind. He rooted for me to get the role. Even these days, if you are good you 
need someone rooting for you because it's not only on merit. There are so many 
people looking for work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Winnetka Road" marks Tilly's first TV series. The lithe actress received a 
best supporting actress Oscar nomination for the 1985 film "Agnes of God" and 
also has appeared in "The Big Chill" and "The Two Jakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tilly, who doesn't even own a TV, wasn't looking to do a series. "People would 
say to me, 'Oh, you don't want to do (TV).' I had been offered quite a few. But 
they offered me this one and I really liked the script. I heard that John Byrum 
was a real great guy to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 She met with the producers at lunch and was impressed with Byrum. "John 
started saying, 'How I work is that I really like for actors to be creatively 
involved. If you have any ideas, I will incorporate them into the stories.' I 
was sitting there listening to him and thought, 'Why hasn't anybody told me 
about TV before?' It's so weird. You just accept these things that people tell 
you you don't want to do. You are like, 'Wait a minute, this sounds great.' It 
was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Tilly, whose first novel, "Singing Songs," will be published this June by 
Dutton, even got to write the fourth episode. "I'm really grateful. John was 
like, 'Wow. Give me your ideas.' So I started writing down all of these ideas 
so I couldn't forget them and he said, 'Why don't you write a script?' So I 
wrote a script. He was so encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Bracken's daughter encouraged her famous father to accept the role of Father 
Burke. "When the opportunity came up to do 'Winnetka Road,' my daughter was 
living in Winnetka. Ill. When she heard about it, she said, 'Oh, you have got 
to take the part.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And Bracken wanted to do a TV series. Though the actor has starred in some of 
the greatest movies ever made, including Preston Sturges' "The Miracle at 
Morgan's Creek" and "Hail the Conquering Hero," he had never been a regular on 
a TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, Bracken was intrigued with the idea of working for Spelling. 
Back in the late '40s, Sturges opened a restaurant-dinner theater in Hollywood 
called The Players. "We did 'Room Service' there," Bracken recalls. "I played 
it for 18 weeks for nothing, just so Sturges could catch up on some of the 
debts he had. I was doing a couple of pictures at the time, so I had to back 
out. So as a result, we had to put on a new show and a young lad came in with 
his girlfriend. He was a stage manager and he wanted to do 'Quonset Hut,' which 
was Garson Kanin's play. Sturges and I agreed that it would be a good show to 
do. That was the beginning of a guy named Aaron Spelling." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bracken met with Spelling about his part, he wasn't even sure the man 
behind "Dynasty," "The Mod Squad," "Charlie's Angels," "Beverly Hills, 90210" 
and "Melrose Place" would remember The Players. But, Bracken reports, "The 
greeting was just wonderful. He called me his hero and said, 'We will argue 
about the money, but the part is yours if you want it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Winnetka Road" airs Saturdays at 10 p.m. on NBC (preempted this week).

PROFILE; THE GIFT OF GABY; HOW A 12-YEAR-OLD CAN BE A TV STAR AND A REGULAR KID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID, Beth Kleid is a frequent contributor to TV Times and Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gaby Hoffmann bursts into the brightly colored '50s-style Johnny Rockets 
diner, apologizing over and over for being late. She settles into a red vinyl 
booth. She's had a long day in seventh grade, a long week working on her first 
TV series. And on this warm Friday afternoon, she's thirsty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chocolate Coke, I've never heard of that!" she exclaims, checking out the 
menu. "It's weird." Intrigued, she orders one. It comes, she sticks in her 
straw and takes a big sip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ewwww," she scrunches up her face into one of those trademark expressions 
that made her a scene-stealer in movies such as "This Is My Life" and 
"Sleepless in Seattle." "What is that taste?" She pushes it away, and without a 
moment's delay, starts chattering. Indeed, this animated 12-year-old is aptly 
named. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have ordered, like, a cheeseburger and fries and a float or 
something, but I'm going out tonight," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby makes kid faces, she eats kid food. Her world is typical teeny-bopper: 
"The Diary of Anne Frank" ("I've read it like four times"), "Beverly Hills, 
90210" and "Melrose Place" ("They're obsessive"), her best friends ("I have 
four"), movies, Madonna, '60s music. "Like" and "Oh my God" are sprinkled 
through her every sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But this regular kid, who has been in high-profile films since her debut in 
"Field of Dreams" when she was 6, now has her own TV show. NBC's new comedy 
"Someone Like Me" stars Gaby as alter ego Gaby Stepjak, a typical 11-year-old 
living in St. Louis. The TV Gaby deals with the usual stuff involved in growing 
up: blowouts with her sister, a ragamuffin boy who has a crush on her and 
deciding whether to run away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer and creator of the show, Bruce Helford (a former executive 
producer for "Roseanne"), says the thing that appealed to him about Gaby, and 
made her perfect for the role, is that despite her show-biz success, she truly 
is a normal preteen. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a really natural kid -- you don't get any of that glossy, slick 
sitcommy kind of kid you can't stand," he says. "And she's wise. She's really a 
bright young woman." He describes the young actress, with her mix of impishness 
and winning charm, as someone other kids (and TV-viewing kids) would want for a 
friend: "She's the girl you want to hang out with in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Helford conceived of the show before meeting Gaby, but once he met her and 
"fell in love," she became the basis for the character. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby agrees that she and the character Gaby are very much alike. "She tries to 
get what she wants. She gets in big fights with her mom, like I do all the 
time. She gets in fights with her friends, and says the same things I would 
say, like fine ," she says dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby is quick to point out a crucial difference: "Well, Gaby is e-le-ven, and 
I'm 12. And I'm in seventh grade, and she's in sixth grade. And I hate it, I 
hate it, I hate it. God, I just hate it. I mean it's OK to act older. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 She has strong opinions and doesn't hesitate to express them. Director Nora 
Ephron, who worked with Gaby in "This Is My Life" and "Sleepless in Seattle," 
explains why the young star makes such an impression. "She has this kind of 
divine bossiness that I have a weakness for," Ephron says. "I just think she's 
a remarkable person and actress." 
</P>
<P>
 But please, don't call Gaby precocious. "Most people my age are just like 
that," she insists. "And obviously lots of people are, like, still stuck back 
in the '50s or '60s or whatever because it's different now. Everybody says, 'Oh 
Gaby, you're 12 going on 30.' That's, like, not true. I mean, people are mature 
nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of TV shows don't get that. The kids aren't real," she says, rolling 
her doe-like brown eyes. What she likes most about her TV character is that she 
rings true. 
</P>
<P>
 So true, that even her clothes are somewhat like the real-life Gaby's. "She 
wears Docs," she says, referring to the clunky Doc Marten shoes. Docs are part 
of Gaby uniform, but on this day she's wearing platform Mary Janes, along with 
a white Gap T-shirt tied at the waist and Levi's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to shop," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She's also taken with more intellectual pursuits. "I love to read and I love 
to write. I read, like, four books at a time." Currently, she's in the middle 
of "All the Pretty Horses" and "Little Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby says it's not easy to juggle school and the series. She's also busy 
getting used to a new school and making new friends, after moving to Los 
Angeles from New York City with her mother three months ago to do the show. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her new friends, 13-year-old actor Matthew Thomas Carey, who plays the 
disheveled boy who has a crush on Gaby, says she hasn't let the fame get to 
her. "It's not, like, 'This is my show,' at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby describes herself as "very open to people. I get that from my mom." She 
and her mother, Viva Auder, the former Andy Warhol groupie, are close. "I can 
ask her anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaby isn't worried that she'll go the way of some child stars who have had 
problems. "I want to go to college and everything." She says she plans to keep 
acting and eventually become a director. 
</P>
<P>
 Her more immediate goal is to host "Saturday Night Live." "Oh my God, that 
would be the best," she says, breathless. "That would really be nerve-racking 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone Like Me" airs Mondays at 8:30 p.m. on NBC (preempted this week).

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: ITALIANATE EMPIRE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the North Hollywood space that was once Maison Gerard, Ca' del Sole seems 
more like a living room, suitable for dinner parties and cocktails, rather than 
a bustling restaurant. At lunch, the pace may be more frenzied -- it's right in 
the heart of the studio district and has plenty of booths for dealing and 
schmoozing -- but at dinner, things are more relaxed.It's a grown-up place to 
have osso buco or slow-cooked duck or Venetian-style spaghetti.  
</P>
<P>
 From the people who started L.A.'s Locanda Veneta and Ca' Brea (one of the 
principals also consulted on the restaurant Florian), Ca' del Sole is just one 
of two places opened by the group in the past few weeks. Il Moro, on Olympic 
Boulevard in West L.A., is the newest. They are trying to build a small 
restaurant empire without building a chain of clones -- each place has a 
different name and a slightly different menu and attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 At Ca' del Sole, the menu encourages new customers to order several dishes for 
sharing, in the Venetian family-style. So far, appetizers (great for sharing) 
seem better than the pasta and entrees. Pale, cool slices of porchetta , 
slow-roasted ham, come with a good salsa verde. Grilled eggplant comes slick 
with first-press olive oil. Fresh artichoke hearts are tossed with endive, 
Parmesan and an herb-flecked vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ca' del Sole, 4100 Cahuenga Blvd., North Hollywood, (818) 985-4669. Pasta 
and entrees $7.75 - $16.50.

RESTAURANT NEWS: PUCK STEPS IN AT SPAGO; ANYONE FOR AN OSCAR BASH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now might be exactly the right time to eat at Spago. Head chef Joseph Manzare 
has left Wolfgang Puck's West Hollywood restaurant and, until Puck replaces 
him, the great chef himself has temporarily taken over lead cooking duties. 
(Puck normally stops by each of his three local restaurants nightly and spends 
a portion of the evening in the open kitchen of at least one of them.) 
</P>
<P>
 Manzare co-cooked with Kevin Ripley at Puck's Malibu restaurant, Granita, 
before he became head chef at Spago. "He lived in one of the big buildings 
right on the beach in Santa Monica," says Puck, "and he completely freaked out 
after the quake. One night he came in and just said, 'I'm leaving.' He didn't 
want to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," responds Manzare. "I'm in my apartment in Santa Monica right now on 
the eighth floor looking out at the ocean. The earthquake happened a month 
before I left. (My leaving Spago) had nothing to do with the earthquake. The 
truth is, I am working on my own project."  
</P>
<P>
 Matt Nichols is the most likely candidate to replace Manzare. "I told Matt if 
everything works out he is going to get the chance." says Puck. "He's really 
very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Puck empire grows. Besides his 10-year-old Spago flagship and 
four other celebrity-studded restaurants, an interest in a Spago spinoff in 
Tokyo (and soon another in Mexico City) and a frozen pizza company, the Visa 
pitchman is now feeding the mozzarella-ed masses through a string of fast-food 
cafes.  
</P>
<P>
 Puck is getting into the take-out act too. He's just opened "Wolfgang Puck to 
Go" in Gelsons Pacific Palisades, where white collars can pick up pizzas, 
pastas, salads, pasta sauces, salad dressings, Spago-baked breads, even Spago 
matzo. "Business is good out there," says Puck. "because they are all our 
customers anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OSCAR BASHING: The one thing Puck is not cashing in on -- at least this year 
-- is an Oscar party at Spago. As previously reported, Spago will be closed on 
Oscar night for the first time in eight years. And, unless you're a major star 
or some other VIP, the party at Morton's is already booked. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's always the Tony Bill party. The director/producer/actor/former 
AT&T spokesman is celebrating the Oscars at his 72 Market Street in Venice 
beginning at 6 p.m. For $30, customers get a four-course buffet dinner prepared 
by chef Roland Gibert and a big-screen view of the awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The partying also starts at 6 p.m. at Typhoon at the Santa Monica Airport. 
This black-tie optional affair features a worldly buffet ($25.50 per person), 
big-screen viewing of the Academy Awards, and big parking spaces for incoming 
private planes.  
</P>
<P>
 Ed Debevic's Oscar party raises money for the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. 
Partygoers pay $19.94 for an all-you-can-eat-buffet consisting of Ed's mom's 
meatloaf, cheeseburgers, buffalo wings, "chick" sticks and homemade tortilla 
chips and guacamole.

REEFER MADNESS, 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the Orwellian-monikered Freedom Alliance wants Sony to stop distributing 
Cypress Hill's recordings because the racially mixed rappers are exercising 
their First Amendment freedoms to advocate the legalization of marijuana (Pop 
Eye, March 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Just who is kidding whom? If these people are so concerned about freedom, then 
why do they want to take away the freedom of Cypress Hill to speak, create and 
make a living, just because they dare to question the orthodoxy that government 
and law enforcement have established on the drug issue? 
</P>
<P>
 While I do not share Cypress Hill's views that everyone should smoke pot, the 
group has just as much right to say them as preachers who say that everyone 
should accept the literal truth of the Bible, for example. By the very nature 
of its ethnic makeup (Cuban, Chicano and white) and through its raps, the group 
discourages the sort of divisive racism that left much of this city in flames 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cliff Kincaid of the Freedom Alliance cared about real freedom, he would be 
commending rather than attacking Cypress Hill, just on the grounds of being 
against racism and the destructive war on drugs that has cost too much in 
crime, dollars and -- indeed -- freedom.

 Regarding Chris Willman's negative review of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers' 
video "Mary Jane's Last Dance" (Sound & Vision, Feb. 20), I believe he missed 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The surface images of necrophilia may be creepy, but they are metaphors for 
the story of a marijuana addict who outgrows the habit. He returns to "Mary 
Jane" for one last dance to "kill the pain," but it no longer works. The effort 
is futile, much like trying to re-create the romance with a dead date. It only 
tires him out, so he finally releases his hold on Mary Jane (as he releases Kim 
Basinger into the ocean). 
</P>
<P>
 A '70s rocker has entered the 12-step '90s, and his healthy message should be 
noted.

PATCHING THINGS UP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How unfortunate that Jan Herman and I miscommunicated on my feelings about my 
hometown, Burbank, in "Getting Their Words' Worth" (Feb. 27).I had hoped no one 
would notice. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, my remark about "forgetting" I was born and raised there had to do 
with the shots Burbank has taken from "Tonight Show" hosts and other NBC 
comics, a circumstance Burbank residents have had to endure for decades. I like 
Burbank, and wouldn't say so if I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Patricia McCarthy's kind letter last Sunday, I received several 
concerned-to-angry "what goes?" calls. The most severe was from my mother. Oy.

PRINCE AND THE PAPER

 I read Chris Willman's story regarding the unreleased soundtrack for James L. 
Brooks' "I'll Do Anything" and was compelled to write a response ("Some 
People'll Do Anything to Hear These Songs," Film Clips, Feb. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 First, Willman uses a "source with friends at Paisley Park Records" to state 
that had called our Los Angeles office requesting that all copies of "I'll Do 
Anything" be destroyed.Why quote a "source with friends" when all he had to do 
was call either myself or PMK Public Relations, and we would have confirmed 
that no copies of the tape existed at Paisley Park Records? 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the story incorporates a very strong negative quote that is only 
credited to "one astonished professional songwriter." Is that Willman's 
description of this person, or can we have his or her name and judge for 
ourselves? 
</P>
<P>
 From the context of the story, I got the impression that Willman never heard 
the music. Also, these songs were written for a film, not independently, and 
should be judged from that perspective. The next time he plans to be judge, 
jury and reporter, he should try to wear each hat objectively and, above all, 
personally review the evidence.

THE EDGE OF DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Dance to the Edge," by Lewis Segal (March 6): 
</P>
<P>
 What a nice surprise to see an article on dance, and local dance at that, on 
the cover of Sunday's Calendar. I applaud The Times and Lewis Segal for this 
reporting and hope this will signal increased coverage of dance in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Trends come and go. Ten years ago Mary Jane Eisenberg's form of dance, termed 
"hyper realism," was in vogue. Now it's "Hyperdance." The tenets of Hyperdance, 
however, are not new. Both George Ballanchine in ballet and Merce Cunningham in 
modern dance (to name just two) wanted an audience to "perceive the movement 
first and foremost before laying any trip on it," to use Segal's phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is indicative of the times that many of these Hyperdance 
choreographers are not interested in communicating with an audience. This 
attitude reflects society's increasing lack of interest in communicating with 
one another, something I find rather distressing, particularly in art. 
</P>
<P>
 In an art form in which your body is literally your instrument, I wonder how 
long the proponents of Hyperdance will be able to push their bodies to the 
limit. Hyperdance may burn itself out because there won't be anyone left to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 And this too, I suppose, is a fitting tribute of the times.

<P>
 Those of us in the arts are especially grateful to The Times when the arts get 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Segal's article informs the public that dance here in Los Angeles has finally 
been acknowledged. History tells us that dance came into its own in Los Angeles 
in the 1920s, when Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn established the Denishawn 
school right here in Eagle Rock. One can only wonder where all of contemporary 
dance would be without their vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Need I say there is a wide void from the 1920s through the 1990s. Let us hope 
that The Times continues to inform us.

<P>
 I would like to thank Segal for his well-written article and The Times for 
giving it print space. 
</P>
<P>
 As I read the article, it occurred to me that dance has not come very far as a 
developed art form if Hyperdance really is the latest step in dance's 
evolution. Early this century in America, modern dance artists fought hard to 
establish dance as a developed art form. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet, which was the predominant genre of theatrical dance at the time, had 
degenerated somewhat into a performance of physically difficult tricks designed 
to amaze the audience and elicit the "ooh-ahh" response. Modern dance artists, 
serious about raising the level of expression and art in dance, rebelled and 
began to develop what we now call modern dance. Many long years were spent by 
these pioneers and others in an effort to develop dance into a mature art form. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's Hyperdance. Having sampled some of the local examples, I find it 
difficult to see this type of work as an advancement of the art form. The work, 
in fact, appears to be that same old turn-of-the-century ballerina doing her 
gimmicky tricks, only this time she's dressed in the current cultural style. 
Isn't Hyperdance a new arrival at an old place?

 As a recent transplant from San Francisco, I was amused that Segal has 
discovered extremely physical dance and pronounced it to be the next big L.A. 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I applaud the efforts of Southland choreographers to go back to the 
roots of modern dance and rediscover the "effort-ness" of movement, I question 
the "next big thing" status Segal has bestowed upon an approach whose 
popularity crested in San Francisco more than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to establish parochial ownership of this "new" terpsichorean 
attitude, the writer first claims it is the region's turbulent metaphor, then 
claims it isn't about anything, cites choreographers who create characters and 
work with themes, and concludes that dance isn't important for what it says but 
for what it does. Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Segal suffers from the critics' need to label every perceived 
movement, school or trend with some kind of cute catch phrase; by trying to 
encase the urge toward higher and higher levels of physicality with the trite 
term Hyperdance , Segal is making it more important than it really is -- and at 
the same time trivializing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite my criticisms, I must encourage Segal's efforts to write about young 
choreographers trying to create their own unique voices. It is refreshing to 
see a writer trying to get in touch with the local cutting edge.

 I'm sure it was not Daniel Cerone's fault, but there are many inaccuracies in 
his article "Expatriate Games" (March 6): 
</P>
<P>
 * I did not do any acting in the film "Day of Reckoning," nor was I ever 
interested in doing such. I was the co-creator and co-executive producer of 
this Paramount Studios-NBC movie. 
</P>
<P>
 * The article suggests my partner Stirling Silliphant and I are at "odds" over 
the production, the deal-making and the results of the final product. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. We are actively engaged in developing a new 
television series to be filmed on location in Paris. I never "sold away" our 
rights to the project against Stirling's wishes; as partners, we make all such 
decisions jointly. 
</P>
<P>
 * As for the "name" power of my getting projects financed, the long list of 
past, present and future projects speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a better title for Cerone's article would have been "Ego Games" -- one 
of the very reasons Stirling and I choose to write and produce outside the 
Hollywood system.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: MARATHON DREAMER SUFFERS THE FITS AND STARTS OF RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, Robin Abcarian's column is published Wednesdays and Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the Los Angeles Marathon, I've been at my best on my morning runs, 
fantasizing that my 30- or 40-minute jog could -- with ever so little effort -- 
be stretched into a four-hour 26.2-mile jaunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, for people like me -- who tie on fancy running shoes and pound the 
old knee cartilage a few times a week -- a marathon looms as out of reach as a 
walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you meet someone -- a marathoner, usually -- who blithely tells you: "If 
you can run four miles, you can definitely run a marathon." And a very big part 
of you wants to believe it. Not because you actually want to run a marathon, 
but because you want to be able to say that you ran a marathon. And because you 
know, deep down, that what holds you back is your head, not your legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, it would be incorrect to say that I have no marathon experience. 
In 1990, I "did" the New York City Marathon; I was the support team for my 
friend. It worked out pretty well. I carbo loaded; she ran. I had a good 
power-shopping session at Bloomie's, caught up with her at Mile 17 for a 
picture, then ate lunch. Afterward, I got stuck in post-race crowds in Central 
Park and almost passed out from claustrophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell you, marathons are hell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After fits and starts and always hating it, I began running in earnest in 
early 1991. My goal was to run a 5K that May with a colleague. Actually, my 
true goal was to lose a little weight. Eating less was just not a possibility 
for me. I figured if I ran, the pounds simply would melt away, that my inner 
Kim Basinger would finally be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many years ago, I was forced to listen to a formerly plump friend burble 
annoyingly that since she had begun running five miles a day, she could eat 
anything she wanted and not gain weight! I bought this line for many years, 
positive that the reason for my inexorable increase from single into 
double-digit clothing sizes was the direct result of not running, completely 
unrelated to my lifelong obsession with tapioca pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 How many others have been damned to clothing brands with just a skosh more 
room by such infernal misinformation? 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out it was the tapioca after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Running does not cause fat to melt away. Running causes fat to jiggle 
uncomfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 And here is some really upsetting news: According to a book published by the 
Honolulu Marathon Clinic, "The closer your weight is to your feet, the harder 
it is to run. . . . This explains the phenomenon of the spindly-legged fat man 
running well." 
</P>
<P>
 This means that my nightmare body -- the beefsteak-tomato-on-toothpicks shape 
I foresee 20 gallons of tapioca down the line -- will not impede my ability to 
run a marathon eventually. It will merely allow me to be the world's fattest 
marathoner . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running is not for the squeamish. It is a sport that demands the frank 
admission that bodily functions are normal, natural and embarrassingly 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Running races does for me what watching "Married . . . With Children" does for 
Terry Rakolta of Americans for Responsible Television. It makes me throw up. 
</P>
<P>
 Many theories have been advanced by friends and family -- low blood sugar, 
milk intolerance, over-exertion, high anxiety -- but nothing I do seems to 
help. I always lose it just before the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite race picture shows me crossing a 5K finish line with my father at 
Santa Monica College. My mouth is clamped shut, my eyes are shut tight, my 
cheeks are bulging. I am nanoseconds away from my traditional race-ending hurl. 
My father -- who, come to think of it, has slim legs and wears pants with a 
skosh more room -- is the only person I know who will stay that close to me 
near a finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 That -- and the fact that he chides me mercilessly afterward -- is why I love 
him so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a hot, gorgeous afternoon last week, I ditched work, determined to run for 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can do that," I told myself, "then maybe one day I really can run a 
marathon." 
</P>
<P>
 I drove to the beach, put the radio headphones on and started north on the 
bike path. A breeze was up, the sky was clear, the Santa Monica Mountains were 
so close you could almost touch the fire scars. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 30 minutes were easy. At 40 minutes, I considered stopping. There 
was no real physical discomfort. My loser's reflex was kicking in. A few 
minutes later, I got a stitch and slowed down. It passed. At 50 minutes, I knew 
I could finish the hour, but I was certain I'd never run a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes later, with the end in sight, covered in sweat, I felt a slight 
runner's high, a happy, maybe-I-can-go-forever kind of feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 So I ran for five more minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 And believe me, it seemed like forever.

WHY NOT OK GAY WEDDINGS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I appreciated "State of the Union" (March 6). I also commend Micki and Chris 
Clark and Daniel Holmes and Kay Wiker for sharing the stories of their love and 
commitment ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 It amazes me, the big hubbub over whether or not it's "OK" to let us gays be 
in love, get married and pursue our dreams. No one has asked for approval, just 
the same basic rights and privileges that are afforded the straight population. 
</P>
<P>
 I too have been fortunate to find someone I deeply love and will share my life 
with. We had a wedding witnessed by 120 family members and friends. Other than 
the legal aspect, it's just as binding and probably more emotional than a 
straight wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 I look forward to the day when we finally aren't persecuted for, of all 
things, our love. When we can also benefit from the legal, tax and insurance 
benefits of being married.

 Preventing marriage will not make gays and lesbians stop being gay and 
lesbian. However, it may discourage monogamy and stability merely to gratify 
homophobes.

CAN ADS REALLY HELP TO CURB TEEN DUI? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am an 18-year-old senior at Chatsworth High School, and I am writing 
concerning the article "Under the Influence?" about teen-agers and alcohol 
(Feb. 22). 
</P>
<P>
 Honestly, I don't think any adult can really know how teen-agers deal with 
alcohol and what should be done about it. I know what goes on. I see it every 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting alcohol for teen-agers is like taking candy from a baby. There are a 
few liquor stores that accept fake IDs from teen-agers. The IDs I'm speaking of 
aren't the "high-tech" ones that look real, but ones that can be purchased by 
anybody for $10 at any check-cashing establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The common beverage among teen-agers is beer in a 40-ounce bottle or can -- 
inexpensive, easy to hold and pretty much does the job of "relaxing" you. The 
biggest problem of the night is finding a place to drink the alcohol.  
</P>
<P>
 Drinking and driving doesn't even enter the minds of the kids as a bad thing. 
If you drive and you're drunk, you're not going to just leave your car. I know 
teen-agers who get very drunk every weekend and always get home safely. 
Although they hear all the stories of drinking and driving, I guess until it 
happens to someone they know, they'll keep doing it.  
</P>
<P>
 My point is, it's a common practice of high school kids to drink. It's in the 
hormones at this age to defy the law. All the advertisements in the world 
showing how bad it is to drink and drive won't change anything. It's a way of 
life on the weekends.

 This is in response to the article about proposed warnings for beer ads. The 
beer companies use celebrities, models, motor vehicles and certain water 
activities that appeal to people under 21. I'm 17 and these commercials 
certainly appeal to me, but isn't that the point of advertising? It's naive to 
pretend beer companies don't realize the market of underage drinkers. It may 
not be morally correct to target consumers who are not legally able to buy 
their product, but the beer company is a business. Like any business they're 
out to make money. I have consumed alcohol on special occasions such as New 
Year's. I was not compelled to drink because of any beer commercials, but 
because of peer pressure and it was my responsibility to not drive.  
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, kids my age shouldn't drink, but the reality is that alcohol is 
easy to purchase and is consumed in high quantities by teen-agers. Beer 
companies can't be accountable for the attitudes of teen-agers toward alcohol 
or how their product is used.

GALLERY: NOGUCHI'S CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One scene has a pile of beige granite boulders artfully stacked. Behind the 
boulders is a row of slim, healthy redwoods on a gentle slope.And off to the 
side, a raised mound of cactus and other succulents evokes a desert 
environment, surrounded by a snaking stream. 
</P>
<P>
 The artful creations in this Costa Mesa courtyard are by one of America's 
great sculptors, the late Isamu Noguchi. 
</P>
<P>
 For 11 years, the sculpture garden, called "California Scenario," has 
attracted curious tourists, art students and people looking for a quiet place. 
Six scenes representing California's natural beauty are spread over the 
1.6-acre sandstone courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned in 1980 by Henry T. Segerstrom, developer of South Coast Plaza 
Town Center, the garden cost more than $1 million to construct. In a 1989 
interview, Segerstrom noted that the garden gave Noguchi an opportunity to pay 
homage to his home state. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was considered a New Yorker and a Japanese artist, but in truth, he was a 
native Californian and this was the first revelation of his own appreciation of 
and sensitivity to that element in his life," Segerstrom said of the artist, 
who died in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The pile of boulders is a 28-ton sculpture cut and fitted by Noguchi himself. 
Titled "The Spirit of the Lima Bean," it is a tribute to the Segerstrom family 
and the roots of their fortune: lima bean farming. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture garden also offers a simpler version of new-age "aroma therapy" 
and "wave music." The light, sweet scent of honeysuckle greets visitors who 
stroll by the sixth element of the sculpture, a raised mound representing the 
agricultural use of California's land. 
</P>
<P>
 California Scenario is at 116 Anton Blvd. Admission is free.

UP ALL NIGHT / HILLARY JOHNSON: WHERE WORLD MUSIC IS THE STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Belly-dancer Aisha Ali vibrates her silver and silk-clad hips to the sharp, 
sensuous trill of Souhael Kaspar's tar drum. Fellow musician Ali Jihad Racy 
tosses aside his oud, a Middle Eastern lute, to take up the beat with another 
drum. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience of 60 or so Tuesday night regulars claps Ali and company on to a 
rousing, swirling, shimmering finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is International Bandstand -- not a nightclub, but a 7-to-10 p.m. 
UCLA Extension course taught by local world-music guru Tom Schnabel, who has 
hosted "Cafe L.A." on public radio station KCRW since 1992. Schnabel has been a 
musical fixture in Los Angeles since 1979, when he instituted KCRW's "Morning 
Becomes Eclectic," which he hosted until 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-week class, offered once a year, takes on a different region of the 
globe each week, and Schnabel regularly supplements his witty, personal 
lectures with live performances by dancers and musicians. Here are nine parties 
for which you don't need to find a date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Schnabel has been my most important influence musically," says student 
Clive Baillie, who works in advertising and pursues music as a passionate 
hobby. "But this has turned out to be a very expensive class, since I end up 
going to Tower Records on the way home and buying everything we've listened 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening devoted to the music of northern Africa and the Middle East begins 
with Schnabel presenting video clips and selections from his personal 
collection of more than 7,000 records and CDs.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a song called 'Nisi Nisi.' It's kind of the 'Louie Louie' of 
Algeria," Schnabel says, introducing a Rai number by artist Khaled. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 8:30 p.m. coffee break, Schnabel brings on Racy and Kaspar, who 
demonstrate several styles of Middle Eastern classical and folk music on an 
array of instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Racy, a professor of ethnomusicology at UCLA, tunes up a black, stringed 
instrument from Egypt, the rababah. "It's a coconut half covered in fish skin," 
Racy explains to the class with a wink, "one of the few musical instruments 
that is even halfway edible." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-too-brief folk-music section of the program concludes with Racy 
demonstrating the art of circular breathing on a deceptively simple little 
woodwind called a buzuqu. It's a stomping number. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you explain how you did that?" an awed student asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very simple," Racy says, to much disbelieving laughter. "When you're 
almost out of breath, you puff out your cheeks and keep the pressure on the 
instrument while you breathe in through your nose to fill your lungs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Dizzy Gillespie," another student calls out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right," Schnabel interjects. "Hubert Laws used to do that when he'd 
play three-minute solos, and people would be amazed, thinking he did it all in 
one breath." 
</P>
<P>
 The class is a labor of love for Schnabel, who pays the musicians out of his 
teaching fee. "As long as I don't lose too much money, I'm happy," he says. 
Instead of giving a final exam, Schnabel throws a party at his house in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year I might opt for a really general music-appreciation class," says 
Schnabel, "a sort of wine-and-cheese thing at my house, something where we can 
listen to sufi singers and then Miles Davis' greatest solo, and talk about why 
music is like food, why voices are like silk." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Information: UCLA Extension: (310) 825-9064. Tom Schnabel's world music show, 
Cafe L.A., can be heard every Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on 
KCRW 89.9 FM.

THE BUZZ: BEST BIRD IN A SUPPORTING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by the Social Climes Staff 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In honor of Spago going dark Monday night as a memorial to the late Swifty 
Lazar and his legendary Oscar parties there, we advise that it would be Very 
Hollywood to pop a Wolfgang Puck frozen pizza in the microwave before zoning 
out with the Academy Awards show on your TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But your Social Climes staff has to wonder what we'll be eating at all those 
Oscar parties. Unfortunately, not even our most respectful form of groveling, 
all the way to the head office of Vanity Fair in New York, could pry loose a 
description of even one tiny, inconsequential hors d'oeuvre to be served at the 
party at Morton's, co-hosted by the aforementioned celebrity-happy magazine and 
producer Steve Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
 But if we could put money on it, we bet the main course will be . . . chicken. 
You see, we think we've discovered a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Elton John, at his AIDS Foundation party at Maple Drive, will be dishing up a 
choice of grilled Chilean sea bass, penne with grilled vegetables or grilled 
chick en. And at the official, post-Oscar Governor's Ball, the black-tie crowd 
will be dining on grilled king salmon and breast of chicken . 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, apple dishes seem to be very in. There will be caramelized apple 
tarts served at both Maple Drive and the Governor's Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler, star of TV's "Grace Under Fire," is right with the trend 
setters. As she is hosting her first annual Academy Awards party to benefit "We 
Have a Dream for Better Days," (supporting efforts to get children off the 
streets and to end hunger and homelessness), we had to ask if there would be 
chicken and an apple anything. The event at Chaya Brasserie, open to the public 
for $50 per person, indeed promises a dinner that includes chicken and apple 
strudel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stars and Hope: Although the Oscar bash is without a doubt the ultimate A-list 
gathering of celebs, there is another event that runs a close second. That 
distinction belongs to the star-studded Carousel of Hope ball chaired by 
Barbara and Marvin Davis, who will host the 11th annual party Oct. 28 at the 
Beverly Hilton. The event benefits the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood 
Diabetes and the L.A. chapters of the American Diabetes Assn. and the Juvenile 
Diabetes Foundation International. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-month break between parties allows the stars to catch their breath 
and find something new to wear. 
</P>
<P>
 So far lined up for this year's mega-event are Jay Leno as emcee and Merv 
Griffin as host (he does own the hotel, after all). Performing will be Phil 
Collins, Neil Diamond and Placido Domingo in a show produced by George 
Schlatter, with musical director David Foster and musical chairman (boy, we 
like that title) Quincy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening also includes a silent auction. Last time bidders paid good money 
for a date with model Claudia Schiffer and lunch with Luke Perry. But since 
she's engaged and he's married, the committee will have to keep looking. for 
fresh blood this year.

WESTSIDE WATCH: MANN SCHOOL LACKS GLITZ, BUT ITS TEST SCORES GLITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Horace Mann School doesn't fit the many stereotypes of Beverly Hills 
promulgated by television shows, movies and the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on busy Robertson Boulevard in the city's southeastern quarter, it 
draws its students from homes more modest than the mansions traditionally 
associated with Beverly Hills. Horace Mann's students include immigrants from 
Israel, Japan and Korea, along with pupils whose native language is Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was nothing modest about the school's math scores on a statewide 
test. Its fourth-graders had Los Angeles County's highest scores on the 
mathematics portion of the California Learning Assessment System test, with 50% 
scoring at the top three levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The next closest school was Vista Grande in Palos Verdes at 43%.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Our) success involves the three fourth-grade teachers (Lynn Koff, Ellen 
Morehead and Rachael Zanka) who came up with a lot of new types of material 
that allowed the children to write the kind of answers that were creative and 
extend beyond what normally might be expected," Principal Arthur E. Fields 
said. "They developed their own open-ended questions, which children had to 
write the answers to, rather than just using math as a means of computation." 
</P>

<P>
 DIAMOND'S IN THE ROUGH: Good law has turned into bad luck for 41st Assembly 
District candidate Roger Jon Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has no one but himself to blame. . . . He's responsible for the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, when Diamond ran unsuccessfully for the Assembly, he challenged the 
rule that incumbents always got first position on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the California Supreme Court didn't hear the case until after Diamond 
had lost to the Republican candidate, former Assemblyman Paul Priolo, whose 
name appeared first on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he got to court, Diamond was stymied because the Legislature's 
attorney would not concede that being listed first on the ballot was an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond didn't give up, however. He raised the issue again the following year 
in a local Santa Monica election. A trial court judge agreed with Diamond that 
the person listed first on the ballot had a leg up. Alphabetical order wasn't 
fair either, the judge ruled. A lottery was then instituted to determine the 
ballot order. 
</P>
<P>
 When Diamond flew up to Sacramento last week to attend the lottery for ballot 
positions, he found that the system he had fought for, fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond will be listed last on the Democratic primary ballot (after lottery 
winner Sheila James Kuehl and four others). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called irony," Diamond said. "You couldn't write a script better than 
that." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 POKER FACED: Tom Hayden went on "Politically Incorrect," Comedy Central cable 
network's talk show last week. He bombed as a comic. On purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Democratic gubernatorial hopeful later explained that he 
deliberately decided to take a humorless approach on the show, which has been 
dubbed "The McLaughlin Group on acid." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't go in warmed up to be funny," Hayden said. "I didn't realize you're 
supposed to have a lot of one-liners about the world's tragedies and horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 While we had braced for guffaws, all we got was Hayden on Whitewater ("These 
law firms seem to have replaced the political parties and maybe even the 
networks as where things happen in America.") Not exactly material for Leno. 
And Hayden on American relations with China ("I think we should make human 
rights the cornerstone of American policy.") Nothing to make Arsenio jealous. 
And Hayden detailed his support of a plan to give scholarships to college 
students in exchange for three years service as police officers upon 
graduation. What would Letterman do with that? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Hayden's saving those thigh-slappers for the campaign trail.

GOP EFFORTS TO UNSEAT HARMAN MOVE INTO HIGH GEAR; POLITICS: RANCHO PALOS VERDES 
COUNCILWOMAN SUSAN BROOKS AND FORMER PALOS VERDES ESTATES COUNCILMAN RON 
FLORANCE SEEK REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks has canvassed South 
Bay's supermarkets and landmarks in her bid to unseat Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' opponent in the Republican primary, former Palos Verdes Estates 
Councilman Ron Florance, already has hung 1,000 signs throughout the 36th 
District, which stretches from Marina del Rey to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates, the only two Republicans to enter the race by last week's 
filing deadline, are quickly spreading their names and messages outside the 
peninsula. But political analysts agree that the winner of the GOP's June 7 
primary must not only emerge from that race relatively unscathed, but surmount 
another hurdle in seeking to unseat Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can establish name recognition," said H. Eric Schockman, a USC 
political science professor who has been following the race. "But you can't 
just let the voters know who you are. You've got to convince voters that there 
is a good reason to vote against an incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be a tough task, he said. When Harman announced her reelection bid 
two weeks ago, she already had a war chest of almost $500,000 and the 
endorsements of the South Bay's top aerospace executives. Even former Torrance 
Mayor Katy Geissert, a Republican, has crossed party lines and plans to back 
the first-term congresswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a betting man, I would say that Jane Harman is sitting very pretty 
right now," Schockman said. "But I know that you can't get too cocky this early 
in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is split almost evenly between the parties, with 40% registered 
as Republicans and 39% registered as Democrats. In the 1992 election, Harman 
benefited when Republicans divided over the issue of abortion. But the issue 
may be moot this time since both Brooks and Florance are abortion rights 
supporters, as is Harman. Still, this year's GOP challengers are not 100% 
harmonious. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, a former special education teacher, said Florance is the 
"old-fashioned Republican" who is depending on money and political handlers to 
carry him to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, an investment banker and financier, chipped in $150,000 of his own 
money in the race and estimates that he will have a war chest of $250,000 by 
the end of the month. Brooks has put $13,000 of her own money into the race, 
bringing her total raised to $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heart of our campaign is people, the heart of Ron Florance's campaign is 
money," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Florance defends spending his own money, saying it is proof to potential 
contributors that he is committed to the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Brooks) can beat Harman," he said. "I don't think she has the 
broad- based financial support to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, who reported spending $1.6 million to win the seat in 1992, declined 
to say how much she planned to spend on this election, although she predicted 
it would be an expensive race. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, Florance said he hopes to raise $500,000, a sum he said will be 
necessary to mount a serious challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do that by knocking on doors," he said. "You have got to go to the 
media to get the message across." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, either Republican could have a tough time if the California economy 
shows substantial signs of improvement by November. Harman, who voted for 
President Clinton's budget plan, says that such an economic turnaround will 
prove she made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "My budget vote, which is controversial, will prove to be a wise vote," Harman 
said. "(The) $500 million in deficit reduction, some of which has already 
occurred, I think is spurring the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks and Florance point to Harman's budget vote as one of her 
shortcomings. Both cite a Heritage Foundation study showing that the South Bay 
district will be hit with $1.1 billion in new taxes over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery "is the (Bush) Administration reflecting on the economy right 
now," Brooks said. "Over the long run, the tax plan will have a negative 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have a tax package," Florance said, "the (economic) cycle would 
be even more robust." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Republican candidates, in fact, are casting Harman as an 
inside-the-Beltway, Washington insider who sides with Clinton on almost all 
major votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jane Harman talks conservative Republican and then votes Clinton, tax and 
spend liberal," he said. "Jane Harman votes 90% of the time with the Clinton 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brooks: "She speaks just like a Republican. But she has a very different 
agenda than she espouses to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, however, denies that she gives blind support to the White House. She 
points to her efforts to seek greater cuts in the budget, which Clinton has 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subliminal theme (of her opponents) is: I am a Democrat and this is a 
district for Republicans," she said. "I am a representative, and I have fought 
for people who happen to be Democrats, Republicans and independents, with good 
results." 
</P>
<P>
 Also running in the 36th district are Libertarian Jack Tyler, Green Party 
candidate Robert (Bob) Long, and American Independent Joseph (Joe) Fields.

 Only hours after the massacre of dozens of Muslim worshipers in a mosque in 
Hebron, Jewish and Arab leaders in Los Angeles got together to decry the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, undaunted by the lack of communication between Israel and the Palestinian 
leadership, local representatives are taking their dialogue one step further 
with the establishment of a joint speakers bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was born at a joint dinner of Jewish and Arab groups in December, but 
it took on urgency after the Feb. 25 Hebron shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers -- Arabs and Jews -- will appear as a team before audiences at 
churches, synagogues, mosques, schools and community groups, said Monir Deeb, a 
board member of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are arguments, let it be," said Deeb, a Palestinian who works with 
an Israeli partner in a San Fernando Valley general contracting business. "This 
is a dialogue that people should be able to initiate, hopefully toward peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizing the effort are groups including the Anti-Discrimination Committee 
and local chapters of the National Assn. of Arab Americans, the American Jewish 
Congress and Americans for Peace Now, a support group for the Israeli peace 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to build a consensus to support the peace process in the 
United States, and that's the goal of (the) speakers bureau," said Rabbi Laura 
Geller, regional executive director of the Congress, a Westside-based 
organization that calls itself "the progressive voice in the Jewish community." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jews support the government of Israel, and Arab Americans support the 
initiatives of the Palestinian people, and therefore our involvement makes 
sense," she said. "We don't make policy, but our support is not an 
insignificant factor in the whole equation." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone supports the effort. David Lehrer, regional director of the 
Anti-Defamation League, said that his Jewish-sponsored organization has been 
sued by Deeb's group over allegations of spying by an ADL operative in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the statements and actions against the ADL, one must wonder about the 
seriousness of their commitment to dialogue with the Jewish community," Lehrer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Julian White, regional director of Americans for a Safe Israel, said he 
thought that joint appearances would send a misleading message about the 
position of American Jews. A significant number of Jews, he pointed out, oppose 
the surrender of any territory to Palestinian control -- a key component of the 
Middle East peace accord proposed in Washington in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reflects a total self-identification of those two Jewish organizations 
with the Arab position, and the Arab position is the same position as the PLO," 
he said. "We are certainly at the opposite pole in terms of the accord." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting sponsored by White's group Tuesday, West Bank settlers' spokesman 
Elyakim Ha'etzni told a friendly crowd of about 200 at the Beth Jacob synagogue 
in Beverly Hills that the peace process was "a sinister plan for the 
destruction of Israel by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that 33 Israeli Jews have been killed since Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in September, he urged American 
Jews to "use your influence on the American Administration, on the Israeli 
Embassy and the Israeli consulates. Don't let them get away with this. Help 
150,000 Jews whose safety is imperiled. We are holding the fort for all of 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha'etzni's call was the sort of thing that organizers of the speakers bureau 
hope to counteract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's going to be part of our discussion group," joked Gerald 
Bubis, the local chair of Americans for Peace Now. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubis said the goal of the speakers bureau is to help people understand their 
differences on the extent of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories 
and the final resolution of Jerusalem, among other issues, and to try to 
identify areas of agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not engaged in diplomacy but trying to sensitize," Bubis said. "What 
I'm afraid of is that each community is bleeding, metaphorically and literally, 
and each community is feeling more despair, and the Ha'etznis of the world can 
get many more people out and exercised than moderating speakers and moderate 
voices." 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of meetings to identify speakers within their own groups, the 
four sponsoring organizations have scheduled a joint session in April, with 
hopes of completing their training and taking their act on the road by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who invites them, they will go," said Tony Amsih, a Sherman Oaks real 
estate broker who is president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. 
of Arab Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the killings in Hebron, he said, "We feel the need to push 
forward and the sooner the better, not to give a chance to the opportunists to 
target the whole effort." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other outreach efforts have included expressions of sympathy by almost all the 
Jewish organizations in Los Angeles, said Dr. Maher Hothout, spokesman for the 
Islamic Center of Southern California, Los Angeles' largest mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciated that, although we indicated we need more than that," Hothout 
said. "We need to demand that the causes of the problem should be dealt with." 
Specifically, he said, the presence of armed Jewish settlers in the midst of 
the occupied territories must be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is intense disagreement over the future of the Middle East, he 
said, "the environment of discourse and debate is more in Los Angeles than in 
any other place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Jewish organizations have scheduled public forums on the consequences of 
the Hebron shooting, including a panel of rabbis of different political 
persuasions at 7 tonight at UCLA's Hillel Jewish Center, 900 Hilgard Ave., 
moderated by actor Richard Dreyfuss. Another forum is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. 
Tuesday at the Torah Ohr synagogue, 7200 Beverly Blvd., including talks on 
"Taking The Law Into One's Hands" and "Israel At The Crossroads: An Intense 
Struggle For Jewishness In The Holy Land."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; CAFE CLOSES AFTER OWNER GOES TO PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financially troubled Crenshaw Cafe, a popular eatery on the Crenshaw strip 
that served up lively conversation with its plates of soul food, has closed.  
</P>
<P>
 The fortunes of the cafe began a fast decline after owner Jamil Shabazz, 40, 
was sentenced to state prison in November on conspiracy and insurance fraud 
charges for his involvement in one of the largest auto insurance fraud rings in 
the country, according to the district attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Cafe head waiter Michael Garrison, who took over management after Shabazz was 
incarcerated, said dwindling business and increased overhead quickly 
overwhelmed him and forced the cafe to close March 3. "It's a shame, but there 
was nothing else to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owner Beryl Robinson, who also owns nearby Coley's Kitchen Jamaican 
restaurant, said the cafe had fallen far behind on its $1,600-a-month rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old cafe was famous for its soul-food cooking that, following 
Shabazz's Muslim beliefs, eschewed pork and emphasized vegetables. Alongside 
the grits smothered in gravy and short ribs were ground turkey burgers, egg and 
broccoli scrambles and steamed vegetable plates.  
</P>
<P>
 As famous as the food was the handwriting that covered the walls at the 
10-table restaurant. Signatures and testaments to the cafe's culinary virtues 
were scrawled in ink by Muhammad Ali, jazz pianist Billy Childs, ex-Laker star 
Michael Cooper, the Dorsey High basketball team, singer Lou Rawls, and rappers 
Kool Moe Dee and L. L. Cool J, to name just a few. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-profile crowd, which included many members of the local Muslim 
community, guaranteed spirited conversations. Nick Cates of North Hills, a 
longtime patron, said he often dropped by after church on Sunday, Bible in 
hand, and wound up in friendly philosophical debates with Muslim customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was always some kind of dialogue happening," Cates said. "The cafe had 
a cast of characters I didn't see anywhere else." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: WILSHIRE CENTER; RED LINE CONSTRUCTION SOUND PROVOKES 
RADISSON'S FURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When guests at the Radisson Wilshire Plaza Hotel lose sleep because of the 
noise from the Metro Red Line construction site beneath their windows, the 
hotel loses business. 
</P>
<P>
 Since subway construction between Normandie and Western avenues began more 
than two years ago, dust, noise, construction platforms, heavy equipment and 
traffic obstructions have interfered with commerce on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel, at 3515 Wilshire Blvd., has been particularly hard hit and in 
January presented the Metropolitan Transportation Authority with an $18-million 
claim for damages, including loss of business and business goodwill, property 
damage, increased maintenance costs, noise-related stress and impaired access 
to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is reviewing the claim, said Steven Chesser, an agency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Many regular guests and larger clients -- including one tour agency that 
booked 6,000 rooms annually -- have said they will not stay at the hotel until 
major construction is completed sometime in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Mooney, the hotel's public affairs director, said the hotel does not 
expect subway construction to be invisible, but "we expect reasonable efforts 
to mitigate the impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's claim states that the MTA has been lax in forcing the project 
contractor, Tutor-Saliba Corp., to abide by contractual obligations to lessen 
the impact of disruptions. Moreover, the agency itself responds to community 
concerns only when pressured by city officials, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's specific complaints include construction begun earlier or finished 
later than within specified work hours, obstructions to the hotel's driveways 
and surrounding sidewalks, and the MTA's failure to heed independent 
recommendations for reducing the effects of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials have previously acknowledged noise problems but say they are now 
taking a more aggressive trouble-shooting approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Construction is a messy job," said Dennis Alexander, a contract engineer with 
Parsons-Dillingham, the company hired by the agency to inspect subway 
construction. "It's never going to look pretty but we're going to try to 
address specific problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney said: "Talk is cheap, but if it's not accompanied by action, it could 
be very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 At an MTA meeting organized last month to deal with community concerns, 
officials from the agency were unprepared to answer numerous questions about 
its loan program for impacted businesses. The program is administered by 
East-West Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA scheduled another community meeting for 6 p.m. Monday at the hotel to 
discuss construction claims and the loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Wayne Williams, the Radisson's vice president of operations, said in a 
letter to the MTA after the Feb. 17 meeting, "a concerned community on 
Wilshire" is turning into "an angry community." 
</P>
<P>
 The loan program was started last year. As of March 9, three businesses had 
received loans of $25,000 or $50,000; 13 other loan applications are under 
review, Chesser said. The MTA has also made two separate large loans outside 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney said that the hotel has not applied for a loan through the program 
because applicants must waive the right to sue the MTA. "Our damages won't be 
addressed with a loan," he said. "What can a loan do to bring people back? We 
want compensation for damages." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Nate Holden told Wilshire Boulevard merchants that he has 
urged the MTA to implement a construction mitigation program similar to the 
$27.7-million program planned for the Hollywood Boulevard construction phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood program includes some measures for noise reduction and provides 
for a full-time MTA staff to deal with public complaints as well as a citizens 
committee to monitor mitigation measures. JAKE DOHERTY

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * RENTAL REGISTRATION FEE -- Gave preliminary approval to an ordinance that 
would waive the 1994 registration fee for rental units declared uninhabitable 
due to the earthquake, in cases in which the units are to remain vacant for the 
reminder of the year. If a unit is repaired and re-rented, the registration fee 
will be due the first day of occupancy, and deemed delinquent if not paid after 
45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * POLICE EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION -- Approved using $208,000 in the Police 
Department's General Service Fund to employ 10 non-city, union personnel to 
install communications equipment in 353 newly purchased black-and-white police 
cars. The installation work is usually done by police personnel, but due to the 
large number of vehicles, hiring outside help was judged the quickest way to 
get the cars onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * SURPLUS EQUIPMENT SALE -- Approved the sale of surplus city equipment, such 
as tables, desks, chairs, and file cabinets, to the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for $1 per item. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * WALKING TO WORK -- Endorsed a state Senate bill that would exempt from 
taxation employer subsides to employees who walk or bike to work. Some 
employers pay employees to car-pool or take public transit to their jobs, and 
this money is exempt from state taxation. In opposing the effort to expand the 
scope of this exemption, Councilmen Nate Holden said: "A person with a job gets 
paid to work, not to walk to work." Passed 9-1.

FOR YEARS, THE CABLE TV INDUSTRY WAS ON ITS OWN, FREE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AS IT 
SAW FIT. BUT THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPPED IN AND GAVE CITIES THE POWER 
TO REGULATE RATES AND SERVICES. AND CUSTOMERS HAVE FLEXED THEIR MUSCLES AS 
WELL, SENDING A CLEAR . . . ; MESSAGE TO THE MEDIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five times a day, Andy Steuer picks up his office phone, dials the local cable 
television company and clicks a stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a test. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at Century Cable in Santa Monica are supposed to answer customer 
calls within 30 seconds under new federal rules that give cities the power to 
regulate their local cable companies. Steuer, a part-time staffer for the city 
of Beverly Hills, notes the elapsed time, says thanks and hangs up. He finds 
that the company flunks a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the brave new world of cable TV regulation. The stopwatch checks 
are just one sign of cities' new regulatory authority over cable companies. The 
local power was granted by a 1992 federal law that reimposed regulation on 
cable firms following five years of unfettered operation -- and, according to 
many customers -- skyrocketing prices and grudging service. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, both with long histories of friction with 
Century over rates and service, have joined a handful of trailblazing cities 
around the country to make use of this new clout. This month, they ordered 
Century to cut the basic rate it charges residents. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a complicated new job; most Westside cities have hired consultants to 
guide them through the blizzard of confusing rate rules. Local officials were 
once powerless to offer much more than sympathy to residents upset with prices. 
Now they stand to accept glory or fire for their decisions on cable service -- 
a hot-button issue that infuriates Westsiders more than just about any other 
local problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood officials last year helped direct hundreds of residents' 
complaints to the federal government after Century repackaged its channels in 
such a way that it cost about $8 per month more to keep the same programming. 
Lawyer Pamela Koslyn filed her complaint, and since then has taken to 
scribbling nasty taunts on the bottom of her payment checks to Century. Other 
outraged residents cut off service altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen an issue that has more people more angry and enraged than 
cable," said Helen Goss, who oversees cable operations at West Hollywood City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The air was downright victorious March 7 when the West Hollywood City Council 
ordered Century to trim nearly $4 from its $24.08-a-month price for basic cable 
and to pay refunds back to the Sept. 1 start of the regulation law. 
Long-stewing residents, some of whom even brought cable bills to the session, 
applauded the unanimous vote as if the playground bully had been vanquished at 
last. The next afternoon, the Beverly Hills City Council ordered its own $1.68 
rollback -- to $22.40 a month -- plus refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 Century executives plan to appeal the rate-rollback orders, saying the two 
cities overstepped their authority. Rates won't change until the appeal is 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompting all this is the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition 
Act of 1992, which reversed a 1984 law that had unshackled the cable industry 
from local regulation. Facing a clamor over rising cable rates and monopoly 
conditions across most of the nation, Democratic lawmakers turned cable 
regulation into an emotional election issue and overrode a veto by 
then-President George Bush, the only time Congress succeeded in doing so during 
his four years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The industry argued that the rates had paid for more and better programming 
and warned that regulation would leave it handcuffed as satellite and other 
technologies elbowed into the video market. If prices were unreasonable, asks 
Continental Cablevision Vice President John Gibbs, why did the number of Los 
Angeles subscribers double over five years? 
</P>
<P>
 The law, whose central goal was to lower cable prices by 10%, resulted last 
year in 500 pages of regulations from the Federal Communications Commission 
that set off a stampede for consultants who could decipher them. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, cities and towns oversaw local cable operations through franchise 
agreements with operators, contracts that provide the communities a fee of 3% 
to 5% of company revenues. But cities had no say over rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now communities can set rates for basic service using FCC-devised "benchmarks" 
that vary from system to system. Basic service includes over-the-air broadcast 
channels, plus public access and government channels. The FCC regulates 
satellite channels such as CNN or MTV. Pay channels such as HBO and Playboy and 
pay-per-view channels are unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also laid out strict standards for customer services, such as 
telephone-answering time or responding to outages. Before the 30-second federal 
standard took effect, Century had two minutes to answer the phone under its 
franchise agreement with Beverly Hills. While the law toughens standards, it 
still isn't clear what teeth it gives local officials who want to enforce them. 
Beverly Hills may soon consider fining Century for recent lapses in answering 
the telephone, but it would use its old franchise-agreement powers, not the new 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 All Westside cities have made the first moves to regulate rates, but none have 
jumped as fast as West Hollywood and Beverly Hills -- a reaction to fierce 
public pressure after years of what Beverly Hills Councilman Allan L. Alexander 
calls "a rocky romance" with Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a history of raising rates and a history of bad service," said West 
Hollywood City Councilman John Heilman, noting that the city almost dropped the 
Century franchise because of dissatisfaction six years ago. "We finally have 
the ability to regulate their rates and roll back the rates. That's what people 
were screaming about." 
</P>

 If Westsiders seem to scream louder than most about cable -- even over rate 
hikes that amount to mere pennies a day -- there are reasons. For one, it is 
next to impossible to get a clear TV picture without cable in West Hollywood, 
Beverly Hills and Malibu (which is served by Falcon Cable) because hills nearby 
block broadcast signals. Cable has succeeded so well that people now view it as 
a utility they can't live without. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't have cable, I don't have reception," Koslyn said. "It's a 
necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 For another, as in most of the country, Westside cable firms operate as de 
facto monopolies in their franchise areas. Besides West Hollywood and Beverly 
Hills, Century serves Santa Monica, Marina del Rey and most of West Los 
Angeles. Falcon has Malibu and a tiny chunk of Pacific Palisades. Continental 
Cablevision covers a wide swath from Hollywood to Culver City and Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 That means customers can't switch carriers when their bill goes up or the 
service technician shows up late. 
</P>
<P>
 "(People) get worked up about it because they're trapped," said Tracy Westen, 
a communications lawyer who teaches at USC. "There's nowhere they can go." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also see psychology at work in this love-hate relationship with cable; 
viewers can't complain to Dan Rather, but they can call the local cable company 
that sends them a bill every month. Others still resent paying for TV at all 
and few customers would ever think to credit their cable firm for a great HBO 
movie. "It's kind of an invisible medium," Westen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Century quieted much of the previous criticism over the past five years by 
pouring $100 million for new wiring -- allowing it to carry more channels and 
improve picture quality -- around Los Angeles. It even began winning praise for 
treating customers better. Subscribers who once waited 20 minutes or more to 
get an answer, were now reaching a human voice in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year the firm generated a tidal wave of complaints when it rebundled 
some satellite channels into higher-priced, optional "a-la-carte" packages. 
Many subscribers howled that the move was simply a bid to escape local 
regulation. During public hearings in West Hollywood last fall, company 
officials sat through scoldings from customers who were paying more to buy "a 
la carte" channels that once were part of their basic service. 
</P>
<P>
 The company says the shift is part of a coming trend to let people tailor what 
they watch and avoid paying for shows they don't. Costs rose for some viewers 
to cover price decreases mandated by the new regulations, said Century Vice 
President Maggie Bellville, who runs operations in Southern California. 
Bellville said about two-thirds of customers saw prices fall because of new 
rules barring charges for items such as extra outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people's bills went down. Those are people we don't hear from," 
Bellville said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate cuts ordered by Beverly Hills and West Hollywood may not be the last 
on the Westside. Other cities in the area are reviewing their cable rates as 
the first step toward a possible rollback. In some cases the cable companies 
are still preparing the financial forms used by cities to see if current rates 
are within the federal limits. To complicate matters, the FCC is expected this 
week to issue new rules that will cut rates 7% more and tighten control over 
pricing of the disputed "a-la-carte" channels. 
</P>
<P>
 While cities are enjoying the long-awaited chance to rein in cable operators, 
their powers are limited to overseeing basic cable, not the deluxe channels. 
Rates cannot be set lower than the federal guidelines allow, no matter how loud 
the grass-roots outcry for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only do what the law allows," said Heilman, the West Hollywood 
councilman. "I'm sure there'll be some people in the community who don't 
understand that and want us to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 And officials may find themselves on the hot seat for granting rate hikes that 
are warranted under the law -- such as increases to cover the costs of 
inflation, fees paid to carry broadcast stations and new channels. "That makes 
the local government officials look like the bad guys," Heilman acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills activist Thomas A. White was on hand to back the City Council 
when it voted the rate cut two weeks ago, but he fears that the council's 
pro-business ethos might keep it from being an aggressive watchdog for cable 
consumers. White said his group, the Municipal League of Beverly Hills, may ask 
future council candidates to address cable service questions much as it grills 
them on other key local issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials question whether small city staffs are equipped to 
implement the complex FCC rules and keep up with the onslaught of new video 
technology. "We're imposing a layer of marketing and technology on the cities 
in areas that are very complicated," said Peggy M. Keegan, vice president of 
the California Cable Television Assn. "I don't know if it's too much for them, 
but I think it's a very challenging situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica is among the long list of cities paying lawyers and accountants 
to wade through company financial filings -- the first step in determining 
rates. "This is all new to us," said city cable manager Laura Greenfield. 
"Perhaps once we're educated we can do it on our own. But at this point . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem a mountain of work to ensure a decent price for Beavis and 
Butt-head -- that's because cable is not considered a luxury anymore. Angry 
viewers may scrawl hateful notes and shake their fists at public meetings. But 
even critics like Pamela Koslyn cannot imagine life without cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing without cable?" she asked. "It's just human nature. You get something. 
You get used to it. You start to like it. It becomes necessary." A Westside 
Cable TV Guide 
</P>
<P>
 CENTURY CABLE Westside communities served: West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, 
Santa Monica, West Los Angeles, Marina del Rey, Pacific Palisades. Subscribers: 
120,000 (includes small part of San Fernando Valley) Basic price: $22.80 to 
$24.08 a month for 31 to 42 channels, depending on area 
</P>
<P>
 CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION Westside communities served: Hollywood, Culver City, 
Mid-Wilshire, Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Palms, Venice. Subscribers: 100,000 
Basic price: $8.10 to $9.23 a month for 22 to 24 channels, depending on area 
</P>
<P>
 FALCON CABLE Westside communities served: Malibu, Topanga and part of Pacific 
Palisades. Subscribers: 6,000 Basic price: $28.90 for 31 channels 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The federal government defines basic cable as broadcast channels, 
public-access and channels used by local government. Basic packages cited above 
vary widely from company to company. Some also offer additional channels, such 
as home shopping and sports channels as part of basic. Prices don't include 
converter boxes. Subscriber figures are only estimates because franchises 
extend beyond Westside in most cases.

FOR SENIORS; A PICTURE OF A LIFE STAMPED BY HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Fabian was not on Schindler's list. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not one of the Jews saved from the Nazis by industrialist Oskar 
Schindler, whose story is recounted in the hit film "Schindler's List." Neither 
did he have enough money to buy his way out of Nazi-controlled Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 What he had was a trade. He was a tailor, and the British needed skilled 
people like him to teach British professionals how to use their hands for the 
war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Under harassment from authorities, he had fled Lithuania for Berlin because 
the Germans were still allowing Jews to leave there as long as they did not 
take any money with them. There, he met two Jewish tailors from Great Britain 
who were recruiting Jewish tradesmen. He was given free passage to England and 
placed in the Kitchener detainee camp in Sandwich, England. He taught lawyers 
how to cut patterns and sew. 
</P>
<P>
 For Fabian it was a blessing. He survived the war, met his wife, Clara, in 
Britain and later, the 80-year-old says in his thick Lithuanian accent, "became 
100% American." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam also had a hobby that was passed to him from his grandfather and 
transcends age and nationality. He's a stamp collector. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazis destroyed the original collection, but when Sam came to America in 
1949 he resumed collecting. And he began a new life. It was 1939. He was 25 
years old. His immigration papers, carefully preserved in an album, say 
"refugee from Nazi oppression." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what was going to happen," he said of the harassment in Lithuania, 
"because the Gentile people in my town of Tilset, Lithuania, told us to 'get 
out before you get killed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Sam and Clara, who had fled Hungary to England, do not talk much about 
the past. Not that it is a taboo, but the Fabians, who live in West Hollywood, 
are more interested in the present than in the past -- although Sam still keeps 
a sewing room complete with a Singer sewing machine almost as old as he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing better than this machine," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the stamps -- all 20,000 of them -- carefully preserved in scores of 
albums according to country of origin that reveal Sam's passion. He brings out 
album after album, each stamp carefully placed, each album fastidiously 
organized. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a year ago, he was teaching stamp collecting to a group of youngsters 
ages 7 to 12 at the Brentwood Library. "Hitler took my first collection; this 
is my second collection. My father taught me, and I teach children and my 
grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can learn history from stamps, geography, art. . . . You can learn about 
famous people. This is a good thing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabian's life-size photograph hangs in an exhibition at Santa Monica Place 
titled "The Age of Enlightenment." 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer David Peevers wrote in the text accompanying the picture: "You 
might pass Sam Fabian on the street and not notice him. This show of 28 
profiles of older people allows you to see and experience these incredible 
people and the lives they have lived. Their stories could get lost because 
there's a perception about being old that says this person doesn't have a lot 
to offer. This show says pay attention, open your eyes, talk to these people, 
be open to them and you're going to learn a great deal about life and living. I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition runs until March 31 at Santa Monica Place. For information, 
call Emeritus College, (310) 319-4567, or Santa Monica Place, (310) 394-5451.

YOUR MORTGAGE; SERVICE KEEPS EYE ON BORROWER CREDIT HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can call it Guardian Angel. Or see it as Big Brother. Either way, it will 
allow your home mortgage lender to do something it's never done before: To 
monitor your ongoing personal financial status during the course of your 
mortgage, scanning for early warning signs in your credit performance that 
could help avoid late mortgage payments -- or a costly foreclosure -- down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on here? It's called "credi-track," and it's a sophisticated new 
electronic service being offered to major lenders nationwide. It enables 
mortgage firms to tap into existing borrowers' credit files at periodic 
intervals to make sure that nothing has changed dramatically for the worse 
since the loan was first approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the traditional lender-borrower relationship, by contrast, the lender 
checks credit, income and debt-ratio levels just once -- at the loan 
application stage. After that, you're off the screen. That is, unless you miss 
monthly payments -- at which point you may be up to your neck in financial hot 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate, say you're a first-time home buyer. A year after you got your 
mortgage, your financial world starts slowly unraveling. Your spouse is laid 
off by his or her employer, cutting family income by 40%. Your child racks up 
monstrous -- and uninsured -- dental bills. Your monthly outstanding 
charge-account balances mushroom, and you eventually begin to miss mandatory 
monthly payments. You keep mailing in your largest and most important bill -- 
the mortgage on your home -- but your financial squeeze is making even that 
nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're like most borrowers, you never contact your mortgage lender about 
your personal financial problems. You don't want to let on that you're no 
longer the sterling credit risk that you were back at the application stage. 
Instead, you slide toward the edge, miss a couple of mortgage payments, and 
you're suddenly on the icy downhill slope to foreclosure proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 That wouldn't necessarily happen to you if you were on the new tracking 
system, say its promoters. Your lender probably would have been in touch with 
you long before you stopped paying the mortgage. The credit-monitoring system 
could have spotted the sudden surges in credit card and installment account 
balances. It might have picked up your spouse's employment change. 
</P>
<P>
 With those facts in hand, the lender could then have contacted you to discuss 
possible remedies. Among the options: temporary or permanent recasting of your 
mortgage terms to reduce your monthly payment; stretching out the length of the 
loan; professional credit counseling sessions to help you work through your 
entire financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound attractive? Or a little scary? Or perhaps both? The system's developer, 
Bill Effinger of La Jolla-based Credit Technologies Inc., concedes that "to 
some people it might seem a little Big Brotherish at first." But the reality is 
that under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act mortgage lenders already have 
access to existing borrowers' commercially maintained credit bureau files. 
</P>
<P>
 But checking up on borrowers on a regular basis is impractical, given the vast 
numbers of loan accounts in a typical lender's portfolio. Nor has there been a 
commercially available system that hones in on periodic changes in individual 
borrowers' "credit scores" -- indexes of credit-worthiness that rise and fall 
over time. 
</P>
<P>
 The new credit-tracking system is directly on-line with the three major credit 
repositories -- TRW, Equifax and TransUnion, according to Effinger. It uses 
sets of "alert triggers" during portfolio "scans" to identify possible problems 
with borrowers. Among the triggers that prompt what he calls a "closer look": 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four or more recent credit bureau inquiries -- a sign that the borrower is 
actively and abruptly in the market for additional credit or a major purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 25% or higher increase in total household debt from the last scan, or 
from the date the loan went on the lender's books. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two or more late payments on non-mortgage installment debts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Changes in employment status that could have a negative effect on 
credit-worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The system scans samples of a loan portfolio using criteria set by the lender. 
For example, it might credit-check 50% of all borrowers classified as C's -- 
borderline acceptable risks at the application stage. Just 10% of top-quality A 
borrowers and 20% of B borrowers might be selected for scans. 
</P>
<P>
 By simply spotting one or more foreclosure-prone borrowers a month, says 
Effinger, participating lenders can more than pay for the costs of the 
credit-monitoring system -- roughly $69 per loan for three scans over an 
18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 But are electronic credit barometers as good for consumers as Effinger claims 
they are for lenders? Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the 
Washington-based Consumer Federation of America, calls the program "possibly 
very helpful" for home buyers who run into financial trouble. But he says he's 
"worried about the gray area this gets into as far as privacy." Brobeck would 
like lenders to survey their customers' attitudes about financial data privacy 
before signing up for the program, and would prefer it be "offered as an 
option" to borrowers who expressly agree to it. 
</P>
<P>
 But an expert in central city, lower-income mortgage lending, consultant 
Bernice Sanders Smoot of Washington, has no reservations about credit-tracking. 
She calls it "just what we've needed" to persuade reluctant bankers that they 
can minimize risks -- and help their customers -- by monitoring home buyers' 
finances.

OLD PAINT, YOUNG VICTIMS; THE NO. 1 SOURCE OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING IS 
HOUSEHOLD PAINT APPLIED 15 TO 100 YEARS AGO. AN ESTIMATED 3 MILLION CHILDREN IN 
THE U.S. SUFFER FROM LEAD CONTAMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The symptoms that plagued Elizabeth Jimenez's 2-year-old twin daughter weren't 
really out of the ordinary. The irritability, bouts of insomnia and refusals to 
eat all mimicked the "terrible twos" -- a stage most parents of toddlers know 
all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 Her pediatrician told her not to worry. But when little Alexandra vomited a 
dark substance, Jimenez became alarmed. A close family friend suggested the 
mother of five have her daughter tested for lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The test turned Jimenez's life upside-down. It showed that Alexandra was 
suffering a high level of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," Jimenez recalled. "I was scared. I was really scared." 
</P>
<P>
 She had good reason to be. Apparently, when the family lived in an 80-year-old 
house in Pomona, Alexandra had ingested invisible lead dust from the painted 
walls. She also chewed on lead-tainted woodwork. Enough poison had entered her 
small body to cause some neurological damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A lead level higher than 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood is considered 
unsafe by the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Alexandra's 
blood measures 49 micrograms per deciliter of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 (A microgram is to a deciliter about what an eyedropper of liquid is to a 
gallon.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 years after lead poisoning in children was first recognized, the 
metal continues to contaminate an estimated 3 million young children in 
California and the nation, inflicting upon them, most experts believe, learning 
disabilities, hyperactivity, lowered IQ, impaired motor coordination and in the 
most serious cases mental retardation and even death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding lots of kids with lead poisoning who basically have had their 
lives limited," said Dr. Sue Binder, chief of the CDC Lead Poisoning branch. 
"The fact that it's all preventable -- that we don't have to have poisoned 
children -- makes it a real tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the foremost preventable health hazard to children," agreed Don Ryan, 
executive director of the nonprofit public interest group, Alliance to End 
Childhood Lead Poisoning in Washington. "It eclipses every other health 
hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the No. 1 source of childhood lead poisoning is household paint applied 
between 15 to 100 years ago, with the older paint used before 1950 usually 
containing the highest lead levels, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The paint itself isn't the problem. It's the oxidation and deterioration of 
the paint, which creates a nearly invisible, highly toxic dust that settles 
inside the house -- on floors, walls, furniture and toys. Young children often 
put dust-coated toys and fingers in their mouths and ingest the lead that way. 
Other children get it by eating paint chips and chewing on such lead-painted 
surfaces as window sills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake is certain to have made matters worse, kicking up 
lead dust and cracking old paint as it twisted apart thousands of structures 
and jolted many more. 
</P>
<P>
 And the post-quake repairs are only worsening the problem, said Margo Derry, 
acting director of the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program for the 
County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a problem before with people renovating houses," Derry said. "Now with 
the earthquake and all the (repair) work going on, the problem is infinite." 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Health Services officials recorded about 700 cases of 
childhood lead poisoning statewide in 1993, with 12% of those cases considered 
medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, 529 children were diagnosed as lead poisoned last year, 
about 60% of them from paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest were contaminated by a number of other lead sources: soil, 
lead-tainted home remedies -- especially popular with some Latino and Asian 
communities -- pottery and china finished with unsafe lead glazes and lead 
solders in some canned goods and plumbing fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 But health officials believe that the diagnosed cases represent only a 
fraction of the actual number of poisoned children. They expect childhood lead 
poisoning cases to soar as routine testing of all children up to 6 years old 
takes hold in California. 
</P>
<P>
 It's estimated more than a half-million California children face the risk of 
lead poisoning. Many of those afflicted with the condition don't look or act 
sick. The disease offers no definitive symptoms, except at its most acute 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times children can be exposed to lead and it's causing an adverse 
neuro-psychological effect and you wouldn't really know it because the children 
don't become symptomatic," said Bob Schlag, head of the Lead Hazard Reduction 
Department of the California Department of Health Services. "What we're 
concerned about are the subtle cognitive deficits in children." 
</P>
<P>
 Testing for lead poisoning, he said, is the only way to detect the disease and 
his office now recommends every child be tested at least once, with regular 
testing for those exposed to greater lead hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Academy of Pediatrics revised its policy on blood lead testing in 
July and now recommends that all children be tested at about 1 year of age for 
elevated levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead poisoning in children was first recognized as a serious health hazard 
early in this century. Worldwide, a number of countries, including Great 
Britain, Greece, Tunisia, Spain, Poland, Cuba and Yugoslavia banned lead paint 
for indoor use or restricted children's exposure to it in the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, however, it wasn't until 1978 that the U.S. Consumer 
Products Safety Commission finally restricted the use of lead in household 
paint. Shortly after, leaded gasoline -- the other main source of lead 
contamination outside the workplace -- was banned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one giant public health triumph of the late '70s and early '80s was 
taking lead out of gasoline," said Ryan. "Population-wide, average blood-lead 
levels plummeted by more than half." 
</P>
<P>
 But because lead-based paint remains in half of the 104 million dwelling units 
nationwide, according to federal estimates, the childhood lead poisoning 
problem didn't go away, while much of the attention given the issue did. 
</P>
<P>
 That began changing in 1988, in part because of a report published by the 
federal Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry that said in 1984, 15% 
of U.S. children had blood lead levels high enough to affect their cognitive 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the study showed that while the problem does indeed 
disproportionately affect children from impoverished families who live in 
older, dilapidated housing, lead poisoning isn't restricted to the urban poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real overpowering data," Binder said. "As people began to look, they 
began to find more and more cases, not only in the cities but in suburban homes 
that were being renovated. Whole families of kids were being poisoned because 
of the things people were doing to their homes. The recognition of how 
widespread it was became a catalyst for action." 
</P>
<P>
 That helped bring about the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act 
of 1992, also known as Title X, a far-reaching federal law that eventually will 
affect virtually everyone, including homeowners, landlords and tenants. It will 
bring about profound changes in the prevention of lead poisoning -- including 
mandatory real estate disclosure laws and warning requirements for the sale or 
lease of any house or apartment built before 1978. That portion of the law will 
take effect in October, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now in California, lead-based paint is lumped together with other 
environmental hazards in the 1993 disclosure form issued by California 
Department of Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The childhood lead poisoning issue has not received as much attention in 
California as it has on the East Coast, where a number of local and state 
agencies have in place aggressive lead prevention and abatement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlag says that's because California's houses are on average newer than those 
nationwide, leading many to wrongly assume that lead poisoning isn't an issue 
in the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the unfortunate myths that childhood lead poisoning is only a 
problem in the East," Schlag said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, there are more than a million homes built before 1950 
that are known to contain the highest levels of lead. Further, many more built 
as late as 1978 also contain lead paint, although the amount of lead used in 
the paint is probably much less than that used in older paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you own a home that was built before 1978, there's a very good chance that 
you're going to find lead in the paint," said Janet Comey, chief of the Lead 
Poisoning Abatement Program for the County of Los Angeles Department of Health 
Services. "If you have children under the age of 6 and you have peeling, 
chipping paint, you should have some concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Lead is most dangerous to children under 6 years old. That's because it 
attacks the brain and nervous system. Children between 1 and 3 years old, like 
Alexandra Jimenez, are most susceptible to the metal because their neurological 
systems are rapidly developing and because they're more likely to put 
lead-tainted objects in their mouths or to chew on contaminated surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a child is identified as lead poisoned, the case is reported to the 
county Health Department for further action. 
</P>
<P>
 If the child has a blood level higher than 45 micrograms per deciliter of 
blood, as was the case with Alexandra, the child is usually prescribed a 
chelating agent, either intravenously at a hospital or orally at home, which 
helps remove some of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandra got the latter treatment and her mother had to give the sick toddler 
capsules three times a day for 19 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "They smelled like sulfur and she would scream and sometimes vomit them up," 
Jimenez said of the medication. "While she was taking those pills and getting 
blood tests once a week, it got to the point where we'd just drive past the 
doctor's office and she would break out crying." 
</P>
<P>
 For less serious cases, there is no active medical treatment, said Derry, of 
the L.A. County health department. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no further exposure, what seems to work well is health education 
for parents," she said. "We talk to parents about the circumstances of their 
child's exposure and we try to mitigate that exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, any family with a lead-poisoned child is assigned a 
public health nurse and specialist who make a visit to the child's home. The 
team interviews the parents and inspects the home to find the source or sources 
of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, health officials find that the child's home is free of lead 
contamination and that the youngster is picking up the lead at a preschool or 
relative's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. County Department of Health Services then orders the owner of the 
contaminated property to eliminate the hazard, which can be very costly 
depending upon how extensive the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is work with the owners," said county lead poisoning 
chief Comey. "We're trying to come up with a sensible way where people can 
afford to do these abatements." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, she said, there are no government loan programs or other 
financial assistance aimed specifically at private lead abatement work. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say Title X will eventually establish an infrastructure for dealing 
with the lead poisoning problem at all levels before children become sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we'd like to do is prevent the lead from coming into the child's 
environment and we wouldn't have to do the blood tests we're doing now," said 
Schlag, of the state health department. "Ultimately that's our long-term 
vision. In the meantime, a huge population is being exposed. Before we get the 
lead out of the environment, several generations will be passing through at the 
risk stage." 
</P>
<P>
 For Alexandra Jimenez, now 3 years old, the most visible sign of her lead 
poisoning is her slower verbal development, which has fallen behind that of her 
twin sister. But whether the damage is permanent remains to be seen and her 
family is hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately," said Elizabeth Jimenez, "I think I found it soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Dealing with lead hazards in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. FACTS ABOUT LEAD 
</P>
<P>
 * As an element, inorganic lead cannot be processed by current technology and 
destroyed. It will continue to be a potential hazard in some form forever. 
</P>
<P>
 * Humans do not have natural defenses against lead exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 * The human body can accumulate lead over a lifetime and does so even with 
minimal exposure. For humans to experience the adverse effects of lead 
exposure, they need not be exposed to large quantities of lead at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Estimates of lead exposure cases greatly understate the cumulative effect of 
a persistent and pervasive pollutant such as lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lead knows no socioeconomic or demographic boundary. It affects children and 
adults from a wide range of backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lead serves no physiological purpose in the human body. The presence of lead 
in humans in any amount is not good. Lead levels in some segments of American 
society are 3,000% to 6,000% higher than that of pre-industrial humans. LEAD 
EXPOSURE 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 17% of all children in the United States are exposed to lead in some 
form, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report to 
Congress in 1987. Lead poisoning is a common occurrence that seems, at the 
outset, harmless. It is the accumulation of lead in the body that can cause 
serious medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE: 
</P>
<P>
 LEADED PAINT -- An estimated 12 million 7-year-olds in the United States have 
potentially been exposed to lead. Lead in paint is ingested by children as dust 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
 WATER PIPES -- An estimated 3.8 million children have drinking water with 
dangerously high lead levels. Older homes and buildings may still use lead 
waterpipes. 
</P>
<P>
 FOOD -- Most children under 6 in the United States are potentially exposed to 
lead in food at some level. An estimated 1 million children are exposed to 
enough lead in food to suffer a low level of poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 GASOLINE -- Some 5.6 million children under 7 years old are potentially 
exposed to lead left over from now-banned leaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 POTTERY -- Handcrafted pottery and china dishes with decorative paintings 
applied on top of the glaze are primary sources of lead exposure. Dishes with 
coroded glaze should also be avoided. Avoid using questionable dishes to heat 
or cook food. 
</P>
<P>
 ETHNIC REMEDIES -- Azarcon, a bright orange powder, and Greta, a yellow 
powder, are two of the most common substances containing lead. Both remedies 
are used in the Latino community for intestinal illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 SOIL -- Soil normally contains low levels of lead. The accumulation of chipped 
paint and paint dust in soil around the house increases the level of exposure 
to children. WHO'S AFFECTED 
</P>
<P>
 Infants and young children are most susceptible to lead poisoning. And because 
lead can easily penetrate the placenta, a developing fetus also faces a higher 
risk of lead poisoning. The primary organ affected by lead poisoning is the 
brain and central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MAJOR HEALTH EFFECTS: 
</P>
<P>
 * Extremely severe poisoning can induce coma, convulsions and profound, 
irreversible mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lower levels of lead exposure can slow cognitive development in children, 
reduce IQ scores and impair hearing. Prenatal lead exposure can also cause 
retardation in the mental and physical development of a child through at least 
2 years.

HOT PROPERTY: 'DRACULA' BITES ON FIXER CONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor GEORGE HAMILTON has purchased a condo in the same high-rise building 
overlooking Beverly Hills where he has been leasing, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, who has hosted such TV specials as "Comedy Battle of the Sexes" and 
"Dracula: Live From Transylvania," appeared in the TV movies "Caution: Murder 
Can Be Hazardous to Your Health" (1991) and "Poker Alice" (1987), co-starring 
Elizabeth Taylor. He starred in the film "Love at First Bite" (1979) and was in 
the series "Spies" and "Dynasty." 
</P>
<P>
 The unit that Hamilton bought has two bedrooms and a den in 2,100 square feet. 
He paid close to the asking price of $569,000, entering escrow the day of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "George bought the condo as an investment. He'll fix it up, live in it for 
awhile, then maybe sell it next year," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The condo, which is on the 23rd floor and has what is described as "a head-on 
city view," is in a nearly 150-unit, full-service building built in 1968. 
Hamilton will continue to live in his leased, one-bedroom quarters on another 
of the upper floors while redecorating his new place, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, 54, has lived on his yacht at Marina del Rey, and he has been the 
owner of record of two landmark Beverly Hills estates: Grayhall, a 
22,000-square-foot home built in 1909 and later owned by international 
financier Bernie Cornfeld and then Herbalife founder Mark Hughes, and the late 
Charlie Chaplin's home of almost 30 years, an 11,000-square-foot house built in 
1922. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton lived in the Chaplin home for several years and refurbished it, but a 
representative of the Philippines government, which assumed ownership in recent 
years, once claimed that the actor and then former Saudi arms dealer Adnan 
Khashoggi had held title for their friends, late former Philippines President 
Ferdinand Marcos and Marcos' wife, Imelda. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Young and Paul Czako of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, represented 
Hamilton in buying the condo, and Su-Z Schneider and Janna Wathen of Jon 
Douglas Co., Brentwood, represented the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Accused Hollywood madam HEIDI FLEISS' Beverly Hills-area home, which first 
came on the market in January, has been sold for just under its $1.8-million 
asking price, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Federico Pignatelli, head of a San Clemente manufacturing company of laser 
dental products, purchased the four-bedroom, 3,500-square-foot villa from 
Fleiss' father, Dr. Paul Fleiss, a Los Feliz pediatrician who had owned the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody is saying where Heidi has moved. "They're trying to keep a low profile 
until her case is resolved," said listing agent Kurt Rappaport of Nourmand & 
Associates, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros. chairman BOB DALY has purchased a home in Bel-Air in the 
mid-$5-million range, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly bought a Holmby Hills home in 1990 for $9.25 million, but then he and his 
wife, Nancy, divorced. L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan is her new companion, and 
songwriter Carole Bayer Sager is Bob Daly's. Sager, who was formerly married to 
composer Burt Bacharach, sold her Bel-Air home last fall for about $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate that Bob Daly just purchased is on two acres with a 500-foot-long 
driveway, city and ocean views, and a 7,000-square-foot house designed by the 
late architect Paul Williams. Daly plans to refurbish the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing designers/manufacturers Francine Browner and Neil Afromsky, a 
husband-and-wife team, sold the home, which they had purchased a couple of 
years ago for about $4.5 million, sources say. They plan to stay in the area 
but are also said to be considering the purchase of a ranch in the Santa Ynez 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Babajian and Linda May, both of Fred Sands Estates, Directors Office, had 
the listing, and Bob Daly was represented by June Scott of Douglas Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Late actor GARY COOPER'S Holmby Hills home has been sold for just under $3 
million, sources say. The house was originally listed four months ago at $3.45 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 With its high ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows and open floor plan, 
including a dining area that seats 18, the nearly 7,000-square-foot home is one 
of the best examples of late architect Quincy Jones' contemporary, light and 
bright style. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, where Cooper died in 1961, was built in 1953 as a showcase for the 
Oscar-winning actor's extensive art collection. There is also a sculpted, 
Versailles-like garden on the 1.6-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers are MCA senior executive Charles S. Paul and Dr. H. Vance Fletcher 
Jr., a dermatologist. The seller is the estate of pioneer Nevada hotel 
developer Beldon Katleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Listing agents were Joyce Rey and Cecelia Waeschle, both of Prudential Rodeo 
Realty. The buyers were represented by Don Robinson, a lifelong friend of the 
Cooper family who is also with Prudential Realty. The transaction was handled 
by Billie Davis Escrow.

CONDO Q & A: USE CARE WHEN REPAIRING QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My association is forging ahead and hiring contractors to make 
earthquake repairs without properly checking references and the contractors' 
licenses. What information should be obtained before the work is commenced? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: It is especially important to be cautious about your procedures during 
disaster recovery. There are some contractors who assume that you will not 
check their references or qualifications, so they will be trying to take 
advantage of you. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not pay deposits for purchasing supplies or other expenses without 
thoroughly checking licenses, bonds and insurance. Besides checking with others 
who have had work done by these contractors, you should receive certificates of 
insurance directly from the contractor's insurance agent. Check with the 
association's insurance agent to find out the amount of coverage that the 
association should be requiring from the contractors. The contractor should 
have general liability insurance, vehicle insurance and worker's compensation 
insurance covering any employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the State Contractor's License Board at (800) 321-2752. This number is 
answered 24 hours a day. If you have a touch-tone phone, you can enter the 
six-digit license number that you obtain from the contractor. By following the 
phone instructions, you can verify the license number and find out when the 
license expires, the type of licenses that the contractor holds, bonding 
information and then companies holding the bonds. In addition, the recorded 
message will explain how to obtain information about any consumer complaints 
that have been filed with the state board about the contractor and how those 
complaints have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Review carefully the estimate that the contractor provides. In some cases, it 
may be the only agreement that is signed, so be sure that it includes all of 
the exact specifications that you need, such as description of materials that 
will be used, responsibility for permits, the payment schedule, completion 
dates, clean up requirements, lien release and grievance procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cost of the project exceeds $1,000, it would be advisable to have the 
association's attorney review the agreement, the certificates of insurance and 
other information prior to signing with the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The time and expense that it takes to check out your contractors and verify 
the information that they provide will reduce or eliminate additional time, 
expense and liability for the association if problems arise while the work is 
being done or after the project is completed. Must Association Follow Its 
Bylaws? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Several months ago my partner and I purchased a unit in an upscale 
condominium association as an investment. At that time, we did not know about 
the association's lack of compliance with the governing documents. Now that we 
are aware of some problems, we would like your advice about the way the 
association is being operated. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of our concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- A special assessment was voted upon at the annual meeting without prior 
notice to the owners that a vote would be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- The board of directors has been setting an unrealistic budget each year, 
deliberately keeping the monthly assessments at a low amount, and then passing 
a special assessment each year to replenish reserve funds that are used for 
operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- The declaration states that the fiscal year must coincide with the 
calendar year but the board has established July 31 as the fiscal year-end. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- The board has not mailed out the annual budget or the year-end audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we would not have purchased the unit if we had known about the 
association's failure to abide by the declaration and bylaws. Now that we are 
owners, we would like to protect our investment by urging the board to improve 
their procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 We would appreciate your comments on the board's current practices. One board 
member says that they can run the association the way that the owners want. 
Does the board have the authority to disregard the association's governing 
documents? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The board has an obligation to protect every owner's investment by 
upholding and enforcing the declaration of covenants, conditions and 
restrictions (CC&Rs), bylaws and other legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The board could be in a real pickle if you decide to sell your unit. Certain 
documents must be provided to an owner who is selling a unit. The owner has the 
right to submit a written request to the association asking for the most recent 
financial statement that was prepared and distributed in compliance with 
California Civil Code Section 1365. State law requires that this information be 
provided within 10 days. The purchaser could hold the association responsible 
for any damages and, in addition, the association could be charged a penalty of 
$500 if the information is not provided within the 10-day period. If a lawsuit 
is filed, the prevailing party will recover attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 For the protection of all of us who own property in a community association, 
most states have laws that require that the community association board conduct 
the association's affairs in a business-like manner. 
</P>
<P>
 In some of the examples that you cited, the board is not only disregarding the 
association's legal documents, but also the state law. The annual meeting 
notice should have included information about the special assessment vote. If 
the association's income for the prior fiscal year was at least $75,000, a 
licensed accountant should have been engaged to perform a review of the 
association's financial records. The review should be distributed within 120 
days after the close of the fiscal year. You should have received a copy of the 
most recent financial report prior to purchasing your unit, as noted 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual budget should be adopted by the board and sent to all owners 45 to 
60 days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. The state law requires this 
even if your association documents do not. All associations must comply whether 
large or small, incorporated or unincorporated. If the board cannot accomplish 
this, then they should allocate association funds to hire a management company 
that will keep the association in compliance with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being openly critical of the board, offer your help to get the 
association on the right track. The board may resent your discovery of their 
shortcomings but if they see that you are wanting to be helpful instead of 
combative, they will probably accept and appreciate your help. 
</P>
<P>
 I have served on my homeowner association's board of directors so I am well 
aware that it isn't always easy to run the association properly. However, the 
board has a duty to comply with the law and the association's legal documents. 
Every owner should be concerned about operating the association in a haphazard 
manner, which exposes the board members and the association to liability and 
may put the association in jeopardy of a lawsuit.

GARDENING; APRICOTS CHALLENGE TO SOUTHLAND GARDENERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is hard to beat the sweet, sun-ripened goodness of a freshly picked 
apricot. In addition, its profusion of white blossoms and its deep green 
foliage makes the tree an attractive addition to most landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 While the apricot tree sounds like an ideal candidate for a home orchard, some 
Southland gardeners have found it difficult to get good fruit production from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked two Southern California fruit tree experts for their thoughts on 
growing apricots successfully here. Bill Nelson, of Pacific Tree Farms in Chula 
Vista, is known throughout the west for his expertise with fruit trees and Gary 
Matsuoka, of Laguna Hills Nursery in Lake Forest, specializes in mild-climate 
fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest complaint from home orchardists is that apricot trees have 
sporadic production habits -- crops some years and almost no crop in other 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Nelson and Matsuoka agree that this is mostly because of our mild 
Southern California climate. For good fruit production, most apricot trees have 
a winter chilling requirement (temperatures below 45 degrees) of 500 or more 
chilling hours during the winter for the trees to produce well. Unlike the 
prime apricot growing areas of the Central Valley, many of the climatic zones 
of the Southland normally don't get cold enough for decent fruit production 
form many apricot varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nelson most of the Los Angeles Basin and a good portion of the 
rest of Southern California receives only 200 to 300 chilling hours during the 
winter. Matsuoka has broken it down even further. He says that in a normal year 
in the most populated zones of the Southland, hilly areas tend to be warmer and 
flatland areas are colder. He says hilltop and hillside areas typically receive 
200-250 chilling hours, valley floors and other flat areas get about 300-400 
hours and areas along river beds usually get 500 or more chilling hours because 
cold air tends to flow along river beds. Also, higher elevation zones, such as 
Beaumont, get a good number of chilling hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuoka and Nelson both suggest the use of low-chill apricot varieties for 
the milder Southern California zones. These trees, they say, will usually set a 
good crop in all but the very warmest winter years. 
</P>
<P>
 Which apricot tree varieties to select? They both named a variety called Gold 
Kist as their top choice. Year after year it is a reliable producer of high 
quality fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson calls it "an excellent back yard apricot tree for mild winter zones." 
Gold Kist is a heavy producer of good-sized, very flavorful fruit. It produces 
an early harvest; often three to four weeks before most other varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Other varieties favored by Nelson include Royal, Autumn Royal and Flora Gold. 
Nelson says that Royal (also called Blenheim) is supposed to require more 
chilling weather that it actually does. He says that in most years Royal is a 
good producer. Royal is the leading commercial variety and it is a longtime 
favorite, with sweet, mild fruit. I have personally had good success with 
Royal. However, Matsuoka says that he has found Royal to be an inconsistent 
producer in the warmer zones. Autumn Royal is similar to Royal but it bears 
later in the season. Nelson has found Flora Gold to be a very reliable producer 
of good quality fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuoka says that Early Golden, a new variety, shows promise in the milder 
zones. Matsuoka has also grown the various genetic dwarf apricot trees with 
very poor results. 
</P>
<P>
 All the varieties mentioned here are self-fruitful; they don't need another 
tree planted nearby for cross-pollination. 
</P>
<P>
 As to care, Nelson says that during the growing season, apricot trees need 
ample water. He says that this is often not understood by the home grower. He 
suggests a weekly watering schedule, especially during warm weather. "They need 
as much water as citrus trees," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 During the winter when the trees are dormant, normal rainfall will suffice. 
However, in winter drought years the trees will often require supplemental 
watering. Matsuoka connects his trees to a drip irrigation system, which has 
produced good results. Both Nelson and Matsuoka stress that the soil the tree 
is grown in must drain well to prevent soggy soils, which promote root 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson recommends feeding the trees once a year with slow-release fertilizer 
tablets. He feeds his trees in late February each year with a product called 
Best-Tabs, which he says last for a year and provides the trees with the basic 
nutrients and also the important trace elements. 
</P>
<P>
 To enhance fruit production, apricot trees should be pruned during their 
winter dormant period. Without diagrams, it is difficult to explain the pruning 
procedure (apricot trees require different pruning from other stone fruit); a 
good pruning book will make the procedure simple. Matsuoka cautions that 
apricot trees should be pruned moderately or lightly. He says excessive or 
improper pruning can lead to heart rot. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, apricot trees are fairly pest-free and require little 
spraying. Nelson warns against using a lime-sulfur dormant spray (commonly used 
on other stone fruit trees) on apricot trees because it will cause damage. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the large, succulent fruit a home-grown tree is capable of producing, 
you must thin the fruit each spring when the fruit is about the size of a dime. 
Thin the fruit to three inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit may be harvested at several stages, but its flavor is best when it's 
allowed to ripen fully on the tree. If you plan to store the fruit for a few 
days, pick it while it is still firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Apricot trees are available the year-round at Southland nurseries and garden 
centers. They are available bare-root during the season and in containers the 
rest of the year. If you are in their vicinity, both Nelson and Matsuoka have a 
wide selection of the trees at their nurseries. Pacific Tree Farms is located 
at 4301 Lynnwood Drive, Chula Vista, 92910; phone (619) 422-2400 (they will 
also ship trees by mail order). 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills Nursery is located in Orange Country at 25290 Jeronimo Road, Lake 
Forest; phone (714) 830-5653 (no mail order).

COMMON SOURCES OF LEAD AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lead-based paint, which was allowed for residential use in the U.S. until 
1978, is now considered the main source of childhood lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary pathway for contamination is from the fine dust that spreads just 
about everywhere in a home as the paint deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other sources of potential lead contamination. In Los Angeles 
County, traditional home remedies and medicines used by some ethnic communities 
have caused serious lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California State Department of Health Services, there are 
several ethnic remedies that can pose serious threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the most common are Azarcon, a bright orange powder, and Greta, a 
yellow powder, both used in the Latino community for intestinal illnesses. The 
substances are almost 100% lead and are poisonous in any amount to children and 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay-loo-ah, a red powder used in the Hmong community and given for rash or 
fever is another dangerous compound. In the Asian Indian community, health 
officials warn against the use of Ghasard, a brown powder to aid digestion; 
Bala Goli, a flat, round black bean, and Kandu, a red powder, both used to 
treat stomach aches. 
</P>
<P>
 Also dangerous is Kohl or Alkohl, a powdered remedy used in the Arab-American 
community to treat skin infections, to put on the navel of newborn children and 
used as eye makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 A Centers for Disease Control (CDC) survey of California children with lead 
poisoning showed 40 youngsters statewide poisoned by traditional home remedies 
in 1992, with nearly 60% of them living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil can be a source of lead. In most cases, lead in soil comes from paint 
chips that flake off a house or building, factory pollution and leaded 
gasoline, according to state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil naturally contains about 50 parts per million (ppm). Urban soil typically 
contains between 200 ppm and 500 ppm. Anything above 1,000 ppm is considered 
hazardous waste. Lead-contaminated soil is dangerous to children because it 
sticks to objects, such as toys and fingers, that children often put in their 
mouths. Lead poisoning experts recommend covering such soil, especially around 
the perimeter of the house, with grass, plants, rock, concrete or other ground 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Pottery and china is another potential lead hazard, according to a study by 
the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). 
</P>
<P>
 The study says some of the greatest risks come from old china, handed down 
from past generations, homemade or handcrafted china, pottery and china with 
highly decorated inside surfaces that touch the food or beverage and pottery or 
china with decorations on top of the glaze instead of underneath it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dishes with corroded glaze should be avoided at all times, EDF officials warn. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of lead exposure depends on the particular dish and on how it's used. 
Some dishes are finished with lead-free or low-lead glazes. Those containing 
leads should not be used to store acidic foods and drinks, like tomato sauce 
and fruit juices. 
</P>
<P>
 And because heat can accelerate lead leaching, questionable dishes should not 
be heated up or used in a microwave. 
</P>
<P>
 The EDF provides a list of mail-order, home-test kits that cost between $20 
and $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Less likely sources of lead include lead solder in some canned goods, mainly 
foreign canned goods produced in countries like Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is lead in water, but state health officials say except for a few 
isolated cases, lead in water is not a big problem in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986 lead solder in water pipes has been outlawed, and in pre-1986 
pipes, the lead is usually encased in mineral deposits so that it is no longer 
a problem, say state and local health officials.

SHOULD YOU TEST YOUR CHILDREN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a recommendation last year by the American Academy of Pediatrics that 
pediatricians test all their patients under 6 years old for lead poisoning, 
many parents who want the test find their doctors reluctant to arrange it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if they haven't dealt with lead poisoning, it's easier to pretend it 
doesn't exist," said Dr. Routt Reigart, professor of pediatrics at the 
Charleston-based Medical University of South Carolina and chairperson of the 
AAP committee on environmental health, which drafted the AAP rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's a long-term chronic disease, it's not a short-term commitment 
(for the doctor). They need to work with the public health agencies to find out 
how the child was exposed, so it's a more than just treating an ear infection." 
</P>
<P>
 Reigart and others who support routine screening consider lead poisoning one 
of the foremost health threats faced by children nationwide. And recent studies 
by the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control say lead -- even at low levels 
in the blood -- is far more toxic to children than once believed. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all physicians agree with that. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most vocal opponents is Dr. Edgar J. Schoen, a pediatrician with 
Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Oakland. Schoen says that lead poisoning is no 
longer a significant threat to U.S. children and that routine testing -- which 
typically costs between $10 and $75 a test -- is a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of defective data out there being quoted," he said of the 
studies that show otherwise. ". . . and it's politically incorrect to question 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoen says scientific data on the neuro-behavioral effect of low blood-lead 
levels are still "controversial" and "inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes society would be better served by widespread education. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you want to do is teach parents there is a risk," he said. "If you live 
in an area with old homes and peeling paint then yes, your child should be 
tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Leonard Kutnik, a pediatrician with the Claremont Pediatric Medical Group 
in San Diego and an AAP district chairman, said he too has reservations about 
the AAP's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the physical pain (to the patient) of the blood being drawn and you 
don't want to create any pain or discomfort if you don't need to," he said. 
"Then there's the economic issue. We don't have enough dollars to do the things 
we should do . . . and we don't want to waste the dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Kutnik said that of about 40 children tested for lead poisoning under a 
Medicaid and Medical program in San Diego, none had elevated lead levels, 
leading him to believe San Diego children may not benefit from universal blood 
lead testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But until we can show that, the decision was made that the best way to 
protect a majority of children from something that could be harmful was to 
perform universal screening," said Kutnik, who voted in favor of the AAP 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Adler, head of the general pediatrics and Childrens Hospital Los 
Angeles and president of the AAP's Los Angeles chapter agreed: "I'm not 
advocating that we continue a lead screening program for many years. If there 
is no identified danger in a community, I think it can be dropped." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Adler said he didn't consider lead poisoning a serious problem 
for California children. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I started doing more extensive lead screening . . . I was surprised 
to see the number of children that we've identified with lead toxicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said, those suffering from the disease "by far and away have not 
shown any clinical symptoms that would have been picked up by (a routine) 
examination." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schoen and his supporters are unswayed in their opinion that lead 
poisoning isn't a serious threat to children, including the urban poor, who 
have long been considered at greatest risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing in the world these kids need is their blood level tested," 
Schoen said. "They're not immunized, they're not getting proper nutrition, they 
can get shot in the street. Their threat from lead comes from a barrel of a 
gun."

PRICES SHOWS SIGNS OF LEVELING OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern California residential real estate market showed surprising 
strength last month, posting sales gains for the eighth month in a row and 
showing signs that the steadily falling prices of the past two years may be 
leveling off, a real estate information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 12,921 new and used condos and houses were sold in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego counties last 
month.That was up 7.5% from 12,024 in January and up 26.4% from 10,222 in 
February a year ago, Dataquick Information Systems reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales increase was strongest in Orange County, at 65%, while sales levels 
were up only 14.5% in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Condo prices were up 2.2%, from a median $139,000 a year ago to $142,000 now. 
The median for a newly built home was $168,000 last month, the same as a year 
ago.

THE SMALL-STATE PRESIDENT; A FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON A GOVERNOR'S NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Clough, Michael Clough is a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign 
Relations and co-chairman of New American Global Dialogue, a Stanley Foundation 
foreign-policy program. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind Secretary of State Warren Christopher's political mugging at the hands 
of the Chinese government last week is a foreign policy at war with itself. On 
one side is the Clinton Administra tion's desire to protect human rights. On 
the other is its quest to open up foreign markets for U.S. business. Unhappily 
for Christopher, the Chinese know that Bill Clinton can't have it both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton team's troubles with China are symptomatic of a broader failure to 
develop a role for the United States in the post-Cold War world. As a result, 
it remains trapped in old modes of strategic thinking, which adds to its 
difficulties in Haiti, Bosnia and Somalia. The absence of a new vision is also 
a main reason for the Administration's inability to win lasting public support 
for bold global initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early days of his presidential candidacy, Clinton's positions on 
foreign policy have reflected an uneasy mix of political calculations, 
intellectual influences and experiences as a state governor. His political 
advisers have always seen foreign policy as a potentially dangerous diversion 
from domestic matters. This explains Clinton's reluctance, as candidate and 
President, to focus on international issues. On those occasions when he has 
outlined his vision of the world and America's place in it, two themes have 
emerged, each reflecting a crucial but strikingly different set of influences 
on his approach to foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The overarching rhetorical theme in Clinton's major foreign-policy addresses 
-- first elaborated in a speech at Georgetown University, in December, 1991 -- 
has been a call for a renewed U.S. commitment to global engagement. We must, he 
then declared, "lead the world that we have done so much to create." America's 
goal, he told the United Nation's last fall, "is to expand and strengthen the 
world's community of market-based democracies." 
</P>
<P>
 This neo-Wilsonian vision has deep roots in America's liberal internationalist 
past. It combines a strong belief in the power of the United States to shape 
the world with a deep and abiding faith that it can -- and will -- do so in a 
way that serves the larger interests of both America and the world. For the 
grandsons of the wise men who orchestrated the nation's rise to global 
pre-eminence, this is an appealing, Kennedyesque vision. 
</P>
<P>
 All Clinton's boldest positions -- his commitment to defend Bosnia against 
Serbian aggression, to restore democracy in Haiti and in the former Soviet 
Union, to create political order in Somalia and to protect human rights in 
China -- flow from this vision. But it is doubtful that Clinton is as 
personally committed to reviving liberal internationalism as are his chief 
foreign-policy advisers, especially National Security Council Adviser W. 
Anthony Lake. This may explain why Clinton has been quick to drop the 
foreign-policy promises he made during the campaign once it becomes clear that 
carrying them out could prove costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The second recurring theme in Clinton's foreign-policy addresses has been the 
idea that national security now revolves around economics and its corollary 
that our principal global objective should be to improve the international 
competitiveness of the U.S. economy and vigorously promote U.S. economic 
interests abroad, especially exports. This view is an article of faith among 
many of the academics, such as Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich, who have 
been part of Clinton's intellectual circle since his days at Oxford. It is also 
much more compatible with the President's domestic agenda and his political 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 This geo-economic perspective also closely parallels the thinking of most U.S. 
governors, and, his Vietnam-era student days aside, Clinton's most formative 
international experiences occurred while he was a young governor trying to 
boost Arkansas' economy by promoting state exports and attracting foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's speech writers have made a determined effort to reconcile his 
liberal internationalism and economic boosterism by arguing that a prosperous, 
internationally competitive national economy is a precondition for global 
leadership. At one level, they are right. Economic prosperity did make it 
possible for Washington to pursue an ambitious international agenda from the 
late 1940s through the 1960s. At another level, however, this argument is 
either self-deluding or mere sophistry. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the competitiveness crowd is not to build a more democratic world 
order. Rather, it is to ensure that Americans do not lose out to Asians and 
Europeans in the increasingly fierce competition for global markets. In light 
of this reality, it is naive to believe that other nations will eagerly follow 
Clinton's political lead while ex-Gov. Clinton busily courts economic partners 
and squeezes economic rivals. Therein lies the real reason for Beijing's 
chilliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks before Christopher arrived in Beijing, Undersecretary of 
Commerce Jeffrey E. Garten went to China to lobby on behalf of U.S. companies 
seeking to do business with the Chinese. He also gave a widely publicized 
speech in Hong Kong, in which he emphasized the importance of the China market 
and declared that access to it was crucial for the success of efforts to boost 
U.S. exports. Corporate executives have similarly warned about the probable 
economic consequences of a failure to extend China's most-favored-nation 
status. Given this background -- and the fact that none of our major economic 
competitors will support an effort to use trade to promote democracy in China 
-- Christopher should not have been surprised at Chinese resistance to his 
human-rights pleading. 
</P>
<P>
 What the secretary of state may find surprising is that his effort to carry 
the banner of liberal internationalism may be doomed to failure. At the same 
time, however, it is also clear that trade promotion is no substitute for a 
serious foreign policy. Adopting a governor's eye view of the world may help 
U.S. business to become more competitive, but there is a real danger that it 
will encourage national myopia.

THE SMALL-STATE PRESIDENT; TO UNDERSTAND ROSE FIRM, THINK 'POLITICAL MACHINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ben Joravsky, Ben Joravsky, a staff writer for the Chicago Reader, is the 
author of Race and Politics in Chicago (CRS Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been clear since the first whiff of Whitewater wafted north from Little 
Rock, Ark., that what we have here is not so much a scandal as the death of a 
Great Political Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, this Machine's a little different than most, at least in appearance 
-- not a fedora or pinky ring in this bunch. Still, the tell-tale signs are 
there: You've got a cast of characters nestled together for far too long in the 
insulated confines of power. For 10 years, their friend, Bill Clinton, was 
governor. And for 10 years, they ran Arkansas state government. They enforced 
the laws and doled out contracts and awarded jobs and sat in the leather-bound, 
swivel chairs, gavels in hand, of state regulatory boards and commissions at 
their command. Few dared challenge them. Those who did were banned from the 
kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns a few heads, untempered power. Those so blessed easily conclude that 
their power is like the divine right of kings. There's nothing they can't do, 
no wrong they can't fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, the papers bring new tales of their machinations. Vincent W. Foster 
Jr., Beverly Bassett Schaffer, James B. McDougal, Susan McDougal, Dan R. 
Lasater, James B. Blair and David Hale -- if they didn't work for or with the 
state, they worked for or with the Rose Law Firm, Hillary Rodham Clinton's old 
firm. Or maybe they were somehow linked to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, 
the failed S&L owned by McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater 
Development Corp., a vacation-home development deal that also went bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Did I mention Webster L. Hubbell? Mayor of Little Rock, state Supreme Court 
justice, partner at Rose -- this guy had it made. A few days after the 1992 
election, he was pictured with the President-elect, sitting in a golf cart on a 
golf course at some exclusive, all-white country club. Clinton's chomping on a 
sandwich. Hubbell's chortling. A couple of good old boys, running the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell went with the Clintons to Washington, but recently he had to step down 
from his Justice Department job on account of an embarrassing feud over legal 
fees he's been having with his old partners at Rose. Now there's a dispute that 
never would have surfaced had the Clintons stayed in Little Rock. Clinton could 
have settled it over a game of golf, appointing someone to a state commission, 
if that's what it took. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the way it goes with Machines. The Big Boss dies or goes to jail or 
leaves town or otherwise gets distracted, and everything falls apart. Old 
friends turn to foes. Long-simmering envies and resentments boil over. There's 
always someone with a grudge, someone feeling slighted. The first sign of 
weakness brings a batch of prosecutors, subpoenas in hand, and soon everyone's 
ratting. Of the turmoil engulfing Rose, one Arkansas lawyer recently said: 
"They are not a firm but an association of lawyers who don't want to lose 
money. And they are willing to turn on each other to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons say they've committed no crimes. They say the whole Whitewater 
affair has been distorted and exploited by ideological enemies determined to 
stymie the drive for mandatory national health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Could be. These things have happened before. In 1929, Big Oil rumbled with 
rage when Louisiana Gov. Huey P. (Kingfish) Long proposed to tax oil 
production. They primed legislators with liquor, women and cash and 
masterminded a call for the governor's impeachment on various charges of 
corruption. It almost worked -- except Long got enough legislators to sign a 
pledge vowing to vote against impeachment regardless of the evidence. 
Afterward, to show his thanks, Long took his boys to a coastal resort, fed them 
lobsters and got them drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, old Kingfish is a tough act to emulate. He was a big-time Boss, and 
he ran a mighty Machine. He built highways, hospitals and schools, dams and 
bridges. Unlike Clinton, he ran his state even after he went to Washington. For 
two years, Long was governor and senator. His reign might have lasted forever, 
except he was shot -- and even then his Machine rumbled on for another 25 years 
under the aegis of his younger brother, Earl. 
</P>
<P>
 In their day, the Longs were rivaled only by Kansas City's Tom Pendergast, 
whose Democratic organization was so resourceful it once squeezed 20,000 votes 
from a district of fewer than 20,000 people. Pendergast diversified. He built a 
business empire of hotels, taxicabs and race tracks -- enterprises regulated by 
the very state officials who owed their jobs to him. It was a neatly woven 
system that worked well -- at least for Pendergast. 
</P>
<P>
 It collapsed, legend has it, after a turn-coat flunky, lips loosened by 
liquor, stayed late in a bar, babbling about a political "fix." The feds got 
wind of the scam and launched an investigation. Eventually, Pendergast spent 
several months in Leavenworth for failing to pay taxes on thousands of dollars 
in payoffs he received from insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Chicago, we've made peace with our Machine, having seen it rise from 
the grave at least twice in the last few years. Mayor Richard J. Daley built 
the thing -- or at least honed it -- and when he died in 1976, everyone figured 
the Machine would go with him. Sure enough, in 1979, voters elected Jane M. 
Byrne as their mayor -- a fiery maverick who called the Machine a malicious old 
monster run by an "evil cabal" of greedy aldermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in office, however, Byrne cozied up to the monsters she had once 
denounced. Again, voters revolted, replacing Byrne with Harold Washington, who 
vowed to dance on the Machine's grave.

<P>
 Funny thing about Machines, they're more resilient than you think. Look at 
Earl Long. The voters returned him to office until the day he died. They might 
have kept on electing him after that, except no one bothered to put his name on 
the ballot. Even Pendergast had the last laugh, when Harry S. Truman, his 
protege and defender, was elected President. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Chicago, the Machine outlasted even Mayor Washington. He died in 1987, 
just a few months into his second term. Two years later, the voters elected 
Richard M. Daley, the old Boss' boy. At first, a few anti-Machine stalwarts 
resisted. But not so much anymore. Old reformers and anti-war activists, who 
condemned the father, now bow and scrape before the son. They attend his fund 
raisers. They laugh at his jokes. If they're well-behaved, Daley appoints them 
to city commissions and boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere, the old man must be laughing.

'BOP': A FITTING SYMBOL FOR THE NEW SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jeffrey Herbst, Jeffrey Herbst, an assistant professor of politics and 
international affairs, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, just 
returned from a year in South Africa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last weekend's overthrow of strongman Lucas L. Mangope in the South African 
homeland of Bophuthatswana was another milestone in the transition to 
post-apartheid rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangope, president of one of the black enclaves considered "independent" 
states during the days of grand apartheid, had refused to recognize the interim 
constitution that currently governs South Africa. As such, he had prohibited 
all campaigning for the country's first nonracial vote on April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was overthrown when his own people, almost all of whom support the 
African National Congress, rose up against him, and his security forces made it 
clear they would not support him. 
</P>
<P>
 The final act of Mangope's rule featured thousands of right-wing whites 
streaming into Mmabatho, the capital of "Bop," on a fool's errand to try to 
save the former puppet of the white regime. The whites were quickly turned away 
but not before three of them were summarily executed by a black Bop soldier, an 
image broadcast around the world and one that will undoubtedly confirm all the 
worst fears the extreme right has about the new South Africa. Several dozen 
Africans were reportedly killed by the rag-tag white army in the hours 
preceding the execution. While all loss of life is to be regretted, Mangope was 
actually unseated with far less bloodshed than had been expected, given the 
vehemence of his opposition to the end of white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for Mmabatho is mistakenly cited by some as evidence that the 
extreme right is a spent force in South Africa politics. The mere fact that 
several thousand armed men could be mobilized at a moment's notice to invade 
Bop should be a chilling indication of the numbers that the extreme right 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, a direct armed confrontation, such as what took place in 
Mmabatho, is precisely the kind of battle that goes to the right's weakness. 
Although it commands thousands of well-armed men with military training, the 
right can never hope to match the firepower of the government's security 
forces. There is no chance of it overthrowing any South African government. 
</P>
<P>
 What the right can do is carry out individual acts of terrorism that may 
destabilize the country, or lead to a permanent atmosphere of uncertainty. For 
example, the white terrorist who killed Chris Hani, secretary-general of the 
South African Communist Party, in April, 1993, delivered, with one bullet, a 
more stunning blow to the transition process than all the bullets fired in 
Mmabatho, because Hani was a critical link between the aging black leadership 
and the "comrades" in the townships who are demanding radical change quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Other assassinations, or acts of industrial sabotage, could also destabilize a 
country that, by necessity, will have uncertain politics for many years to 
come. As is evident in Northern Ireland, even exceptionally well-trained 
security forces dedicated to defeating the other side (characteristics that 
probably cannot be ascribed to the South African security forces, in light of 
the transition they are undergoing and the number of conservatives in critical 
positions) often cannot conquer a hard-core band of terrorists. Unfortunately, 
the right will probably live to fight another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it likely that any political accommodation can be reached with the the 
extreme conservatives. The right is unalterably opposed to majority rule. There 
is probably nothing that a future ANC-led government can offer that would tempt 
them to accept the new South Africa. Also, the right is so splintered that no 
one leader can speak for it, making fruitful negotiations almost impossible. 
Finally, what the conservatives say they want -- a boerstaat that would be an 
independent country for the Afrikaners -- will never be granted by an ANC 
committed to governing a united South Africa. Indeed, there is really no area 
of the country where whites are a majority and even the creation of a 
gerrymandered white "homeland" would still leave the majority of Afrikaners 
outside its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scene that took place in Bop a few days after the battle was largely 
ignored by the world media but also has important implications for South 
Africa's future. Nelson Mandela went to Mmabatho and received a hero's welcome. 
Among those cheering were the numerous civil servants of the former homeland 
who could support Mandela because they had been assured they would keep their 
positions and their pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a dent in the huge inequalities in housing, medicine, education and 
infrastructure inherited from white rule, the new government should fire 
thousands of these civil servants who work in the bloated South African 
bureaucracy. Eliminating the enormous duplication (there are, for example, more 
than a dozen health ministries) would be a critical part of the "apartheid 
dividend" needed to address the enormous social backlog. But the ANC agreed to 
protect civil-servant jobs and pensions as part of the price of having to 
negotiate for power from the white government. 
</P>
<P>
 Having to keep on so many agents of the old regime will be an enormous 
financial burden at precisely the time when every last rand will be needed to 
address social problems. Indeed, the irony that the Africans and whites who 
worked for and supported Mangope until the end will be among the most 
prosperous in Mmabatho for a long time to come, while those who helped 
overthrow him will remain poor, will be a permanent source of anxiety for the 
new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Bop is a fitting symbol for much of the new South Africa: Some odious agents 
of the old order were removed but the new government will come into being 
handicapped by the need to reach an accommodation with the apartheid state 
itself to achieve power.

TRYING TO BUILD A UNION MOVEMENT IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Davis, Mike Davis is the author of City of Quartz: Excavating the 
Future of Los Angeles (Routledge, Chapman & Hill). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Threepenny Opera," Bertolt Brecht gave an oppressed hotel maid an 
exquisite dream of revenge. Pirate Jenny summons "a ship with eight black sails 
and 50 cannons" to render justice on her exploiters ("and when their heads 
roll, I'll say, 'Hoop-la!' "). 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, as hotel corporations know too well, that militant ship of 
justice with the black sails is Local 11 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Local 11 will launch one of the most dramatic organizing campaigns 
in recent history. The result of several years of intensive planning and 
rank-and-file debate, it is an experiment in 21st-Century labor protest. 
Traditional union tactics have been completely rethought. There will be no 
formal strike nor stationary picket line. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, under the leadership of their young president, Maria Elena Durazo, 
the hotel workers will become a peaceful guerrilla army. They intend to 
confront the tourist industry with disciplined but unexpected actions. Across 
the city, there will be leafletting, human billboards, flying pickets, 
delegations to city officials and, inevitably, mass civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the hotel workers speak of building not just a union but a social 
movement, like those of the 1930s and 1960s. If their immediate targets are a 
dozen or so non-union luxury hotels in Downtown and at LAX, their strategic 
goal is a living wage for all 50,000 hotel employees in Los Angeles County. 
(The union currently represents 13,000.) Unionization of the hotels, in turn, 
is visualized as the first step in lifting hundreds of thousands of other 
service workers out of their low-wage ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
 The national business press has recently hailed entertainment and tourism as 
the new engines of prosperity, offsetting losses in traditional manufacturing 
and defense production. In Los Angeles, however, the $8-billion tourist 
industry -- the second-largest sector in the regional economy -- is capitalized 
on poverty. The average worker earns a mere $5.35 an hour -- low enough to 
qualify for food stamps. If the annual incomes of hotel and theme-park 
employees are slightly above the official poverty line, those of restaurant 
workers are far below. 
</P>
<P>
 Working conditions, meanwhile, are too often indistinguishable from sweatshops 
or farms. Downtown's great luxury hotels, for example, scarcely look like the 
cotton plantations of the tourist economy. But ask any maid cleaning a 
$250-a-day room about her life. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ordinary shift, she may make 25 beds and scrub 18 toilets and bathtubs. 
Her back usually aches, and her hands and eyes are often irritated by caustic 
cleaning chemicals. She is harassed by management and sometimes by guests. This 
is stoop labor without the sunshine, and maids -- overwhelmingly from Mexico, 
Central America or the Philippines -- are campesinas in white smocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there is no iron law of wages that consigns tourism workers to peonage. 
In heavily unionized tourist centers like Las Vegas, San Francisco, Honolulu 
and New York, wages average 50% higher than in Los Angeles. In New York, for 
example, union maids earn $12 an hour in first-class hotels -- a dignified 
compensation for their toil. In San Francisco and Las Vegas, waitresses, fry 
cooks and room-clerks can afford to own homes and support families. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, there is no indication that higher wages have wrecked mass tourism 
or destroyed profits in these travel destinations. Quite the contrary. But 
there is growing evidence -- as Local 11 pointed out a few years ago in the 
controversial video "City on the Edge" -- that poverty-wage levels and their 
social consequences are eroding the image of Los Angeles. The worst slums in 
the metropolis -- Lennox, Pico-Union, City College -- tend to have the largest 
concentrations of low-wage hotel and food-service employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the corporate sector of the local tourist industry enjoys huge public 
subsidies. The Community Redevelopment Agency has given Downtown's luxury 
hotels tens of millions of dollars worth of density bonuses and land discounts. 
One Downtown hotel, for example, was able to buy its prime Figueroa site for 
only $1.5 million in 1980. By 1990, the value of the land alone was estimated 
to have increased tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Convention Center expansion, meanwhile, has diverted tax increments from 
affordable housing and threatens to hijack general revenue to make up a likely 
shortfall between its out-of-control cost (now more than $500 billion) and 
less-than-anticipated bed-tax income. Rumors fly that another $100 million of 
public funding is being sought to construct a first-class hotel in the 
wasteland near the center. South Figueroa is beginning to look ominously like 
Los Angeles' fiscal Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers also directly subsidize the MediCal coverage and county hospital 
services that compensate for the health-care insurance that non-union tourism 
employees cannot afford to buy. It has been estimated that more than a quarter 
of the state's uninsured workers are employed by major corporations, like the 
big hotel and restaurant chains. One of the principal attractions of 
service-sector unions like the hotel workers, or SEIU's "Justice for Janitors" 
campaign, has been their success in winning employer-paid health benefits. For 
the maids and cleaners, this is often equivalent to a 20% raise -- though that 
still barely elevates them above the level of AFDC assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Local 11 and its allies propose to take the working poor off welfare by 
forcing corporate employers to accept the principle of a living wage. As their 
campaign unfolds, they undoubtedly will be accused of trying to sabotage the 
economic recovery by scaring away tourists and disturbing luxury lifestyles. 
(Higher wages and union contracts, after all, are not part of the official tool 
kit for "Rebuilding Los Angeles.") Some critics, moreover, will conflate their 
actions with the threat by the police union to advertise the city as a lawless 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 It is essential, however, to distinguish between legitimate social exposure 
and irresponsible fear-mongering. Hotel workers pose no danger to public 
safety. They have no power to empty the jails (as the sheriff has threatened in 
recent budget debates) or to turn their backs on disorder. If they are forced 
to engage in street protest, it is because official boosterism still ignores 
issues of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Media pundits drool over immigrant millionaires and emerging technologies, but 
rarely explain how a reinvented Los Angeles economy will help the multitudes 
stranded in low-paid service jobs. For how many generations will maids and 
busboys have to wait before their families can afford the price of admission to 
Disneyland or Magic Mountain? 
</P>
<P>
 As Local 11 sees it, Los Angeles is in danger of becoming Chiapas with 
freeways. That's why they are telling all the potential Pirate Jennys: "Your 
time is now!"

IMMIGRATION GHOSTS HAUNT THE HISPANIC CAUCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ruben Navarrette Jr., Ruben Navarrette Jr. is the author of A Darker Shade 
of Crimson: Odyssey of a Harvard Chicano (Bantam). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Congressional Hispanic Caucus must wish that the immigration issue would 
just go away. But in the spirit of the more outspoken Congressional Black 
Caucus, the 18- member caucus professes a dedication to "voicing and advancing, 
through the legislation process, issues affecting Hispanics in the United 
States" -- and immigration is the most controversial issue on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 103rd Congress considering an onslaught of new immigration bills, 
including a proposal by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) targeting 
the children of illegal immigrants in public schools, the misty-eyed imagery of 
the Statue of Liberty is wearing thin. Ironically, nowhere is this more true 
than in the nation's Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollsters invariably find Latinos more eager than the rest of the population 
to control the nation's borders. Last year's National Latino Political Survey 
revealed that 66% of Cuban-Americans, 75% of Mexican-Americans and 79% of 
Puerto Ricans believed there was too much immigration into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That constitutes a silent majority: Latinos for Immigration Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Washington, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, while trying to 
weather the anti-immigrant storm and remain loyal to its constituency's 
immigrant roots, stumbles along, far behind the expressed wishes of that same 
constituency. Once they arrive in the portals of power, even the brightest 
political stars cannot make peace with yesterday. The ghosts of 
Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrants who, generations ago, crossed the Rio 
Grande in search of something better roam the porcelain halls of Congress 
whispering into the ears of caucus members. " No nos olviden . . . " Do not 
forget us. Something better yes, but better for our whole family. 
</P>
<P>
 So as caucus members sit in committee with colleagues who want to beef up the 
border patrol or deploy the National Guard or charge an admission fee to 
America, the ghost of immigrants past sits next to them -- whispering: "If you 
do not speak for us, who will?" They hold their breath and give the ghost their 
vote. Still, back at the office, there is new polling data and angry phone 
calls from constituents complaining that Los Angeles is becoming Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Where, finally, is the Hispanic Caucus on the rock-and-hard-place issue of 
immigration? Mostly in hiding. On the caucus agenda for this Congress, 
immigration is buried at No. 7. When the subject is mentioned, it is only with 
regard to monitoring enforcement of immigration laws to ensure that Latinos are 
not discriminated against. Nothing about deporting illegal immigrants from U.S. 
jails. Nothing about securing or revoking the citizenship birthright to the 
children of illegal immigrants. Nothing about safeguarding or eliminating 
education, health and welfare benefits for illegal immigrants. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the Hispanic Caucus not out in front of the curve on the 
immigration issue, it is completely off the chart. For example, despite a 
consensus among Latinos that those who employ undocumented workers should be 
punished, the caucus has consistently opposed employer sanctions. It was in the 
mid-'80s, during the debate on the Simpson-Mazzoli bill and before the adoption 
of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, that caucus members raised their 
concern that such sanctions might lead to employers discriminating against 
Latinos. Despite such objections, the sanctions were approved, a setback never 
forgotten or forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost 10 years, the sanctions snub has been stuck in the caucus' craw. 
Last session, a distinguished caucus member introduced legislation to repeal 
employer sanctions under the pretense that they have not been successful in 
curbing excessive immigration. It went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, it was rumored that Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), the 
caucus president, was preparing to reintroduce similar legislation despite 
overwhelming public sentiment that employer sanctions should actually be 
strengthened, not repealed. Anticipating a political storm that would make the 
Alamo look like a spring picnic, Serrano thought twice. And so, after all the 
rhetoric, the only caucus offering this year is something called H.R. 1292, 
which amends IRCA to increase penalties for employer discrimination. Of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the Hispanic Caucus has one last hope to catch up to its constituency 
and salvage some integrity in the immigration debate. It comes to them not from 
the Spanish-speaking ghosts of the past but from an English-speaking leader for 
the future. At the beginning of this session, freshman Rep. Xavier Becerra 
(D-Los Angeles), addressed the immigration issue in a way that is not merely 
reactive. By seeking and winning membership on the House Judiciary Subcommittee 
on International Law, Refugees and Immigration, Becerra has become the point 
person on the immigration issue for the entire caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman congressman's speeches are filled with the familiar language 
espousing the protection of immigrants' rights and safeguards against 
discrimination. But as the grandchild -- not the child -- of immigrants, there 
is a detached generational dimension to Becerra's perspective. Unlike his older 
colleagues, politicos who entered public life in the 1960s and '70s, when 
immigration from Latin America was a virtual trickle, Becerra concedes the 
United States simply cannot afford the open-border position so dearly held by 
some old leaders. Hopefully, his will be a voice of reason on this issue for 
years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for Becerra, the pressure to toe the caucus line must be fierce. His 
challenge -- a personal one -- is to resist the haunting of old ghosts. He must 
somehow overcome the temptation to fall into the comfortable orthodoxy of the 
elders and instead forge a fresh perspective on the immigration issue that 
commits to stopping the onslaught of illegal immigrants into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the legislative hurt feelings of the past, the defining issue of 
the day is not employer sanctions or worker discrimination. It is up to a new 
generation of leaders to take the immigration debate where older politicos have 
not and will not: to the border.

IS IT A MOSQUE OR A STATE? A BOY FORCES PAKISTAN TO DEBATE IDENTITY; 
POLITICIANS ARE HOLDING THEIR TONGUES, LEST THEY ANTAGONIZE THE RELIGIOUS 
RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Journal and the London Observer, has written extensively on Asia.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not since the Salman Rushdie protests in 1989 has this Pakistani city been 
gripped by such an emotional religious case. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs plastered throughout the town of Gujranwala read: "Any one who 
blasphemes against the prophet should be hanged in public." For months, dozens 
of Muslim fundamentalists staged angry protests outside the town's courthouse, 
and now they have set upon this ancient walled city. The maulvis of Gujranwala 
are demanding that a 12-year-old boy and two others be hanged for allegedly 
defiling the name of the prophet and writing derogatory phrases on the wall of 
a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the protests is Salamat Masih, a gangly young Christian 
accused of blasphemy -- a charge that carries a mandatory death sentence. None 
of Salamat's accusers has yet to say what he wrote, and, in any case, they have 
since erased the evidence. Defense lawyers deny the boy could have written 
anything: Salamat is totally illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was recently transferred to Lahore, where his lawyers think Salamat 
will receive a fairer trial. But when charges against the three were framed, 35 
maulvis protested outside the courthouse in an attempt to scare the judge. The 
trial is set to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, politicians, including Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, withheld 
comment on the case, lest they antagonize the religious right. The country's 
law minister has sent the blasphemy law to the Islamic Ideology Council for 
review, concerned that it has been used to prevent the expression of religious 
beliefs. A spokesman for Bhutto said it's likely the law will be modified. A 
decision is expected in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 During preliminary hearings, Salamat needed a police escort to repel 
hostilecrowds and safely enter the court in Gujranwala, where protesters had 
crowded the galleries to intimidate the judge. In the past two years, three 
people accused of blasphemy have been killed by fanatics while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1947, Pakistan has struggled to define what it means to 
be a Muslim state. "Father of the Nation" Mohammed Ali Jinnah was not 
particularly religious, but it was he more than anyone who insisted on the 
creation of Muslim Pakistan. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's first elected 
leader, was known for his modernism -- a practicing Muslim, his political 
outlook was secular. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, while he was prime minister, from 1973 to 1977, he caved in to 
the mullahs and banned alcohol. The man who toppled him, Gen. Mohammad Zia 
ul-Haq, completely changed the 1973 constitution to accord with the Sharia 
(Islamic Law) -- something many politicians are still trying to undo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan's blasphemy laws are as extreme as those in Iran and Saudi Arabia. In 
1991, Nawaz Sharif's government conceded to Pakistan's religious parties and 
made death the mandatory punishment for blasphemy, though there is no mention 
of such a punishment in the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Muslim religious parties have always done poorly in Pakistani 
elections. In last October's elections, they won only 3% of the vote and fewer 
than 10 of the 217 seats in the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 But these Islamic parties continue to have a disproportionate influence on 
public perceptions. They are extremely well-organized, often using the mullahs 
to whip up emotional support for a cause by preaching in mosques across the 
country. Politicians fear they will be labeled un-Islamic if they don't agree. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, only human-rights activists have come to Salamat's aid. The 
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan took up the boy's cause after his appointed 
lawyer, a Muslim, received threats from right-wing religious groups and quit 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Pakistanis, most of them religious minorities, have been jailed on 
charges of blasphemy since 1986, when Zia increased the punishment to life 
imprisonment or death. In the past two years, two people have been found guilty 
of blasphemy and sentenced to death. They are awaiting their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of most of these cases are land disputes or personal jealousies. 
Evidence is often circumstantial, and the prosecutors rely on one person's word 
against another's -- often all it takes to get a conviction in blasphemy cases. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending six months behind bars, Salamat was released on bail late last 
year. Sitting in his lawyer's office, Salamat said he had been accused of 
blasphemy because the Muslims from his village want to force the Christians to 
leave the area. In Pakistan, there are an estimated 5 million Christians, who 
make up less than 1% of the population. Generally, they represent the poorest 
class and are looked down on by local Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already had some enmity with those people," said Salamat, who used to herd 
buffalo for his family. "They just wanted an excuse to get back at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Salamat, who appears oblivious to the punishment he might face, was accused of 
blasphemy last May after he had a fight with the 8-year-old son of a prominent 
Muslim family living near his village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started over some pigeons. The boys caught my pigeons, and they didn't 
want to give them back to me," he recalled. "The little boy with whom I had a 
fight said he saw me write on the mosque." 
</P>
<P>
 True or not, Salamat Masih may become another victim of Pakistan's inability 
to find a working relationship between mosque and state.

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; CAN TOLERANCE BE WRITTEN INTO HIGHER EDUCATION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MARTIN, Geoffrey Martin is a senior journalism student at the 
University of Southern California.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges recently approved a revised 
"statement on diversity," it crossed over from its traditional role of 
evaluating a curriculum's minimum standards into one of mandating what should 
be taught in the classroom. In effect, the association wants to enforce a 
multicultural code. 
</P>
<P>
 In so doing, it is violating the autonomy of scholastic programs and 
infringing upon students' right to choose their courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald R. Gerth, president of Cal State Sacramento and a proponent of the 
policy shift, contends that an appreciation of diversity should be an "outcome 
of undergraduate education." The new policy would presumably achieve this by 
expanding studies beyond Western values. 
</P>
<P>
 But most universities are already diverse in their curricula and student 
bodies. At USC, for example, there is plenty of diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Every undergraduate is required to take at least one class in non-Western 
cultures. They must take at least two semesters of a foreign language, unless 
they are already fluent in a language other than English. Composition classes 
now incorporate the teachings of Ghandi and Confucius. Literature classes are 
no longer confined to Western books. My empirical-approaches course, which 
fulfills a sociology/anthropology requirement, focuses on the traditions of the 
Bushmen and shaman in Africa, Nanook of the North and the urban struggle of 
first-generation Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 On my way to class, I pass a group of black students near the entrance of the 
Commons cafeteria. The international students, mostly from the Far and Middle 
East, talk about their assignments outside the science and engineering complex. 
White friends gossip on the steps in front of Commons. And there is a cluster 
of Asian-Americans near Tommy Trojan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the presence of great diversity in students and course selection, 
the integration of different ethnic groups on campus is far from being 
achieved. Imposing a uniform multicultural curriculum will not help. 
</P>
<P>
 A university can require certain classes. But for any course to be effective, 
individuals must want to learn about other cultures. Unfortunately, being 
forced to study other cultures' beliefs and practices simply because they are 
different is not conducive to learning, let alone a path toward greater 
tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 I've taken courses about different ethnic groups out of choice, and because it 
was my choice, I've learned from exposure to these cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no shortage of opportunities for students who desire to research the 
lives and artifacts of different cultures. With ethnic and gender studies 
expanding, this trend will undoubtedly continue. In addition, the growing 
ethnic and racial diversity of Los Angeles -- and America -- virtually 
guarantees that new ideas and different values will become part of the 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal for an educated America should not simply be an awareness of 
different skin colors and ideas, but rather the integration of a multiplicity 
of ideas and perspectives into a commonly shared belief. This is best achieved 
through an open marketplace of ideas and rigorous debate, not through the 
dictates of an ivory-tower elite.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; DEE DEE MYERS; PRESS SECRETARY TO AN 
ADMINISTRATION FULL OF TALKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas B. Rosenstiel, Thomas B. Rosenstiel covers the media for The Times 
and is the author of Strange Bedfellows: How Television and the Presidential 
Candidates Changed American Politics. (Hyperion Press) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the flame began turning up on the Whitewater mess, one small artifact of 
the story was the disappearance of the daily press briefing for White House 
reporters. Since March 2, the familiar face of the young woman with the blond 
shag haircut, the slow temper and sometimes unfortunate gift for the hip 
one-liner has been missing from the press-room podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Dee Myers, the Valencia-bred presidential press secretary, has not been in 
hiding -- but access has been controlled, mostly to one reporter at a time in 
her office. Unlike past Administrations, where tough-minded press secretaries 
were a primary fire wall during crises, in this White House, other high 
officials are as visible -- and verbal -- as Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers' current caution is different from times past. During the chaos over C. 
Lani Guinier's nomination to head the Justice Department's civil-rights 
division last June, one columnist questioned the Clinton Administration's 
maturity and used Myers' fondness for flip remarks as an example: "One of the 
things you lose when you get high office is the freedom to kid around with 
abandon." 
</P>
<P>
 At 32, Margaret Jane (Dee Dee) Myers qualifies as a pioneer in U.S. politics. 
She is not only one of the youngest people to be a presidential press 
secretary, but also the first woman. In an Administration with more 
high-ranking women than any other, Myers is the second most visible female 
after the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 For all this, Myers still fights for respect. She does not occupy the 
traditional spacious office of past press secretaries, but sits in a cramped 
space two doors down; her title is deputy assistant to the President, not full 
assistant like her predecessors. Such things make reporters worry that she 
lacks access and is winging it when describing policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticisms are typical of the job. Next to vice presidents, press 
secretaries are the Rodney Dangerfields of politics. The real difference 
between Myers and past press secretaries is that so many others in Bill 
Clinton's Administration talk so freely. This is a White House with many 
spokesmen and no clear hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking in her small office, the daughter of a Lockheed test pilot and Vietnam 
veteran still shows hints of the tomboy who grew up in a Republican, Catholic 
family just north of the San Fernando Valley. She is generous with her time and 
still candid. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: This is an Administration in which everyone seems to be a spokesman. 
What is your job?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: A lot of people in this Administration do have relationships with the 
press. A lot of peer relationships. People went to school together. They grew 
up together. They live in the same neighborhoods. They have the same interests 
. . . . In many ways that is helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not sure that has a tremendous effect on my role. It has some effect 
clearly. My job is to be a spokesman -- the spokesman, I suppose -- for the 
President, for the White House, to do the daily briefings, to manage the press 
corps in terms of travel, day-to-day needs, access, interviews, all those 
issues. I am the primary contact person, but certainly not the only contact 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has Whitewater changed what you do?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It has made it more difficult for a number of reasons. For one, it is 
distracting. And even though the President may be giving a speech on jobs, or 
meeting with a foreign leader, the press is still focused on Whitewater. So you 
are trying to push what the President is talking about and field the questions 
on Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The second thing that makes it hard is there are so many questions we can't 
answer -- because we don't have the information or because we need to let the 
special counsel do his job -- that it often looks like you're evading or not 
being direct, when, in fact, for one reason or another, you can't give them the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most frustrating part of it is having to prove the negative. 
Prove the Clintons didn't do anything wrong. That is frustrating, especially 
when no one has accused him of any specific allegations of doing anything 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With the Whitewater controversy, do you agree with the argument that there 
is an almost institutional bias to tear down the presidency that has become 
part of the media culture?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There is an institutional cynicism that causes reporters to question 
everything the President says, and the motives of everything the President and 
his Administration try to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that is troubling. I don't think anything is ever taken at face value. 
The press never accepts at face value that the President is taking a certain 
action because he wants to create jobs or because he believes that it is in the 
best interests of the American people or that he is genuinely committed to 
making life better for people. There is a relentless search for motives, bad 
actions, insincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a generation weaned on Watergate, and there is no presumption of 
innocence and no presumption of good intentions. Instead, there is a 
presumption that, without relentless scrutiny, the government will misbehave. 
</P>
<P>
 The press plays an important role, and I think the press has to serve -- and 
the White House press corps, in particular -- has to serve as the institutional 
memory . . . . The press has seen some of this stuff before, and they know, and 
they can smell the difference between a cosmetic act and a real policy change. 
But sometimes I think it goes too far, and if you just look at this week -- to 
compare Whitewater to Watergate is a travesty. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not to say we haven't made mistakes that we shouldn't be held 
accountable for, but to suggest that this is somehow equivalent to that is just 
unfortunate. It's not the same. And all troubles are not the same. All mistakes 
are not impeachable offenses, and to suggest otherwise -- there isn't enough 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A lot is made of your being young. Do you think at times you are too 
irreverent? Of the wrong generation for the Washington press corps?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think coming into this job being young, being from Los Angeles -- and, 
let's face it, in Washington being from California is a negative -- and being 
female, those things created a challenge for me. In some ways, I have had to 
work very hard and have to continue to work very hard to overcome that. 
</P>
<P>
 I think people want to believe that because you are young and from California 
and female, that you are not as serious . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does being a woman create problems?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Washington is still very much a male-oriented culture. Being from Los 
Angeles, I think it is less so there -- there is less attachment to tradition, 
perhaps, there is more flexibility, more acceptance of change generally. 
</P>
<P>
 That is partly because of Hollywood. You can have a 30-year-old person running 
a multimillion-dollar studio who has two earrings and never puts on a tie. That 
doesn't happen here. People in power tend to be older, tend to be male and tend 
to be fairly conventional. I don't mean that in a critical way. It is just a 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
 I have tried to bring a sense of humor to the job, because I think it allows 
you to survive. Things can get pretty tense out there. Reporters have things 
they need to get done on any given day that you can't give them. A lot of 
times, as you know, it can get pretty aggressive. And humor is a good way to 
defuse that, to keep it a little bit lighter . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You do have to be careful. I think I have stepped over the line a few times. 
You learn from your mistakes. Sometimes, you hear something coming out of your 
mouth and you wish, right away, you hadn't said it. But having a sense of humor 
has served me more than it has hurt me -- just in the sense that it has allowed 
me to keep my sanity, or what was left of my sanity when I got here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When did you step over the line?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The one day that stands out was during the budget debate in the Senate. I 
shouldn't even tell the story, but I kind of get a kick out of it, because I 
was terrified for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 It was going to be very close, and it had passed the House by one vote, and 
there were two or three holdouts, and one of them was (Sen.) Bob Kerrey 
(D-Neb.). He had come over that morning and met privately with the President at 
the residence. At my briefing, someone asked me where they met; I said at the 
residence; what room, and I said, "The Bob Kerrey Room, formerly the Lincoln 
bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as I said it I thought, "Oh, my God, he hasn't cast a vote yet. The 
vote is not until 8 p.m., after the news." Sure enough, the quote ended up on 
NBC, and I was worried Kerrey was going to be furious and might change his vote 
back. So after the news, I went to the vice president -- I was afraid to tell 
the President -- and told him. He looked at me, paused and he burst out 
laughing. He said, "C'mon, we have to go tell the President." So I told the 
President, and he thought it was funny. But I was petrified for several hours 
until Kerrey voted. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One question raised about all press secretaries, and raised frequently in 
this White House, is whether Dee Dee Myers has enough access to the President 
to be effective.  
</P>
<P>
 A: The only person the press believes has enough access to satisfy all their 
needs is the President himself. I think it's a fair question, and it is one 
that you have to prove every single day. I think it is very hard to change 
perceptions. There are some reporters who think I have an adequate amount of 
access and there are others who question it . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I do talk to my predecessors from time to time. I talk to Marlin (Fitzwater, 
who worked for Ronald Reagan and George Bush), I talk to Jody Powell (who 
worked for Jimmy Carter), I talk to Ron Ziegler (who worked for Richard M. 
Nixon), and one of the things you talk about with other press secretaries is 
how hard you have to work to have the access. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When you walk out to do a briefing, you can tell -- from what is on CNN and on 
the wires, what is in the morning papers and from your first round of calls -- 
you can tell what 70% of your questions are going to be. It is the other 30% 
you are not sure of that make you nervous. It could be something that a 
reporter is working on, or something off the wall, or what's happening in some 
country you haven't paid attention to in the last week. You try to be as 
prepared as you can. You learn to say, "I will get back to you," rather than to 
try to wing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One reason people ask that question is you don't occupy the office that 
past press secretaries had and because you are a "deputy assistant" rather than 
"assistant" to the President.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that appearances do matter to the press in terms of establishing or 
reinforcing the idea that you have access. In terms of appearances, I think, 
those things have not been helpful. In terms of reality, it has mattered less. 
</P>
<P>
 I worked on the campaign from the early stages -- I took this job in October 
of 1991 -- and traveled with the President every single day for over a year. It 
has helped me a tremendous amount. I know enough about his past from Arkansas, 
I have, I think, a very good relationship with him. I have the ability to walk 
in and ask him questions when I need to ask him questions. I see him several 
times a day on a number of issues. There is a good amount of trust between us. 
</P>
<P>
 It is incumbent on me to work as hard as I can to provide the information that 
reporters need to do their jobs. I don't think any press secretary can ever 
satisfy every reporter. All you can do is work at it every day and . . . try to 
serve the President and the press and let the results speak for themselves. . . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: One criticism I heard when the Administration arrived, that I hear again, 
is people in this White House believe in the power of spin -- or their ability 
to talk their way out of things -- and that has hurt.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have heard that analysis. It is true that we were very aggressive in the 
campaign, and that one of the things we did very well was to knock down 
misinformation and aggressively put forward positive information so that we 
tried to remain on the offensive. I think a little bit of that mentality we 
brought into the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an oversimplification to say that we think we can spin our way out of 
problems. But I do think there is a sense that by being aggressive and by 
trying to knock down bad information or misinformation and replace it with 
positive information -- particularly in an Administration that is doing so many 
things proactively -- that I do think that, while not trying to talk their way 
out of things, there are people here who will try to talk reporters into, "No, 
no, no, the story shouldn't be Whitewater. It should be that we have created 
more than 2 million jobs, more than Bush created in four years, we've done that 
in a year. We are going to create 8 million jobs." There is a lot of aggressive 
enthusiasm. Sometimes, perhaps, that is misperceived . . . .

BOOSTER SHOTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING; TWO HUGE PROGRAMS WILL BE OFFERED IN THE 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American dream of owning a home often turns out to be no more than a dream 
in pricey California, where too many people are unable to get a home loan. But 
now, as interest rates remain low, millions of dollars of new financing are 
being made available for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the two new programs that were announced last week are no cure-all, 
but they are welcome and long overdue. Traditional lenders historically have 
catered to the middle and upper housing market at the expense of the low end, 
where the goal of owning a home has been the most elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 This tendency to favor the more affluent borrower has become an institutional 
problem. Barriers to borrowing have been particularly severe for minorities and 
low-income workers, according to studies that have identified racial 
discrimination and biases in lending practices. In any community, homeownership 
is a key to building economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the Federal National Mortgage Assn., the nation's largest home 
mortgage investor, said it will commit $1 trillion between now and the end of 
the decade to help finance homes for 10 million families and the communities 
most in need. The Fannie Mae program is designed to reach families with incomes 
at or below the median for the communities. Minorities, new immigrants, central 
city residents and people who have special housing needs are expected to be 
among the beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development California's mega-rich state pension funds disclosed 
that they will invest millions in a remarkably affordable housing deal that 
should yield 5,000 apartments, townhouses and homes for renters and first-time 
buyers. This unprecedented infusion of private pension funds into what had been 
a public effort is laudable. It is also very necessary because federal budget 
deficits and other fiscal constraints preclude greater government involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious project -- $340 million in construction loans -- involves 
Oakland's World Savings & Loan Assn., the Ford Foundation, the California 
Public Employees Retirement System (CalPers), the California State Teachers 
Retirement System (CalSters), Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Bridge Housing 
Corp., a nonprofit developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Is funneling such huge amounts of money into affordable housing altruism or 
charity? Neither. These institutions look at these investments as good 
business. But with their investment, they demonstrate an admirable social 
conscience.

BUT SHOULD UCLA COST AS MUCH AS STANFORD?; BRILLIANT NEW REPORT SUGGESTS THAT'S 
THE WAY STATE IS GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are, broadly, two ways to look at the decline of public higher education 
in California. Faculty and administration see deferred maintenance, foregone 
raises, shrunken staff, deteriorated labs and libraries and increasing 
workload. Students and their families see much of what faculty and 
administration see, but they also see fees too high for them to pay and a 
deliberate downsizing that bars their path even when poverty does not. 
</P>
<P>
 When state money was abundant enough to meet the needs of provider and 
consumer alike, there was no need to choose one over the other. But money is no 
longer abundant, and a choice is clearly being made to preserve the integrity 
of the institutions -- the University of California, the California State 
University and the community college system -- by a combination of cost-cutting 
(enrollment reduction) and revenue enhancement (increased fees), even if this 
combination sharply reduces educational opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 DISAPPEARING STUDENTS: There is no question that, personally, the key 
administrators would prefer the continuation of low-cost, high-access public 
higher education. But professionally they have begun to move in another 
direction. UC fees are climbing by as much as 40% annually. Cal State fees have 
risen 85% since 1990. Community college fees increased 30% in 1993 alone. 
Because the average family income of UC students is high, UC enrollment has not 
dropped by much. But the Cal State system has lost 22,000 students, the 
equivalent of a large campus, and community college enrollment has dropped a 
staggering 137,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Should this quiet but radical change in California public higher education 
continue? UC tuition has been rising at the rate of $600 per year with no end 
in sight. There is little doubt that UCLA could thrive even with tuition as 
high as Stanford's; and if its tuition goes that high, it will be, effectively, 
a private institution. But should it be one? And should administrators -- or 
even the UC regents -- be allowed to make it one by boosting tuitions? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't think so. There is no more basic question about public higher 
education than whether it will remain public. This is why we welcome the 
invitation offered to the public by the California Higher Education Policy 
Center to comment on the draft of its report "Time for Decision: California's 
Legacy and the Future of Higher Education." 
</P>
<P>
 CALL FOR FREEZING FEES: The center's director, Patrick Callan, is no more 
anti-faculty or anti-research than UC President Jack W. Peltason or CSU 
Chancellor Barry Munitz is anti-student. But the center's emphasis on access is 
unmistakable. One need read no further than its second recommendation: that 
undergraduate student charges be frozen during the 1994-95 academic year and 
thereafter not be permitted to rise faster than statewide personal income. Or 
its third: that "funding priority should be given to campuses that maintain or 
increase enrollment while at the same time providing quality education" -- a 
penalty, in other words, for reducing access. 
</P>
<P>
 The merit of these and the center's other recommendations aside, their 
publication permits the public to engage an issue too large to be entrusted to 
even the most brilliant and dedicated professional managers. The center 
maintains that, properly managed, California public higher education can 
"accomplish more with less": access as well as quality, including research 
quality, on a reduced budget. Administrators maintain the opposite: You can't 
get blood from a turnip, something's got to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides make strong points, and the debate will be won or lost, needless to 
say, in the details. All Californians -- not just students and their families 
-- have a stake in its outcome.

UNIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Op-Ed piece by Harry Bernstein titled "Workplace Totalitarianism Takes a 
Hit" (Column Left, March 13) shows us once and for all the reactionary nature 
of recent unionism in America. Not only was labor unwilling to accept sharing 
of decision-making but it was unwilling to face the reality of international 
competition and the drastic changes it brought into play.Little wonder that 
labor union membership is now under 20% in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that labor's partnership in management decisions solves the real problem. 
(Witness current difficulties in Western Europe.) Perhaps the most promising 
trend in the U.S. has to do with employee ownership, not just decision-sharing. 
That is already happening at companies like Avis and United Airlines. But why 
can't the employees use the money in their retirement funds to acquire control 
of the corporations where they work? After all, a 10% ownership of the stock 
can often give you control of the whole show. But that would surely spell the 
end of unions.

SEN. DAVID ROBERTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the editorial on the Roberti recall effort (March 13): 
</P>
<P>
 It is utterly irresponsible journalism to lump all of of David Roberti's foes 
and critics into the same bunch as the gun groups. While such individuals may 
have gotten the recall going, the list of recall supporters has blossomed to 
include a wide variety of activists from the right, left and center.In fact, 
two of the five recall proponents listed on the original petition support the 
assault weapon ban. They also support cleaning up the Legislature. It is 
obvious to all political observers that Roberti is using the gun issue as a 
smoke screen. Roberti's record as a legislator and his integrity and 
effectiveness are the only issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anyone deny that the California Legislature is rife with corruption, 
influence-peddling, pork-barreling, posturing and knee-jerk lawmaking? As 
President pro tempore of the Senate for more than a decade, Roberti has left 
his mark on that body by wielding tremendous power over pending legislation, 
committee appointments and project funding.

RAPE: THE CRIME THAT IS TRULY INSANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The people of Claremont can breathe easier: Rapist Christopher Evans Hubbart 
failed a psychiatric exam last Wednesday and as a result was not paroled. Modoc 
County citizens are pressing their fight to keep out another serial rapist, 
Melvin A. Carter, released on parole Thursday. But Claremont can relax only 
until August, 1995, when Hubbart's prison term is up; psychiatric exams can 
delay a parole but not extend a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that tests show that Hubbart is mentally disordered, does he belong in a 
conventional prison in the first place? The assumption that an offender sane 
enough to stand trial is sane enough to be returned to the community needs a 
second look. Even though Hubbart may understand that his crime is a crime, he 
may belong in psychiatric rather than criminal confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 Most crimes accomplish by illegal means some end that could also be 
accomplished by legal means. Instead of buying a popular CD, a teen-ager steals 
it. The act, though wrong, is comprehensible. Sex crimes are different. Rape 
only seems to be a path to sexual pleasure. As all serious students of the 
subject confirm, the violence of rape is an end in itself for the rapist. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who commit sex crimes are often denounced as animals, but sex crimes as 
the human species commits them scarcely are paralleled in other species. This 
is so because these crimes pervert the distinctive capacity of the human animal 
to make symbols; that is, to make one reality stand for another. Solders kill, 
but they are not murderers. Rapists perform the sex act but they are not 
lovers. In the first case, the empirical reality of the act is ennobled; in the 
second, it is hideously degraded. But only the human animal is able to make 
either transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 To recognize the deeply human strangeness of sex crime is not to excuse it. 
John Wayne Gacy, the professional clown who murdered 33 boys and young men 
during the 1970s in a Chicago suburb, was rightly found guilty: His disorder 
had not robbed his mind of its ability to recognize crime as crime. And yet, as 
a recent exhibit of Gacy's prison art at the Tatou gallery in Beverly Hills all 
too vividly confirmed, Gacy does indeed have a richly disordered mind. 
</P>
<P>
 For his kind of crime, concern for public safety and concern for the disturbed 
criminal himself may be pointing in the same direction. Mentally disturbed, 
violent people should not be on the streets.

IMMIGRATION DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I agree with Elton Gallegly's "Column Right" (Commentary, March 13) insofar as 
the need to document the number of illegal aliens, or undocumented workers, if 
one prefers. We simply cannot put our head in the sand and pretend that we 
don't have a problem with the major drain on our welfare, education and medical 
systems caused by immigrants who have arrived in this country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they are legal or illegal is, to a large extent, immaterial. It is 
against our moral standards to turn away those in need of medical care, 
regardless of their immigration status. The child becomes an American citizen 
at birth and is legally entitled to certain services. How can we afford to pay 
for this tremendous burden without federal assistance? 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that illegal immigration is a federal problem. In many 
cases, assistance is federally mandated without provisions for federal funding. 
In any case, we will end up having to deny benefits to someone, if sufficient 
funds are not available. 
</P>
<P>
 We should start now by surveying the population to determine the number of 
illegal residents in California. One thing is certain: We will never be able to 
do this without a bipartisan effort. In order to accomplish this, we must stop 
pointing the finger of blame at one another. The important thing is to solve 
the problem. 
</P>

<P>
 The recent tragic accident in which a truck full of illegal immigrants ran off 
the road and killed many of the occupants can be blamed both on those who 
crossed our border illegally and on the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The government entices people to come here illegally by its unwillingness to 
pass and fund the necessary legislation to enforce our immigration laws. That 
information spreads around the world with predictable results. To prevent this 
type of accident from continuing to happen, we should either throw open our 
border and invite the rest of the world to come on in or else put a stop to 
illegal immigration by whatever means are necessary.

 Politicians who drink the wine of corporate interests and sing their song 
discover that screaming "illegals" is more convenient than discussing the 
homeless, jobless and their voting record. Old folks who have forgotten that 
long ago they were the ones to be branded "foreigners" now demand the expulsion 
of those of ancient North American seed whose ancestors ruled this territory. 
</P>
<P>
 A few voices protest that these hard workers will not bankrupt us. Their labor 
produces value, they pay sales, gas and other hidden taxes, their low wages 
produce lower costs and lower prices for food, clothing, etc. and if they 
leave, no one will make a mad dash for the open jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the influx? Why risk hardship, robbery and even death in order to slip 
into a country where undocumented aliens often sleep 10 to a room? They are 
driven by hopeless poverty and murderous repression, from Guatemala, Haiti, 
Mexico, El Salvador and on and on. Countries with small wealthy elites whose 
military shows no mercy to the peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 Further research reveals U.S. corporate investment in these nations and a flow 
of funds and arms to them by this country in order to maintain the status quo. 
The Ft. Benning, Ga., Army school trains (these nations') officers. Here they 
learn "death squad tactics" and the art of subduing the field hands.

 This letter is in response to the commentary by Wayne A. Cornelius titled 
"Border Control: Smoke, Mirrors" (March 14). 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost inconceivable that today, in one of the world's most civilized 
countries, there are still a few who believe that there are certain types and 
levels of crime that are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration is illegal. It is a crime. A case could be made to 
mitigate the punishment for those who are violating our immigration laws, if 
they were fleeing from persecution or civil upheaval, but certainly not just to 
obtain a better way of life. This is the usual case for those coming from 
Mexico. To ignore any crime at the border is to invite disrespect for our laws 
and ultimately to encourage anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Where there are violations of law, the customary solution is to increase 
police personnel with the most advanced equipment. It makes sense to properly 
equip the Border Patrol so that they do their assigned duties more efficiently.

 The stadium lights along the Tijuana border lighting up the sky every night,

stop unarmed peasants from invading our country.

COLUMN RIGHT / JACK KEMP: FORGET EUROPE AS A MODEL FOR CREATING JOBS; CLINTON'S 
HEALTH PLAN HAS THE SAME BLIND SPOT -- BROADER BENEFITS REQUIRE HIGHER TAXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK KEMP, Jack Kemp, a Republican former congressman from New York, is 
co-director of Empower America, a conservative advocacy organization based in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most consistent facts about American economic life over the past 
several years has been the almost weekly announcement of massive job cutbacks 
or layoffs by Fortune 500 firms. 
</P>
<P>
 What should America do? President Clinton thinks he has the answer. "We simply 
must figure out how to create more jobs," he said back in January. "We have a 
lot to learn form the Europeans," he added, citing European job-training 
programs and the ability to move people "from school to work into good-paying 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one problem with this job- growth tutorial. Europe has nothing 
to teach. Every country on that continent, except Switzerland, is experiencing 
unemployment well above America's 6.5% rate. Several European countries have 
unemployment rates well into double digits, including Belgium, 14%; Denmark, 
12.4%; France, 12%, and Spain, 23.1%. Britain is the only European nation with 
an unemployment rate lower today than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe's high unemployment rates have a single root cause: the failure to 
create enough new jobs. Between 1982 and 1992, the six largest European 
countries combined created just 6.9 million jobs, while the European labor 
force increased by 7.5 million. Over the same period, the United States created 
18 million new jobs, while the labor force grew by 16.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many reasons why we created so many more jobs in the 1980s, but one 
of the most important is that European employers pay significantly higher taxes 
on labor. In Belgium, for example, government-mandated charges on labor as a 
percentage of GDP have risen from 19.6% in 1970 to 29.5% in 1991; in Italy, 
from 12.7% to 23.6%. Only Great Britain's rate has remained steady. By 
contrast, the U.S. rate was 15.9% in 1970, 19.4% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 So, this much we can learn from Europe: A welfare state with national health 
insurance and expensive fringe benefits has an insatiable appetite. And the 
main burden of financing this largess always falls on working men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 With his national health-care plan, President Clinton would set America on 
Europe's descending path. Although he tells us that few workers will pay more 
than they do now, history is clear: All national health-insurance schemes 
inevitably cost far more than anyone projected when the programs were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Government has a dismal track record in predicting the burden its programs 
will impose on future taxpayers. Look at Medicare. When that program was 
enacted in 1965, the Johnson Administration estimated that it would cost $8 
billion per year by 1990. The actual cost? $98 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if we take the Clinton projections at face value, his health plan will 
still lead to a 27% increase in federal taxes by the year 2004, according to a 
study from the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton defends this vast expansion of federal taxation on the grounds that 
higher taxes will be offset by lower health-insurance costs. This is just a 
semantic game. Would people really be better off if the government increased 
their taxes by the amount of their annual food costs while providing free food 
at the same time? Of course not, because the government cannot provide anything 
as efficiently as the market and because the costs would quickly rise far 
beyond expectations, leading to tax increases or reduced benefits. Also, in the 
process, people would lose the freedom to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care will not escape this fate. Quality will decline because patients 
and doctors will be forced into more rigid government constraints. As in 
Canada, a model for the Clinton Administration, people will wait months or even 
years for simple operations, and many will be denied access to treatment 
because the plan managers judge them too old to benefit, never mind their 
physicians' opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 To these costs we must add a price paid in jobs. As the European example 
shows, higher benefits lead to higher taxes, which, in the end, lead to higher 
unemployment. A recent DRI/McGraw Hill study predicts that by the year 2000, 
the Clinton health plan would cause 1 million jobs to disappear -- a 
conservative estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of invoking a European model of job creation that creates no jobs, 
President Clinton should study the lesson of America's job explosion in the 
1980s. He would find that the key to job creation lies in unleashing the 
creative power of America's entrepreneurs and small business owners through 
lower taxes on both labor and capital. Viewing entrepreneurs as a endless 
funding source for an insatiable federal government is a prescription for 
employment stagnation -- or worse.

A NEEDLESS NEW RISK OF BREAST CANCER; BIOTECH: THERE ARE WELL- FOUNDED 
SUSPICIONS ABOUT MILK FROM COWS TREATED WITH THE NEW GROWTH HORMONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMUEL S. EPSTEIN, Dr. Samuel S. Epstein is professor of occupational and 
environmental medicine at the University of Illinois School of Public Health 
and chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition Inc. The concerns in this 
article have been sent to the FDA and the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration recently warned dairy producers, distributors 
and retailers against "hormone-free" labels on milk from cows that have not 
been given the biotech milk-production stimulant known as recombinant bovine 
growth hormone. The FDA states that such labeling could be "false or 
misleading" under federal law, as there is "no significant difference between 
milk from treated and untreated cows." Monsanto, maker of the hormone, is 
already suing one large Midwest milk producer for using the label. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusing FDA guidelines were, according to the consumer publication Daily 
Citizen, written by Deputy Commissioner Michael Taylor, a former counsel for 
Monsanto and a biotech umbrella organization. The guidelines are scientifically 
flawed and reckless and reflect flagrant disregard of consumers' right to know. 
Furthermore, the FDA ignores evidence linking milk from treated cows with 
increased risk of breast cancer. The concerns, based on published research: 
</P>
<P>
 * The biotech hormone induces a marked and sustained increase in levels of 
insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1, in cow's milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * IGF-1 regulates cell growth, division and differentiation, particularly in 
infants. While human and normal bovine IGF-1 are identical, they are largely 
bound to protein and thus probably less biologically active than the unbound 
IGF-1 in treated milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * IGF-1 is not destroyed by pasteurization or digestion and is readily 
absorbed across the intestinal wall. In a 1990 FDA publication disclosing 
toxicity tests conducted by Monsanto, feeding the hormone (trade name Posilac) 
to mature rats for only two weeks resulted in statistically significant 
increases in body and liver weights and bone length. These effects were seen at 
a small fraction of injected doses given to control rats. But by gerrymandering 
these explicit data, the FDA alleged that IGF-1 "lacks oral toxicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the FDA nor Monsanto has investigated the effects of long-term feeding 
of IGF-1 and treated milk on growth, or on more sensitive sub-cellular effects 
in infant rats or infants of any other species. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cows injected with the biotech hormone show heavy localization of IGF-1 in 
breast (udder) epithelial cells; this does not occur in untreated cows. 
</P>
<P>
 * IGF-1 induces rapid division and multiplication of normal human breast 
epithelial cells in tissue cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is highly likely that IGF-1 promotes transformation of normal breast 
epithelium to breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * IGF-1 maintains the malignancy of human breast-cancer cells, including their 
invasiveness and ability to spread to distant organs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The breast tissues of female fetuses and infants are sensitive to hormonal 
influences. Imprinting by IGF-1 may increase future breast-cancer risks and 
sensitivity of the breast to subsequent unrelated risks such as mammography and 
the carcinogenic and estrogen-like effects of pesticide residues in food, 
particularly in pre-menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
 These concerns are not new. In a 1989 letter to the FDA, I warned that the 
effects of IGF-1 "could include premature growth stimulation in infants, 
(breast enlargement) in young children and breast cancer in adult females." 
More recently, the Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Assn. 
stated: "Further studies will be required to determine whether the ingestion of 
higher than normal concentrations of bovine insulin-like growth factor is safe 
for children, adolescents and adults." The opposite of "further study" is 
uncontrolled, unlabeled sales of treated milk to unwitting consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from risks of breast cancer and other IGF-1 effects, the FDA and 
industry have downplayed additional differences between hormonal and 
non-hormonal milk. The FDA-approved label insert for Posilac, a pamphlet that 
only dairy farmers see, admits that its "use is associated with increased 
frequency of use of medication in cows for mastitis and other health problems." 
Monsanto's own data further show up to an 80% incidence of mastitis, an udder 
infection, in hormone-treated cattle and resulting contamination of milk with 
statistically significant levels of pus; this will necessitate virtually 
routine use of antibiotics, with attendant risks of allergic reactions and 
antibiotic resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress should insist that, at the very least, the FDA immediately revoke its 
restrictions on labeling of milk from untreated cows. More prudently, it should 
ban the use of these hormones.

COLUMN LEFT / PETER ZHEUTLIN: BLAME APLENTY FOR SHRINKING RESOURCES; FISHING 
JOINS LOGGING ON THE ENDANGERED-JOBS LIST, AND AGAIN, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS 
ARE MADE THE BOGYMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the largest floating protest in America since the Boston Tea Party. 
Angry fishermen blockaded Boston Harbor last month to protest against the 
recent imposition of federal regulations that severely restrict fish catches in 
the North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations, and the protest, are the inevitable result of substituting 
crisis management for long-term planning when it comes to natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations will, in the short-term, cause real pain and economic 
dislocation for many fishermen. But their predicament has its roots in decades 
of overfishing. It is an elementary law of nature that applies to most 
renewable resources: When consumption exceeds regeneration, the resource will 
be depleted and those who depended on it will, sooner or later, be out of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been known for years that fish harvests, not just in the North Atlantic 
but in many parts of the world, have proceeded at levels that are 
unsustainable. In New England, overfishing of commercially valuable species, 
such as cod, haddock and flounder, have allowed less valuable species to 
dominate the habitat, and the displacement may be permanent. In 1990, a task 
force recommended strict quotas in hopes of restoring commercial fish 
populations in five to 10 years. So, the question in New England is whether to 
allow the last remnants of commercially valuable stocks to be depleted -- which 
would give the fishing industry a brief reprieve but a certain death -- or to 
restrict catches, allow stocks to replenish and salvage the industry's 
long-term future. 
</P>
<P>
 It is of little comfort to those facing immediate economic disaster that the 
obvious answer is the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find the same lack of foresight everywhere you look. In the Pacific 
Northwest, loggers and mill owners blamed the spotted owl and environmentalists 
for their economic woes. But the loggers of Oregon didn't run into a spotted 
owl or environmentalists, though both made convenient scapegoats. They ran into 
their own lack of foresight. For too long, they cut trees faster than the 
forests could regenerate. Given the chance, they would have cut themselves 
right out of a future. In fact, some did. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montana, too, big timber companies cut trees three times faster than new 
trees could grow back. Times were good, while they lasted. But when Champion 
International cut and ran from nearly 900,000 acres of forest land late last 
year, it left entire communities dazed and hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of jobs in Libby, Mont., when the tree-cutting binge was in 
full swing in the 1980s. Plenty of short-term jobs, that is. And, one supposes, 
New England's fishermen could eke out a few more lean years before they fished 
themselves, and the fish, out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere the issue is characterized as jobs versus the environment. It's a 
false dichotomy, but one that serves the interests of industry quite well. When 
corporate shortsightedness and greed inevitably result in lost jobs, the 
corporate finger points at environmentalists. The company has its profit, the 
stockholders have their dividends and the displaced workers have their bogyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fishermen who are hurting now are small, independent operators. It 
is easy to understand, given how tough it is to earn a living at sea, how and 
why overfishing occurred. There is plenty of blame to go around, and some lies 
with governments that waited until a crisis to act. 
</P>
<P>
 For good reason, environmental groups cannot appear to be anti-jobs, and, 
indeed, they are not. Yet the specter of even the slightest economic 
dislocation can often derail sensible, long-term environmental planning. The 
issue isn't jobs versus the environment. It's short-term jobs versus long-term 
jobs. Those who depend on natural resources for their jobs -- fishermen, 
loggers, paper-mill workers -- have the most to lose from shortsighted 
depletion of those resources. 
</P>
<P>
 We can no longer afford the short-term vision that has consistently guided 
policy concerning our natural resources. Posterity, it is said, has no lobby 
with politicians, so the political challenge is daunting. We must adjust our 
sights. The next quarter, the next election, the next harvest -- these are 
short-term perspectives. The next century and beyond must be our frame of 
reference.

HOW LOS ANGELES CAN BENEFIT FROM THE FARRAKHAN CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden and John W. Mack, Xandra Kayden is a visiting scholar at the 
Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont College and author of Surviving 
Power (Free Press). John W. Mack is president of the Los Angeles Urban League.

<P>
 Smoothing the strained relations between African-American and Jewish leaders 
caused by the anti-Semitic statements of an associate of Louis Farrakhan might, 
on its face, seem virtually impossible. The Nation of Islam leader's rebuke of 
Khalid Abdul Muhammad was ambiguous, and mainstream black leaders, although 
critical of Farrakhan's handling of the incident, have not ostracized him. All 
this has made Jewish leaders wary. 
</P>
<P>
 African-American leaders, in turn, are a little more than irritated by the 
call to condemn Farrakhan, not only because it suggests that they should move 
in lock-step. They never demand of their white counterparts that they rise up 
en masse and denounce racists among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the history of the two communities' relationship offers plenty of 
resources to start to heal the wounds opened by the controversy. Therein lies a 
lesson for Los Angeles and its ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-Jewish relationship goesback to the turn of the century, when Jews 
were among the founders of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People and the Urban League. More recently, Jews made up two-thirds of the 
white riders on the freedom buses in 1961. Three years later, according to 
Murray Friedman of the American Jewish Committee, Jews accounted for one-third 
to a half of the Mississippi "Freedom Summer" volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sustaining core of the relationship was and is the relationship 
between institutions: the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League 
of B'nai Brith, the American Jewish Congress, the Jewish Federation and 
countless synagogues on one side; the NAACP, Urban League and the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference and many black churches on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 All these organizations have strong roots in their communities, as well as 
experience in working with others to achieve a common goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Power movement that grew out of the civil-rights movement shifted 
the energies of many African-Americans from coalition-building to self-help. 
But most African-American leaders refused to sever links to their Jewish 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 So, among Jews and African-Americans, there is a memory of coalition and an 
infrastructure that enables them to reach out to each other in times of 
controversy or crisis. But continuing relations must be based on mutual 
respect, acceptance of the real differences concerning the problems of racism 
and anti-Semitism and poverty -- and an understanding that one group cannot 
select the other's leaders. Still, the tools of healing are available. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, who speaks for the Korean, the Latino, the Chinese, the Filipino 
or the white community? When tensions between these communities arise, which 
organizations can legitimately represent their communities? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chinese-American community, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Assn., 
formed in 1853 and representing 28 family associations, plus other groups in 
the community, comes closest. But it is one institution in a far more diverse 
community than the one it represented more than 100 years ago. There are other 
coalitions of organizations, but their leaders do not know their counterparts 
in other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jews and African-Americans -- and for the city -- the Farrakhan issue 
raises the larger question of leadership: what it means to lead one community 
in a world of many communities; how conflicts are identified, and how 
communities are brought together. It is a political process, one of talking, 
learning more about each other and searching out a common ground. The outcome 
will probably be more a truce than a new age of peace, but the dispute will not 
become an obstacle to cooperation on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson for Los Angeles -- and America -- is that each community must 
develop leaders and institutions that can speak for them, and then trust them 
to reach out, to negotiate, to reach an accord. It is a political process in 
which every group must engage.

5 YEARS AFTER EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL, ALASKANS ITCHING FOR TRIAL; POLLUTION: 
OIL COMPANY SETTLED WITH THE STATE FOR $900 MILLION IN 1991, BUT OTHER 
CLAIMANTS REMAIN. FEDERAL SUIT STARTS MAY 2. 
</P>

<P>
 Tides and times have been kind to Prince William Sound in the five years since 
the Exxon Valdez rammed a charted reef, dumping nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into pristine waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Storms have scoured Alaska's 1,500 miles of polluted coastline, removing about 
half the oil embedded in some places. Many beaches look clean. Population 
forecasts for bald eagles are good. The tourists are back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's behind us," said John Manly, an aide to Gov. Walter J. Hickel, whose 
administration won a $900-million settlement from Exxon Corp. in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not over for the people of Cordova, home port to Prince William 
Sound's commercial fishing fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordova fishermen are among the plaintiffs who filed damage claims in the wake 
of the March 24, 1989, accident. They are only just getting their day in court, 
and until they do, they will not turn the page on the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 They blame the Valdez spill for bad salmon harvests over the last two years. 
They say they are just hanging on, and that massive Exxon is trying to wait 
them out, an assertion the company denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a war of attrition," said salmon fisherman R. J. Kopchak, a former 
Cordova city councilman whose three-story house overlooks Cordova's dock and 
forested Orca Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical week's mail, stacked on Kopchak's kitchen table, contains court 
notices about his lawsuit: More papers to sign, more documents to file. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know one guy, a fisherman here with a valid claim, who just quit sending 
in his paperwork. Refuses to do it anymore," Kopchak said as he scanned the 
foggy bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer Exxon and its attorneys can make it miserable for you, the greater 
the chance the settlement will be less." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopchak is among fishermen who say this summer's salmon season could be his 
make-or-break year. If the run fails or prices are weak, Kopchak said he may 
have to polish up his carpentry skills and move his wife and four young 
children somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I built this castle because I figured I'd live and die here," he said. "I 
really love this place. We don't lock our doors. We don't worry about our kids. 
The problem is, what I want to do is fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Exxon, the world's largest corporation, reject any suggestion that 
delay is a tactic. Complaints have been separated into state and federal class 
actions, each with separate trial judges, schedules and evidence rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal suit, scheduled to start May 2, includes 100,000 potential class 
members. Some estimates put the damages at $1.5 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial in state Superior Court is scheduled to start June 6 and includes 
seven towns oiled in the spill's path. The mayors want compensation for 
municipal services they say were diverted in response to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Other state plaintiffs include 13 Alaska Native corporations; they claim 
damage to their land and archeological sites. Natives also sued Exxon in 
federal court over damage to their traditional ways, which depend on the sound 
for food. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence-gathering for all these actions has consumed the last five years. The 
company said more than 5 million pages of documents have changed hands; nearly 
2,000 depositions were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 A list filed by Exxon names 315 planned witnesses in the federal case. 
Plaintiffs plan to call 270 witnesses in a case scheduled to last all summer. 
Authorities will testify on marine science, land values, fish abundance and -- 
hardest of all -- whether there are any lingering effects of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cordova, everyone wants an Exxon settlement -- even townspeople with no 
claim pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be known as the oil spill town any more," Mayor Margy 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at a table in the restaurant of her dockside hotel, Johnson pointed out 
a pair of sea otters playing in icy waters where, in late February, the fishing 
fleet was still idle. Some Cordovans, hoping for a new image as a tourist town, 
say the city should adopt a new slogan. "Sea otter capital of the world" has 
been mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a can-do businesswoman, wants action. 
</P>
<P>
 Until it was abruptly canceled last week, she was helping organize Cordova's 
first "Bury the Blues Day," scheduled for March 26. The event, complete with a 
New Orleans-style band parading through town, was aimed at uniting the 
community. But organizers called it off when too many people complained they 
weren't yet ready to forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Cordova, the spill was like a death in the family," Johnson said. "I'm 
appalled that five years later there's still no settlement with Exxon. That's 
like trying to get over a death when you can't read the will." 
</P>
<P>
 Cordova, a town of nearly 2,600 on the sound's eastern edge, can be reached 
only by boat or plane. Nearly half the work force is directly employed in fish 
harvesting or processing. State labor economists reported this month there was 
"little prospect" that salmon prices would bounce back soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment has receded over the last three years, sales receipts dropped and 
more than two dozen homes are on the market, the state said. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agent Linden O'Toole -- among the only families to get out of 
fishing, remain in Cordova and pursue a new occupation -- said she is fielding 
about as many inquiries from out of state as from Cordovans looking to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Toole, who is supporting her fisherman husband and two small children, said 
earnings from real estate have gone to pay off tens of thousands of dollars in 
fishing debts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping for our sake and a lot of people in this town that Exxon will come 
through with a settlement," she said. "They're a huge company. They don't need 
to hurt families like ours to do business." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, one year after the spill, the fleet turned in a near-record pink 
salmon harvest and prices were good. Then, in 1991, prices on the worldwide 
market collapsed and harvests were dumped back into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The next two years, for undetermined reasons, the run failed. Last year, the 
Pacific herring season, which typically begins in April and is the fishermen's 
first cash crop of the year, was cut short in Prince William Sound when schools 
failed to materialize. Some fish were diseased. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, frustrated by Exxon's claims that the spill caused no ongoing harm, 
a mosquito fleet of 65 seiners gave up the dismal pink salmon season to bottle 
up the Port of Valdez, terminus of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. For nearly 
two days, no tankers could arrive or depart during the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never forgive and forget," said 42-year-old Doug Pettit, a Cordova 
fisherman who since 1987 has run a local heating-repair business to tide his 
family over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if someone murdered my daughter," he said. "You can never forgive the 
person who did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit is an oil-spill domino. Since fishing has declined, he has worked 
harder at the heating company. But his neighbors are living on savings and 
hopes for an Exxon settlement, and Pettit -- who also has an Exxon claim 
pending -- said he has gotten lenient on pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't like you tapped a new resource," he said, taking a break one rainy 
morning as he coaxed heat from the pipes at the fishermen's union hall, in 
Cordova's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're still working with money from fishing. We all share the problem."

SOME FEAR NASA INVITES NEW SHUTTLE DISASTER; SPACE: BUDGET CUTS, PROBLEMS WITH 
PARTS HAVE SOME ANALYSTS WORRIED. THE AGENCY INSISTS IT IS NOT LAX ON SAFETY 
AND HAS NOT COMPROMISED STANDARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 NASA budget cuts and a string of problems with crucial space shuttle parts -- 
including the engines and booster rockets -- have raised fears of another 
Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few months, NASA has investigated one serious shuttle issue after 
another: booster pressure spikes, glued engine pumps, flawed engine welds. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Mulville, director of NASA's engineering and quality management 
division, said the problems are unrelated and in no way suggest "we have been 
lax in our standards or compromise our standards." 
</P>
<P>
 But Alex Roland, a former NASA historian who teaches at Duke University, said 
he's worried and has been for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting a little more comfortable, perhaps too comfortable, and 
that's what happened with Challenger," Roland said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Pike, head of the Federation of American Scientists' space policy 
project, also said he fears another accident -- perhaps sooner rather than 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, after 
combustible gas leaked from an O-ring joint on the right solid rocket booster. 
All seven people aboard, including a high school teacher, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was NASA's 25th shuttle flight. Columbia's current two-week research 
mission, which ended Friday, is No. 61. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA estimates the odds of a catastrophic failure during the shuttle's 8 
1/2-minute climb to orbit -- considered the most dangerous part of the flight 
-- at 1 in 75. 
</P>
<P>
 But those estimates don't factor in recent cuts that have trimmed NASA's 
budget by hundreds of millions of dollars and forced the agency to delay some 
safety improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The string of problems we've seen not only in the shuttle program, but with 
the Hubble, the Mars Observer, is from squeezing programs across the line and 
making them fit into an inadequate budget," Roland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubble Telescope was launched with a deformed mirror that required repairs 
by spacewalking astronauts. The Mars Observer vanished last summer as it neared 
Mars; program managers were criticized for design flaws and poor operating 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA's proposed budget for the next fiscal year contains $3.3 billion for the 
shuttle program, down from $3.5 billion this year, which was down from $3.9 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is it. We can't get any closer to the bone," NASA Administrator Daniel 
S. Goldin warned when the proposed budget was presented to Congress last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of NASA's space flight program, Jeremiah Pearson III, insists that 
safety is, and will remain, paramount. He wants to fly at least six shuttle 
missions a year; anything less wouldn't save much money, he said, and might 
cause proficiency to drop. The current plan calls for eight flights a year. 
</P>
<P>
 To save money, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has 
eliminated shuttle work deemed redundant, deferred safety improvements and, 
since 1988, reduced the production of main engines from five a year to two. 
Each engine costs more than $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real challenge for NASA is to cut the budget while maintaining safety," 
Columbia's commander, John Casper, said from space during a news conference 
last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There probably is a line out there. I'm not aware of where that line is, but 
I know the program managers for the shuttle program are, and I know that they 
won't let us go below that line and they will not permit unsafe shuttle 
operations," Casper told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems continue to surface, however, particularly in the components most 
critical to shuttle safety -- the three engines and two booster rockets that 
propel the shuttle and its crew into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest problem involves one of the nearly 400 welds in the high-pressure 
hydrogen fuel pump of the main engine -- Weld 51. An anonymous report to NASA's 
Safety Reporting System late last year said some of the welds were misaligned 
and raised concern about the manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Pumps with seriously misaligned welds have been barred from flight until a 
NASA materials review board can decide whether to reduce the number of times 
the parts should fly. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA had hoped to replace the high-pressure hydrogen fuel pumps with pumps 
that have no welds, but budget cuts delayed those plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pumps we are flying are pumps that were designed in the early '70s," said 
NASA's engine chief, Otto Goetz. "The technology is 20 years old and in the 
meantime the country has developed a lot of new things." 
</P>
<P>
 A potentially more serious problem was the unauthorized use of a 
super-strength glue, for at least five or six years, to secure loose platings 
in the low-pressure oxidizer turbopumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The glue is incompatible with liquid oxygen; in other words, it could ignite. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basic human error," Goetz said. "The technicians should have never used 
it, and all the instructions said clearly, 'Don't use anything that is not 
(liquid oxygen) compatible.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Goetz said that even if the glue had caught fire, the results would have 
been inconsequential because of the small amounts of glue used. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rocket boosters, reviews of pressure surges concluded in January 
that the increases were within safety limits. The spikes, or jumps in pressure 
inside the boosters, first were detected during a 1993 launch of Endeavour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the best of times, this is an extraordinarily complex technical 
challenge and there are no safety guarantees," said Steven Aftergood, senior 
research analyst for the Federation of American Scientists.

HARD TIMES PUT THE SQUEEZE ON DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FOSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a girl, Evalynn Kling imagined that life as a grown-up would be like 
playing June Cleaver in a never-ending episode of "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be married by age 25," she remembers dreaming. "I'll have started a 
family, I'll have a cat and a dog. I'll have a man taking care of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward to 1994, and turn off the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Kling is 28 now. She has no husband, no kids, no pets, no house with a picket 
fence. Just a tiny apartment, a $7-an-hour secretarial job, and a pile of 
bills. Her job is temporary, but after months of unemployment, she's glad to be 
working at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life isn't the fairy tale we were taught to expect," she said. "It's a 
struggle to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Americans who have weathered tough times recently, Kling views 
reports of economic recovery with wary optimism. Yes, she's working. Yes, 
things are looking up. But although the bills are getting paid, anxiety 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Kling's troubles began in 1990, when she was an administrative assistant for 
the Weyerhaeuser Co. Hard times in the timber industry forced the shutdown of 
her division, which refurbished and sold used logging equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she's had four short-term jobs, interspersed with seven months of 
unemployment in 1992 and three months in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment was something new for Kling, a high school graduate with one year 
of community-college secretarial training. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-spoken and well-mannered, a bright and attractive woman with long 
brunette curls, Kling is eminently employable, said Debra Dyjak, head of the 
temporary help agency Kling contacted in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got some nice office skills. She's gone to school," Dyjak said. "She 
should have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Kling agrees emphatically. Being jobless left her feeling embarrassed, 
rejected and depressed. Her whole body ached the first time she walked into the 
unemployment office. 
</P>
<P>
 She hit the job search hard, leaving resumes at 10 to 20 offices a week. When 
nothing came through, she turned to temporary office work. 
</P>
<P>
 The work has been steady -- penny-pinching government agencies and businesses 
increasingly are turning to temps -- but there's no security for Kling, and the 
pay varies. Anything less than $7 an hour won't pay the rent, but she takes it 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd still rather work," she said. "It makes me feel more useful working for 
less money than not working at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Months of unemployment have drained her savings, and she has no medical 
insurance. She drives a 1981 Honda Civic with 150,000 miles on it. She clips 
coupons for groceries. The kitchen counter in her one-bedroom apartment doubles 
as a table for her sewing machine, which she uses to sew her own clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 She once used a Visa card for emergency expenses -- a flat tire here, a broken 
radiator there -- but now, able to pay less than $50 a month toward the $1,200 
balance, Kling has cut up her card and pays cash for everything. 
</P>
<P>
 She still allows herself dreams, but they're more modest now. She hopes to 
find a permanent job, one that would allow her to attend night classes and get 
a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get somewhere with my life," she said. "It's not going anywhere as 
long as I keep running into these dead-end jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Kling remains confident that prosperity will come her way, sooner or later. 
But she also is sure that it will not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all the different things I've done for myself," she said, pointing to 
a resume spanning seven years and eight jobs.

'IN COLD BLOOD' MURDERS HAUNT DEATH PENALTY DEBATE; KANSAS: OPPONENTS AND 
SUPPORTERS OF RESTORING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT REFER FREQUENTLY TO THE CLUTTER 
FAMILY, MEMORIALIZED IN TRUMAN CAPOTE'S BOOK. 
</P>

<P>
 Almost 35 years after the Clutter family homestead became a slaughterhouse, 
Kansas legislators debating the death penalty still speak movingly, almost 
intimately, of Herb, Bonnie, Nancy and Kenyon, the four victims no one here can 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the state's most famous murder case, even without the notoriety brought 
by "In Cold Blood," Truman Capote's "nonfiction novel" that was later made into 
a somber black-and-white movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In making their arguments, both opponents and supporters of capital punishment 
refer frequently to the Clutter murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a point of remembrance," said state Rep. Clyde Graeber, chairman of the 
House committee that considers capital punishment legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a Bible," said Rep. David Heinemann, an attorney who as a teen-ager 
lived four miles from the Clutters' home outside Holcomb in southwestern 
Kansas. "We can look at it through our own lenses and substantiate our own 
viewpoints." 
</P>
<P>
 This legislative session, Kansas is closer than ever to restoring the death 
penalty. Each house of the Legislature has passed its own bill, and a joint 
conference committee is studying the significantly different versions. Reaching 
a compromise is expected to take a few weeks. Most supporters think a bill will 
eventually pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Joan Finney personally opposes capital punishment but has promised to let 
a bill become law without her signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas is one of 14 states without a death penalty. Before the U.S. Supreme 
Court declared all death penalty laws unconstitutional in 1972, Kansas executed 
prisoners by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those put to death in Kansas before 1972 were Perry Smith and Richard 
Hickock, the killers of wheat farmer Herb Clutter, his wife, Bonnie, their 
16-year-old daughter, Nancy, and 15-year-old son, Kenyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickock and Smith targeted the family farmhouse but planned only to rob the 
senior Clutter, who they believed kept substantial amounts of cash in a safe. 
The Clutters were in fact well-off, but Herb Clutter was locally notorious for 
writing checks for the smallest purchases and not keeping cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men entered the Clutter home before dawn Nov. 15, 1959; they bound and 
gagged all family members, then shot each one in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 They left with $40 to $50 in cash and Kenyon's transistor radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickock and Smith were convicted and sentenced to hang the following spring. 
They spent five years on Death Row before entering "The Corner," the warehouse 
at the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing that housed the state gallows. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Cold Blood" was published in 1965, shortly after their executions. 
</P>
<P>
 The last inmates hanged in Kansas were not Hickock and Smith but serial 
killers James Latham and George York, who murdered seven people in five states. 
They walked up the 13 gallows steps June 22, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Capote mentioned York and Latham in his book but only because they shared 
Death Row with Hickock and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latham and York -- their case is barely known in Kansas," Heinemann said. 
"But everybody knows 'In Cold Blood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Heinemann and other opponents of capital punishment note that Herb Clutter, a 
strict Methodist, was against the death penalty. Heinemann also believes 
Hickock and Smith might not have killed Bonnie, Nancy and Kenyon if they didn't 
already face "the big swing," as Hickock called it, for Herb's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of capital punishment usually cite the Clutter case as the kind 
of heinous crime that should be punished by death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd never had anything like that in our area," said Clifford Hope Jr., the 
attorney who handled the Clutter estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas has never been comfortable with capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature repealed the state's first death penalty law in 1907; no 
inmate had been hanged in the preceding 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The state returned to the death penalty as punishment for first-degree murder 
in 1935. Gov. Alf Landon noted at the time that criminals had robbed or tried 
to rob 87 banks in the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most potent means of discouraging crime is speedy and certain 
punishment," Landon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents in 1935 sounded the same arguments still ringing in the Legislature 
almost 60 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are lowering the standard of civilization; we are tarnishing the good name 
of Kansas, and this bill cannot and will not accomplish its purpose," state 
Sen. Joseph McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state waited nine years for its next execution. From 1944 to 1965 it 
executed 15 people. But since 1976, when the Supreme Court allowed states to 
start executions again, Kansas has enacted no new death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Gov. John Carlin vetoed bills in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1985. His 
successor, Republican Mike Hayden, made reinstating capital punishment a 
priority, but the Senate rejected bills in 1987 and 1989. The House rejected a 
death penalty proposal in 1992.

IN BRIEF, DO-IT-YOURSELF LAWYERS CITE COST; JUSTICE: GROWING NUMBERS OF 
AMERICANS REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN VARIETY OF CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At 8 a.m., the do-it-yourself lawyers begin their unending procession through 
the cavernous offices of Hampden County's family and probate clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 They crack oversized binders of handwritten court records, scratch their 
scalps, rub their eyes, and pose question after question to overworked clerks 
behind a 4-foot-high counter. 
</P>
<P>
 "'Abuse and threats is not grounds for divorce," a clerk tells a woman staring 
at a legal form. Another clerk arrives to speak to the woman in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have absolutely no idea what to do," says Deborah Hawley, a 
clerk. "A lot of people come in here angry because they're already frustrated 
by what's going on in court. They come up here, and they'll yell and scream at 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 The clerks, even if they know the law, are barred from giving legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for better or worse, the hordes of uninitiated standing before them are 
among the growing legions of Americans forced to depend on their own wits in 
legal matters. They represent themselves -- acting "pro se" in the rarefied 
Latin terminology of the courts -- in divorce cases, custody disputes, small 
claims court and even full-blown lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some don't think they need a lawyer, some can't find one, and others even 
believe they are better off without one. But they point overwhelmingly to one 
deciding factor: Cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm broke," said Dawn Monty, a 27-year-old mother of one, as she labored over 
six divorce and custody forms at the clerk's office. "It's very expensive to 
get a lawyer for a divorce. My mother went through two of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Bar Assn. does not keep records on how many Americans act on 
their own legal behalf. But all agree the numbers have risen dramatically in 
recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
 An ABA study in the Phoenix area found that at least one of the parties was 
acting pro se in 24% of 1980 divorce cases. Ten years later, that figure had 
soared to 88%. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges and lawyers attribute such increases to the streamlining of divorce law 
in some states and a proliferation of do-it-yourself legal kits, an explosion 
of custody battles and requests for restraining orders, broader jurisdiction 
for some small claims courts, Reagan-era cuts in government-funded legal 
counsel for poor people, and escalating lawyers' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some self-taught lawyers, although acknowledging legal costs as a motivation, 
contend they can do better work than real lawyers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys forget. I'm on top of everything," said Melvin Brown, a 
63-year-old retired firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who quit high school after the ninth grade but later gained an 
equivalency diploma, is representing himself in a 15-year-old legal dispute 
over his union fees with the city of Chicopee, Mass. During that time, he has 
filed lawsuits all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and even argued verbally 
in state Supreme Court, doing research at a local law library and occasionally 
turning to a lawyer friend for informal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Not content with previous mixed decisions, he is now suing the city for $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown estimates that he would have paid about $100,000 if he had allowed 
lawyers to do his work. "I could never have afforded what I've been through. 
The average person can't afford it either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Burns, who has fought the government in court over her son's brain 
damage that she blames on mandatory childhood vaccinations, said a lawyer could 
not match her personal commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking at this case as one case in 100. This is my son -- my son," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many reluctant pro se lawyers are clearly lost in the maze of petitions, 
pleadings, judgments, statutes, dockets, jurisdictions and courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I have any project at home that requires more than a hammer, a nail and 
a screwdriver, I call a carpenter. Sometimes it's important to call a lawyer," 
said William Kelly, a small claims judge in Kentwood, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 David G. Sacks, a family judge in Springfield, is troubled by the train of 
poverty-stricken pro se lawyers who trudge through his courtroom. For them, 
it's no hobby, but the only alternative to lawyers with fees starting about 
$100 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a surprise that people who have trouble paying for a mortgage, 
groceries, rent and heat are having trouble paying for a lawyer," he said. "My 
greatest concern is . . . people coming in here who are unable to enforce their 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of cases with pro se parties in Hampden probate and family court 
has swelled to 50%, according to Thomas Moriarty Jr., the register of probate. 
His office and some others around the state have set up volunteer 
lawyer-for-a-day programs to offer free, informal legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 James Martin, a high-powered corporate attorney, spent one recent day at the 
Hampden Family Court offices advising pro se parents and spouses, including a 
woman seeking a restraining order against her ex-husband for an alleged attack 
on her fiance in the courthouse that very day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through a box of Kleenex in here -- half a dozen people bawling 
their eyes out," Martin said with a weary smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But volunteer lawyers can help only a small percentage of those in need. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent report, an ABA panel proposed easier-to-understand legal forms, 
administrative divorces without judges in uncontested cases, special after-hour 
court sessions and courthouse day care, and encouraging lawyers to provide 
limited advice for a fee without insisting on taking over an entire case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Supreme Court undertook a pilot project last year in three cities 
where it placed courthouse computer booths that teach a person to fill out 
divorce forms or eviction notices in either English or Spanish -- and then 
print out the completed forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how well it's running because not one person has had to ask any of 
the court staff at the pilot sites for help," said Lynn Wiletsky, manager of 
the project.

AFRICA'S YOUNGEST DICTATOR KEEPS TIGHT REIN; SIERRA LEONE: VALENTINE STRASSER 
HAS SURVIVED A CIVIL WAR, TWO COUP ATTEMPTS AND CONDEMNATION FOR EXECUTING 
ENEMIES, MUZZLING THE PRESS AND DRAFTING BOYS OF 12. BUT HE ALSO HAS ENDORSED 
DEMOCRACY, CLEANED UP THE CAPITAL, RESUMED TAX COLLECTIONS, CUT CRIME AND 
SLASHED INFLATION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Capt. Valentine Strasser was a lad of 25 when a group of equally young fellow 
officers, fresh from toppling the government, asked him to rule the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years into his almost accidental regime, Africa's youngest dictator has 
managed to survive a civil war, two coup attempts and global condemnation for 
executing enemies, muzzling the press and drafting boys as young as 12 into the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has endorsed a two-year transition to democracy, cleaned the trash 
from the capital, resumed tax collections, cut street crime, slashed civil 
service rolls by one-fourth and lowered inflation from 115% annually to less 
than 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrust into a fishbowl, Strasser, now 27, and his twentysomething ruling junta 
say they have developed a sense that history is judging them, the first African 
leaders to be born after colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all believe it is for posterity," said Maj. Julius Maada Bio, 29, the No. 
2 man in Strasser's ruling council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've assumed a position of a high responsibility. I like my 
responsibilities," he said, adding paradoxically: "But as a young man, I can't 
say I enjoy them." 
</P>
<P>
 Strasser and his clique came of age during the corrupt dictatorships of the 
1970s and 1980s, a period when the school system fell apart to such a degree 
that students took their chairs home so they could be certain to have a seat in 
class the next day. Strasser joined the army after high school. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to power after the Cold War, when the one-superpower world could 
demand democracy and free markets in return for financial aid -- prompting most 
of the 48 sub-Saharan African nations to try representative government. Most 
have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 By any yardstick, the chances that Strasser's government will be peacefully 
replaced by a model democracy in two years seem remote. That hasn't stopped the 
world from giving him an intensive civics lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Strasser is being bombarded by advice from the continent's biggest military 
dictatorship, Nigeria; the United States and its allies; and that global 
arbiter of economic aid, the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutifully accepting painful IMF restructuring conditions has its rewards. 
Strasser has received $300 million in global aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans finance waste disposal, the British help organize tax collections, 
ethnic Lebanese run most businesses and an advisory council of internationally 
respected Leonians has drafted a proposed constitution they have gently nudged 
Strasser to support. 
</P>
<P>
 His junta members, whose trademark attire is sunglasses, berets and jungle 
fatigues, also are regularly counseled by the fellow West African nation of 
Ghana, where Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings turned his own young soldiers' coup 14 
years ago into an election victory last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria, meanwhile, is helping Strasser fight a rebel war that has paralyzed 
the diamond industry in the south and east. Nigerian troops also are defending 
Freetown, including Strasser's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nigerian dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, set what might be considered a bad 
example for Strasser last year by ousting a civilian government, dissolving 
elected legislatures and rolling back a decade of economic restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have their useful points," Bio said of the disparate influences, "but 
they have their own faults." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "the boys," as they are known, have little experience with democracy or 
the outside world. Bio glared sullenly from behind his office desk while a 
press aide berated a reporter for asking inappropriate questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "One has to be extremely tactful dealing with them," said Tejan Kabbah, former 
manager of the U.N. Development Program in New York and chairman of the 
advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxford-educated Kabbah, 62, said the advisory council is applying pressure 
to the Strasser government "subtly, so as not to embarrass them." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been promoting the 170-page draft constitution by canvassing villages 
with posters and slogans in the indigenous languages. The schedule calls for a 
public referendum on the document in May, 1995, and election of a multi-party 
government in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The council acknowledges that democracy is not an easy sell in one of the 
world's poorest nations, where life expectancy is 42 years, 86% of the people 
are illiterate and infant mortality is among the world's highest. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Leonians, who have embraced Strasser as one of them, have been hardened 
by deprivation and repression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crude culture of survival in the past 30 years has created a situation 
where people only care about survival, not democracy," said Paul Kamara, 36, a 
human rights activist and journalist jailed three times by Strasser's 
predecessor and once by Strasser. 
</P>
<P>
 Strasser religiously shuns the press and declined to be interviewed. People 
who meet him regularly say he has grown isolated and makes few daily decisions. 
Bio chairs the Cabinet meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Strasser remains popular in this West African nation of 4.5 million, which 
was settled two centuries ago by freed slaves from Britain, the United States 
and Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Leone, as beautiful as it is poor, has perfect ocean beaches ringed by 
mist-shrouded mountains. European tourists frequent beach-front hotels and 
stroll the sand accosted only by mellow merchants peddling beach sandals, 
prostitutes, T-shirts and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The seacoast capital, Freetown, is a clean but pathetically ramshackle 
collection of colonial-era buildings in varying states of decay. The dirt 
streets are narrow, crowded and closed whenever Strasser goes for a drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Leone won independence from Britain in 1961 and began a long decline 
marked by coups and contested elections that left hundreds dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Maj. Gen. Joseph Momoh, the army commander, took over and the country 
slid into a social hell of interminable fuel lines, food shortages and 
corruption that diverted 90% of diamond production. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a rebellion began that ultimately forced 1.5 million people from 
their homes. Because Momoh could not pay or feed his soldiers, junior officers 
became malcontents and agitators. 
</P>
<P>
 By May, 1992, things were so bad that the United Nations listed Sierra Leone 
as the world's worst place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days later, nine junior officers led a 60-soldier convoy into town to 
demand their pay at gunpoint. The unpopular Momoh, virtually without support, 
fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprised mutineers, largely uneducated men from rural villages, asked the 
more charismatic Strasser to lead a provisional military government. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hailed as a savior by a people who overlooked, sometimes cheered, his 
regime's early rash of human rights abuses, such as the execution without trial 
of 29 alleged coup plotters on Freetown's lovely beach, which prompted Britain 
to suspend aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Such abuses have been curbed and Britain resumed assistance in January. But 30 
politicians remain under house arrest and about 20 newspapers remain closed. 
Four journalists are being prosecuted on sedition charges for quoting a Swedish 
newspaper that accused Strasser and his men of selling black market diamonds in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though life has improved, there is virtually no economic growth. 
Investors steer clear of a nation at war run by soldiers in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Former businessman John Benjamin, 41, the only civilian in the ruling junta 
and the only member older than 29, insists the young government is no less 
stable than any other in West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have really matured," he said. "All our colleagues have taken 
things much more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very aware of their place in history and they don't want to fail. 
When you are in your 20s and you fail, you have a longer time to live with your 
mistakes."

PARANOIA GRIPS CIVILIAN WITH SIERRA LEONE YOUNG GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FRITZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Benjamin has a closed-circuit television monitor on his desk that gives 
him news he can use, such as who's outside his electronically controlled 
security door. 
</P>
<P>
 Honest paranoia is part of power in Sierra Leone, a West African nation 
engaged in a civil war and run by an unpredictable military junta led by 
27-year-old Capt. Valentine Strasser. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the attention is focused on Strasser, some of the spotlight is 
shifting to Benjamin as Leonians begin pondering the government's recently 
unveiled two-year transition to civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin, secretary-general of the ruling council, is the only civilian in 
Strasser's junta and is widely considered to be the No. 3 man, after Maj. Maada 
Bio. 
</P>
<P>
 The new constitution was drafted by an advisory council chosen by the 
government and is to be voted on in May, 1995. Since its publication in 
December, Leonians have talked much about how it seems to have been styled to 
suit Benjamin. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * The new government must be civilian. Benjamin is the only civilian on the 
ruling council. 
</P>
<P>
 * The president must be at least 40 years old. Strasser and his junta all are 
in their 20s. Benjamin is 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * People of mixed parentage may run for president. Benjamin's father was 
German, his mother Leonian. His full name is John Benjamin Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin, a casually dressed, affable man in striking contrast to the tense, 
uniformed young officers, acknowledged that he makes most of the day-to-day 
government decisions. He laughed when asked whether the constitution was 
custom-built for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The constitution is not built for one person," he said. "We want people to 
rise above whether one person would benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin is the brother of Capt. Prince Benn-Hirsch, an army malcontent whose 
mysterious assassination helped spark the coup by disgruntled young soldiers 
that put Strasser in power in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonian newspapers have speculated that Benjamin, who was head of a computer 
firm at the time, helped bankroll the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin, glancing at a security man furiously shaking his head, said he could 
not comment on his role.

 When the Rev. Ron Wolf greets parishioners after Mass, sometimes a child will 
run up and give him a big hug. In more innocent times, it was the kind of 
loving gesture that made a priest's day. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are not innocent times. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a child's hug freezes Wolf with apprehension. Too many priests have been 
accused of sexual abuse, he said. Too many parents are suspicious of any 
affection shown to their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be really, really careful," said Wolf, pastor of St. Thomas 
Aquinas, a Roman Catholic church near Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the thought goes through my mind, 'I wonder who's watching? Who's 
taking a picture?' I've never had any problems at all, but I'm not taking any 
chances." 
</P>
<P>
 He's got company. Priests, teachers, coaches, Scoutmasters -- people once 
considered pillars of any community, trusted as role models for children -- now 
often find themselves under a cloud of suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of sexual abuse allegations has prompted some adults to stop working with 
children altogether. Others try to protect themselves by withholding the 
physical affection shared freely in more trusting days. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you are seeing is sexual abuse hysteria," said Dr. Richard Gardner, 
professor of child psychiatry at Columbia University. "People are running 
scared. You can't touch kids anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that young children no longer crave hugs, kisses, cuddles or pats on 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children need nurturing touch," said Cordelia Anderson of Minneapolis, a 
lecturer on sexual health and violence prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, if you mention touch, people think about sexual abuse. Many adults 
are more worried about litigation and protecting themselves than giving 
children what they really need." 
</P>
<P>
 You can hardly blame them. If Americans once buried their heads in the sand 
about sexual abuse of children, a stream of gruesome headlines in recent years 
has made it seem as if exploitation is everywhere: Orgies at preschool. 
Molestations behind the altar. Sex in the Scoutmaster's tent. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of reported abuse has risen sharply since the 1970s, but nobody knows 
for sure whether it's because abuse is increasing or because people are more 
aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain: Nobody is immune from accusation. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, one of America's most 
visible Roman Catholic prelates and a leader in the church's struggle to rout 
priestly pedophilia. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 34-year-old Steven Cook filed a $10-million lawsuit accusing 
Bernardin and another priest of molesting him as a teen-ager. In February, Cook 
dropped Bernardin from the lawsuit, saying he no longer trusted his 
hypnosis-recovered memories. But the damage to the cardinal's reputation 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardin's vindication produced little cheering among Catholic leaders. 
Scores of sex-abuse cases involving priests are still hanging; one estimate 
puts the church's cost of settling the scandals at more than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rev. Wolf is wary of hugs, it's because he headed an investigation of 
sex-abuse lawsuits that have brought his archdiocese to the brink of 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to the Archdiocese of Santa Fe is an absolute, unmitigated 
disgrace," Wolf said. "I think we have to take the necessary precautions to 
make sure that abuse never again exists." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf said he is never alone with altar boys. If he counsels a young woman at 
night, she has to bring a parent, and when the session is over, there are no 
hugs, just a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 His reserved demeanor saddens him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I care about children," he said. "But in this day and age, you have to set 
your limits. And the ones who think they're so secure . . . they're the ones 
that are going to be thrown to the wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 Absent specific instructions from Catholic leaders, priests are on their own 
to develop a personal code of conduct. But many other organizations that work 
with children have more formal hands-off policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boy Scouts of America requires that two adults be present during all Scout 
activities. Many public school districts have unofficial no-touch policies. The 
YMCA's national office advises local clubs to scale back on touching older 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very natural for a preschool child to cuddle up against you while you're 
reading a story," said Leslie Cohn, YMCA spokeswoman in Chicago. "With a 
school-age child, you'd say, 'No, sit beside me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Blount knows how easily good intentions can be misread. The retired 
owner of a Seattle travel agency volunteers as a reading tutor at an elementary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, he picked up his 9-year-old student for an outing to Mt. Rainier 
National Park. He didn't realize that two women were trailing him, thinking 
Blount had forced the boy into his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 miles, the women pulled around Blount to cut him off. One jumped from 
the car and screamed to a bystander, "Call 911! He's kidnaping that boy!" When 
police arrived, they called the boy's grandfather and straightened things out. 
</P>
<P>
 Blount is remarkably charitable toward his accusers, saying, "My hat's off to 
somebody who takes that risk." But he does lament the loss of innocence that 
makes people assume the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing sexual about caring for a kid, or there need not be -- no 
matter what we read all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of abuse allegations has made it harder to find qualified volunteers to 
work with children, said Richard Walker, national spokesman for the Boy Scouts 
of America. He sees it not only in scouting but in his volunteer work with 
Little League baseball in Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, it's like looking for a needle in the haystack to find enough 
coaches," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations bringing men and boys together come under special scrutiny. 
That's understandable, since most sex offenders are men. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most men are not sex offenders," Cordelia Anderson said. "And God knows 
we need more men in nurturing positions with children." 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicion of adults in organized settings is misplaced because 90% of child 
sex-abuse occurs at home, committed by a relative or friend, said Joyce Johnson 
of the Child Welfare League of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media tend to focus on the other 10% -- someone who's in a position of 
trust, a priest or day-care worker," she said. "You've got people thinking that 
all priests or child-care workers are molesters, and that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a no-touch approach may seem the safest recourse, there are costs, 
said Philip Villaume, a Minneapolis attorney who has defended more than 300 
teachers in abuse cases since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to urge teachers not to touch children at all, but now he has changed 
his advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the violence we have in society, with weapons in the schools and 
all, perhaps it's time we're allowed to reach out and touch somebody, to 
embrace them in a positive way," Villaume said. 
</P>
<P>
 That carries a risk, of course. But Richard Blount, for one, said the payoff 
is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to share our parenting," said Blount, whose own children made 
lifelong friends in Boy Scouts. "I can't be dad and Boy Scout leader and 
athletic director for my own kids." 
</P>
<P>
 So Blount still tutors, and he still takes kids on outings. "But now we go in 
groups," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, you have to be careful these days.

RUSSIAN DESCENDANT CHALLENGES U.S. FIRM'S USE OF SMIRNOFF VODKA NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are few things that a Russian takes as seriously as his vodka. And few 
Russians take it more seriously than Boris Smirnov. 
</P>
<P>
 The pudgy, bearded former KGB man is a descendant of one of the most famous 
vodka makers of all, Pyotr Smirnoff, who until the 1917 Russian Revolution 
produced spirits for Russia's czars. But today a huge American company, 
Heublein Inc., claims the right to the Smirnoff name, and its brand is selling 
briskly virtually across this vodka-imbibing country. 
</P>
<P>
 For Boris Smirnov, 35, this is nothing less than an affront to national pride 
and his family name -- and one that he is determined to rectify by producing 
his own "genuine Smirnov" vodka and demanding exclusive rights to the name in 
the Russian market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vodka is something Russian. Pyotr Smirnoff was Russian," said Boris Smirnov 
during a recent interview at the crumbling building in the heart of old Moscow, 
where his family's company stood until the Bolsheviks nationalized it. "We are 
not trying to manufacture Johnnie Walker Black Label here. We're not trying to 
make French champagne. We're trying to make something that belongs to us."

CLINTONS TURNING WHITE HOUSE 'GREEN'; ECOLOGY: FIRST FAMILY MAKES OFFICIAL 
RESIDENCE MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT, INSTALLS RECYCLING BINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill and Hillary Clinton want to leave an enduring legacy to the White House, 
and you can color it green. 
</P>
<P>
 That's green, as in environmentally sound and energy-efficient and easier on 
the pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the effort the Clintons already have taken delivery of a 
super-efficient refrigerator touted as an energy and money saver. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for the first time, recycling bins have been installed in the White House 
residential quarters so glass and newspapers can be separated from the 
Clintons' trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning is under way to reglaze the third-floor solarium, increasing window 
performance by as much as 85% and reducing the need for air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the incandescent bulbs used in the table lamps in the President's study 
have been scrutinized and found wanting. New and compact fluorescent bulbs are 
suggested to save energy and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornate Victorian skylights over stairwells in the Old Executive Office 
Building next to the White House are being scraped free of decades-old paint 
and cleaned of grime to bring daylight back into the center of the granite 
structure and reduce electric bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration summed up the first phase of the effort as it issued an 
action plan titled, "The Greening of the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to cut energy consumption in the 18-acre executive complex by 30% 
by the year 2005 without reducing the comfort of those living and working 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The "greening" report suggests improvements in heating and cooling systems, 
indoor air quality, water management and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is being coordinated by a team of 100 architects, engineers, 
building managers and environmentalists. They aim to produce a package of 
improvements that could be a model for offices, stores and homes nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton commissioned the enterprise last April 21 in an Earth Day address, 
saying, "I want to make the White House a model for other federal agencies, for 
state and local governments, for business and for families in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I ask you to do the best you can in your house, I ought to make sure 
I'm doing the best I can in my house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Zoi, deputy director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy, 
said the Clintons regard the project as an important legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be their contribution to the White House as opposed to china or 
other things," she said.

$30-MILLION U.S. BLOOD BANK HUNT FOR RARE AIDS VIRUS COMES UP EMPTY; MEDICINE: 
SOME BELIEVE THE HIV-2 TESTING WAS DRIVEN AS MUCH BY FEAR OF VIOLATING A 
FEARFUL PUBLIC'S DEMAND FOR SAFETY AS IT WAS BY ANY REAL MEDICAL NEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the summer of 1992, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a 
resoundingly non-controversial step in the war on AIDS: It ordered all blood 
banks to test for a virus called HIV-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the virus was rare to the vanishing point, no one seriously 
opposed the directive, not even the blood banks, which would have to pay for 
the testing. In fact, they publicly welcomed it. The subject of expense hardly 
came up. 
</P>
<P>
 This was another virus that causes AIDS, after all, the most dreaded of all 
diseases. The blood banks inadvertently helped spread the AIDS epidemic in the 
early 1980s. Neither they nor their regulators wanted to make that mistake 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost was not a factor," recalled Dr. Charles Wallas, president of the 
American Assn. of Blood Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 So over the last year and a half, the blood banks have spent an estimated $30 
million testing all donated blood for signs of HIV-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Not a single infected donation has been found. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. The country's blood banks have tested about 20 million units, 
and they have not turned up one drop of bad blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike HIV-1, the primary AIDS virus that probably infects somewhat under 1 
million Americans, HIV-2 is almost impossible to find in the United States. No 
one knows precisely how many people have it, but intensive searching has turned 
up less than 50 cases nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those involved say HIV-2 testing was driven as much by fear of 
violating an apparently uncompromising public desire for blood safety as it was 
by any real medical need. Blood bankers themselves are of two minds about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are we doing HIV-2 testing? We are erring on the side of caution," said 
Dr. James MacPherson, head of the Council of Community Blood Centers. His 
organization represents the nonprofit, non-Red Cross blood banks that collect 
about 35% of the nation's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Paul Holland, medical director of the Sacramento Medical Foundation 
Blood Center in California, said the testing represents a hopeless attempt to 
make the blood supply 100% safe, no matter how slight the risk or how high the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it was not a good decision, then or now," Holland said. "We 
had zero evidence that HIV-2 was being transmitted by blood donors in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials and blood bankers agree they feel pressure to remove all 
risk from transfusions, a quest for perfection that exists almost nowhere else 
in medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether HIV-2 testing was the right thing to do, many in the 
blood banking world believe it was unavoidable. The sad history of AIDS made it 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s, AIDS spread silently through the nation's 
blood supply. No one knew what caused the disease, so there was no clear way to 
stop it. About 6,400 Americans, including tennis player Arthur Ashe, got AIDS 
from transfusions or other blood products. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, researchers learned the culprit was the human immunodeficiency 
virus -- HIV-1. In 1985, a test became available to screen for it, and the 
blood banks immediately began checking all donations. But there was criticism 
that the blood banks and FDA should have done something sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggested they should have looked for so-called surrogate markers. 
Testing blood for elevated liver enzymes, for instance, might have provided a 
clue to hepatitis infection, which was known to be more common in people 
infected with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows if surrogate testing could have improved blood safety. But some 
said the blood banks held back to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very sensitive to those charges," said Wallas. "Given that people tend 
to learn from past experience, we made a decision that cost should not be part 
of our decision making." 
</P>
<P>
 HIV-2 gave all involved a chance to show they had indeed learned a lesson from 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus is a cousin of HIV-1 that is confined largely to West Africa. Even 
though HIV-2 is harder to catch than HIV-1 and causes disease more slowly, the 
ultimate effect is the same -- AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a combination test came on the market to screen blood for HIV-1 and 
HIV-2 at the same time. By then, health officials knew of just 18 cases of 
HIV-2 infection in the United States, nearly all in African immigrants. The 
question arose: Should blood banks be required to use it? 
</P>
<P>
 Already there had been a brush with HIV-2. In 1986, a U.S.-born woman who had 
traveled in West Africa donated blood infected with HIV-2. But her tainted 
donation never made it into the blood supply, because it was spotted by the 
HIV-1 test. Because HIV-1 and HIV-2 are so similar, the standard HIV-1 alone 
test can find HIV-2 between 60% and 90% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 To learn how common it was, health officials screened 20 million blood 
donations for HIV-2. They found no cases. Even when they focused their search 
where they would most expect to find it -- in venereal disease and drug abuse 
clinics in cities with large numbers of West African immigrants -- they located 
just two cases among 31,533 people tested. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that if routine 
testing began, at worst, 2.6 of every 10 million pints of donated blood would 
harbor the virus, but the true figure could well be zero. Since the standard 
HIV-1 test will find at least two-thirds of HIV-2 infections, checking 
specifically for HIV-2 would, at most, eliminate one bad unit of blood yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 With all this information, the FDA ordered blood banks to use the new 
combination test beginning in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was the right thing to do, and we thought the public expected 
us to do it. The alternative was the risk of a recipient getting infected with 
this virus," said Dr. Peter Tomasulo, chief operating officer of the American 
Red Cross, which collects 45% of the nation's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although HIV-2 was hardly a public health threat, no one could guarantee it 
would never spread. And certainly no one wanted to explain how they allowed 
even one person to catch the virus when a test could have prevented it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line was that if we wanted assurance of preventing HIV-2 
transmission, HIV-1 screening was not adequate," said Dr. Jay Epstein, head of 
the FDA's Office of Blood Research and Review. "Given the concern about HIV, 
which was special because of the horror of what happened in the early '80s, 
there was a climate that not doing whatever could be done was seen as 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson estimates that HIV-2 testing costs $20 million annually. It adds 
about $1.50 to the price of a $100 pint of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination test itself costs about $1 more than the standard HIV-1 test. 
Other expenses include keeping track of those who test falsely positive, so 
they will not donate again, counseling these donors about what their positive 
test results mean and finding new donors to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is not the only cost. MacPherson estimates that adding HIV-2 to the AIDS 
test has doubled the number of falsely positive results to 5,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though their blood is safe, the donations are thrown away, and these 
donors are told not to give blood for six months. If their blood turns up 
positive again, they are asked to refrain from donating again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the worst nightmare to get a call from a blood center saying we have 
found something in your blood," said Dr. Thomas Zuck of the University of 
Cincinnati. "We try to explain that they reacted on a test to antibody for 
AIDS. You can imagine how upset these people are, and they won't believe they 
are not infected." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether all of this is protecting the nation from an outbreak of HIV-2 is 
unclear. The CDC said that, at last count, it had found 48 people with the 
virus. There was no sign HIV-2 had begun to spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did we jump the gun, or were we very smart in implementing something before 
it's needed?" asked MacPherson. "We need a few more years to know."

 A Navy sailor aboard the Virginia was found strangled at his post, a telephone 
cord wrapped twice around his neck. His wallet and diary were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Naval Investigative Service ruled the death of Machinist Mate Kenneth 
Louthain a suicide, citing testimony that he had exhibited "self-destructive 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 A House subcommittee, in a report released in mid-March, supported that 
conclusion, but said that in this and seven other military deaths, the Navy 
sometimes failed to follow standard law enforcement procedure and withheld 
information from families. 
</P>
<P>
 But the House Armed Services Oversight and Investigations subcommittee 
rejected a more damning charge: that the Navy prefers to avoid controversy by 
calling murders suicide. The subcommittee found "errors" and "unprofessional 
actions in individual cases," but said the Navy "does not have a policy, 
campaign, conspiracy or predisposition to present homicides as suicides." 
</P>
<P>
 The probe stemmed from complaints by family members who refused to believe 
official reports that their loved ones committed suicide. The subcommittee 
focused on eight cases handled by the Naval Investigative Service because most 
of the complaints concerned Navy or Marine Corps cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion drew an immediate and angry reaction from the family group, 
"Til We Have Answers," that formed around the disputed cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is lip service. I read it twice and I just could not believe it," said 
Cathy Jakovic, co-founder of the group. Her son, Scott, was shot and killed in 
1991 in what officials said was a game of Russian roulette at a Naval Weapons 
Station in Earle, N.J. Jakovic said a fellow Marine guard shot her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier to deal with a suicide than a murder," Jakovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the families criticized the subcommittee report, the finding did 
confirm their allegations that the Navy sometimes gave conflicting or 
incomplete reports, failed to return some personal effects, did not follow 
standard law enforcement procedures such as dusting for fingerprints, and 
treated family members callously. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint statement, Reps. Norman Sisisky (D-Va.), the subcommittee chairman, 
and James Hansen of Utah, its senior Republican member, said that although the 
investigations weren't bungled, the dealings with family members were. 
</P>
<P>
 "The families have emerged from these cases scarred. Many of them feel they 
were lied to," Sisisky and Hansen said. "We find they were sometimes patronized 
and treated as if they were ignorant." 
</P>
<P>
 In seven of the eight cases, the subcommittee found no reason to question the 
conclusions reached by NIS investigators. The panel said it was "troubled" by 
an investigation into the February, 1992, death of Marine Lt. Kirk Vanderbur. 
Vanderbur was found at a rifle range in Hubert, N.C., near Camp Lejeune, dead 
of a gunshot wound to the head. He was found holding a rifle with his thumb but 
also had a shotgun wound in the chest. The shotgun was found eight to 10 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Local police concluded that the death was a suicide. The NIS had a "limited 
role" in the probe, according to the subcommittee, and reached no conclusion. 
The subcommittee said the local police finding "does not sit well." 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, the subcommittee criticized Norfolk base police for letting 
witnesses leave the scene of a shooting without getting their names and phone 
numbers. In another case, NIS investigators failed to take fingerprints from a 
gun linked to what was later termed a suicide and never checked the hands of 
the victim for powder burns. 
</P>
<P>
 And the subcommittee criticized the Marines in a third case for giving a 
family three different stories about how Lance Cpl. Cornelius Whittles had died 
in a 1989 shooting, also at the Earle, N.J., naval station. In one version, 
Whittles was playing Russian roulette. In another, he was cleaning his gun. In 
a third version, he was playing with his gun. The NIS ruled the case an 
accidental suicide. The Navy Cases 
</P>
<P>
 Summaries of eight cases investigated by the House Armed Services Oversight 
and Investigations Subcommittee: 
</P>
<P>
 * 2nd Lt. Kirk Vanderbur, Feb. 17, 1992, Hubert, N.C. Vanderbur was shot once 
in the head and found holding a rifle. He also had a shotgun wound to the 
chest. The shotgun was found eight to 10 feet away. Local police said Vanderbur 
failed with the shotgun, possibly by accident, then crawled to the rifle and 
shot himself. The Naval Investigative Service reached no conclusion. The family 
disputes the suicide ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seaman Mark Dasalla, Dec. 11, 1985, Norfolk, Va., Naval Station. Dasalla 
grabbed a Marine guard's pistol in a scuffle and turned on a second guard. The 
Marine shot Dasalla when he refused to stop. Dasalla's father, Mark, accused 
the Navy of "trying to paint my son in a bad light." The subcommittee said the 
investigation was sound but criticized base police for failing to get names of 
eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marine Pfc. James Gardner, Oct. 1, 1991, Naval Submarine Base, Bangor, Wash. 
Gardner was found dead on the floor of a locked bathroom, a gunshot wound to 
the head. The handgun was found with the safety in the "on" position. Gardner's 
mother, Arlene Ball, said she is willing to accept the suicide ruling but 
called NIS "arrogant and stupid." The subcommittee faulted the NIS for failing 
to take fingerprints or check Gardner's hands for powder marks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Machinist Mate Kenneth Louthain, Oct. 3, 1992, aboard the USS Virginia. 
Louthain was found dead at his duty station with a telephone cord wrapped 
around his neck. The body showed no signs of trauma or struggle. NIS ruled the 
death a suicide, citing testimony that Louthain had exhibited "self-destructive 
behavior." The family says Louthain was murdered and accuses the Navy of a 
coverup. The subcommittee supported the suicide conclusion but criticized the 
Navy for first telling the Louthains that Louthain was found in the water off 
Jamaica, later that he was found dead at his duty station, and finally that he 
was strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marine Lance Cpl. Scott Jakovic, Oct. 12, 1991, Naval Weapons Station, 
Earle, N.J. Jakovic apparently shot himself playing Russian roulette. A fellow 
Marine who, according to one account, encouraged Jakovic to "do it," was 
court-martialed for involuntary manslaughter. The Navy listed the death as an 
accident. The subcommittee found the investigation "thorough and competent." 
</P>
<P>
 * Marine Cpl. John MacCaskill, May 25, 1988, U.S. Embassy, El Salvador. A 
State Department investigation ruled that MacCaskill shot himself in the mouth 
at a San Salvador bar, noting that MacCaskill was drunk and that witnesses 
reported him despondent. The family wants to question three other Marines who 
were there. The subcommittee agreed with the suicide finding but criticized the 
State Department for providing inaccurate information to the family about what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marine security officer Michael Leslie, Sept. 19, 1991, Naval Station, Guam. 
Two local officials heard a gunshot and found Leslie dead with his left wrist 
handcuffed to the steering wheel and a gun in his right hand. The family 
suspects murder and wants the case reopened. The subcommittee said the case was 
well handled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marine Cpl. Cornelius Whittles, April 15, 1989, Naval Weapons Station, 
Earle, N.J. NIS found that Whittles had been playing with his handgun, 
including pointing it at his head, when the weapon fired. The subcommittee 
agreed with the finding but termed the case "a classic example of how not to 
handle the casualty notification process." The family was given three different 
versions of the death: that Whittles was playing Russian roulette, cleaning his 
gun, or simply playing with the gun.

APACHES GO FOR THE GOLD IN WOOING RADIOACTIVE DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDUARDO MONTES, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mescalero Apache Reservation already boasts a luxury resort, a casino and 
a ski area. It is in hot pursuit of a radioactive waste dump to add to that 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a business-oriented tribe," tribal Vice President Frederick Peso 
said. "This is just another long-term business venture that we are looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders have fought for three years to put a temporary storage facility 
for high-level nuclear waste on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 They began pursuing a private deal after Congress last year cut off funding 
for an environmental study to determine if a federal storage site could be 
built on the 461,000-acre reservation where about 3,300 people live. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mescaleros have actively courted utility executives, would-be business 
partners in a private venture to store thousands of tons of nuclear waste in 
the desert of the Apache homeland in south-central New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, known as a Monitored Retrievable Storage site, or MRS, is backed 
by Minnesota-based Northern States Power Co., and would store highly 
radioactive waste for at least two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribal council says the site would create jobs for Native Americans and 
make money on storage fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Howard, president of Northern States, said the utility's interest is "very 
serious, very positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said the waste would be stored until the U.S. Department of Energy can 
open a permanent site. Most utilities are running out of space at their plants 
to store spent nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 But tribal leaders face opposition from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody ever tries to construct such a facility anywhere within the state 
of New Mexico while Bruce King is governor, he will use any legal means to try 
to stop it," the governor's spokesman, John McKean, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor and congressional delegation have said the state is already doing 
enough for nuclear storage with the still-unopened Waste Isolation Pilot Plant 
near Carlsbad, about 80 miles southeast of the Mescalero reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 And there has been skepticism about how temporary a Mescalero site would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), who was instrumental in cutting off funding for 
the federal studies, said there were no assurances such a site might not end up 
being permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it would take up to two years to prepare an application for a federal 
license for the site and up to four more years to get authorization from the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Howard said. In addition, Indians on the 
reservation would get to vote on the proposal. Howard hopes the MRS could be 
ready to open as early as 2002.

NO MATTER HOW YOU SLUICE IT, FEISTY GOLD MINER FIGHTS FOR VEIN; ENVIRONMENT: 
OREGONIAN TRIES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK WITHOUT DISCHARGING MUD INTO THE 
ROGUE RIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BARNARD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 16 years, Geoff Garcia mined the ancient riverbed that holds the gold on 
his Last Chance claim. 
</P>
<P>
 But now his trusty old bulldozer, nicknamed Cable Mabel, sits idle until he 
figures out how to mine without getting the state Department of Environmental 
Quality on his case again for sluicing mud into the Rogue River. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fined $5,045 last December after misdemeanor convictions for 
discharging muddy water without a permit and degrading state waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's going out mining anymore," lamented Garcia. "It's a big gamble to 
begin with. Is the gold there? Is the price going to be right? Is the equipment 
going to fall apart? Then you add that somebody might drive up and say, 'You 
can't mine anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mining has always been an adventure for Garcia. After graduating from the 
University of California at Berkeley in 1974 with a geology degree, he labored 
5,000 feet underground in an Idaho silver mine and tramped the creeks of the 
Brooks Range in Alaska as a field geologist. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Charlotte, is a geologist as well, and they named their three 
youngsters for minerals: Crystal, Emery and Amber. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia moved to Galice in 1977 to mine in the winters between summer field 
seasons in Alaska. In those days his neighbors were a free-spirited bunch, 
living in tree houses and cabins on old mining claims. The U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management, or BLM, ran them out as squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 As a miner living in a cabin on his claim, Garcia is part of the self-reliant 
tradition that helped settle the West. But now he figures people like their 
gold miners safely in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects to be thrown off his claim, if he can't resume mining. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Dodson, president of the Rogue Valley Mining Council, said it's still 
possible for a small-time gold miner to make money, but it's a tougher game 
than the old sourdoughs knew. 
</P>
<P>
 BLM has culled 60% of the 42,000 mining claims on federal land in Oregon and 
has stopped granting patents -- outright ownership of moneymaking claims -- 
pending reform of the 1872 Mining Act. 
</P>
<P>
 BLM was worried that requirements that claim holders do $100 a year of 
assessment work often just caused environmental damage and didn't lead to any 
real minerals development, said Pat Geehan, deputy state BLM director for 
mineral resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon has toughened its regulations on the new heap-leach process where 
cyanide trickles through piles of low-grade ore to draw out gold that could 
never be mined by the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisheries biologists concerned over dwindling runs of salmon also watch miners 
more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm supposed to get a storm-water permit," said Garcia. "That's $300 just to 
have rain fall on the mine. The difference between mine tailings and a plowed 
field is you have to pay the government $300 for rain to fall on mine 
tailings." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Oregon is Gold Country. Galice, a wide spot in the road outside 
Grants Pass, is best known for whitewater rafting -- but it's named for a 
French doctor who struck gold in 1852. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's Last Chance Mine dates to 1912. His gold is mixed with sand and 
gravel in an ancient riverbed that went dry long ago. He washed the gold out of 
the gravel by running creek water over it in a sluice box. The gold stayed 
behind; the sand, gravel and clay went down the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the road to Garcia's cabin sits a rusty old hydraulic cannon called a 
giant, a relic of the old days when miners hosed down whole hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, placer mining accounted for 35% of the gold in the country, 
according to the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Now it's only 1%, since new techniques 
for mining low-grade ores boosted U.S. production to 23 million ounces in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Garcia got along by waiting for winter rains to swell the Rogue 
with muddy runoff, so that his work would just blend in with what was happening 
naturally. He played cat-and-mouse with fish and wildlife biologists eager to 
bust him. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1938 report by a fish biologist for the Oregon Department of Geology and 
Mineral Industries on placer mining on the Rogue convinced him that he was 
doing no harm. Commissioned in the midst of a dispute between fishermen and 
miners, the report concluded that placer mining didn't hurt the fish any more 
than natural sedimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1985, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality took over 
regulating water quality on the river. Garcia could no longer do anything that 
would raise sedimentation in Rocky Gulch Creek by more than 10%. Last April he 
got busted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Sale, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Quality, said Garcia 
was treated like anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 But it galled Garcia that the city of Ashland, for example, can get a variance 
to sluice out tons of sedimentation from its drinking water reservoir into 
Ashland Creek every few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society seems to have this guilt about disturbing the land," said Garcia. 
"They still go to their big parking lots and supermarkets, but if they have a 
chance to get rid of their guilt and nail some little miner on the hill, they 
feel like they've done their part to save the world."

FIFTH GRADE BOYS SHAVE HEADS TO SAVE CLASSMATE'S FACE; CANCER: FELLOW STUDENTS 
DIDN'T WANT FRIEND TO FEEL OUT OF PLACE WHEN CHEMOTHERAPY CAUSED HAIR TO FALL 
OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Mr. Alter's fifth-grade class, it's impossible to tell which boy is 
undergoing chemotherapy. Nearly all the boys are bald. Thirteen of them shaved 
their heads so a sick buddy wouldn't feel out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everybody has their head shaved, sometimes people don't know who's who. 
They don't know who has cancer, and who just shaved their head," said 
11-year-old Scott Sebelius, one of the baldies at Lake Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Ian O'Gorman is the sick one. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors recently removed a malignant tumor from his small intestine, and a 
week ago he started chemotherapy to treat the disease, called lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides surgery, I had tubes up my nose. I had butterflies in my stomach," 
said Ian, who'll have eight more weeks of chemotherapy in an effort to keep the 
cancer from returning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian decided to get his head shaved before all his hair fell out in clumps. To 
his surprise, his friends wanted to join him -- in a move reminiscent of the 
1992 U.S. Olympic volleyball players, who shaved their heads in a show of 
solidarity with a bald teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing he would want is to not fit in, to be made fun of, so we just 
wanted to make him feel better and not left out," said 10-year-old Kyle 
Hanslik. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle started talking to other boys about the idea, and then one of their 
parents started a list. They all went to the barber shop together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to put words to," said Ian's father, Shawn, choking back tears as 
he talked about the boys. "It's very emotional to think about kids like that 
who would come together, to have them do such a thing to support Ian." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' teacher, Jim Alter, was so inspired that he, too, shaved his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're showing the world and the country what kids can do. People think kids 
are going downhill. This is the best," Alter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Ian's illness has proved to be one of the most important lessons 
of his class. "We've had some lessons on cancer cells, different kinds of 
cancer and of course, chemotherapy," said Alter, who calls the boys his "little 
bald eagles." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian doesn't like to talk about the cancer much or the pain, but his friends 
know what's happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there with him in the hospital, and I've seen what he's been 
through, all the needles, all the throwing up, how he couldn't walk and 
everything. It's like torture," said Kyle, who likes to ride bicycles with Ian 
after class. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian left the hospital March 2, and doctors told his mother, Heather O'Gorman, 
that 70% to 90% of children with the same disease at this stage have achieved 
long-term survival. Once the doctors are through with the chemotherapy, they 
will monitor him for another two years for a recurrence. If there is none, 
doctors would pronounce him cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ian has lost 20 pounds and is pale, he is eager to get back to the 
business of being an 11-year-old -- playing baseball and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can start on Monday," he said.

 Southern California urbanites, finding the appeal of small-town life stronger 
than ever, might also like the idea of vacationing in a slower, steadier, more 
personable world. Today, Travel begins a series of articles that will look at a 
handful of unscientifically selected American towns (with populations under 
15,000) that are safe, walkable, affordable, not too busy and not too 
self-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Friday afternoon when I drove into town, missed the address I was 
looking for, and fell to wandering. I circled the central square, and skirted 
the cemetery where William Faulkner is buried. I cut through the University of 
Mississippi campus, admiring the red-brick walls, the green-shuttered windows 
and the northern Mississippi hills that roll through town. Eventually, I found 
the 102-year-old home that held my bed and breakfast. This is a town with a 
population of 10,141 , I told myself, ascending the creaky wooden stairs. Slow 
down, or you'll run out of Oxford before dark . 
</P>
<P>
 But by Saturday morning, I had tasted the crawfish quesadilla at the City 
Grocery, on the square. I had inspected contemporary folk art in the Southside 
Gallery (milk jugs, melted and molded over the artist's home stove until they 
looked like African tribal masks). I had slipped into a bar called Proud 
Larry's to hear a bluesman named R. L. Burnside wrestle with his guitar and 
moan about slow dogs and fast women. And I had stood at the window of Square 
Books, Oxford's literary epicenter, where the shelves are crowded with Faulkner 
and half a dozen living local writers, including a fairly successful fellow 
named John Grisham. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday night, I was seated in a Jeep with a mannequin named Bubba and the 
prospective mayor-for-life of Taylor, Miss., rolling through darkened Lafayette 
County toward Junior Kimbrough's juke joint. Running out of Oxford, it seemed, 
was not going to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford may be small, but it is a haven for the bookish and the bluesy, a site 
of Civil War and civil rights battles, a handsome town rich in characters and 
fueled by grits, catfish and pecan pie. If business or pleasure brings you to 
Memphis, then an hour's drive dead south will bring you here. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford's town square was laid out in the 1830s -- many say the city's name was 
inspired by that other college town across the Atlantic -- and at its center 
stands a great white courthouse, built after Northern troops burned the town in 
1864. The courthouse is fronted by a monument to the Confederacy's Civil War 
dead. "They gave their lives in a just and holy cause," it says. In a county 
25% black, the monument has stood since 1907. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of restaurants and storefronts huddle around the square, having 
successfully endured the challenge of a monster mall that opened across town a 
decade ago. Most prominent among the square's commercial buildings is Neilson's 
department store (pronounce it Nelson's , and while you're at it, stress the 
fay in Lafayette County), which has been in business since 1839 and claims to 
be the oldest store in the South. Wiley's Shoe Shop, the Parks Barber Shop and 
Smitty's restaurant stand nearby, along with a handful of upscale clothing 
shops and a few law offices. A block down the hill on South 14th Street stands 
the Hoka, a raffish theater, cafe and student hangout that screens highbrow 
movies in a space that was once a cotton warehouse.  
</P>
<P>
 Some Oxonians see creeping boutiquism on the square, and note the departure of 
Sneed's Hardware in 1987. But as long as a $3 shoeshine, a $5 haircut and a 
$2.50 bowl of collard greens and hog jowls can be had in the neighborhood, it's 
hard for a stranger to take the threat too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime rate isn't likely to intimidate city people, either. In all of 1992, 
the FBIfound in its most recent national crime survey, Oxford reported one 
murder, four forcible rapes, seven robberies and 17 stolen cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford's City Hall stands at the square, too, its red-brick walls positioned 
to bask in the afternoon sun. A few blocks beyond it, in St. Peter's Cemetery, 
lies the grave of Faulkner, who passed most of his life here, perplexing his 
neighbors with odd and aloof behavior, recasting them as characters in more 
than a dozen novels set in fictional Yoknapatawpha County. He died in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford, however, remains alive with memorable characters, and since the town 
is so small and unhurried, a curious stranger is likely to meet several of 
them, then probably cross paths again before another day has passed. Look up 
from your Bubba Burger at the Beacon diner, and there in a neighboring booth 
sits your innkeeper. One day, I sat in Marie's Lebanese Cafe, reading in the 
Oxford American magazine about a noted journalism professor at the university, 
Dr. Samir A. Hosni, and waiting to order lunch. Then my waiter arrived -- the 
good Doctor Hosni himself, husband of Marie and helper in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 I am paid to be nosier than the average tourist, but anyone even vaguely 
curious in Oxford will very quickly build a substantial and detailed 
biographical index. Here are three entries from mine: 
</P>
<P>
 * Georgia L. Isaiah stepped out to meet me on Sunday morning, after I had 
pulled off the road to take a picture of perhaps the tiniest restaurant I've 
ever seen: Isaiah's Busy Bee Cafe, which announced itself with a bright sign at 
2013 University Ave. Isaiah, who lives next door, issued orders to Brownie (her 
golden retriever) and Mane (her labrador retriever), and told me the story of 
the Busy Bee. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Isaiah cooked for the Ole Miss university chancellors. But in 1971, 
her husband and her grandmother passed away, and "it just seemed lonesome" at 
home. So Isaiah opened the restaurant next to her house, put up five tables, 
and declared her menu: baked ham on Mondays, pork chops on Tuesdays, roast beef 
on Wednesdays, oven-fried chicken on Thursdays and catfish on Fridays. Fixed 
price: $7, dessert included. "People used to drive down from Memphis just to 
have dessert," she told me. But Isaiah, who is 74 years old, hurt herself in a 
kitchen fire last year and had a mess to clean up after the past winter's 
highly destructve ice storm. The pictures in her dining room of Alex Haley, 
Martin Luther King Jr. and William Faulkner have had no customers to look down 
on for a few months. But beginning in mid-April, she's hoping to resume serving 
dinner on weeknights, by appointment, to those who call her at (601) 234-8865 
to make advance arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leroy Wadlington was a boy when federal officials forced the admission of 
James Meredith as the first black student at Ole Miss in 1962. As a teen-ager, 
Wadlington joined the Civil Rights movement and began demonstrating with other 
black Oxonians, bringing integration to several of the city's previously 
all-white restaurants. Now he is the Rev. Leroy Wadlington, 43-year-old pastor 
of Oxford's Second Missionary Baptist Church, and a partner with Rev. Duncan 
Gray, the white pastor at St. Peter's Episcopal Church, in a fledgling 
pulpit-swapping, congregation-uniting program aimed at breaking down barriers 
between Oxford's black and white churchgoers. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of work remains. After a long Saturday of re-enacting skirmishes from 
1863, several dozen Civil War fanatics, all white and most of them dressed in 
Confederate uniform, feel comfortable leaping to the tabletops in The Gin bar 
in downtown Oxford, swilling beer, and shouting along with the lyrics to "Play 
That Funky Music, White Boy." (I walked in on this scene. With restraint 
astonishing to a Californian, the bar's handful of black customers waited 
quietly and patiently for the retro-soldiers, some of whom had come from 
neighboring states, to finish and leave.) At sporting events of the Ole Miss 
Rebels, alumni, boosters and others fly Confederate flags by the hundreds. 
Overall, Wadlington says, "Oxford has progressed tremendously as far as 
relationships with race go." But as long as the Confederate flag is allowed to 
remain part of Ole Miss traditions, he adds, "these things are going to be 
occurring." 
</P>
<P>
 * Jane Rule Burdine is a photographer and artist and cook and collector of 
folk art, and the fixer-up of a fine old house in the country community of 
Taylor, about 10 miles outside Oxford. The houses don't really need addresses 
in Taylor, since there are so few. But Burdine has adopted a street-name and 
number that the author Willie Morris thought up for her: 3 Railroad Esplanade. 
She is also the keeper of Bubba the mannequin, who sits in her Jeep's back seat 
for security or company or something, and serves as mayor for Taylor's 288 
residents, a post she has held for five years and which she takes very 
seriously, in her way. On the way to Junior Kimbrough's, I asked how long she 
would be mayor. "If I behave myself," she said, "I might be mayor for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding Oxford, there's Memphis (home of Graceland and the National Civil 
Rights Museum) an hour to the north, Tupelo to the east, Little Rock, Ark., to 
the west, and Jackson (the state capital) to the south. The cotton fields of 
the Mississippi Delta begin a few miles to the southwest, and if you continue 
60 miles southwest on state Highway 6, you reach the bedraggled city of 
Clarksdale, where the Delta Blues Museum celebrates the roots of Robert 
Johnson, Son House, Muddy Waters, W. C. Handy and other blues pioneers who 
helped create that American musical form around the beginning of the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford proper has a significant blues landmark, too -- but it lies in perhaps 
the least colorful setting in all Lafayette County. In an orderly, dreary room 
on the third floor of the University of Mississippi's Farley Hall, blues 
archivist and music librarian Edward Komara labors as custodian of the world's 
largest collection of blues recordings (about 35,000 of them on vinyl, tape and 
compact disc, dating back to about 1920). B.B. King donated his record 
collection a few years ago, and 9,000 albums he collected are filed under lock 
and key -- plenty of Ray Charles, Nat King Cole and Django Reinhart records, 
along with an old record of "The Ballad of Davy Crockett." The collection is 
open Monday through Friday, but visitors interested in listening to recordings 
need to call (601) 232-7753 to make an appointment a few days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the biggest tourist event in Oxford -- excluding Ole Miss football 
games -- is the annual Faulkner Conference, which fills the city's roughly 300 
hotel rooms despite its scheduling in mid-summer, when northern Mississippi's 
temperature and humidity are at their most oppressive. This year's conference, 
the 21st, focuses on "Faulkner and Gender" and will run July 31-Aug. 5. The 
Oxford Conference for the Book (April 7-10 this year) was created last year to 
gather writers and editors to mull the processes of creation and publication, 
and has already begun to draw a comparable crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Between seminars and workshops, the literary visitors linger at the Faulkner 
grave site or drive out Old Taylor Road, step past the twin rows of cedars, and 
file through the rooms of a 150-year-old Greek Revival house know as Rowan Oak. 
Faulkner owned it from 1930 until his death, wrote most of his books there, and 
was at the kitchen telephone when a caller informed him that he had won the 
1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. A few years later, Faulkner outlined the 
structure of "A Fable" in big block letters on the walls of the office. They 
remain, as does his black manual Underwood typewriter. (The property was 
briefly closed in February after the ice storm caused widespread power outages 
and stripped most of the area's trees, but reopened in early March.) 
</P>
<P>
 These days at Square Books, Faulkner is heavily outsold by John Grisham. 
Grisham, who grew up a few miles north in Southaven, attended law school at the 
University of Mississippi 15 years ago, published his first novel, "A Time to 
Kill," in 1989, and a year later moved back to Oxford with his wife and kids. 
He is visible in the community -- last summer he coached his son's Little 
League team. Grisham is the biggest name, but he's only one among many 
successful writers around. Barry Hannah, author of the novel "Geronimo Rex" and 
several other works of fiction, lives here and teaches at the university. Larry 
Brown is another neighbor, born here and known for his four novels, but also 
for his 17 years as an Oxford firefighter. (Brown's latest book, "On Fire," is 
a nonfiction account of that time.) Author Willie Morris, born south of here in 
Yazoo City and celebrated in New York as the editor of Harper's magazine in the 
late 1960s, resided in Oxford a while before relocating to Jackson, and still 
visits often. Lisa Howorth, wife of Richard and a teacher at the Center for the 
Study of Southern Culture, is the editor of "The South: A Treasury of Art and 
Literature," published last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a wonderful place for writers," said Anne Rapp, an erstwhile script 
supervisor from Los Angeles whom I met at a reading in Square Books. Rapp 
discovered Oxford while filming "The Firm" in Memphis, and in January started 
renting a two-bedroom house here for $450 a month. She plans to stay several 
months, working on her writing. She and Oxford "just clicked," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Square Books reading is another staple of Oxford's book culture. Howorth 
sets up a few rows of folding chairs in the upstairs cafe area of the 
bookstore, a few paces from an immense selection of work from African American 
writers and literature from the south, and drags up a dictionary stand to serve 
as lectern. On the walls hang autographed photos of authors who have come 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, my last full day in town, the touring authors were Valerie Sayers 
of South Carolina, Pinckney Benedict of West Virginia and Elizabeth Dewberry 
Vaughn of Alabama, each with a new novel out, who read passages about 
(respectively) a young man with an urge to urinate on his enemies; a drug 
dealer who soaks hippies in honey and gasoline, then burns them at the stake; 
and a 12-year-old girl who finds herself in charge of a newly dead body. (Those 
Southern writers, dull as ever.) Afterward, the listeners lined up for 
autographed books, and the Howorths took the guest authors, Larry Brown, Ron 
Shapiro and a few others for catfish at the beloved and rustic Taylor Grocery & 
Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Later still, the more energetic of the group headed off to Junior Kimbrough's 
in nearby Holly Springs for live music and a nightcap. The building is a former 
church, its interior walls now colorized with secular frescoes of Oprah Winfrey 
and others, and crudely lettered signs forbidding drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 A blues band raged in a corner, led by Junior Kimbrough himself, although a 
succession of fellow musicians took their turns. Games of pool were negotiated 
at a table in the middle of the room, with nearby dancers taking care to dodge 
stray sticks. In the back, someone was selling 40-ounce bottles of Colt .45 
malt liquor for $2.75 each. Around midnight, I thought I heard R. L. Burnside 
cursing those slow dogs and fast women again, and I felt almost local. 
GUIDEBOOK / The Oxford Option 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Oxford, Miss., lies about 75 miles south of Memphis, Tenn., via 
Interstate 55 (which runs south) and Mississippi 6 (which heads into Oxford). 
Northwest, the only airline with nonstop service between LAX and Memphis, 
offers restricted round-trip fares beginning at $456. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: The 110-room Holiday Inn of Oxford (400 Lamar Ave., Oxford, 
Miss. 38655; tel. 601-234-3031) is just a few blocks from the city's central 
square. Standard rooms for two run $53-$56 per night. There are three bed and 
breakfasts, each in a handsome old house, each walking distance from the 
square. The Oliver-Britt House (512 Van Buren Ave., Oxford, Miss. 38655; tel. 
601-234-8043) has five rooms renting at $45-$55 nightly. Isom Place (1003 
Jefferson Ave., Oxford, Miss. 38655; tel. 601-234-3310), with three rocking 
chairs on the porch and an impressive collection of antiques inside, has three 
rooms at $60-$75. The Puddin' Place (1008 University Ave., Oxford, Miss. 38655; 
tel. 601-234-1250), where I stayed, offers just one upstairs suite and one 
downstairs suite with somewhat less precious furnishings, which might make it 
more child-friendly. Each suite goes for $85 nightly (with higher rates for 
more than two occupants, and on weekends of Ole Miss home football games). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: At City Grocery (1118 Van Buren Ave.; local tel. 232-8080), chef 
John Currence draws on a New Orleans background and nouveau inclination to 
concoct dishes such as crawfish quesadillas, and shrimp and grits. Most 
sophisticated menu in town. Main dishes: $12.95-$18.95. Just across the square 
stands the Downtown Grill (1115 Jackson Ave.; tel. 234-2659), which also offers 
Southern fare in a dressed-up setting. Main dishes: $5.25-$18.95. The Harvest 
Cafe & Bakery (1112 Van Buren Ave.; tel. 236-3757) specializes in homemade 
soups, meatless meals and fresh bread. Main dishes: up to $6.25. For exotica, 
there's Marie's Lebanese Cafe & Shoppe (1006 Jackson Ave.; tel. 236-7052). Main 
dishes to $5.99. For catfish and a glimpse of the countryside, drive about 10 
miles southwest of town to the Taylor Grocery & Restaurant (P.O. Box 66, 
Taylor; tel. 236-1716), where meals run $1.50 (for a fried bologna sandwich) to 
$9.50 (for the all-you-can-eat catfish fillet). Dinner only. Dress way casual. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to find William Faulkner's typewriter: Rowan Oak, the writer's home for 
more than 30 years, is now run as a museum by the University of Mississippi. 
The home (Old Taylor Road at Bailey's Woods; tel. 234-3284) is open 10 
a.m.-noon and 2-4 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays, 2-4 p.m. Sundays.

TRAVEL INSIDER: NEW D-DAY INVASION BEING AIDED BY LOW-PRICE TICKETS; FARES: 
MANY AIRLINES ARE OFFERING DISCOUNTS FOR VETERANS AND FAMILIES GOING TO FRANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER; Reynolds travels anonymously at 
the newspaper's expense, accepting no special discounts or subsidized trips. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're old enough to remember 1944 and you're thinking about traveling to 
France during this D-day anniversary year -- as thousands of veterans and 
others are -- you should probably also be thinking about discounted air fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the principal dates of the Normandy invasion's 50th anniversary 
fall early in June, normally a costly travel month, Air France and British 
Airways are running 30%-off D-day discount programs through that month and all 
of 1994. In both cases, travelers have a chance at LAX-Paris round-trip fares 
of about $800 in summer, about $700 if they can leave in April, May or October. 
(After that, prices fall substantially on all carriers, along with temperatures 
and traffic levels.) Some U.S. carriers are running similar programs, too, but 
often with lesser discounts or more limited travel dates. 
</P>
<P>
 If you could benefit from one of these programs, it pays to ask your travel 
agent or reservationist specifically about them; they haven't gotten much 
attention. When I called American Airlines to ask about details of its offer 
last week, a reservationist confessed that "this is the first I've heard of 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 There are restrictions on all these fares, of course, beginning with the usual 
"subject to availability" clause. But most of the restrictions aren't too 
demanding, so long as travelers qualify in the first place. It is possible that 
contemporary fare wars among the airlines could undercut these discount 
programs, yielding better prices for all travelers. Until last Friday, for 
instance, several airlines were offering highly restricted springtime 
round-trip fares for as little as $498 from LAX to Paris. But that was for 
dates of very low demand. The best regularly scheduled round-trip LAX-Paris 
prices will jump to the neighborhood of $900 beginning with June departures, 
and likely will remain there until demand wanes in late September. (Those 
prices, and the fares quoted below, exclude $25-$30 in airport taxes on each 
ticket.) Deep summer discounts are highly unlikely, which means that for those 
who qualify, the D-day specials may be the best deals around. Some details: 
</P>
<P>
 The Air France offer (tel. 800- 237-2747), available throughout the year, 
requires that travelers show proof of World War II service (generally discharge 
papers, separation documents or a DD-214 Form from the federal government). 
Restrictions include 30-day advance purchase, a stay of seven to 21 days, and 
travel Monday-Thursday. For travel April 1-May 31 and Oct. 1-31, the price of a 
round-trip LAX-Paris ticket is $683 (30% off the starting price of $976). From 
June 1 through Sept. 30, the price is $771 (30% off the starting price of 
$1,102). 
</P>
<P>
 At British Airways (tel. 800-247-9297), the D-day special is available to any 
traveler over 60 and one companion age 55 or older. As with Air France, the 
discount is 30% from regularly scheduled prices, and could in theory be 
undercut by fare wars. The best fare for travel from L.A. to Paris, April 1-May 
31 and Oct. 1-31: $706 (discounted from $1,006); for travel June 1-Sept. 30, 
$792 (discounted from $1,132). Restrictions include 30-day advance purchase, a 
stay of seven to 21 days and travel Monday-Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At American Airlines (tel. 800- 433-7300), the D-day special applies only to 
departures from the carrier's gateway cities (Chicago, Dallas, Miami, New York 
and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.). The American offer is open to World War II veterans 
with proof of service who can bring along up to three immediate family members 
or grandchildren at the same reduced fare. As with the other programs, the 
American D-day special offers 30% off on selected fares throughout 1994, but 
the numbers don't pencil out as affordably as the European carriers' do. For a 
round-trip ticket to Paris from Dallas (the nearest American gateway to 
Southern California) between April 1 and May 31, America's best 
D-day-discounted fare is $796. From June 1 to Sept. 30, the figure rises to 
$916. Restrictions include seven-day advance purchase, a stay of seven to 180 
days and travel Monday-Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Delta Airlines (tel. 800-241-4141) opens its D-day offer to Word War II 
veterans (or their widows) and three immediate family members -- but isn't 
offering its best discount during the most-sought months of June to September. 
Delta's best D-day rate is $683, for travel May 1-31 and Oct. 1-31. 
Restrictions include 14-day advance purchase, stay of seven to 60 days, travel 
Monday-Thursday. Delta's other D-day offer, good for restricted round-trip 
travel from LAX to Paris or Nice from April 1 to Dec. 17, is $1,016. 
</P>
<P>
 At TWA (tel. 800-892-4141), the D-day discount fares, available to WWII 
veterans and up to three family members, begin at $866 for travel April 1-May 
31 and Oct. 1-31 (restrictions include seven-day advance purchase, stay of 
seven to 90 days, and travel Monday-Thursday), and $969 for travel June 1-Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservationists at Continental, Northwest, United, USAir, Virgin Atlantic and 
Lufthansa said their airlines had no D-day discounts to France now available.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; DIALING FOR DENALI PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, Alaska's popular Denali National Park is taking 
reservations by phone for campsites and round-trip seating on park shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, travelers had to show up in person at the park's Visitor Access 
Center and wait for coveted bus seats or campground spaces as they became 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Open from Memorial Day weekend to the second Thursday after Labor Day, the 
park is accessible to private vehicles for only 15 miles. Shuttles or private 
tour buses go deeper into Denali, providing glimpses of grizzlies, caribou and 
other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25% of the campsites and seats may be reserved by phone, a spokeswoman 
said, with the rest being held for walk-in, two-day advance reservations at the 
visitor center. Reservation fees are $4 for each bus seat and each campsite. 
Entry fees are $3 per person; $5 family. Camping is an additional $12 per 
night, up to 14 nights. Calls will be taken from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday 
through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Call (800) 622-PARK. 
Tickets Available for Aspen Festival 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are now available for the 1994 Aspen Music Festival, which runs June 
24 through Aug. 21 and is scheduled to include appearances by Lynn Harrell, 
Emanuel Ax, Karan Armstrong, Jorge Mester, Gerard Schwarz and the Emerson 
String Quartet. Lawrence Foster is the festival's music director. Prices range 
from $17 to $28. To obtain a ticket brochure, that includes information on 
activities, tours, lodgings and reservations, call (303) 925-3254. Hardy House 
Opens to Public 
</P>
<P>
 Max Gate, the English country house that writer Thomas Hardy designed and 
lived in from 1885 until his death in 1928, will be opened to the public for 
the first time Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in this house, on the outskirts of Dorchester in Southern England, that 
Hardy wrote "Tess of the d'Ubervilles" and "Jude the Obscure" and entertained 
such distinguished guests as Virginia Woolf and H.G. Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Gate has been in the care of the National Trust since 1940 and is now the 
private home of trust tenants. Although it does not contain any Hardy 
memorabilia, its gardens are mentioned in several of his poems. Visitors can 
also see the pet cemetery, with gravestones carved by the author. The house 
will be open Sunday, Monday and Wednesday afternoons through September. 
Admission is about $3.

CRUISE VIEWS: BEST OF THE BEST IN THE CARIBBEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each of the nearly 100 cruise ships sailing in the Caribbean has its own 
special way of showing off the islands -- from beach days at private islands to 
shore excursions with helicopters, scuba diving or submarines. Here are some of 
the best ways to see the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Best whole family experience: American Family Cruises' American Adventure and 
its two-day Dominican Republic stopover at Casa de Campo resort, where kids 
have their own shore excursions -- from horseback riding to donkey polo, 
baseball to snorkeling. Parents, in the meantime, can tackle the Pete Dye 
"Teeth of the Dog" golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Best private island beach day: Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's Coco Cay in the 
Berry Islands of the Bahamas, with a day of exploration and water sports on 
every cruise -- snorkeling with underwater cameras, diving, rides on 
watercycles, rocket rafts and pedal boats, underwater caves and nature trails 
to explore, native straw markets for shopping, steel drum bands and a lavish 
barbecue buffet for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Most elegant beach barbecue: Cunard's Sea Goddess I sends waiters in white 
mess jackets and swim trunks to serve passengers chilled champagne and caviar 
while they sunbathe or wade in the surf at Jost van Dyke in the British Virgin 
Islands, followed by a grilled lunch of fresh Caribbean lobster, steaks, even 
plebeian hot dogs and hamburgers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most photogenic port: Panama's San Blas Islands, where Cuna Indian women clad 
in bright red applique molas and gold nose-rings pose for pictures for a fixed 
fee per click. Get there aboard American Canadian Caribbean Cruises' Mayan 
Prince; Clipper Cruises' Yorktown Clipper; Holland America's Maasdam, Noordam 
and Westerdam on April repositioning cruises to Alaska; Princess Cruises' Crown 
Princess on an April repositioning cruise; Royal Cruise Line's Golden Odyssey, 
and Special Expeditions' Polaris. 
</P>
<P>
 Best onboard entertainment: The stylish and handsome Ballet Folklorique of 
Martinique, who come aboard to perform on many cruise ships calling at 
Fort-de-France. 
</P>
<P>
 Most elegant adventure: Sail the distinctive four-masted sailing yacht Sea 
Cloud and spend days doing Special Expeditions' diligent shore excursions in 
search of rare flora and fauna. Once owned by cereal heiress Marjorie 
Merriweather Post, the Sea Cloud maintains its 1930s ambience, complete with 
marble fireplaces (non-working) and gold bath faucets in the grandest suites. 
</P>
<P>
 Best fantasy beach: The Baths at Virgin Gorda, where passengers may arrive by 
bow-landing tender, rubberized landing craft or overland by bus, then swim in 
the grottoes among the boulders, snorkel offshore or explore the trails around 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Most casual cruise: Aboard Windjammer Barefoot Cruises' tall ships, you can 
spend your entire cruise barefoot if you like, even opting to sleep on deck 
under the stars. Certain sailings during the winter are targeted for singles 
only, and promise an equal number of males and females on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggest sand-and-sea casino combination: If your arm and cash hold up, you 
could play all 212 slot machines, 22 blackjack tables, four roulette and four 
dice tables on Carnival's dazzling Fantasy or Ecstasy en route to Nassau, then 
take a shuttle shoreside to Carnival's 30,000-square-foot casino at the Crystal 
Palace, which adds baccarat to the 750 slots, 51 blackjack tables, seven craps 
tables and nine roulette wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most riveting sightseeing: Passengers line the rails for Panama Canal transits 
as guest lecturers tell the story of the building and operation of the canal. 
Lines that transit the canal frequently during the year include American 
Canadian Caribbean, Clipper, Cunard Crown, Cunard, Crystal, Holland America, 
Princess, Royal Caribbean, Royal, Seabourn and Special Expeditions. To go 
partway into the canal and back into the Caribbean on a shorter, less expensive 
sailing, check Regency Cruises or Dolphin Cruise Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Best island-spotting: Two swivel telescopes are bolted to the handsome teak 
decks aboard the Club Med I for spotting distant islands or identifying ships 
that pass in the night (or day). 
</P>
<P>
 Best floating history exhibit: The arts and antiques aboard any Holland 
America ship, which tell the story of the Dutch West Indian Co. and early 
explorers from the Netherlands through the use of ancient maps, compasses and 
cannon rescued from watery graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Best sailings with cartoon characters: Walt Disney characters depart Premier's 
Big Red Boats at the end of March, to be replaced by Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and 
other Looney Tunes characters from Warner Bros. Other good bets: Norwegian 
Cruise Line's Universal theme sailings (Woody Woodpecker, Andy Panda) or 
Dolphin/ Majestic's Hanna Barbera cruises with Fred Flintstone, Yogi Bear and 
the Jetsons aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Best wildlife sightings: Special Expeditions' Polaris takes passengers in 
motorized rubber landing craft in search of red-footed boobies and black howler 
monkeys in Belize; green turtles and three-toed sloths in Costa Rica, and 
toucans and parrots in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 Best swimming pool: It happens when the posh Seabourn Pride anchors and lowers 
its big steel-mesh collapsible pool into the sea, then unfolds the teak decking 
around for sunbathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Busiest port: Hands down, no contest, it's Charlotte Amalie in St. Thomas, 
U.S. Virgin Islands. The port greets four to six cruise ships a day in winter 
season, with midweek traffic heaviest and Sundays (when shops are closed) 
quietest. Four vessels are usually tied up at the West Indian Dock main port, 
two others at Crown Bay, and the Norway on Wednesdays is always anchored out in 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarest ports of call: If you want to avoid cruise ship passengers altogether, 
your best bets are the following islands, where ships rarely, if ever, call: 
Anguilla, Saba, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, Marie-Galante and Canouan.

DESTINATION: NEW YORK; A NEW BEGINNING FOR THE LODGE AT LAND'S END; CLASSIC 
ADIRONDACK RESORT RECALLS DAYS OF QUIET AND LEISURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE ROBINS, Robins is Newsday's travel editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have been at Land's End for only a half-hour and already I am relishing the 
wood all around me. The chocolate-colored main lodge, the honey-blond rowboat 
moored in the lake, the two unpainted Adirondack chairs placed casually at the 
end of the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 We have driven more than six hours to get here, but there's no complaint from 
us. This newly opened Upstate New York hideaway seems even more intoxicating 
than has been promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Land's End is a careful renovation of a classic Adirondack great camp on Upper 
Saranac Lake, about half an hour from Lake Placid in New York's 6-million-acre 
Adirondack Park. Its parts consist of a spacious house with nine themed guest 
rooms, a boathouse brimming with canoes and skis and paddles and rowboats (with 
a water-view suite upstairs), a tennis court and a beautifully manicured lawn, 
all on 16 acres of lake-front property at the end of a dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, no expense has been spared to re-create Land's End's distinctive 
heritage, which dates to the period between the Civil War and the Great 
Depression when wealthy families tackled this rugged terrain to spend summer 
holidays in the high peaks of the Adirondacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott and Susan Yeaw, he a doctor, she a nurse, purchased the property last 
year (it was originally developed by Donald and Wilhelmina Du Pont Ross) from a 
church group that had used it as a retreat for the past two decades. "I had to 
give a lot of single beds away," Susan Yeaw says. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than six months, they polished and redecorated from top to bottom, 
hired a chef to create breakfasts and dinners, signed on their teen-age 
daughter as the waitress and chambermaid, and opened for business in June. They 
operate all year long, including Christmas and ski season (Whiteface Mountain 
is about 45 minutes away). 
</P>
<P>
 The decor of Land's End looks almost as if Ralph Lauren and crew had just been 
here for a catalogue photo shoot and left the perfect furnishings behind. The 
Naturalist Room has a king-sized twig bed; the Winter Sports Room has a 
Pendleton blanket-covered club chair; the Adirondack Life Room has moose 
antlers on the wall and a log bed, and the Fisherman's Room has a wood-burning 
stove and old pine and antique fishing memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 We opt for The Boathouse, overlooking the lake. The large suite has a nautical 
theme with ships' flags and old photographs on the walls and a sitting room 
that looks like the lounge of a distinguished old cruise ship. There is also a 
small kitchen, good for storing lunch supplies and Saranac beer. But what 
separates this private niche of Land's End from the run-of-the-house look is 
its outdoor porch. 
</P>
<P>
 There, for hours in the early morning, then after dinner through darkness, we 
sit on the Smith & Hawken lounge chairs and do nothing. Listen for the loon's 
cry. Watch a spider devour a dragonfly caught in its web. Stare at blinking 
buoys on the far side of the lake. Talk quietly about the past and calmly about 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the lodge, breakfast is served from 8 to 9, and Mozart is playing 
softly through hidden speakers when guests arrive in the communal dining room. 
Thick French toast one day, hearty oatmeal another. Eggs, fresh fruit and 
yogurt. Hot coffee made with sweet mountain water. Guests share tables, and the 
talk centers on canoeing and fishing and the general good cheer that everyone 
feels about discovering Land's End in its debut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, we take an easy mountain climb on one of the dozens of trails 
marked for hikers in the park. Or we row out to the middle of the lake and fish 
for perch and lake bass, reeling them in as fast as we can get our night 
crawlers on the hook. Dinner, though a bit early for us at 6:30, is a pleasant 
affair. It is preceded by hors d'oeuvres in the lodge's great room, and most 
guests have brought their own wine; there is no liquor license at Land's End. 
We have three dinners during our stay: poached salmon in dill sauce, filet of 
beef and fresh stuffed chicken breasts. Each main course is preceded by an 
interesting salad and followed by a high-calorie dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, a fairly stiff price to be paid for the comforts of 
Land's End: up to $325 for a couple per night. GUIDEBOOK

TASTE OF TRAVEL: OKINAWA: NOT QUITE JAPANESE; THE CUISINE OF THESE ISLANDS IS 
BOLD, EARTHY AND IN SOME WAYS CLOSER TO CHINA THAN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMANDA MAYER STINCHECUM, Stinchecum is a New York-based free-lance writer 
and textile historian who specializes in Okinawa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picking my way over the bumpy dirt road behind the Sakae market, the 
melancholy strains of a shamisen, barely audible above the hubbub of voices, 
greet me as I duck under the curtain and slide open the door of the 
bar/restaurant Urizun. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulars at the bar scoot over to make room for me on my first night back 
in Naha. Our host and friend, Tsuchiya Saneyuki, welcomes me back and 
introduces me to a few people I haven't met before. He places in front of me a 
small, heavy cup of dark brown earthenware from a local kiln, its unglazed 
surface glossed here and there with melted ash. 
</P>
<P>
 The clear, strong, brisk flavor of the colorless liquid within has none of the 
sweetness of sake . It perfectly complements the briny, slightly bitter taste 
of ajike no wata, the innards of a large bivalve, simply dressed with vinegar. 
Distilled from fragrant Thai rice, awamori is closer to the shochu distilled 
liquor of Japan's Kyushu island. These bold flavors embody the essence of 
Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
 That there is indeed an Okinawan cuisine, different from that of Japan, is 
plain to anyone who has spent any time in those wind-swept islands of blazing 
colors and clear light. Pork in all its permutations and the conspicuous 
absence of fish from the formal meal; an emphasis on fresh vegetables, often 
enriched with pork; accents of garlic and the peppery spice piipaachi, and the 
copious use of konbu seaweed arouse the palate with flavors alien to the narrow 
range of Japanese food. Like the cuisines of southern China, salt rather than 
soy sauce brings out the essence. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Japan forcibly annexed it in 1879, Okinawa was an independent kingdom, 
known to the Japanese as Ryukyu. If anything, the influence of the south 
Chinese province of Fujian, where Okinawan government emissaries landed in the 
heyday of Ryukyu trade, dominates that of Japan. The tea served with local 
sweets is usually jasmine, brought to Okinawa from Fujian after annexation. In 
1972, Okinawa once again became a prefecture of Japan, as it was from the late 
19th Century until the final stage of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ryukyus also possess a distinctive culture strong enough to have survived 
submission to China and subjugation by Japan, the annual devastation of 
typhoons, and the near-total destruction of their material culture by both 
American and Japanese armed forces during World War II (in which one-third of 
the civilian population died) followed by almost three decades of American 
military occupation. The latter left an unfortunate heritage of a persistent 
penchant for Spam and Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 But food is one aspect of the local culture that survived the past century 
more nearly intact than many of the arts, since it is created anew many times a 
day with simple techniques and readily available, inexpensive ingredients. 
Okinawan cuisine, reflecting at the same time the people who make and enjoy it 
and the land that produces it, seems an indestructible part of Okinawan 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling public market in the middle of downtown Naha is not only the 
belly but the heart of the city. The main entrance, at the conjunction of the 
main drag, Kokusai-dori, and Heiwa-dori, leads down a gentle slope into an 
arcaded warren of lanes lined with stalls, almost all of them manned by women. 
Many of these are the same women -- some now in their seventies and eighties -- 
who brought their own produce here in the years following the war, to sell and 
to buy on the black market to feed their families. The market has grown up 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping in the early morning is not an Okinawan custom, and it isn't until 
late morning that the market really bustles with women shopping and selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Piles of glowing green vegetables, some familiar, some strange, seem to burst 
from the narrow stalls -- hechima (in Okinawan, naberaa, the same as the 
familiar luffah), a green gourd heavy with water; goya, a bitter gourd covered 
with warts; green papayas; smooth round winter melons, and a wealth of leafy 
greens -- including nigana, a bitter green resembling dandelion greens, and 
fuchiba, known in mainland Japan as yomogi (in English as mugwort), where it's 
mainly used to flavor sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have clearly defined medicinal functions, like the glossy deep purple 
leaves of handama , with a deliciously nutty flavor, good for cleaning out your 
system. Concealed beneath their scruffy skins, the violet-tinged potato (called 
ta-umu , "wet-field potato," in Okinawa) and the crimson-skinned murasaki-umu 
have been credited with saving the people of these islands from starvation. 
Imported from China at the beginning of the 17th Century, they supplanted 
millet and other grains as the staple food of the common people. Only the 
aristocracy and samurai classes ate rice. It wasn't until after World War II 
that most people in Okinawa began to eat rice regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 The cool, dark shops within the covered arcade specialize in dried goods and 
offer many grades and varieties of konbu (kelp). The Okinawan appetite for 
konbu goes back at least as far as the 18th Century, when ships from Hokkaido 
sold the leathery dried seaweed in exchange for Ryukyuan sugar. Other seaweeds, 
the soft, thread-like aasaa and slippery strands of mozuku, are also favorites, 
rich in minerals and apparently playing a role in reducing cholesterol -- 
important in this pork-rich cuisine. Glistening black water-snakes (dried) lie 
in coils or hang from the eaves of the market building. White ginger flowers in 
front of a nearby florist perfume the alleys. Stalls of spices, herbs, roots 
and packaged teas highlight the strong association here, as in China, between 
food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tsuchiya meets me in the fish market. The fishes' sleek, glistening bodies are 
as dazzling as the coral reefs where they swam until a few hours ago. Spotted 
scarlet miibai (a kind of white fish); another miibai , brown with leopard 
spots; gray irabucha (also a white-fleshed fish), turquoise about the gills, 
and yellow-black-and-white-striped flatfish rest on snowy beds of ice. 
Something nameless, opal and turquoise with big teeth, grins at us. Yellow and 
green crabs, their claws bound with blue vinyl ribbon, bubble helplessly on 
crushed ice; in a large tank, six different types of prawns move lazily; 
lobsters decorated with unimaginable rainbows wriggle amethyst antennae. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of this brilliant array of the sea's wealth, fish is not considered 
part of a formal Okinawan meal except in the highly processed and refined form 
of kamaboko (usually translated "fish paste" or "fish cake"). I ask my guide 
how this could be. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who went to sea were considered lazy," he begins in Japanese. They 
were supposed to be tilling the fields. "The common people must have eaten 
fish, but they probably did it in secret . . . " Local officials discouraged 
the islanders from fishing for their own subsistence, preferring to keep them 
working to produce goods that would enrich the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The meat market blazes with bare light bulbs suspended over piles and piles of 
fresh pink pork, presided over by spirited and sexy women with Amazonian arms. 
Okinawans use every last bit of the pig -- from unctuous chunks of fresh bacon, 
generously layered with fat, cartilaginous ears, snout and face, feet, rich 
innards and blood. A liberal use of lard enriches and marries the flavors of 
many vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs on the second floor of the meat market, the Oyako Shokudo 
(parent-child luncheonette) is famous for its nakami-jiru , a rich soup made 
from chitterlings (pig's intestines), served only on Saturdays. By noon the 
place is buzzing. Every day mother and daughter prepare only one or two set 
lunches, real home cooking. Today it's soki-jiru , a rich broth made from meaty 
pork ribs, lightly flavored with miso bean paste, crowned with a mound of 
greens and served with a bowl of rice. Tomorrow's lunch? "I won't know until I 
see tomorrow's vegetables," says the silver-toothed lady behind the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert following an Okinawan meal is likely to be confined to fresh fruit, 
but throughout the day sweets are offered whenever tea is served. The sweets 
made in the sleek Japanese-style shop, Jahana, called kippan and togazuke, are 
firmly based in the court tradition. The complementary flavors of kippan -- a 
dense, bittersweet nugget made from the white part of the peel of mandarin 
oranges, glazed with sugar -- and togazuke -- candied winter melon with an 
indefinable, delicate flavor, cooked in sugar until meltingly tender, hardening 
on the outside to a fragile crystalline shell -- are the perfect foil for green 
Japanese tea or the more delicate types of Chinese tea. Four generations ago, 
Jahana's ancestors were Chinese immigrants in the Kume district of the city. 
Before the war there were three other such confectioneries. Now only Jahana 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Urizun is one of those very rare places that combines wonderful food, sincere 
and unmistakable warmth and local color. Craftspeople and artists, real estate 
agents, teachers, musicians, businessmen, photographers, doctors, naturalists 
and other representatives of the diverse Okinawan society gather nightly to 
share the easy familiarity of the place and his or her preferred style of 
awamori. The finest is kosu, "aged liquor," stored in earthy brown ceramic vats 
for up to 30 years, served in thimble-size cups. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu, a marriage of the cuisine developed at the royal Ryukyu court and 
the food of the common people (clear distinctions are lost in the haze of 
history), maintains a fine balance between the richness of pork, garlic and 
potatoes, and the lightness of seaweed, fish, tofu and vegetables. The light 
touch is that of Tsuchiya Keiko, who comes in every day from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
to do the hardest part of the preparation, oversee the arrival of groceries and 
generally keep things in order (in addition to keeping house and taking care of 
the children). As I help her stir the mashed potatoes in the narrow kitchen one 
morning, she asks me, "Can't you make my husband come in and give me a hand 
with the cooking? Not every day -- but once in a while?" 
</P>
<P>
 A meal at Urizun might include some or all of the following traditional 
dishes. Tofuyo is an intensely flavored little cube of tofu that has been 
fermented for at least six months with rice; salty and slightly sharp like aged 
cheese, its flavor becomes smoother and richer with time, complementing that of 
awamori perfectly. Sunui, a gelatinous seaweed known as mozuku in mainland 
Japan, is dressed with vinegar and here enlivened (on request in deference to 
tame palates) by a dab of grated garlic. Mimigaa sashimi is thin slices of 
pigs' ears, blanched and dressed with vinegar and soy sauce, their crunchy 
texture as important (if not more so) than the delicate and elusive flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 More substantial dishes include kuubu irichii, stir-fried, finely julienned 
konbu (kelp) seaweed, flavored with bits of pork and fishcake ( kamaboko ); 
duruwakashii, unctuous mashed potatoes made from ta-umu sauteed in a bit of oil 
with their green stems, bits of pork, kamaboko and shiitake mushrooms; and 
raaftei, fresh bacon, alternating layers of succulent meat and rich fat, cut 
into large chunks and braised with miso (fermented bean paste) and vegetables 
until meltingly tender. 
</P>
<P>
 My last night in Naha, a classic Okinawan specialty is on the menu: ika 
sumijiru , a wonderfully fragrant and intense soup of squid and its ink. The 
steaming opaque black liquid (based on a hearty pork stock), with snowy pieces 
of squid, daikon and the slightly bitter green leaves of nigana afloat in a red 
lacquer bowl are a shock to the eye, but with a reassuring velvety consistency 
and deliciously complex flavor. Okinawan food should be enjoyed in its natural 
habitat, made with local ingredients, served on robust Okinawan pottery or 
elegant lacquer, to the sounds of the joyous and mournful sanshin (ancestor of 
Japan's stringed shamisen ). In a word, the food that embodies Okinawa's 
culture should be relished in all the complexities of Okinawa itself. GUIDEBOOK

HEAT & SOUL; BAHIA'S UNIQUE AFRICAN-BRAZILIAN SENSIBILITY, A LEGACY OF BRUTAL 
SLAVE TRADE, HAS LEFT BEHIND A MESMERIZING MIX OF PASSIONATE SPIRITUALITY AND 
EXOTIC SENSUALITY.

 It took two buses and three more hours of bouncing travel after our Saturday 
morning flight from Rio de Janeiro to the northeastern Brazilian city of 
Salvador, but we decided to push on to Cachoeira that same day. We wanted to be 
sure we wouldn't miss that evening's service of Candomble, in the town where it 
is most devoutly practiced. 
</P>
<P>
 An African-Brazilian cult developed by black slaves forced to mask their 
Yoruba religion in the cloak of Catholicism, Candomble is still widely 
practiced throughout Brazil's Bahian region. During all-night ceremonies, 
shaman priestesses, spun into frenzied trances, serve as conduits between 
worshippers and their African orixas or deities. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more than anything else, Candomble evokes for me the passionate 
soulfulness and exotic sensuality of Bahia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilian state of Bahia is where Portuguese explorers landed at the turn 
of the 16th Century. They stayed for more than 300 years, turning this coastal 
region and its capital city of Salvador into a wealthy commercial hub and a 
slave trading post. Today, industrial development has not kept pace with that 
in the nation's southern states, leaving the vast majority of its black-skinned 
residents in dire poverty. Still, Bahia's African connection has left a 
cultural legacy that causes even its often condescending neighbors further 
south to consider it the soul of Brazil.  
</P>
<P>
 That sensibility is what drew me and my friends Miriam and Ruth to 
northeastern Brazil in late August for an eight-day trip. And Bahia delivered 
on its promise of of spiritual and cultural intensity. I tasted it in the 
fragrant stews spiced with dende palm oil and coconut milk and heard it in 
pulsating African rhythms that pounded my lungs and eyes as much as my ears; I 
read it in the magical lyricism of Bahian novelist Jorge Amado and saw it in 
the grotesquely carved wooden statues depicting proud Africans in chains, a 
reminder of Bahia's brutal history of plantation slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 That first night in Bahia, I also felt it at the enigmatic Candomble ceremony 
we found, with the help of a cabdriver, across the river in Cachoeira's sister 
village, Sao Felix.  
</P>
<P>
 As we made our way up a dirt path that wound around shabby matchbox houses, I 
heard a steady drum beat and a piercing chant that managed to simultaneously 
pique my sense of adventure as well as my anxiety. One look inside the crowded, 
steamy house at the top, however, and rapt wonder shoved aside my discomfort. 
Two women, heads shaved, lay face down in the center of the floor, their white 
lace petticoats ballooning around them like parachutes that had just hit level 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly they rose to their feet, joining three other women in a sensuous 
dance-like movement. Suddenly one woman went rigid, her cocoa-colored features 
collapsed in on each other as if her face were compressed in a painful vise. 
The fevered intensity of the trance lasted only a few moments before her body 
slumped and the other women gently led her out of the room. Although the 
ceremony usually continues till dawn, after only an hour I was already drunk 
with the throbbing rhythms and ritualistic movements that we were welcome to 
quietly watch but failed to fully understand. 
</P>
<P>
 We awoke the next morning determined not to spend another night in the dirty, 
bug-infested pousada , or pension, we had happened upon the evening before. So 
we moved to what every guidebook seemed to agree is the only place worth 
staying in Cachoeira, the Convento do Carmine, an old Franciscan monastery that 
has been converted into a charming hotel. We stayed in one of the blessedly 
clean, high-ceilinged rooms with dark mahogany floors that are located around 
the perimeter of a lush, open-air square of green at the center of the 
monastery.  
</P>
<P>
 Although barely anyone spoke English, nearly everyone we ran into patiently 
waited until we made ourselves understood, using a blend of phrase-book 
Portuguese and hand signals. The town, designated a historical landmark by 
UNESCO, boasts 18th-Century churches and municipal buildings that date back to 
the days when Cachoeira was a busy trading post between the vast sugarcane 
plantations and the rest of Brazil. But that morning, we opted to leave our 
guidebook in the room and just wander through the sleepy colonial town. 
</P>
<P>
 We passed the delicate, scalloped facades of row houses, some crumbling away 
from years of neglect. Yet their chipped and fading pastels lent the town an 
aura of authenticity that the studied prettiness of historical reconstructions 
couldn't hope to match. 
</P>
<P>
 It was winter in this country below the Equator, and by afternoon a chilling 
rain drove us back to the convent where we decided to indulge, Brazilian style, 
in a langorous two-hour lunch that cost less than $10 each. We had the 
convento's entire dining room to ourselves and watched the rain as a 
sweet-faced waiter served us a thick, steaming soup made of potatoes, carrots 
and rutabagas. Then we moved on to a moqueca , a heavenly sizzling, spiced 
Bahian stew usually made with shrimp or fish.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Coachoeira's spiritualism, we opted for the sensuousness of the deserted 
beaches of Praia do Forte, about a two-hour bus ride away. We decided to forego 
the luxurious but pricey Praia do Forte resort in favor of a quiet, inexpensive 
inn called Pousada des Artistes, that had suprisingly good paintings by its 
Spanish owner and small balconies strung with hammocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I'm not sure which Candomble divinity granted our wish, by morning 
the previous day's steel-wool sky was replaced by a dazzling sun that warmed 
temperatures to the 80s. Ruth slept late, so Miriam and I set out to explore 
the sea turtle sanctuary that sits right off the beach, before sitting down at 
our pousada to a breakfast of fried cinnamon bananas, fresh rolls, and thick 
slices of mangoes, pineapples and papaya. As with most hotels or inns in 
Brazil, breakfast was included in the room rate.  
</P>
<P>
 We immediately fell into our own routine of activities at Praia do Forte, 
which primarily consisted of lying on the deserted beach (seven miles long), 
eating pungent moquecas , and drinking smoldering sugar-cane alcohol at the 
restaurants and bars along the village's main road. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest readied us for our plunge back into the energetic swirl of Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital of Portuguese-ruled Brazil until 1763, Salvador has never regained 
the wealth that flowed in as sugarcane, tobacco, and gold flowed out. But 
Brazil's fourth largest city, situated on the tip of a jutting peninsula that 
looks out on All Saints Bay, manages to retain joyous vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there was a music festival occuring in Salvador during our visit, we 
decided for once to make room reservations. We chose a simple, Italian-run 
hotel recommended by my guidebook and located in a section near the beach 
called Barra, a center for restaurants, hotels and nightlife. But while we 
slept there, we spent our days in Pelourinho, the city's historical district 
which contains the best examples of colonial architecture on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelourinho, which means whipping post, also has a darker notoriety as the 
auction block or punishment site for many of the estimated 5 million slaves 
shipped to Brazil to work the sprawling plantations and gold mines owned by 
Portuguese colonists. Now a UNESCO-protected historical area, Pelourinho is in 
the midst of a $30-million restoration project that has spawned an angry debate 
between those who believe it will protect Bahia's cultural legacy and those who 
fear gentrification will squeeze out poor black Brazilians who embody that 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Though entire blocks are often swarming with workmen, the triangular center of 
Pelhourinho swarms with tourists weaving in and out of a succession of shops 
selling handsewn lace, strangely shaped musical instruments and even 
intricately carved coffins balanced upright in a row like soldiers at roll 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth and I had stopped inside one of the brightly painted, baroque storefronts 
when Miriam came running back to fetch us. A tall, well-muscled teen-ager had 
beckoned her into one of the capoeira schools to watch a demonstration. If 
Bahia's African spirit finds a religious outlet in Candomble, its vent for 
artistic impulses is capoeira.  
</P>
<P>
 Part-martial art, part-dance, capoeira was developed by slaves disguising 
their combat techniques from their masters' watchful eyes. Performing to the 
tinny plink of a berimbau, a one-stringed gourd instrument, capoeiristas manage 
to blend fierceness and grace in thrilling, rapid-fire acrobatics. Mesmerized 
by the stunning choreography, we ended up following the troupe like capoeira 
groupies as they performed through the cobblestone streets for tips. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In true Bahian style, we spent our last day in Salvador mixing the sensual and 
the spiritual. In the morning, we walked along the beach in Barra, watching the 
rows of thong-bathing-suited sunbathers drinking out of split coconut shells. 
In the afternoon, we made a pilgrimage to the 18th-Century church of Nosso 
Senhor do Bonfim in the western part of the city. Though other churches outdo 
it in architectural brilliance and ornate decor, Bonfim is unmatched for the 
intensity of its religious devotees. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking testament to faith in Saint Bonfim's power is off the 
sanctuary in the Sala dos Milagres, Room of Miracles, where white translucent 
plastic arms, heads, feet, lungs and hearts hang from the ceiling as in a 
ghostly meat locker. Suppliants offer the waxy body parts to ask for help or 
give thanks for a successful lung operation or to speedily mend a broken arm. 
Below, the walls are plastered with letters, photographs, momentos and ribbons 
thanking Bonfim for rescuing a missing child, for help on a test, for blessing 
a marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the approach to the church, scrawny children ran after us, throwing ribbons 
in the hopes of getting a tip in exchange.  
</P>
<P>
 Legend has it that by tying a ribbon or fita around your wrist and allowing it 
to fall off naturally, your wish will come true. Although not particularly 
superstitious, we had sufficiently fallen under Bahia's spell to be wary of 
courting bad luck by prematurely cutting off the ribbon. So we all tied our 
fitas in loose knots that would undo at the slightest movement. Yet our cab 
driver, who credited Bonfim with helping him buy his taxi, was so moved by our 
apparent faith in the saint's power that he insisted on properly securing the 
fita around Miriam's wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, his handiwork is still remarked upon by our friends, who three months 
later, rarely fail to comment on the graying, ragged ribbon that is still 
tightly wound around her wrist. GUIDEBOOK

TAKING THE KIDS: HUNDREDS OF FEET UNDERGROUND, IT'S COLD, DARK AND REALLY FUN 
</P>

<P>
 There was no mistaking the Witch's Nose, appropriately twisted and ugly. As we 
made our way down the winding trail, we also passed sharp-toothed monsters, a 
twinkling fairyland and a gigantic crooked finger beckoning us to follow. All 
were made of massive rock -- some more than 20 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 We were an estimated 80 stories underground exploring Carlsbad Cavern, part of 
a 47,000-acre national park and one of the most famous caves in the country. It 
was simultaneously fantastic and spooky. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter Reggie, a second grader, was amazed that these gigantic formations 
had been evolving into their present shapes over hundreds of thousands of years 
from dripping water that left behind small limestone rings on the ceiling and 
floors of the cavern. She was amused that the speleothems (rock formations) are 
everywhere and look exactly like their names: frozen popcorn, gigantic soda 
straws and draperies. 
</P>
<P>
 We made our way around one portion of the cavern called the Big Room -- 1,800 
feet long and 1,100 feet at its widest point -- which is one of the largest 
underground rooms in the world. We gaped at the gigantic stalactites hanging 
from the ceiling, and the 62-foot-high Giant Dome, Carlsbad's biggest 
stalagmite. We peered into the Bottomless Pit, a black hole 140 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids really like this cave," said U.S. Park Service ranger Leanne Benton, who 
was making sure visitors stayed on the paved trail and didn't touch the 
delicate formations. "They have the spirit of explorers." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the 30 miles of mapped trails are open to the public. However, older 
children and more adventurous families can join a ranger exploring Slaughter 
Canyon Cave, an undeveloped section with no electricity or paved walks, some 20 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 At Carlsbad this spring and summer there will also be opportunities to see 
other undeveloped areas of the cave. In Spider Cave, for example, "You'll be 
down on your belly crawling," said Ed Greene, chief of visitor services. "Kids 
love the adventure." (To make reservations for these and other guided tours, 
call Carlsbad Cavern visitor information at 505-785-2232.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a lot of interest in caving now," said Greene, noting that 
Carlsbad draws three-quarters of a million people a year, making reservations 
several weeks in advance a good idea for summer visitors. And when the Mexican 
free-tail bats are in residence in the caves during the summer, 1,000 people 
gather at dusk each day to watch tens of thousands of them fly out for their 
dinner and to hear a ranger talk about bat flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year in August, a dawn breakfast is offered at Carlsbad to encourage 
visitors to watch the bats as they return to the cavern after a night of 
feasting on moths and other hapless insects. It draws 500 people each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlsbad Cavern isn't on the way to anywhere," said Greene of the national 
park 175 miles east of El Paso and 27 miles west of the town of Carlsbad. 
"People come here because they want to be at the cave." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the greening of tourism. People are looking for places to go 
where they can learn about the world around them," said Barbara Munson, an 
officer of the National Caves Assn. Throughout the country, there are about 200 
caves -- including several in national parks -- that were developed for public 
visits. (Call the National Caves Assn. at 615-668-3925.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the National Speleological Society, an organization of 
dedicated cavers, has grown to 11,000 members committed to exploring 
undeveloped caves and preserving them. (For more information call 
205-852-1300.) 
</P>
<P>
 When visiting a cave, be careful -- especially with kids along. Even in 
developed caves, paths are narrow and there may be steep drop-offs. And it may 
be dark. Keep children close to you. Wear sturdy shoes and bring a jacket, 
since it is always chilly inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask in advance about stroller and wheelchair access. At Carlsbad, for example, 
strollers aren't permitted on the paved paths, though visitors in wheelchairs 
may use some of them. Other trails are too steep or narrow, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also essential: Don't touch the formations, which can be easily damaged. 
Because of tourist damage, for the first time in two decades Carlsbad is this 
summer returning to guided tours in certain popular sections of the cavern that 
previously had been open to visitors exploring on their own. "We've counted 
18,000 broken formations in the last eight years," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie and I entered the cavern from its natural entrance near the Bat Flight 
Amphitheater, hiking down 750 feet (there is also elevator access). It was 
through this same gaping hole that Native Americans first ventured inside 
seeking shelter more than 1,000 years ago, scientists believe. They left 
drawings, visible today, on the walls near the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteenth-Century settlers were attracted by the spectacle of the bats. 
Photographs taken in the early years of the 20th Century fueled the fervor and 
Carlsbad was declared a national monument in 1923. Since then, more than 33 
million people have visited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bet nobody saw the same things in the rocks that I did," Reggie said proudly 
when we left.

HIKING: SACRAMENTO: WATERED-DOWN FUN AT AUBURN

 The dam builders didn't get their way on the American River. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, construction began on Auburn Dam, which would have turned the gorges 
and canyons near Sacramento into Auburn Lake. But the project was shelved after 
the collapse of a Montana dam, similar in design to Auburn, and conservation 
efforts by such groups as Friends of the River. The federal Bureau of 
Reclamation then allowed the state of California to use a portion of the river 
as a recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 Though unlikely, the project could be revived: The dam was conceived in the 
1940s and a few die-hard locals have been pushing for its construction ever 
since. As a result, no expensive roads or facilities have been constructed in 
the 30,000-acre Auburn State Recreation Area. Any such improvements would be 
covered by water if Auburn Lake came into existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishing, river-rafting, hiking and camping are popular activities at the park, 
about 25 miles east of Sacramento along more than 30 miles of the north and 
middle forks of the American River.  
</P>
<P>
 A favorite stretch of trail follows the American River from Ruck-a-Chucky 
Campground to the Ruck-a-Chucky Rapids. Early spring wildflowers -- fairy 
lanterns, Indian paintbrush, lupine and many more -- brighten the path. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Interstate 80 on the outskirts of Auburn, exit 
on Auburn-Forest Hill Road and head east eight miles. Turn right on the dirt 
Drivers Flat Road (bumpy, but suitable for passenger cars with good ground 
clearance) and go 2 1/2 miles to Ruck-a-Chucky Campground and road's end at the 
trail head.  
</P>
<P>
 The hike: From the signed trail head, follow the closed road along the river. 
The American River, which has its headwaters in the deep snows of the Sierra 
Nevada, has deposited quite a collection of sand, rounded cobblestones and 
great boulders en route, and carved an impressive canyon as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If you look high above the riverbanks, you might see some little platforms 
marked by rock walls where Gold Rush-era miners lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruck-a-Chucky Rapids is not a stretch of river that wizened river-rafters run, 
so there is a portage trail that leads along the banks to get around the 
rapids. Western Pioneer Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Auburn State Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: From Ruck-a-Chucky Campground to rapids, 3 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Banks of the American River, near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Dramatic stretch of river. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy to moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECAUTIONS: Drivers Flat Road may be closed after rainstorms due to muddy 
conditions.

 For 36 years, Boston-based Grand Circle Travel has been a leading packager of 
tours and cruises for active travelers over the age of 50. The company 
continues to develop new destinations, land-cruise combinations and a worldwide 
series focusing on culture and education. Grand Circle also has established a 
nonprofit foundation that has contributed more than $200,000 to such programs 
as a university for peace in Costa Rica, Nepal's Himalayan Trust and a 
children's village in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Grand Circle travel-program options below might have particular 
appeal for those with diverse travel and cultural interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Live Abroad Extended Vacations is a plan under which travelers may reside in 
a house, villa or apartment in a foreign country for two to 26 weeks. Travelers 
can shop, explore castles, visit museums and take day trips while mingling with 
locals. All Extended Vacation packages include round-trip air fare from major 
U.S. cities, plus lodging, airport transfers, selected meals and an on-site 
program director who is familiar with the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many travelers visit two or more countries, or different regions of the same 
country. A sample Extended Vacation divides 23 days among three Mediterranean 
coastal cities in Spain and includes air fare from Los Angeles, and breakfast 
and dinner daily. Cost begins at $2,125 per person, with additional weeks 
priced at $135 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Extended Vacations destinations include Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, 
Morocco, the Swiss Alps, Austria, Italy, France, England, Scotland, Wales, 
Ireland and Costa Rica. Add-ons of three to five days in nearby major cities 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year, Grand Circle Travel acquired Overseas Adventure Travel, which 
offers trips and safaris throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and 
the Mediterranean. Packages are designed to appeal to several groups, including 
women, families, singles and "busy people," with quick trips of eight to 13 
days for the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas Adventure Travel's African safaris are limited to eight people and 
include huge cabin-tents with beds, linen, toilets and hot showers, plus a 
safari vehicle. Destinations include such off-beat places as Borneo, the 
Amazon, the Andes, Nepal and Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Discovery Series is designed for travelers who seek a deeper 
understanding of the land, culture and people they visit. They can engage in 
dialogue with individuals from the worlds of art, history, nature and politics. 
For example, travelers may meet with former Costa Rican President Rodrigo 
Carazo, learn how to make filo dough during a cooking lesson in Turkey, or 
explore the history of Spanish and Moorish architecture with university 
professors in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elder Venture, Grand Circle's newest program, was created in response to 
adventurous seniors seeking interaction with nature. Trips are currently 
offered to the Amazon, Belize, Costa Rica and the Galapagos Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 * A series of cruises on such lines as Princess, Regency, Royal, Cunard and 
Costa are available, with land-and-cruise options. Deep discounts are common. 
</P>
<P>
 A Grand Circle 36th anniversary voyage, which departs the United States by air 
on Oct. 4 for Venice and the Adriatic Sea, includes visits to cities in Greece, 
Turkey, Romania and the Ukraine. Prices begin at $3,246 per person, including 
air fare from Los Angeles. Also available are shore excursions in Istanbul, 
Athens and the ruins at Ephesus, Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Circle also offers a wide range of discounted budget cruises, including 
a 15-day Danube River cruise beginning at $2,795 per person, with round-trip 
air fare from New York. A 13-day cruise aboard the QE2, with five nights on the 
ship and seven nights in London, and including daily breakfast, airport 
transfers and one week of bus/subway passes, starts at $1,825 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Two current booklets describe Grand Circle programs: Going Abroad: 101 Tips 
for Mature Travelers, which has a new section on health and fitness; and GCT 
Travel Planner. Both are free. For more information, call (800) 248-3737.

VISA ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a senior citizen who traveled alone to visit my mother's birthplace in 
Lithuania. My railway pass was purchased in the United States and it was 
mentioned that no visa was required to pass through the countries on my 
itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 When I boarded the train in Warsaw, the boarding sign read "Warsaw to Vilnius" 
only and did not name any intermediate stops. They neglected to inform me that 
the train would be going through Grodno, Russia (now Belarus), thereby 
requiring a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 I was ordered off the train at 2 a.m. on a freezing morning to be interrogated 
at length regarding the reasons for my trip. After providing my identification 
and adequate explanations, I was allowed to continue on. 
</P>
<P>
 On my return trip, I took a taxi for 120 miles from Vilnius to Grodno and 
again I was subjected to the same ordeal. After approval, I was escorted to a 
Russian train bound directly for Warsaw. Both times I was treated well.

IRVINE HOLDS DOOR OPEN TO HOMEOWNERS; * USING FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP BUY 
AFFORDABLE CONDOS IS A PROGRAM WORTH REPEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to having a stake in the neighborhood, few things are better 
motivators than home ownership, a fact that the federal government wisely 
recognizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several communities in Orange County have taken advantage of a federal program 
to make it easy for people with below-average incomes to buy their first homes. 
Irvine is the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 The private, nonprofit Jamboree Housing Corp., based in Irvine, received $1 
million in federal funds, administered by the state Department of Housing, that 
will help 20 people buy condominiums in Irvine ranging in price from $105,000 
to $175,000. The buyer makes a minimum 5% down payment, and Jamboree lends 
$50,000 more to add to the down payment. That lowers the monthly payment enough 
to be affordable to residents with lower incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than 125 applicants for the lottery that determined which 20 
households would be fortunate enough to get the loans. The program's executive 
director, Lila Lieberthal, said dozens more potential homeowners have called to 
ask if there will be future loans. The problem there is money; the federal 
government is saying it is strapped for housing funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jamboree-assisted homeowners will have to repay the loans when they sell 
their houses or refinance them. If they sell to a family eligible for the 
program, the new buyers can assume the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The company lined up three lenders to provide mortgages that Lieberthal said 
are "somewhat below market rates" and also persuaded escrow and title firms to 
lower their usual rates. Owners must live in the homes, have three or more in 
the family, and have a maximum income of under $40,000 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
 With housing prices still high in Orange County despite the recession, the 
program is needed. It will benefit Irvine and the county, and is worth 
repeating elsewhere.

SANTA ANA'S KOREAN MERCHANTS FITTING IN; * EFFORTS TO PROMOTE RAPPORT WITH 
LATINOS ARE SUCCEEDING, FORTUNATELY FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The vice president of the Downtown Santa Ana Business Assn., Teresa Saldivar, 
thought too many Korean merchants in the city were creating the impression that 
they were the type to take the money and run. She wanted to see more community 
involvement, even if it was just buying a raffle ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean merchants told Saldivar her group's poll of business people might be a 
good way of communicating, but how could they know? It only came in English or 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Saldivar had the poll translated into Korean. A number of Korean 
merchants began reaching out beyond their shops, buying uniforms for elementary 
school students and donating bicycles to a graffiti-removal program. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt to help residents and business people in predominantly Latino 
Santa Ana and the increasing number of Koreans there understand each other 
better appears to be succeeding. And it must, for everyone's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 We all remember the Los Angeles riots of 1992, when tensions among ethnic 
groups exploded into violence. The possibility of similar unrest in Orange 
County galvanized a number of groups to improve communications and try to 
defuse potentially volatile situations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of Korean businesses in Santa Ana grew to an estimated 600, 
Latino merchants said they and their Latino customers perceived the Koreans as 
aloof. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean shopkeepers said that besides language problems, they were accustomed 
to having community problems handled by the government in their native land, 
not by the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers must adapt to the customs of their new land. The Koreans have 
received an assist from the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, which has a Korean 
Business Committee, which last month published its first Korean-language 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants are also learning about strength in numbers, having members with 
similar complaints or requests banding together to speak with government 
agencies. Those activities are providing an example for other cities in an 
increasingly diverse Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Community involvement is what Korean businessman Brian B. Ouh stressed before 
he was killed in a 1991 traffic accident. In recruiting Asian vendors for his 
Fiesta Bargain Store in Santa Ana, Ouh stressed the need that they speak 
Spanish and respect the community where they did business. It is heartening to 
see others continuing his efforts.

SPIKING A PRACTICE UNFAIR TO TAXPAYERS; * O.C. CITIES, AGENCIES PAYING PRICE 
FOR INFLATING SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The time to pay the piper has come in several Orange County cities and 
agencies that allowed employees who were soon to retire to inflate their 
salaries, and thus their pensions, through the maneuver known as "spiking." 
</P>
<P>
 State Controller Gray Davis called the practice "legal larceny" two years ago, 
after an audit by his office of eight California cities, including Anaheim and 
Huntington Beach, found spiking widespread and costly to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 His condemnation still echoes in Huntington Beach, where the City Council this 
month began exploring ways to stop spiking that may occur before a state law 
barring the practice takes effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Though legal, spiking was wrong. It reinforced the erroneous belief that 
government employees are out to rip off taxpayers. The Legislature was right to 
outlaw the practice, and the state Public Employees' Retirement System was 
correct to bill cities that had allowed spiking, even though the cities argued 
that PERS encouraged the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice involved tacking on sick leave, vacation days, automobile 
allowances and other perks to salary, inflating the final bill and using it as 
the basis for pensions. It was bad enough to pay someone for not being sick. 
But it was worse to have it computed in pensions, which are paid year after 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 One man Davis cited as benefiting from spiking was William O. Talley, whose 
salary was increased from $97,390 to $159,109 before he resigned in 1987 as 
Anaheim city manager. That increased Talley's retirement benefits to nearly the 
amount of his salary before the hike. Talley noted that PERS approved it and 
accused Davis of grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, the audit cited a former deputy city attorney, as well as 
15 of 16 other retirees as beneficiaries of spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the numbers have grown. PERS, which administers retirement 
programs for more than 1,000 agencies across California, has billed Huntington 
Beach nearly $1 million in recent months to cover higher pensions for retirees. 
The total cost of spiking in the city is estimated at $2.7 million for 34 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 PERS argued that spiking does not give the system enough time to save money to 
pay inflated pensions, so it has begun collecting from cities and agencies 
throughout California. Others being dunned include Anaheim, Costa Mesa, La 
Habra, Los Alamitos, Newport Beach and the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 PERS officials said spiking primarily benefited higher-ranking city and agency 
employees. But in Huntington Beach, a number of low-level workers last year 
decided to add benefits to salaries to increase the pensions. City officials 
said spiking became part of labor contracts, although some unions have since 
yielded on the practice, as they should. 
</P>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach City Council study two years ago found that among nine 
comparable cities in Southern California, Huntington Beach allowed its 
employees the most generous retirement benefits due to spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is better off being told upfront what it costs to run cities and 
how much employees are being paid, including benefits. No one wants to be 
surprised years later by larger-than-expected bills, especially when government 
budgets have already been frozen and some workers laid off in tough economic 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking is about to be outlawed. Now it will be up to governments to ensure 
some similar practice does not creep in to take its place. Spell out salaries 
and benefits, including pensions, so they are easy to understand. Level with 
the taxpayers.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON HEALTH; FIGHTING TB WILL REQUIRE BOTH 
SHORT-, LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS; APATHY ALLOWED THE DISEASE TO RESURFACE. DOCTORS, 
PUBLIC AGENCIES NEED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEARL JEMISON-SMITH, Pearl Jemison-Smith is chairwoman of the Tuberculosis 
Coalition of Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past few years we have fallen prey to earthquakes, firestorms, floods 
and violence. Our judicial system seems to be in turmoil. Guns, knives and iron 
rods seem to rule. Graffiti and gangs add to the feeling of fear of what the 
future holds for Orange County. We have been caught up in the "tabloiding" of 
the United States, the personalities in the press, the violence of nature and 
man (excuse me, humans). 
</P>
<P>
 In a quiet way, another killer has re-emerged, not with a bang or a flash, but 
insidiously moving into areas where we weren't looking. 
</P>
<P>
 The areas we chose to ignore: Our deteriorating infrastructure, our 
underfunded public health system and our substandard living conditions created 
breeding grounds for an invisible, sneaky disease that we thought had been 
conquered -- tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 We became satisfied when tuberculosis rates dropped dramatically in the '60s 
and '70s. With improved living conditions and effective medications, 
tuberculosis was under control. The Tuberculosis Society even changed its name 
to the American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it slipped people's notice that, over the past year in three different 
Orange County cities -- in two high schools and a preschool -- we had a number 
of cases of tuberculosis. If your town or school district was not affected, you 
may have not been aware. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know that in 1993 tuberculosis increased 7% in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know that in 1990 we had 258 cases, and in 1993 we almost doubled that 
number to 440 cases? 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know that 12% of the cases are in children under 14 and 18% are in 
young people between the ages of 15 and 24? 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the American Lung Assn. of Orange County, the Orange County Health 
Care Agency and a diverse group of community leaders got together to form a 
coalition to address this problem. As part of our education plan we feel it is 
critical that the public be alerted to our concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal emergency funds totaling $360,000 were allocated to Orange 
County, much more is needed to combat this insidious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 We know the county budget is limited, and competing priorities make it 
difficult to find the funds to meet the increasing needs. The Orange County 
Health Care Agency is working long hours to follow up the cases in schools; 
care and treatment must be provided for the increasing caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, education and prevention efforts are required for the 
community at large. But additional work needs to be done, and funding is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, schools would be hard pressed to screen all children for 
tuberculosis unless adequate staffing is provided. It is not a requirement to 
screen children before entering school, and it is at the discretion of the 
health officer to require this. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of resources has resulted in a recent change in services available to 
the community. Preventive therapy will no longer be provided to individuals 
between the ages of 21 and 35 who skin-test positive for tuberculosis but have 
no other risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the time for cost-cutting measures. We can learn from the New York 
experience that declining resources can be linked with the emergence of 
communicable, drug-resistant tuberculosis that is extremely difficult and 
expensive to treat and poses an increased risk to health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand that the Health Care Agency will request additional funds to help 
control tuberculosis. I urge the Board of Supervisors to approve those funds. 
We must face our dilemma and avoid future costly problems by providing adequate 
resources now. 
</P>
<P>
 We are at the stage where we can stop this disease from becoming what it is 
throughout the world: The disease that kills more people -- more than 3 million 
a year -- than all other infectious diseases combined. 
</P>
<P>
 This disease does not discriminate; it delights in finding a place to live in 
the homeless, the overcrowded, the immune-deficient, the young and the elderly. 
It is not easily transmitted. It is spread through the air and requires 
prolonged close contact to be spread. Symptoms to look for include a cough, 
coughing up blood, weight loss, tiredness, weakness, fever and night sweats. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge physicians to "think TB" and to do the appropriate diagnostic tests. I 
urge pharmacists and other dispensers of herbs and medicines to refer clients 
to their doctor or the Health Care Agency if they have symptoms of 
tuberculosis. I encourage teachers to be alert for symptomatic children, and I 
urge community leaders to be knowledgeable and to ask what they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to look for long-term solutions to this problem, including places 
where homeless, infectious individuals can be treated and followed for as long 
as needed to cure their disease. We need to look at the impact that health care 
reform and managed care will have on diseases such as tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as all the other issues that confront us today -- natural disasters, 
crime, and racial disharmony -- tuberculosis will only be defeated if we 
educate, plan for the future and provide essential services for the less 
fortunate.

CLAS EXAM TESTS THE PATIENCE OF TEACHERS, TRUSTEE WITH STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After piloting the CLAS test, and administering it on its maiden voyage, I 
had more than a few questions: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Why do we need another state test? We already have CTBS. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Why do we test limited English students? We already know they do not have 
the language capacity to read and interpret literature, or write narrative 
answers to math questions. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Why do we test special-education students? If they could read and function 
on this kind of test, they certainly wouldn't be eligible for special 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Why do we need a test that ignores basic skills such as spelling, math 
computation and reading vocabulary, and instead tests ability to understand and 
manipulate language and problem solving, both of which are higher up on the 
teaming ladder? 
</P>
<P>
 5. As a taxpayer myself, how can we afford a test that is hand-scored with all 
answers subjective, so a consensus of many scorers is used? If a test is needed 
to compare districts, teachers, students or schools, let's use the CTBS, which 
better tests things we can teach. Now that the results of this test have been 
published, I have the same questions, along with a few comments: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Does the public know not all tests are scored?  
</P>
<P>
 2. Since budget cuts seem to be the focus, why did the testing service receive 
funding for this program? Individual scores are not recorded. I fail to see how 
this helps kids learn. 
</P>
<P>
 3. What can we, as teachers, do to show the public that, at least in our 
humble opinion, this is not a valid or accurate test of what kids need to know? 
I wish every parent could see this test, as we have. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corona del Mar schools have high SAT scores, but low CLAS scores. "Is 
there a mistake?" they ask. I think there is. I think the mistake is in the 
entire CLAS testing program. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Much has been said by the media (Times editorial, March 10) and the 
education departments about the new CLAS tests. From a teacher's perspective, 
there is also much to be said about the current CLAS testing situation. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, teachers do not object to accountability. We constantly hold our 
students accountable and use our assessment information to adjust our 
instruction to better meet student needs. Nor do we object to tests that 
measure performance and thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 We do believe, however, that assessments are only worthwhile if they report 
back accurate information. At some grade levels it takes up to eight days to 
administer all the CLAS tests. Add to that the days spent helping students 
learn testing skills, and a considerable amount of instructional time has been 
devoted to these assessments. Unless the tests themselves ask valid questions 
that reflect true student achievement, and the scoring of the tests provides 
accurate and generalizable results, the results are of no use to us in 
improving instruction. What a potential waste of our precious resource time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the 1993 tests, the percentages of tests scored ranged from 
only 25% to 75%. The result: A patchwork that is so full of holes that in many 
cases no valid generalizations can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 To add to our chagrin, the scores from tests given in the spring of 1993 are 
only now being received. We are set to administer the 1994 tests in about six 
weeks. That hardly gives us time to make program adjustments and then measure 
for improvement in this next round of tests! 
</P>
<P>
 If we sound frustrated, we are. Teachers sincerely want to offer high-quality 
education to their students. But we can't do it alone. We need help from the 
state in providing appropriate assessment tools. We need help from the media in 
reporting accurately and fairly the true meaning of these tests. If these don't 
occur, not only are teachers frustrated, but the students and the public are 
all cheated.

 * You asked that the people of California and in particular the politicians 
give the CLAS testing system a chance to work (Times editorial, March 10). That 
would be a reasonable request if we were talking about a group of people who 
were interested in "working" with those of us who have spent good portion of 
our lives working with the ever-changing student base and funding levels.  
</P>
<P>
 For over a year, the professionals in the district where I am a (school board) 
trustee have attempted to have a constructive dialogue with this new group in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Their arrogance has been beyond description -- that is until Wednesday 
morning, March 9. They published the results of their test.  
</P>
<P>
 Their arrogance and incompetence were beautifully demonstrated by what they 
did to the students, teachers and community of Corona del Mar High School. If 
the CLAS people were professional, they would have noted a vast difference in 
their data and what should have been expected. Most researchers would make an 
effort to rationalize the differences, but not CLAS. They just wanted to show 
how their product "showed up" the schools. If this is not the case than they 
are more incompetent than I suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 The crime of it all is that we in California have spent over $55 million to 
set up another overpaid, self-important, incompetent and big-spending 
bureaucracy. If you ever want to see a waste of money, take a look at the 
"puffery" that CLAS has produced.

 * Pardon me while I rant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What is our world coming to? I read that due to the complaints of a few 
businesswomen, the beautiful paintings of women in various stages of undress 
have been removed from the walls of Newport Beach's Ritz restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, said women found these paintings, which were far from 
pornographic, offensive and degrading, or words to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ritz is a classy restaurant with ambience to spare, and as an art lover I 
(and, no doubt, thousands of other people) thought the paintings added much to 
that ambience. The food's not bad, either.  
</P>
<P>
 What hath political correctness wrought? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that we've reached the point where the demands, no matter how 
extreme, of the few have everyone bending over backward, sideways and every 
other direction, so not to offend these overly sensitive few.

 God help us if those same businesswomen ever decide to see the great works of 
art in Europe. Next thing we'd know, Michelangelo's David would be wearing

REP. DORNAN'S ADVICE TO PATTERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I took notice in your coverage of the Democrat convention in Orange County 
(March 6) that my former opponent of 1984 had a few nasty things to say about 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting that Jerry Patterson, a paid lobbyist for the last 10 years, and 
who most occasionally asks for time with members of Congress including myself, 
would burn his bridges this way.Plus, his wife is running for supervisor!  
</P>
<P>
 After his congressional election defeat, we're told Jerry's choice of soothing 
reading material was Elizabeth Kubler-Ross' "On Death and Dying." There's some 
good advice in that book about forgetting. 
</P>
<P>
 Let it go Jerry. . . . Can't we all get along, as Rodney (King) asked? 
</P>
<P>
 That way you can keep your lobbying job.

TWO SIDES TO THE PAY-SPIKING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Subject: Huntington Beach Pay-Spiking Program: What does the Internal 
Revenue Service think of this idea of a double set of figures to compensate for 
which end of the paying and receiving seesaw you see fit to be on? Isn't this 
like keeping a double set of books? 
</P>
<P>
 This is what our mayor and City Council want us to be taxed extra for? 
</P>
<P>
 PHYLLIS PEARSON

 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Just to set the record straight, I have never cheated anyone. I pay my 
bills, and am always kind to small children and little old ladies. 
</P>
<P>
 I am really incensed by all the talk about "spiking." When I started working 
at City Hall in Huntington Beach, I was advised of my hourly wage, my insurance 
coverage and future retirement benefits. All of the conditions of employment 
were completely explained and acceptable.  
</P>
<P>
 A year prior to my employment, during contract negotiations, the city offered 
the employees some added retirement benefits in lieu of any immediate cash 
salary increases. This action would allow the city to retain more of its budget 
for current expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 This agreement was satisfactory to both parties and was instigated in 1978. It 
allowed for 7% to be paid by the city into the employees' retirement fund. This 
same agreement also allowed for employees to forgo their vacations for a year 
to convert vacation time to salary for their final year before retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some instances of possible abuse when car allowances and other 
perks were counted as salary. Most retiring city employees had never had any of 
these benefits in the first place. There has never been sick leave benefits for 
any of these retirement figures. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice to have the people who speak out so all-knowingly about these 
things do a more thorough investigation before they make hurtful accusations.

EL TORO IDEAS OTHER THAN AIRPORT NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * What if the Orange County Board of Supervisors took a fresh look at the 
conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station? City governments are 
obviously split over its future. Citizens are lining up on each side of the 
issue as if there were no alternatives between an international airport or 
residential/commercial use of the site. Business leaders are threatening to 
float an initiative. It's time for the board to come up with a shopping list of 
alternatives so that the issue is not permanently polarized. 
</P>
<P>
 What if all small propeller-driven aircraft were moved out of John Wayne 
Airport and moved to one of the shorter runways at El Toro? The mixture of 
small airplanes making their base turn into the final approach of 757s at JWA 
is an explosive mixture waiting for a match. The Cerritos disaster and the 
recent crash at the approach to John Wayne Airport are ample proof that a major 
disaster is awaiting us. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the money spent to build a new Riley Terminal and all the other 
related airport support features at El Toro was spent to build a rapid rail 
system? This high-speed system could connect John Wayne to an El Toro 
transportation facility, and then run to George or Norton AFB where a 
commercial airport is desired. The Santa Ana River is a possible route for part 
of this rail line, as are other existing rights of way. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the runway at JWA was extended like LAX so that all of the existing 
facilities of JWA could be used for an international airport? Does it really 
make sense to re-create all of them seven miles away at El Toro? 
</P>
<P>
 What if 20 years after the main runway at El Toro were destroyed, a quiet 
hypersonic aircraft was developed? How stupid would we feel? 
</P>
<P>
 What if we took an idea from Monaco or Long Beach, and ran a profitable race 
car event once a year at a course designed around the taxiways and runways of 
El Toro? 
</P>
<P>
 What if the federal government exercises its right to replace the Marine 
station with another government agency because we were not mature enough or 
unselfish enough to do our best for the Orange County of the future? 
</P>

 * It is distressing to see how Orange County is being split between the North 
County cities with their Lincoln (Club) financial empire and the South County 
cities that are contiguous to and will be impacted by the El Toro closure, 
touted for a new commercial airport. El Toro is just (seven) miles from John 
Wayne Airport, which is serving the area adequately. 
</P>
<P>
 Practical and technical feasibility is being swept under the rug by the 
subjective and highly emotional pie-in-the-sky allegations of improved 
lifestyle. For whom? Certainly not the nearby residents who will be faced with 
the thunderous roar of super-cargo and passenger planes at all hours of the day 
and night. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these high-powered and richly financed commercial airport proponents are 
trying to take the matter out of the hands of the established and 
well-represented study commission by their petition drive. Don't be misled by 
their devious petition drive. 
</P>

 * The runaways at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station are not suitable for 
commercial or cargo aircraft, but this fact seems to have fallen on the deaf 
ears of the Lincoln Club and the North County cities. Neither the military nor 
most of the airlines can visualize such a conversion. They agree with Laguna 
Beach resident Charles J. Quilter II, a captain for a major airline and a 
veteran military flier for the past 33 years. Having thoroughly researched the 
field with which he is familiar, he concludes as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 "A key factor concerning El Toro's use as a commercial airport involves 
significant differences in takeoff procedures between airliners and tactical 
military jets. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Toro, the main takeoff runways slope uphill and point to rising terrain, 
frequently accompanied by an unacceptable tail wind. The high performance of 
modern jets helps to overcome these limitations. This is not the case with 
airline transports who operate under civil regulations which demand certain 
minimum performances. One of these regulations requires airliners to be able to 
climb out safely with an engine failure just before liftoff. It follows then 
that transports must be lightly loaded. To accomplish this, either fuel loads 
or passenger loads must be sacrificed. A great way to begin an international 
flight! 
</P>
<P>
 Are there alternatives? Yes, if you want to take off into the teeth of John 
Wayne airport traffic; are willing to impact the new residential sections with 
noise decibels of a new dimension; can change the area's air traffic control 
procedures; are willing to suspend takeoffs at El Toro while an aircraft is on 
approach. Under instrument rules, this can reduce the hourly capacity of the 
airport by a factor of five to 10. An airport that can only handle relatively 
few arrivals and departures per hour does not have much commercial potential. 
If, and after the Marines leave, its best use as an airport may be for general 
aviation purposes. 
</P>

 * It was good news that a majority of the supervisors will not support an 
initiative proposal by the Lincoln Club to allow voters to decide whether El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station should be converted to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the supervisors have only stopped or not supported different options. 
When are they going to show any leadership? A real solution was proposed by 
Larry Agran (Times commentary, Feb. 6). Why has no elected official adopted, or 
even adapted, his brilliant proposal of an El Toro/Irvine Co. land swap? 
</P>
<P>
 KAY HUNTER 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 * There have been heated discussions regarding what to do with the El Toro 
base after closing it to further military use. There are some who think the 
only thing to do with the base is to develop it into a commercial airport. 
Those who are supporting this idea do not know what they are talking about. I 
have spent some 30 years in the aviation business as an airport and terminal 
planner for major international airlines. The conversion of El Toro into a 
commercial airport is "not in the cards" due to many reasons, including the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Due to the status of economics among all airlines in today's market, their 
support of rental rates and landing fees for another airport within the close 
vicinity of John Wayne, Long Beach and Ontario would be unlikely. Garden Grove 
and Stanton should support their closest neighboring airport, Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 2. The runway configuration and runway usage would have to be modified to 
satisfy the requirements of commercial aircraft, due to taxiway/ramp weights 
and take-offs and landings. Modifications would require major funding by the 
airlines, FAA and airport commission. Airliners require longer and thicker 
runways than existing at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than attempt to obtain support to convert El Toro to a commercial 
airport, let us look to conversion of El Toro to a more useful and needed 
complex that will not only benefit but enhance the entire county. Please 
consider the following suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Transportation Center: The need for a transportation center in this 
location should justify conversion of some of the site to this function. Nearby 
location of Amtrak, and both interstates 5 and 405 would provide an excellent 
South County transportation interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 2. New Orange County Fairgrounds: The location of the base is a very good 
center for the fairgrounds: Existing aircraft hangers could be reconfigured as 
buildings to house exhibits.  
</P>
<P>
 3. Racetrack: Construction of a horse racetrack, to supplement other southern 
California racetracks.  
</P>
<P>
 4. Construction of a theater of performing arts and amphitheater facilities 
may be a good community addition to this area.  
</P>
<P>
 5. Sports center: A major league sports center could possibly be utilized by 
the Los Angeles Raiders.  
</P>
<P>
 Again, the thought of turning the base over to a commercial airport is totally 
unfounded, since the airline industry is suffering great losses and the 
industry could not support another airport in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 C. ROY MILLER 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 * Here are a few facts about the noise at El Toro from someone who does not 
live in Santa Ana or La Habra, but near the landing approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The base, which most of the time operates under restricted hours, has less 
than 300 landings and takeoffs on the average day. The amount of loud noise has 
been estimated at only 20 minutes per day. Most of the time there is little 
activity on weekends, and the airfield is closed on holidays for two, three or 
four days in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison John Wayne Airport handles about 1,200 arrivals and departures 
each day, and about 240 are commercial carriers subjected to the 10 p.m.-7 a.m. 
curfew. the remaining 960 are part of general aviation and do not have to abide 
by that curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if you think single-engine planes are not noisy, you have not been along 
Newport Boulevard in Costa Mesa. The residents there are getting the bulk of 
that air traffic 24 hours a day; or in Buena Park west of the Fullerton Airport 
-- they are nerve wrecking! 
</P>
<P>
 Sure the Marine jets can be loud at times, and on a one-on-one basis they 
probably are noisier! But the volume and frequency of aircraft generating noise 
at El Toro with a civilian airport will be devastating. NICOLAS G. DZIPINA

SPEED LIMITS' RISE SHOULD TAKE A FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re: "Some Speed Limits To Rise," (March 6): It was quite a shocking and 
disappointing thing to read that speed limits on primarily residential streets 
would soon be dictated by drivers, rather than by prudently established 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 I live on a street in Anaheim that has been posted as 35 m.p.h. for over 30 
years.Our house is within half a block of an elementary school, and the street 
is posted for a weight limit of 6,000 pounds, yet there is only casual traffic 
monitoring of speeds, and no enforcement of the weight limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints to the Anaheim police are brushed aside with the explanation that 
they cannot enforce the posted speeds anywhere in Anaheim because the traffic 
court judges will throw out any citations unless they are 16 m.p.h. over the 
posted speeds. This, according to the police, also applies to school zones.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't really understand the mathematics of the "fair speed" argument in this 
light. During the rush periods on our street, these so-called "prudent" drivers 
would soon push the speed limit to 50 m.p.h., or over. Let's face it: If left 
to decide for themselves, the drivers on our streets today will push to the 
limit of what they can get away with. And what, if we may ask, is "free-flowing 
traffic" meant to imply? Uncontrolled traffic? We do, as normal human beings, 
need to be controlled, and in a realistic manner.

STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; THIS TIME, PACIFICA COMEBACK FALLS SHORT; 
DIVISION III BOYS: MARINERS RALLY IN SECOND HALF, BUT LOSE, 81-61, TO 
SACRAMENTO FOOTHILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacifica, that bully of a boys' basketball team, finally ran into someone who 
wouldn't cry uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners, who wore down and tore down one opponent after another, ran into 
a team they couldn't break Saturday. Sacramento Foothill handled the pressure 
and then manhandled Pacifica, 81-61, to win the State Division III boys' 
championship at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a role reversal the Mariners could have lived without. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kicked and scratched until they got the ball," Mariner Coach Bob Becker 
said. "They kept attacking us. They never let up. They disrupted our offense 
that way. We couldn't do what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what we've been doing to teams all year," Pacifica forward 
Chris Vlasic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Mariners (30-2) had disheveled teams with their 
32-minutes-of-stress style, winning 28 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Their tenacity brought back-to-back comebacks in the Southern California 
Regionals. Pacifica had rallied from 22 points down in the semifinals against 
San Diego St. Augustine and erased an 11-point halftime deficit in the final 
against University of San Diego High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the Mariners set up another sucker punch. Instead, they got 
cold-cocked. 
</P>
<P>
 A Rick Gonzales basket gave Foothill a 42-24 lead 21 seconds into the second 
half. Pacifica then went into its whirlwind mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic scored 17 of his 28 points in the third quarter. Pacifica cut the 
deficit to 55-49 at the buzzer, and Foothill seemed to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 But this wasn't going to be a re-run of previous engagements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners closed to within five, 63-58, with 4 minutes 8 seconds left. It 
was their high-water mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill turned the tables, leaving Pacifica in the dust with an 18-3 stretch 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told our kids we wanted to be within eight at the end of the third 
quarter," Becker said. "We were down by six. We felt we were right where we 
wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
 They stayed there, partly because of Mustang guard Alvin Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, a junior, scored 27 points and seemed to blunt every Pacifica run. He 
scored eight points in the fourth quarter, countering a Mariner basket each 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they scored, Alvin scored right back," Foothill Coach Drew Hibbs said. 
"That's a tremendous psychological lift. But Alvin has been our big-play player 
recently." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, who averages 12 points, scored 26 against San Lorenzo in the Northern 
California Regional final, 14 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a redemption run for Houston, who dribbled the ball off his foot 
in the final seconds of the Mustangs' 61-60 loss to Vacaville in the 
Sac-Joaquin Section final. 
</P>
<P>
 He made nine of 13 shots Saturday, including three of four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every playoff game, we seemed to run into a player with Division I 
capabilities," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners missed their first five shots and turned the ball over five times 
in the first four minutes. They didn't score until Jon Surface sank a 
three-pointer with 3:54 left. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the only points of the first half for Surface, who had the flu. He 
came into the game averaging 15 points but scored only 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston scored 15 in the first half, as the Mustangs led, 40-24. They led 
wire-to-wire, jumping to an 8-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't many teams that can put it together against us for four 
quarters," Vlasic said. "They did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners were unaccustomed to many things Foothill did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs had a 27-12 advantage in rebounding in the first half, including 
a 15-2 edge on the offense boards. They had finished with a 46-34 edge. Mike 
Schanzenbach, playing on a severely sprained ankle, finished with 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it came to playing rabid defense, the Mustangs could foam at the 
mouth with the best of them, including Pacifica. The Mariners had 21 turnovers. 
Foothill had 12 steals, four by reserve Corey Jurgens and three by 
Schanzenbach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were a pressure team," Hibbs said. "We wanted to attack them 
right back." 
</P>
<P>
 A philosophy that Pacifica has lived by and lost by.

KINGS WIN, NO GOALS FOR GRETZKY; PRO HOCKEY: LOS ANGELES STAR'S TWO ASSISTS 
HELP BRING 2-1 VICTORY AND TEAM A BIT CLOSER TO FINAL WESTERN PLAYOFF BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 So what if he missed scoring on a breakaway, and later shot wide of an empty 
net with 12 seconds to play? 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky isn't pursuing only Gordie Howe's all-time goal record of 801. 
San Jose is in front of him, too, and Gretzky isn't about to let the Sharks 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The record will fall, eventually. But catching the Sharks is Gretzky's 
priority, and he helped the Kings take a big step forward with two assists in 
their 2-1 victory over San Jose on Saturday at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring the Kings' first-period goals were Jari Kurri (30th of the season) at 
11:53 and Marty McSorley (sixth) at 19:03. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into today's game at San Jose, the Kings (24-37-10) are within one 
point of the ninth-place Mighty Ducks and five behind the eighth-place Sharks, 
who hold the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky, goal-less for the second consecutive game, has scored once in the 
last seven. It has turned into a crawl toward Howe's record, and Gretzky 
remains at 799 goals, two from tying it and three from breaking it. Saturday, 
he had five shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating when you lose, but to me if I play well, I don't even 
question my play," Gretzky said. "I never doubt myself if I play well. And as 
long as I'm getting into the game and getting chances, it'll happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes 802 so special. Every goal is hard." 
</P>
<P>
 If Gretzky's past means anything, he could score two or three goals today 
against the Sharks. He often performs better when angered by negative press or 
an opposing player. There was an incident with Shark defenseman Jeff Norton 
early in the third period when Gretzky was upset after Norton slashed him. 
Gretzky yelled at Norton and skated up to him and shoved him with his stick 
after the whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in front of the net, and I was just playing him like any other guy," 
Norton said. "I wasn't trying to hurt anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Gretzky shocked his teammates as well as the sellout crowd of 16,005 
when he skated past the Shark bench and yelled at several players in the final 
seconds. "He was yapping, but I was yapping back," said Shark left wing Bob 
Errey. "So I didn't hear what he was saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gretzky: "It was nothing. Both teams are playing with emotion. We're all 
fighting for our lives. Tempers flare. It's part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings claimed they didn't hear what he was saying or why he yelled at the 
Sharks on the bench. "Any team that gets him mad, any time we see him yelling 
at a player or a ref, Cap (Raeder) and I like that," King Coach Barry Melrose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kurri: "It's good to see him get involved. You don't see him react like 
that many times. I wasn't really sure what was going on. They were yapping at 
him. It's not really a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurri was more concerned with the way the Kings played in the second period 
after they had opened with a strong 20 minutes to take a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second period, I don't know what happened," he said. "We seem to stop 
playing. We think we have enough of a lead. We should realize that. We still 
can play much better." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 With the trading deadline at noon on Monday, rumors have been flying about 
almost every King, except Wayne Gretzky and Jari Kurri. Saturday, the Kings 
acquired defenseman Donald Dufresne from the Tampa Bay Lightning for a 
sixth-round draft choice in 1994. Dufresne, 26, is 6 feet 1, 206 pounds and had 
eight points and 48 penalty minutes in 51 games this season. He was a minus two 
on the plus-minus scale. "He's a big kid and you can never have enough 
defensemen," King Coach Barry Melrose said. "It's just some insurance." 
Dufresne is known as a steady, stay-at-home defenseman who doesn't make many 
glaring mistakes. "Donald did a good job for us, but we've got to start looking 
ahead," said Tony Esposito, the Lightning's director of hockey operations. 
"We've got to start making room for our kids and get them up here. It just so 
happened Donald was one of the guys who became expendable." The acquisition 
also gives the Kings room to move one of their other defensemen, if the right 
deal should present itself. . . . The Sharks acquired right wing Ulf Dahlen and 
a future draft choice from the Dallas Stars for defenseman Mike Lalor and Doug 
Zmolek. Dahlen is expected to play today. . . . The Kings' scratches were 
defensemen Doug Houda and Tim Watters and forwards Dave Taylor, Phil Crowe and 
Dave Thomlinson.

MORNING BRIEFING: LIBERTY DANCE ENDED BY BOLT OF CAROLINA BLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Liberty University won the Big South tournament and an NCAA tournament 
bid, folks around Lynchburg, Va., had to look for other sobriquets for the 
event besides "The Big Dance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Baptists don't dance," the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of Liberty in 1971, 
was quick to note. "But we're going to dance this year. By special 
dispensation." 
</P>
<P>
 Falwell brings to mind the Rev. Oral Roberts, who recruited long and hard for 
his school, but Falwell goes Roberts one better. 
</P>
<P>
 He provides entertainment at the Flames' games. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent home-game timeout, Falwell -- captain of the 1956 Springfield 
(Mo.) Baptist College team -- marched to the free-throw line and knocked down 
his shot. Nothing but net. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Brother Falwell swished that, the place just erupted," said one school 
official to Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then," the official confided, "after Brother Falwell made the free throw, 
he went back to the three-point line and shot an airball. I guess he should 
have quit while he was ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a saying at North Carolina, Liberty's first-round opponent: "If God 
isn't a Tar Heel, how come the sky is Carolina blue?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We granted that, temporarily," Falwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe a little longer: North Carolina 71, Liberty 51. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Other than UCLA, how many West Coast schools have won the men's 
NCAA Division I basketball championship? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spirits change sides: The Celtics, once thought to have mystical help at the 
Boston Garden, have found that ghosts can be impish, and they have given a name 
to the one that keeps their shots from going in. Said guard Dee Brown: "The 
Lottery Man is on top of the rim." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? A caller's question the other day seemed to stump KMPC's Bob Rowe: 
Why would baseball hire Sen. George Mitchell (D-Maine) as commissioner? When 
the game needed a lawyer, Bowie Kuhn was the choice. When a marketing man was 
needed, Peter Ueberroth was a natural. When a fan was sought, Bart Giamatti was 
an easy pick. When Giamatti died, Fay Vincent, his friend, simply moved in. Why 
Mitchell? Baseball's greatest fear is the loss of its antitrust exemption 
through Congressional action. Hence, the need for a man in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It worked once: Everybody worries about injuries to key players in spring 
training, but Baltimore General Manager Roland Hemond puts them into 
perspective -- sort of -- from experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was with the (Milwaukee) Braves, we acquired Bobby Thomson 
and he broke his ankle in spring training," Hemond said. "We had to call up a 
kid who wasn't even with us in camp -- a kid named Hank Aaron." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In case you missed it: Stanford had the No. 1 recruiting class in NCAA 
Division I women's volleyball for the third consecutive year in an annual 
ranking by Volleyball magazine. Notre Dame was No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Four: Oregon in 1939, Stanford in 1942, San Francisco in 1955 
and '56, and California in 1959.

SKIING / WORLD CUP AT VAIL, COLO.; FROM 13TH TO FIRST FOR AAMODT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who had considered Alberto Tomba's recent Olympic run to the slalom 
silver the greatest comeback in ski racing now have to give second thought to a 
second run by Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
 Already with nothing left to prove at age 22, Aamodt stole some of the 
historic luster from La Bomba on Saturday, striking from the 13th second-run 
position to steal the giant slalom at the World Cup Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt's second run, 0.52 seconds faster than the field, was enough for a 
two-run winning time of 2:25.62. Christian Mayer of Austria was second, 
Switzerland's Steve Locher third. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for Tomba's feat standing in time. Only three weeks ago at 
Lillehammer, it was Tomba who, from the 12th second-run position, unleashed a 
break-neck second run that vaulted the Italian great to the Olympic silver. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Aamodt who opened the way for Tomba to win the silver. The Norwegian 
had the second-fastest first run, but went off course on his second. 
</P>
<P>
 As Aamodt stood at the start gate before his second run Saturday, 1.14 seconds 
behind the pace-setting time of Sweden's Fredrik Nyberg, he remembered Tomba's 
feat. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I didn't think I'd be able to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What inspires Aamodt is the stuff of legends. He already had clinched the 
men's World Cup overall title and had no real incentive to muster a strike 
after his poor first run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired, I thought it was going to be another bad day," he said. "But 
then I decided to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 As Tomba needed Aamodt to fall in the Olympics, Aamodt needed a fall guy and 
found one in Nyberg, who held a commanding lead after the morning run. 
</P>
<P>
 From the bottom, Aamodt stood and watched his two-run time survive 11 skiers 
before Nyberg, seeded No. 1, broke the gate and posted a time 0.66 faster than 
Aamodt's after the first interval. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Nyberg crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the game," Aamodt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blunder not only cost Nyberg the race, but also the GS World Cup title had 
he won. Instead, Austria's Mayer took the title by default. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his 23rd birthday, Aamodt has claimed five Olympic medals, two World 
championships, three World Cup titles and one overall championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, he added a little myth to his collection. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not nearly the drama in the women's GS, won by Martina Ertl of 
Germany, who defeated Switzerland's Vreni Schneider by 0.38, with Anne Berge of 
Norway taking third. 
</P>
<P>
 The race promised much more. Italy's Deborah Compagnoni was the only skier 
with a chance to catch Austria's Anita Wachter for the GS title. But when 
Compagnoni went off course early in the morning run, it clinched the title for 
Wachter without her having to race. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachter did, and finished fourth in the GS. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider also clinched her second World Cup overall without leaving the gate. 
Her title was secured when Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, the only skier with a 
mathematical chance to catch Schneider, could not make the start because of rib 
injuries suffered in Wednesday's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva Twardokens, the top U.S. skier, was third after the first run, but made a 
costly mistake in the second and fell to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The finish was respectable, given how much time she lost at the top when she 
had to brake to make a gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, I was contemplating whether I should stop," Twardokens said. 
"I felt it was that bad of a mistake. But I'm glad I stayed in." 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Voelker, the other U.S. entry, finished 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Because he qualified based on overall World Cup points, Tommy Moe entered 
Saturday's GS, but went off course in his first run. Paul Casey Puckett, the 
only other American who qualified, finished 17th. . . . Italy's Alberto Tomba 
was just another racer, finishing 14th. He is, however, the favorite in today's 
slalom. . . . Two Americans finished among the top 10 in the final GS 
standings. Heidi Voelker was seventh, Eva Twardokens ninth.

TENNIS; GRAF DROPS FIRST SET, BUT CRUISES TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Steffi Graf's forehand sailed long to end the first set, fans rose with a 
roar as Natalia Zvereva grinned at her moment in the Florida sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the day, however, belonged to the top-ranked Graf, who won, 4-6, 
6-1, 6-2, in Saturday's final at the Lipton Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf lost a set for the first time in her 28 matches this year. But she kept a 
more important streak alive with her 32nd consecutive victory, the 
fourth-longest run of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect to win every match," Graf said. "I know I can do it. I think 
that's what you need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 In the all-American men's final today, Andre Agassi will play top-ranked Pete 
Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf earned $150,000, her 84th title and her third Lipton championship. She 
became the first player since Martina Navratilova in 1990 to win three 
consecutive tournaments, an achievement she found taxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment I'm really tired of tennis," she said. "That's why the last 
couple of days it's been difficult for me to be out there. I'm ready for a 
couple of days off at least." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf looked lethargic in the first set, repeatedly missing service returns and 
passing shots. With Zvereva serving at 5-4, Graf managed to erase four set 
points, but not the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly she was down a set for the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't upset," Graf said. "It just happened." 
</P>
<P>
 With the underdog ahead, the crowd of 13,212 roared for Zvereva, from Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd started expecting me to win or something," Zvereva said. 
</P>
<P>
 The German champion made adjustments, and with a few flicks of her powerful 
forehand, the match turned. Graf broke serve five times in the final two sets 
and won going away.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; TRAVELING JACK MORRIS SEES INDIANS AS LATEST WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 38, the leader among active pitchers in victories, Jack Morris finished the 
1993 season with his career and future in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 He was relegated to a cheer-leading role as the Toronto Blue Jays again won 
the American League pennant and World Series, his 7-12 season ending Sept. 9 
because of a strained elbow ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed by the Blue Jays the day after their triumphant parade in Toronto 
that his services would not be needed in '94, Morris might have retired to his 
10,000-acre grain farm in Montana, but his tenacity is a hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my heart and mind I wasn't content walking away under those conditions," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I have anything more to prove to baseball, but I want to prove 
to myself I can still win. This has been a way of life for me, and the older I 
get the more I appreciate the game and the uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call it pride, but I've put in too much work over too many years to even 
think of walking away after a season of that kind. I just wasn't ready." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 19th professional spring, the uniform is now that of the promising 
Cleveland Indians. The one-time union bellwether in the face of collusion, 
Morris was forced to shop his services at a bargain rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of interest, but all at the major league minimum," he said. 
"No one really wanted to pay any money, though a lot of (clubs) said they were 
honored I called, whatever that means." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris was paid $4.5 million by the Blue Jays last year. He then got a 
$1-million buyout instead of a $5.5-million Toronto salary for '94 and also got 
$576,284.51 in the winter collusion settlement. He will receive a $350,000 
salary if he opens the season on the Indians' roster. Incentives based on 
innings pitched can lift him to a $2.2-million ceiling for 240 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who has pitched a workhorse 240 innings or more in 11 seasons, 
including three of the last four, is on his way to solidifying a rotation 
berth, having allowed only three earned runs in 10 exhibition innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack doesn't have to be a No. 1 for us; he can be a No. 3 or No. 4, but if he 
keeps throwing the way he is, I'm sure a lot of clubs are going to feel they 
missed the boat," said Indian General Manager John Hart, who is also counting 
on 38-year-old Dennis Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris pitched well enough to be the Blue Jays' No. 1 in 1992, going 21-6. He 
pitched well enough to be the hometown Minnesota Twins' No. 1 in 1991, going 
18-12 before dominating the Atlanta Braves as the World Series most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Including his 14th and last season with the Detroit Tigers in 1990, he has 
been with four clubs in the five years of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have preferred not to have done that, but I can't complain," Morris 
said, alluding to his having pitched for three consecutive World Series 
winners, making it four rings in all. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the tepid market, Morris said he would not have joined the Indians 
if he didn't believe they, too, had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been lucky in the past, so maybe I can bring some smiles to the faces of 
people in a different town," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 People? Cleveland will pack them in for a change. The Indians are moving into 
a new stadium and expect to draw 3 million or more, a stimulant in a season in 
which they are also moving into the American League's new Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, however, said that realignment wasn't the reason he combed the 
free-agent market, signing Martinez, Eddie Murray and the comparatively 
low-priced Morris among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We developed the core of the club and felt it was ready to take the next 
step, ready for a breakthrough," he said. "We would have taken these steps at 
this stage no matter what division we were in." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray joins an offense that includes Albert Belle, Carlos Baerga and Kenny 
Lofton. Morris calls it a reassuring prospect and said he is reassured, as 
well, by the stability of his elbow, having built up the involved muscles to 
take the load off the ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I said it was perfect or what it was 10 years ago," he said. 
"I've delivered a lot of pitches with it. Some days I can feel it more than 
others, but I think I can still win with it if I stay within myself and hit 
spots. I've learned to live with what I've got. I feel fine, really." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the September ligament strain -- "It might have happened the 
day before or a year before or maybe even 10 years before" -- Morris got off to 
a 1-3 start and went on the disabled list in May with shoulder tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said, the most troubling aspect of that 7-12 season was his 
inability to summon the emotional involvement, the fire that has distinguished 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the hows or whys," he said. "Maybe I just never recovered from 
the ('92) World Series, maybe never gave myself a chance to sit back and 
unwind, but I went into last season mentally fatigued and never really 
rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that if I was going to come back and contribute this year, I'd have to 
find the drive and desire again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I have to be a kid again, but I'm going to have to show 
emotion because I know I can control it and it's the way I pitch best." 
</P>
<P>
 With 244 victories -- he is second among active pitchers in strikeouts, third 
in innings and fourth in shutouts -- Morris said he would like to win 300.

 "But I don't know if it's possible," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fortunate for every one of the 244, and I'm at a point where I have to 
take them one at a time. I've pitched well over the years, but I've also had a 
lot of help over the years and I don't know if I've said that often enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Humility springs from many wells. Toronto was still cleaning up from the 
celebration when Morris was told by club President Paul Beeston that the team 
appreciated his contributions but wouldn't employ him in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can handle honesty like that," Morris said. "It's the other games clubs 
play that can tend to leave you bitter."  
</P>
<P>
 Morris will eventually retire to the farm, although he isn't sure he wants to 
spend the rest of his life raising grain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ends for all of us at some point," he said. "Sometimes it's sad, sometimes 
it's pure. As long as I got the opportunity to pitch, I wasn't ready to face 
it."

 Tuesday is the first anniversary of the boat accident in which Tim Crews and 
Steve Olin of the Indians were killed and then-teammate Bob Ojeda was seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Flags at the Indians' training base will fly at half staff, but the team has 
removed the commemorative patch from its uniform and there will be no moment of 
silence or other acknowledgment of the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a human story beyond a baseball story, and everybody remembers in their 
own way," Hart said. "We have a lot of new people in camp and the mood is 
upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year there was no script and it was very painful. We're proud of the 
widows, they'll always be part of our family, but there comes a time as an 
organization and as individuals when you have to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojeda, who had difficulty coping with his anguish last year and pitched only 
nine innings, has moved on to the New York Yankees and seems likely to win a 
job. He said his world is different than it was before the accident and will 
always be different, but he has returned to baseball because it's important 
"having somewhere to go and something to do that I enjoy doing and I believe in 
doing."

 The Kansas City Royals have started 1-16 and 5-10 the last two seasons. A 
similar start in the new American League Central would probably cost Manager 
Hal McRae his job in favor of coach Steve Boros. 
</P>
<P>
 McRae, asked if he has changed the Royals' format as a precaution against 
another slow start, said, "Guys are playing longer and getting more (at-bats) 
-- or as Vince (Coleman) calls it, going a hard nine." 
</P>
<P>
 Through 14 exhibitions, for example, McRae's son, Brian, had already played 
nine innings five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't scoring runs," McRae said of the staggering starts of '92 and '93. 
"I don't know if we weren't ready, but the pitchers were more ready than the 
hitters were, and the only way to catch up is with more ABs." 
</P>

<P>
 The Blue Jays insist they aren't interested in Ron Gant, and the Boston Red 
Sox say they are, and Gant, obviously thinking of that left field wall at 
Fenway Park, has twice called former Atlanta Brave teammate Otis Nixon, now 
with the Red Sox, to say he would love to join him in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto may be playing it coy with Gant as a bargaining ploy. Left field 
prospect Rob Butler is having such a poor spring that the Blue Jays have 
experimented with catcher Carlos Delgado and first baseman Domingo Martinez in 
left. Nevertheless, the more pressing Toronto need is pitching, a condition 
complicated by the shoulder tendinitis that could sideline relief ace Duane 
Ward through April.

 Briefly: Ex-Dodger Mike Scioscia, who missed the 1993 season because of a torn 
rotator cuff, was invited to the Texas Rangers' camp as a backup and mentor for 
Ivan Rodriguez, but Scioscia continues to have problems throwing, and the 
Rangers are looking at Boston's expendable Bob Melvin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Baltimore Orioles gave Sid Fernandez a three-year, $9-million contract 
as part of their free-agent spending spree, ignoring the fact that an 
oft-injured Fernandez made only 58 starts in his last three years with the New 
York Mets. Fernandez, like Ward, is now sidelined indefinitely because of 
tendinitis. Manager John Oates, despite the addition of Rafael Palmeiro and 
Chris Sabo, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest concern is a lack of pitching depth. Our horses have to take the 
ball on a regular turn. We can't lose Sid or any of our other starters (Mike 
Mussina, Ben McDonald and Jamie Moyer) for an extended period." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the trade that sent erratic Mitch Williams to the Houston Astros for 
finesse and control specialist Doug Jones, Philadelphia Phillie Manager Jim 
Fregosi says: "We've gone from the wild thing to the mild thing. The one guy 
throws all balls and this guy throws all strikes. Whatever happens, it's going 
to happen a lot quicker, and that in itself is a plus."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WALLACH FUELS HOME RUN PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers lead the National League in home runs this spring, and Saturday's 
9-5 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals showed no signs of a slow down. Tim 
Wallach, Raul Mondesi, Mitch Webster and Billy Ashley each homered, giving the 
Dodgers 25 home runs in 16 games. The team hit 26 homers in 30 games last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach is batting .308 with two home runs in 14 games. Since 1990, when he 
batted .296 with 21 home runs, Wallach has batted worse than .225 and hit no 
more than 13 homers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dodgers acquired Wallach before the 1993 season, they hoped he would 
hit at least 15 homers and drive in 80 runs. He might have accomplished that 
had he not suffered a broken rib, ending the season with 12 homers and 62 runs 
batted in. But at 36 and in the last year of his contract, Wallach isn't 
satisfied with those numbers. He spent most of the winter in the batting cage 
at Dodger Stadium working with hitting instructor Reggie Smith, and takes extra 
hitting daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contract doesn't drive me to play; it isn't the money. I want to get to a 
World Series," Wallach said. "Realistically, this could be my last season . . . 
getting there is the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell pitched a perfect eighth inning to earn the victory. Worrell has 
given up only two hits in five innings and has not been scored upon in five 
appearances. He said he has no problems with his arm and will be ready to go 
when the season starts. Left-hander Gary Wayne gave up one hit in the ninth and 
earned the save. He is unscored upon in nine innings and seven games, and is 
moving closer to securing a spot in the bullpen. . . . Carlos Hernandez hit a 
two-run double to break a 3-3 tie in the seventh inning and singled in the 
ninth. . . . Orel Hershiser gave up two earned runs in six innings and struck 
out five. 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Snyder returned to Los Angeles to have his sore back examined. Snyder, 
who has been sidelined most of the spring because of a pulled muscle in his 
side, suffered the back injury while taking ground balls. . . . Darren Dreifort 
update: In four appearances and seven innings, Dreifort has a 1-0 record with a 
2.57 earned-run average and two saves. Fred Claire, executive vice president, 
has also noted that Dreifort's sinker is effective against left-handers, 
increasing his already good chances to make the club. . . . Kevin Gross will 
pitch in his first A game today when he faces Bret Saberhagen and the New York 
Mets at Vero Beach. MARYANN HUDSON

NBA ROUNDUP; HEAT'S FANS GO ALONG FOR A RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having the best record in the NBA since the All-Star break offers a bandwagon, 
and there's nothing a star would rather ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna was missing, but Ray Floyd, Andre Agassi and Brad Gilbert were there 
Saturday night to see the Heat win its fourth game in a row and 12th in 14 
tries, 106-95, over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders was around to argue about his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Heat is Prime Time," said Glen Rice, who scored 33 points on 13-of-17 
shooting. "It gives us added incentive to play that hard with these superstars 
coming out to watch us." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Shaw, reportedly Madonna's favorite, doled out a season-high 15 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been more hype lately for so many reasons," Shaw said. "We're 
starting to play better at home and are 10 games over .500 for the first time. 
Everybody's expecting us to win now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland is on a five-game losing streak and played without injured starters 
Brad Daugherty, Larry Nance and Mark Price, as well as reserves Tyrone Hill and 
John Battle. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 107, Sacramento 100 -- David Robinson scored 48 points and grabbed 
16 rebounds to lead the Spurs at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs' Dale Ellis made the 1,000th three-pointer of his career. Ellis is 
the first player in basketball history with 1,000 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 105, New Jersey 93 -- Dan Majerle scored 14 of his 22 points in the 
third quarter, helping the Suns hold a double-digit lead throughout the second 
half at Phoenix as they snapped a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 116, Dallas 107 -- Latrell Sprewell scored 24 points and three 
teammates added 20 or more at Dallas, helping the Golden State Warriors snap a 
seven-game road losing streak and hand the Mavericks their 11th loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 107, Utah 103 -- Rik Smits made two free throws to break a 101-101 tie 
with 34 seconds to play, lifting the Pacers to a victory at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers took a 15-point lead into the fourth quarter and led by 18 with 
9:29 to play. The Jazz rallied behind Karl Malone, who scored 16 of his 
season-high 37 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 106, Detroit 88 -- Reserve Mario Elie hit all nine of his shots and 
pulled down a career-high 15 rebounds at Houston to lead the Rockets past the 
Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets won their fourth in a row and snapped a three-game Detroit winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 105, Boston 91 -- Patrick Ewing scored 35 points and had 14 rebounds 
and the Knicks won at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 New York held Boston scoreless for the first 6:46 of the fourth quarter and 
shares the NBA post-shot clock record streak of holding the opposition under 90 
points with the 1954-55 Syracuse Nationals -- eight games.

STATE HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; DIVISION III GIRLS; A RECORD FOURTH 
IN A ROW FOR BREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Behind the play of senior point guard Nicole Erickson, Brea-Olinda won a 
record fourth-consecutive CIF State championship Saturday at Oakland Coliseum 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda, making a record sixth consecutive appearance in a State title 
game, defeated San Jose Archbishop Mitty, 54-44, in the Division III final. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Ladycats their fifth championship overall, breaking the 
record of four titles, which they shared with Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, who will attend Purdue, scored 16 points and broke Mitty's pressure 
defense. Afterward, Erickson tried to convey her emotion at having won four 
consecutive titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our last game together, so it's hard," Erickson said and then burst 
into tears. "This is the end of a piece of our lives that we'll never have back 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda might not continue its dominating ways because three key starters 
have finished their eligibility -- Erickson, 6-foot-2 center Colleen Hudson and 
forward Sarah Beckley. 
</P>
<P>
 But what a way to end an era. 
</P>
<P>
 During a postgame news conference, it was announced that USA Today's No. 
1-ranked team, Ohio Pinkerington (27-1), lost in the final of the Ohio State 
Division I championship, 59-54, to Garfield Heights Trinity (25-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Second-ranked Brea-Olinda probably will take over the top spot in the final 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 "This season is just a dream, it's an absolute dream" said first year-coach 
John Hattrup, noting that former coach Mark Trakh, now the Pepperdine women's 
coach, deserves much of the credit for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He built the house, I'm just renting," Hattrup said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hattrup did a good job keeping the house standing. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the Ladycats improved to 33-0 and extended their winning 
streak to 54 games. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the final, the Ladycats did not find their rhythm offensively until the 
second quarter. Sparked by four points each from Erickson, Hudson and Beckley, 
they outscored Mitty, 12-6, over the first 4:15 of the quarter to take a 23-18 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitty cut its deficit to two with 1:49 to play in the half, but that was as 
close as it got. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerri Walsh had a game-high 18 points and 13 rebounds for Mitty (30-3).

STATE HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; DIVISION III BOYS; THIS TIME, 
PACIFICA'S PLAN DOES NOT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Garden Grove Pacifica High basketball team was accustomed to coming from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 It overcame large deficits in its last two State tournament games to win and 
earn a berth in the Division III championship against Sacramento Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Mariners found themselves behind by 21 points in the third quarter 
of Saturday's title game, they did not panic. They were used to the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill had other ideas, however, as it also stepped up its game down the 
stretch on its way to an 81-61 victory at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Pacifica saved its best for the end of the game," said Drew Hibbs, 
Foothill's coach. "We heard they came from behind in the regionals, so when 
they started to make a run for us we were ready. We didn't stand there and take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (30-2) trailed San Diego St. Augustine by 22 in the second half of a 
Southern Regional semifinal before winning, 65-62. In their 60-55 victory over 
San Diego University in the regional final last Saturday, the Mariners were 11 
points behind at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 After Foothill jumped out to a 40-24 lead at intermission, Pacifica Coach Bob 
Becker figured his team had the Mustangs right where it wanted them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't panic at halftime," said Becker, who coached the girls' basketball 
team at Garden Grove Rancho Alamitos last year. "I told the kids we had been in 
this situation before, and I figured we could wear them down in the second 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Becker shuffled his lineup throughout the game, Foothill did not wear 
down. When the Mariners got to within 63-58 midway through the fourth quarter, 
the Mustangs went on a 6-0 run to regain control. 
</P>
<P>
 Hibbs went to his bench sparingly, but his starters got the job done. Alvin 
Houston had several big plays and finished with a team-high 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston had plenty of help. Rick Gonzales and Mike Pelton had 18 and 15 
points, respectively. Mike Schanzenback finished with a game-high 13 rebounds, 
as the the Mustangs controlled the boards, 46-34. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pacifica, making its first appearance in the State tournament, had its 
chances in the second half. Forward Chris Vlasic scored 17 of high game-high 28 
points in the third quarter as the Mariners closed the gap to 55-49. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaimi Besho's two free throws with four minutes remaining pulled Pacifica to 
within five, 63-58. Foothill then committed a turnover, but forward Ramon 
Alliman missed an easy dunk on a breakaway play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs took advantage of the miscue. Houston promptly made a three-point 
play to change the momentum and thwart the comeback.

STATE HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; DIVISION I GIRLS; SACRED HEART PREP 
ISN'T BOTHERED BY LYNWOOD 
</P>

 Lynwood High apparently thought it could push around the new kids on the block 
in the State Division I girls' basketball championship Saturday night at the 
Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But Atherton Sacred Heart Prep pushed back, defeating the Knights, 59-53. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood was the defending Division I champion. Sacred Heart, which won the 
Division V title last year, was playing its first season in the top division. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was nice," Coach Mike Ciardella said of the Gators' Division V 
championship, "but there is no comparison. This is real nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred Heart has a student enrollment of 288, making it the smallest school 
ever to win a Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But it certainly didn't play like a small school. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Renee Robinson made two driving layups to open the third quarter and 
spark the Gators' on a 14-9 run. They took a 38-34 lead into the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynwood didn't give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we could beat this team," said Tawana Grimes, a senior guard. "I 
always felt we could come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis Felts scored eight points during a 13-4 run midway through the fourth 
quarter to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "She put us on her back and carried us," Ciardella said of Felts. 
</P>
<P>
 Felts, a senior guard, had a game-high 26 points, including 12 of 13 free 
throws. Jennifer Circle, a 6-foot-3 junior center, had 18 points and nine 
rebounds for the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood (32-2) was hindered by early foul trouble. Timicha Kirby, the Knights' 
leading scorer, picked up two fouls in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beat ourselves," Coach Ellis Barfield said. "Sacred Heart didn't beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby, who finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds, made only one of seven 
three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred Heart ended its season 38-0, setting a state record for victories in a 
season. Sacred Heart set the previous record last season when it finished 37-0.

 Ripon Christian High of the Sac-Joaquin Section won a record third State 
Division V boys' basketball title with a 60-46 victory over Pacific Hills 
Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (35-1) also won titles in 1988 and '92.Pacific Hills, previously 
known as Bel-Air Prep, also finished as the Division V runner-up in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripon Christian led from start to finish, building a 33-21 halftime margin. 
Forward Phil Mensonides had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Hills (24-9) shot 27% from the field. Forward Danny Brummel led the 
Bruins with 14 points. Forward Bryan Sterling had a game-high 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripon Christian 62, El Cajon Christian 46 -- Jenny Miller scored 18 points to 
lead the Knights to the State Division V girls' championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripon Christian (31-5) went on a 9-0 run in the final 1:25 of the third 
quarter to take a 47-38 lead. The Patriots (28-5) never got closer than seven 
points in the fourth quarter. ERIC SHEPARD and WENDY WITHERSPOON

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; THIS SWEDISH STAR IS PROVING SHE BELONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first victory on any of the professional golf tours is an occasion to 
remember, but when it is a major, it is something special. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Alfredsson, the Swedish golfer who is a graduate of US International in 
San Diego, is not likely to forget her first LPGA victory. It was in last 
year's Nabisco Dinah Shore, one of the most important tournaments in women's 
golf. It was also the last time that Dinah Shore was there to present the 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought I could win on the LPGA, but you never really know until you 
finally do it," said Alfredsson, who will defend her championship in the 
72-hole $700,000 event beginning Thursday at Mission Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always pictured myself winning a tournament, but it didn't happen the way I 
thought. I dreamed of walking up to the 18th green to the cheers of the crowd. 
Instead there I was on the 18th fairway last year unable to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too focused on trying to hold onto my lead. I had to worry about Betsy 
(King) making a birdie, or me hitting one into the water. It wasn't until later 
I could even think about how it felt to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson bogeyed the last hole, but still won by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golf is a bit different than most sports," Alfredsson said. "No matter how 
well you play, it doesn't necessarily mean you will win. You don't have control 
over the other players. The best I ever shot was a 63. If I do that and 
somebody comes along with a 62, I did my best, but I still lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson wasn't always sure she wanted to be a professional golfer. She 
accepted a scholarship at USIU in 1983 partly to find out. She had already won 
three Swedish national championships before enrolling in college. She received 
a degree in international business in 1988. When she and two others from Sweden 
were second in the World Amateur Team Championships shortly after graduation, 
she decided pro golf was for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she won tournaments in several countries in international 
competition, her career on the U.S. tour didn't begin until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1989 I made it through the first round of qualifying and had paid all my 
fees for the final rounds at Sweetwater, Tex.," she said. "Then, I did a stupid 
thing. I forgot to sign the registration card. I was on the putting green when 
someone asked me if I was the only one from Sweden trying to qualify. She added 
that if I was, I failed to register. It was too late and I was out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was only 17th in qualifying school in 1991, she quickly proved 
she belonged on the LPGA tour. She didn't win a tournament, but she lost in 
Japan to Betsy King on the fourth playoff hole, finished third in another event 
and earned $262,115 in 24 tournaments. She won the Itoki Classic in Japan after 
the official season was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have put too much pressure on myself because I wanted to prove I could 
win here," Alfredsson said. "There were so many things that made it special. 
The Dinah Shore is just about the most prestigious tournament. And it was not 
too far from San Diego, where I have so many friends. And, of course, I finally 
beat Betsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson is hard on herself and when she does "something stupid," she curses 
in Swedish so that few spectators can understand her. Usually. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in this country so much of the time that when I get upset with 
myself, English words slip out and everybody knows what I said. I have to be 
more careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson returned to Sweden last November and thinks she went too soon. She 
lives in La Canada and was home on Jan. 17 when the earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an experience," she said. "We shook quite a bit and dishes and glasses 
were shattered. It was a weird feeling later that morning when I went out to 
get the mail. It was a warm, beautiful day and yet, you knew half of Los 
Angeles was in turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the Dinah Shore brings out the top golfers. Among those who will 
make it difficult for Alfredsson to repeat are Donna Andrews, who won last 
week's LPGA tournament at Tucson, young Southern California star Brandie 
Burton, King, Patty Sheehan and Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got off to a slow start this season, but I'm coming around," Alfredsson 
said after finishing 69-68 in the last two rounds at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished last year No. 5 in money with $402,665. Her only victory was in 
the Dinah Shore, but she tied for second in the U.S. Open and had nine top-10 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Four golfers who made it through the first round at Whispering Lakes in 
Ontario will compete in the National Long Drive Contest at Whispering Lakes on 
Friday and Saturday. They are Chris Kitlinger of Laguna Niguel, Bob Strege of 
Henderson, Nev., Paul Mercado of Upland, and Mike O'Mara of Mira Loma. 
Kitlinger's best drive was 359 yards 1 foot. . . . The PGA Tour said that a 
team event similar to the Ryder Cup, but involving the U.S. and the rest of the 
world except Europe, could be held this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The ninth annual Servite Open, a co-ed tournament, will be held at SeaCliff 
Country Club Monday, April 11. . . . The 44th annual Boys and Girls City junior 
golf tournaments will be played March 26-28 at Wilson, Harding and Roosevelt 
courses in Griffith Park. . . . The fifth annual White Memorial Medical Center 
golf classic will be held March 28 at Friendly Hills Country Club in Whittier.

GOLF ROUNDUP; SINGH USES PUTTER TO TAKE LEAD 
</P>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vijay Singh turned a hot putting streak into a four-under-par 68 and a 
one-stroke lead Saturday in the third round of the Nestle Invitational at 
Orlando, Fla.. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like the way I started, but I got the putter going later," the 
native of the Fiji Islands said after completing three rounds over Arnold 
Palmer's Bay Hill Club in 205, 11-under par. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine others led or shared the lead before Singh took control with three 
consecutive birdies beginning with a 25-foot putt on the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of them are still within three strokes of the lead going into today's 
final round. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh's primary challengers are Nick Price, Tom Watson and Andrew Magee, who 
are tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, trying to break a seven-season non-winning string, shot a 67. Price, 
who last week scored his 12th worldwide victory in 18 months, shot 68 despite a 
double bogey. Magee had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh, 31, played four seasons in Europe before starting his American tour 
career with a runner-up finish in this tournament a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to a victory in the Buick Classic in suburban New York and won 
rookie-of-the-year honors with $657,831 in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Davies shot a seven-under-par 66 to pass eight players and take the 
third-round lead at the Standard Register Ping tournament at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 On a course suited to power -- the 6,483-yard Moon Valley Country Club is the 
longest on the LPGA tour -- Davies used a deft short game to save par and 
maintain a one-shot lead over Elaine Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in a threesome with Davies and Val Skinner, Crosby also shot 66. She 
started a shot behind and wound up with a 54-hole total of 208.

 Crenshaw won its second State Division I title in a row with an 89-79 victory 
over Carmichael Jesuit in front of 11,564 Saturday night at the Oakland 
Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (29-2) also defeated Jesuit in the championship game last year, 
73-66. 
</P>
<P>
 The title was the sixth in the last 12 years for Coach Willie West, a state 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "'We had a tough schedule," West said. "Much tougher than last year, and we 
still prevailed." 
</P>
<P>
 The heroes were numerous for Crenshaw. Kristaan Johnson, a transfer from Van 
Nuys Montclair Prep, scored 15 of his 27 points in the first quarter and added 
seven rebounds. Tommie Davis, who transferred last summer from Fremont, set a 
Division I record with 14 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremaine Fowlkes, a transfer from Culver City, finished with a game-high 30 
points and eight rebounds. He cited added motivation with California Coach Todd 
Bozeman sitting courtside. Fowlkes will attend Cal in the fall. ERIC SHEPARD

HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING / SEASON PREVIEW; CRESCENTA VALLEY'S JENKINS PUTS FOCUS ON 
THE FAST LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In less than two weeks, John Jenkins will know if he made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-8 senior passed up a chance to be a starter on this season's 
Crescenta Valley High basketball team, choosing instead to train full-time as a 
swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision seemed like a no-brainer for someone who might one day swim in 
the Olympics and could become the fastest high school sprinter in U.S. history. 
But when the Falcons made an improbable run to the Southern Section Division 
I-AA basketball final, Jenkins began to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't go to any of the games, there is no way I could have sat through 
them," he said. "I really didn't know if I'd made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll have a better idea after the U.S. National Championships in Seattle, 
which begin March 30. He's not expecting to win, but if he swims well, 
basketball will disappear in the wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to place but I just want to see how much I've improved," Jenkins 
said. "I've been concentrating on this for months." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Jenkins' performance in the 50 and 100 freestyle events and on 
two relay teams led Crescenta Valley to the Division II title. Jenkins set a 
Southern Section record in the 50-yard freestyle in the Division II 
championships with a time of 20.53 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 With several returning swimmers, the Falcons are ready for another run. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Jenkins is training hard for the championships with his Industry 
Hills club team, he's shown his commitment to Crescenta Valley by swimming in 
several nonleague meets. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning from the National Championships, Jenkins will split his 
practice time with his teammates at Crescenta Valley and the club team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was younger, like maybe 9 or 10, he was a full-time swimmer," 
Industry Hills Coach Mike Gautreau said. "But when he reached about 13, like a 
lot of kids, he became a little burned out. But he's got all the tools. He just 
realized that last year after he won." 
</P>
<P>
 The early results justify Gautreau's optimism. In a meet last week, Jenkins 
timed 21.0 seconds in the 50 freestyle unshaved and unrested. A year ago, 
Jenkins didn't achieve that time until the end of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins is pursuing the national high school record in the 50 freestyle. Joe 
Hudopohl of Cincinnati, an Olympian in 1992 while still in high school, swam 
20.01. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he were to break 20 seconds it would be phenomenal," Gautreau said of 
Jenkins. "It would mean he was better than any sprinter at this age in the best 
country for sprinters in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Jenkins fails to break the record, Crescenta Valley Coach John 
Loporchio doesn't want the disappointment to tarnish the rest of Jenkins' 
senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got a good perspective about what he needs to do," Loporchio 
said. "Just because he's set standards already, he shouldn't be considered a 
failure at all if he doesn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 With almost a full year of continuous training behind him, Jenkins feels more 
comfortable and confident in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last year, his height actually was a disadvantage. Because the 50 
freestyle is a short race, his long reach and stroke were neutralized. Lately, 
he has focused on improving his start and turns. 
</P>
<P>
 "My start by far is the biggest improvement," Jenkins said. "I always felt my 
best race was the 100 since it's longer and my start wasn't as strong. Now I 
feel at home as soon as I hit the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins' sprinting potential has attracted interest from some of the nation's 
top programs, including Arizona, Texas and Washington. But Jenkins is waiting 
on the future of the endangered UCLA swimming program before deciding. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he continues to train hard and gets with the right college coach who knows 
how to deal with sprinters, he could be in the Olympics by 1996," Gautreau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, Jenkins will know for sure he chose correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only going to play one more year (of basketball) anyway," Jenkins said. 
"If I do well with swimming, it will take me a lot further." Teams to Watch 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley -- Jenkins leads one of the top boys' teams in the area. The 
defending Pacific League champion loses backstroke specialist Troy Nickell but 
has several talented freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinter Jeff Robb and sophomore Joey Bennett (100 backstroke, 100 butterfly 
and 200 Individual Medley) already have qualified for the Southern Section 
championships. Steve Kim (200 IM, 100 breaststroke) and Even Robb (100 
backstroke) are the top newcomers as the Falcons look to increase the gap 
between themselves and second-place Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake -- The Wolverines, led by senior Alexis Larsen, will make a 
run at the Division III girls' championship and are a heavy Mission League 
favorite. Larsen, who has signed with USC, was a Southern Section champion in 
the 200 IM and 500 freestyle last year as the Wolverines finished second behind 
San Luis Obispo.  
</P>
<P>
 "It already brings tears to my eyes to think this is her senior year," Coach 
Darlene Bible said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen will be joined by talented sophomores Helicia Paz (100 butterfly, 500 
freestyle), Kristen Olsen (100 backstroke, 100 breaststroke, 50 freestyle) and 
Emily Dashiell (100 backstroke 100 freestyle). Two divers, sophomores Colleen 
Gildea and Vy Vy Burt, a converted gymnast, are probable qualifiers for Section 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena -- Coach Jon Siman thinks the girls' team is poised to reclaim the 
Division I team championship won by the Bulldogs in 1992. A veteran team is led 
by seniors Abby Gustafson, Mandy Walz and Danielle Walker. Gustafson (50 
freestyle) and Walz (100 backstroke) won Southern Section championships in 
1992. They are joined by one of the top freshmen in the nation, Rebecca Gilman 
(500 freestyle). 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' team isn't as strong but should compete with Dos Pueblos and Santa 
Barbara for the Channel League title. Senior John Lorry (500 freestyle) and 
juniors Clay Flocco (100 butterfly, 200 freestyle) and Robbie Williams (500 
freestyle, 100 butterfly) lead the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks -- A group of four seniors will try to lead the Lancers to their 
13th consecutive boys' Marmonte League title. Michael Melzer (backstroke), 
Daniel Burbach (breaststroke), Corey McFarlin (butterfly) and David Kung 
(freestyle) provide a formidable medley relay team. Sophomore Benj Phall 
finished ninth in the Division I diving championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Gemberling hopes to at least duplicate last year's 11th place 
finish in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' team is hurt by the graduation of Valery Calkins, who won two 
events in the Division I championships last year. Calkins now swims at South 
Carolina. Junior Shaina Christensen and senior Amy Capella will keep the 
Lancers in the upper half of the league. Junior Dory Apgar was a section 
qualifier in diving. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart -- The Indians haven't lost a Foothill League girls' dual meet since 
rejoining the league in 1982. The streak should continue because Coach Steve 
Neale has a strong sophomore class. Becky Skyler has already qualified for the 
Southern Section championships in three events (100 butterfly, 50 freestyle and 
100 backstroke) and Erin Walsh in two events (100 breaststroke and 200 IM). 
Kelly Velentine (freestyle) and Lauren Prelle (butterfly) are other top 
sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 The depth will help offset the loss of All-American Lindsey Gassner, who 
placed second in the 50 and 100 freestyle in the section championships last 
year. Gassner, a senior, moved to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus -- The boys' team should repeat as Foothill League champion. Todd 
Pierce (50, 100 freestyle), Jason Adamek (backstroke) and Bill Jones (50, 100 
freestyle) form the nucleus of a experienced team. Freshmen, Ryan Hyfield 
(butterfly, 500 freestyle) and Troy Wheply (100 butterfly, 100 backstroke) will 
help the Centurions. 
</P>
<P>
 A deep girls' team should keep Saugus in second place behind Hart. Sophomore 
Katrina Reynoso is a returning section qualifier in the 200 individual medley. 
Caroline Hardbarger and Suzanna Maness also are talented sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake -- The boys' and girls' teams both should contend in the Marmonte 
League. Sophomore Jennifer Vanderbrook and junior Rachel Mandich lead the 
girls' team. Sophomore Nicholas LeClerc and seniors Nick O'Hare and David Block 
are top swimmers for the boys' team. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura -- Sophomore Erin Schatz (200 IM, 100 backstroke) leads a girls' team 
which has as good a chance as any to win the Marmonte League. Senior Christine 
DiSpaltro (200 freestyle, 500 freestyle), Dorian Reese (200 IM 100 butterfly) 
and Krista Hanson (100 breaststroke) are top performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' team doesn't have the depth to win the league title but with three 
strong swimmers, Harvey Wilford (200 IM, 100 butterfly), Chris Zendejas (200 
IM, 100 breaststroke) and Jason Reese (200 IM, 500 freestyle), the Chargers 
should finish in the top half of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal -- With a strong crop of freshmen girls combined with several returning 
swimmers, the Highlanders have a chance to win their first outright Marmonte 
League title since 1982.  
</P>
<P>
 Junior Erika Salazar was a Division I finalist in the 100 butterfly and is 
helped by seniors Sara Landre (freestyle), Jenny Treglown (distance freestyle) 
and Heather Weis (diving and sprint freestyle).  
</P>
<P>
 The freshmen are headed by Courtney Duncan, the fourth Duncan to swim at 
Royal. Stacie and Marten Duncan went on to swim at Harvard and Ryan Duncan is 
swimming at Cal. "Courtney's got the potential to be the best," Coach Steve 
Snyder said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jamie McIntire and Amanda Whipple are other top freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills -- The Highlanders lost one of the nation's top swimmers -- 
Kristine Quance, now at USC -- but sisters Keri (senior) and Julie (junior) 
Quance are back to try to improve on last year's third-place finish in the City 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Erin Shaw joined the Quance sisters to set a City record in the 200 
medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham -- The defending boys' City champion is the favorite in the West 
Valley League and should contend for the City title again. Chris Cristales, 
second in the City in the 200 freestyle, will lead several strong swimmers. 
Gretchen Ballard set City records in the 50 and 100 freestyle last year. The 
newest addition is diver Aruz Gyulbdikian, a potential Olympian from Armenia 
spending her second year in the United States.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / JEFF FLETCHER; SOME CUTS TO CLEAR THE BASES

<P>
 Remind me not to apply for a job that has any connection with the Burbank 
Unified School District trustees. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The story about Jim Parque, Crescenta Valley's 5-foot-8 left-handed pitcher, 
is that when he pitched as a freshman, he was so short the No. 1 on the back of 
his jersey was partially tucked into his pants. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Want to meet a baseball scout? Be at Thousand Oaks High's field A at 3 p.m. 
March 29. El Camino Real and Quartz Hill are scheduled to meet in the Thousand 
Oaks tournament, and that could mean a matchup of Conquistadore left-hander 
Randy Wolf and Rebel right-hander Roger Worley, perhaps the top two pitching 
prospects in the area. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be fooled by Monroe right-hander Joel Zamudio's 0-2 start. A scout who 
saw him pitch Tuesday said his fastball was consistently about 85 m.p.h. -- on 
the slow gun. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be fooled by Newbury Park right-hander Keith Smith's 3-0 start either. 
Although he's a great athlete, he probably doesn't throw hard enough to warrant 
the size of bonus that it would take for professional baseball to pry him from 
his football scholarship at Arizona. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Royal baseball Coach Dan Maye loves the fact that Simi Valley's lineup is not 
as dangerous as last year's for two reasons: Obviously, it makes the Pioneers 
more beatable. But besides that, Royal follows Simi Valley in Marmonte League 
scheduling. Last year many teams conceded victories to the Pioneers and saved 
their No. 1 starters for Royal, Maye said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa's Sarah Nichals is one of the top freestyle distance swimmers in the 
nation. But she won't be in he Southern Section championships in May. She'll be 
in France with the junior national team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Want to get an idea of how high Camarillo track star Jeremy Fischer can jump? 
Next time you walk though a standard door, just imagine Fischer jumping over 
it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Crescenta Valley shortstop Kirk Hagge has passed his Scholastic 
Aptitude Test, look for him to sign with Cal State Fullerton, Pacific, 
Pepperdine or Miami. Then look for him to be drafted. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Dave Corleto, who lives in Encino, and infielder Dave Forst, who lives 
in Sherman Oaks, are two of the best high school baseball players you won't 
read much about in the Valley because they play for Brentwood. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hueneme Coach Reg Welker, who is down to 11 varsity baseball players, has 
received only two responses from his plea for players in the school bulletin, 
and both of them turned out to be academically ineligible. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Taft beat Fairfax, 55-1, in softball. A mercy rule in City Section softball 
would make too much sense, thus being totally out of character for the section. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands baseball Coach Al Tarazon, on taking his team to Arizona for a 
tournament: "It's going to be the first time out of the state for some of these 
guys. Heck, first time out of the county.". . . 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet Bell-Jeff baseball Coach Craig Sherwood, who works the graveyard 
shift in a market, wasn't thrilled with his game scheduled for 8:30 a.m. 
Saturday in the L.A. Baptist tournament. Then he woke up to learn the game was 
rained out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo sophomore Tyson Montoya knows how to start off. In his first varsity 
at-bat after being recalled from the junior varsity, he drove in two runs with 
a two-out single. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Alemany boys' basketball team (3-20) was one of the worst in the 
area, two of the area Southern Section statistical leaders came from that 
squad. Chris Engler led in rebounding with 13.5 per game and Jackie Chavez led 
in steals with 4.1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon and Crescenta Valley were the only area high school basketball teams to 
have two players average 20 points. Canyon was led by Greg Minor (22.9) and 
Charles Woodard (20.6) and Crescenta Valley was led by Richard O'Neill (23.1) 
and Brock Jacobsen (21.0). . . . 
</P>
<P>
 One final high school basketball note: Crescenta Valley finished 19-11, but 
the teams it lost to had a combined record of 192-61, including Mater Dei 
(33-1), La Canada (21-3), Reseda (18-2), Long Beach Poly (26-7) and Pacifica 
(30-2), which lost in the state Division III championship game Saturday.

CSUN PUTS HUGE FOOT ON BREAKS; COLLEGE BASEBALL: THINGS GO MATADORS' WAY IN 
10-7 VICTORY OVER CAL STATE SACRAMENTO AS NAJAR SURVIVES SHAKY SIXTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Somebody grab a thesaurus. These Cal State Northridge guys need to expand 
their vocabularies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher John Najar called it "big." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Kernen called it "huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Not incorrect, but a bit understated. The proper term should have been 
gigantic.  
</P>
<P>
 Najar took advantage of a crucial break Saturday as Northridge held on to 
defeat Cal State Sacramento, 10-7, in a Western Athletic Conference game at 
Hornet Field. 
</P>
<P>
 One of baseball's enduring truisms is that the home team usually gets the 
breaks, but don't try to sell that one to the Hornets (12-11, 2-3 in the WAC). 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest break came in the bottom of the sixth, with Northridge (15-11, 
4-1) holding a 6-2 lead. Najar gave up a single and a walk to put runners at 
first and second with none out. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup hitter Josh Kirtlan, who hit a game-winning homer Friday and another 
in the ninth on Saturday, surprised everyone by attempting a bunt down the 
third-base line. The ball rolled foul, but Kirtlan didn't get another swing. 
</P>
<P>
 He was ruled to have stepped across the plate and out of the batter's box. 
Northridge catcher Josh Smaler was credited with the easiest putout of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was real big right there," Najar said. "I threw him a changeup away and 
I guess it looked so fat he wanted to go out and get it. He's probably their 
best hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Najar (5-2) hit Jason Beeman to load the bases, but managed to retire the next 
two batters on grounders. Instead of a disastrous inning, only one run scored 
and Sacramento closed to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a huge break," Kernen said. "We've had some funny stuff happen to us 
this year. I'd like to think we had a few coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Another cost Sacramento a run and a third, which didn't factor into the 
scoring, caused several red faces. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, a single by Chad Thornhill drove in Jonathan Campbell to give 
Northridge an 8-3 lead and sent Eric Gillespie to third. Thornhill then stole 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out and first base open, Sacramento elected to intentionally walk the 
red-hot Jason Shanahan, who had driven in at least one run in each of the 
previous 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan's streak was snapped, though perhaps he deserved an asterisk. After 
pitcher Toby Rodgers delivered ball three, catcher Jason Quintel fired the ball 
into center field for an error, allowing Gillespie to score for a 9-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The play loomed larger when Najar began tiring in the late innings. In the 
eighth, he gave up a three-run double to Derek Brown and the Hornets cut the 
lead to 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have been rolling our way for a while," said Gillespie, who had three 
hits. "The big plays have been turning out in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the monstrous, titanic and humongous ones.

 In the Division I girls' game: 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton Sacred Heart Prep 59, Lynwood 53 -- Sacred Heart, the defending 
Division V champion playing its first season in Division I, completed an 
unbeaten season by knocking off the defending division champions. 
</P>
<P>
 At 38-0, Sacred Heart broke its own record for victories in a season set last 
year, when it was 37-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis Felts scored eight points during a 13-4 run midway through the fourth 
quarter to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Felts, a senior guard, had a game-high 26 points, including 12 of 13 free 
throw attempts. Jennifer Circle, a 6-foot-3 junior center, had 18 points and 
nine rebounds for the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood (32-2) was hindered by early foul trouble. Timicha Kirby, the Knights' 
leading scorer, picked up two fouls in the first quarter. WENDY WITHERSPOON

WITH A LITTLE HELP, LADYCATS LOOK LIKE NO. 1; POLL: NATION'S TOP-RANKED TEAM 
LOSES, MEANING NO. 2 BREA-OLINDA LIKELY WILL TAKE ITS PLACE IN RANKINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Brea-Olinda girls' basketball players sat in an interview room 
Saturday, trying hard not to cry after a perfect 33-0 season, Lee Moulin's 
mother, Dede, walked into the room after a call to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 
She said only two words: 
</P>
<P>
 "Pickerington lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The on-court celebration a few minutes earlier was small compared to the flood 
of emotion that bounced off the walls now. Brea-Olinda Coach John Hattrup 
thrust his arms into the air and yelled "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Erickson jumped up and down, screaming "I told you all, I told you 
all," then fell to the floor in tears as senior sub Tammy Banks leaned over 
her, holding Erickson's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone jumped to their feet except for Susan Rhodabarger, who sat in her 
chair, shocked, unable to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickerington, Ohio, the No. 1-ranked team in the nation, according to USA 
Today, was beaten by Garfield Heights Trinity, 59-54, in the Ohio State 
Division I championship game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Brea-Olinda, now No. 2, as the probable "national champion" when the 
next poll is released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were going to be No. 1, this is the time; now we can be No. 1, and 
there's no challenge, there's no game to play," said Hattrup, a first-year 
coach after being an assistant in the Ladycat program for five years. "This is 
so unbelievable. This season is just an absolute dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said when I coached Mission Viejo (to the State championship game in 1982), 
I'd never have another team like that. Five years later, we won the section 
title, and I said the same thing. But this group -- I don't know how you can 
top this group. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Former Coach) Mark Trakh really deserves a lot of credit for this; he built 
the house, and I'm just renting. He's the one that got the girls to this level; 
without him, we wouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda, in the midst of a 54-game winning streak and a 130-5 record since 
Erickson became the starting point guard, opened the year 15th in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Etiwanda tournament final early in the season, the Ladycats defeated 
Lynwood, 55-40. Lynwood, ranked seventh in the current poll, was beaten by No. 
9 Atherton Sacred Heart, 59-53, in Saturday's Division I title game. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Ladycats played in the Alaska Invitational at the end of 
December, they were fifth. There, they beat then-No. 6 Trinity and Lake Oswego 
(Ore.) Lakeridge, which later defeated Oregon City, a team also ranked ahead of 
Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-54 victory over Lakeridge -- and 6-foot-7, Stanford-bound center 
Chandra Benton -- was the Ladycats' biggest challenge and their closest game; 
Brea-Olinda led by two with six minutes left before Erickson caught fire, 
finishing with 38 points. Benton scored 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group is unbelievable," Hattrup said after the Ladycats got the news. 
"You can see it in this room; they can't even talk. They're speechless because 
this means so much to them. Unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a dream season. Everything has gone perfect, and for that to 
happen -- it's like Nicole said, it's the cherry on top of the sundae. 
Everything and then some." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson was sporting a "Quad Squad, 1990-1994" T-shirt -- replete with 
caricatures of everyone on the team -- after exiting the locker room. The 
scenario was especially meaningful to her. She recalled telling a reporter 
after winning the Southern Section title her freshman season that the Ladycats 
would be No. 1 in the nation her senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my entire life," Erickson said, "I don't think I've had a better day: 
unbeaten, State championship, national championship."

VLASIC WOULD TRADE PERFORMANCE FOR TITLE; PACIFICA: SENIOR GETS 28 POINTS, 11 
REBOUNDS AND THREE STEALS IN LOSS TO SACRAMENTO FOOTHILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Vlasic, Pacifica's role-playing star, simply won't stick his oversized 
basketball sneakers on center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think after a 28-point, 11-rebound, three-steal game, he'd bask for a 
moment in some hard-earned limelight. Not this guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to credit my teammates," said Vlasic, a senior. "They set picks. 
They got me the ball. They made the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about you, Chris? What about you? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you can't do it all by yourself," Vlasic said. 
</P>
<P>
 He came close. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic nearly led the Mariners to a tremendous comeback in Saturday's State 
Division III boys' title game at the Oakland Coliseum Arena, scoring 20 points 
in the second half. His teammates went along for the ride, but it turned out to 
be a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento Foothill came away with an 81-61 victory, but the Mustangs had to 
sweat out Vlasic first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he could shoot," Foothill Coach Drew Hibbs said. "Our kids got right 
in his face. He still made shots." 
</P>
<P>
 That's just Vlasic. He's a role player, and he played the role of scorer 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic made seven of nine shots and had 17 points in the third quarter -- 
including the Mariners' first 15 of the half -- to rally them from a 40-24 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica trailed, 55-49, at the end of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, when you hit a couple shots, you feel that you can get on a roll," 
Vlasic said. "But you can't get shots without the ball. My teammates gave me 
some key passes and picks." 
</P>
<P>
 Them again. What about you, Chris? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I carried them," Vlasic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah? The Mariners scored only eight non-Vlasic points in the third. Carry 
them? He dragged them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, Chris doesn't get enough credit," Coach Bob Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Becker is partially to blame. He took a great scorer and made him a 
key role player. Heck, Vlasic doesn't even start. He averaged fewer than 20 
minutes during regular season but led the team with an average of about 20 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 But you won't hear him complain about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Success is always the goal," Vlasic said. "I don't care how many points I 
get, as long as we reach the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic and the Mariners reached for it Saturday. He had a steal and a layup, 
then made a free throw to close the gap to 63-56 with 4 minutes 41 seconds 
left. The Mariners got as close as five before Foothill pulled away down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Chris would have traded every point for a title," Becker said. "No 
question about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Vlasic who got the Mariners this far. He clinched the Southern 
California Regional final with eight free throws in the final minute to 
preserve a 60-55 victory over University of San Diego High School. 
</P>
<P>
 All season, in fact, Pacifica looked to him for his play and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came off the bench all year and had a great attitude about it," Becker 
said. "He is the type of kid you want the rest of the team to emulate." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the Mariners, none of them could Saturday -- at least on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Surface, the Mariners' second-leading scorer, was slowed by the flu and 
finished with only 10 points. No other Mariner scored more than eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of help," Vlasic said. "My coaches, my teammates . . . "

DIGEST: QUANCE, BURTON STAND OUT AT DIVISION I MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC freshman swimmer Kristine Quance of Northridge shattered a meet record and 
Cal State Northridge diver Dawn Burton made a big improvement on the final day 
of the NCAA Division I Women's Swimming and Diving Championships at the Indiana 
University Natatorium in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Quance turned in a time of 2:10.69 in the final of the 200-yard breaststroke,

FOR CSUN, ONE STREAK STARTS AS ANOTHER ENDS; COLLEGE TRACK: WOMEN TAKE SECOND 
COLLEGIATE CLASSIC IN ROW; MEN'S SUCCESSES END AT THREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One streak ended for Cal State Northridge, but another began in Saturday's 
Collegiate Classic track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors finished second behind Utah State in the men's meet, snapping 
their string of three consecutive victories in the meet, but won their second 
consecutive title on the women's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Tannel House and Teresa Stricklin each won two events as Northridge 
(8-0) totaled 97 points. San Diego State finished second with 83 points, 
followed by Long Beach (71) and Cal State Fullerton (32). A group of athletes 
from the Japanese Sports Federation finished fifth with 22 points and USC 
placed sixth (15). 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge men, led by double winner Joe Hicks, had 101 points -- 15 
behind victorious Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 USC placed third (94 points), followed by Cal State Fullerton (72), Cal State 
Long Beach (67), Weber State (21) and the Japanese Sports Federation (17). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud of what the kids accomplished," Coach Don Strametz said. "We 
had several people who really came through for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Strametz was particularly pleased with distance runners Alva Dancel and Lori 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancel placed second in the 10,000 meters with a time of 38 minutes 48.74 
seconds in the morning and finished third in the 5,000 (18:23.45) in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller placed second in the 3,000 with a personal best of 10:28.38 and came 
back 35 minutes later to win the 1,500 in 4:42.24. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that's a great strength double," Strametz said. 
</P>
<P>
 House continued the best season of her Northridge career by winning the long 
jump (20 feet 1/4 inch) and triple jump (39-9 1/4). 
</P>
<P>
 The long jump mark tied her personal best and the triple jump effort improved 
her best by three-quarters of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's having a great season," Strametz said. "She's really starting to get 
consistent at 20 feet in the long jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge scored 19 of 21 possible points in the weight events as Stricklin 
won the shotput (45-8) and discus (154-1), and Kristen Dunn finished second in 
the javelin (148-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Stricklin's mark in the shotput and Dunn's in the javelin were inferior to 
their performances in last year's meet, but Strametz is not overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still two to three weeks behind where we should be because of the 
(training time lost in the aftermath of the earthquake)," Strametz said. 
"Hopefully, we'll be caught up by (the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in four 
weeks), but it could take longer than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks was victorious in the shotput (53-0 1/4) and the hammer (191-10) for the 
Northridge men's team (7-2), which has been forced to compete without several 
key performers this season for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Scurry, the Matador record-holder in the long jump (26-3 1/2), is 
academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Harisay, who put the shot 58-1 3/4 last year, moved away in the wake of 
the earthquake, and Jason Stein, Northridge's top performer in the 400 (48.14), 
recently moved to San Diego to pursue a career with the city's police 
department.

PREP ROUNDUP; IRVINE WINS RACE, LOSES BID FOR SOUTH COAST RELAYS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "You go girl," was how one Irvine teammate encouraged another before the start 
of the girls' 6 X 50-yard freestyle relay at the South Coast Relays on Saturday 
morning at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 She did, and so did the other five members of the Irvine relay team. Amy 
Aldinger, Gusti Lind, Jennifer Webb, Lana Kraus, Monica Huszcz and Wendy 
O'Brien swam fast enough -- their time was 2 minutes 35.70 seconds -- to set a 
meet record and erase the mark of 2:35.79 set a year ago by Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they had earlier this season in a dual meet against El Toro, defending 
Division I Southern Section champion, Irvine fell short of the meet 
championship, which the Chargers won, 178 points to Irvine's 172. Mission Viejo 
was third with 152. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had a good chance of winning," said El Toro Coach Sheri Ross, 
whose Chargers won their third consecutive relay team title. "They really get 
pumped up for it." 
</P>
<P>
 As did the Mission Viejo boys. The Diablos won four relays en route to a meet 
title with 194 points. Runner-up Capistrano Valley had 180 points and 
third-place Irvine scored 140. 
</P>
<P>
 Host San Clemente's girls won the 400 medley relay and the 200 breaststroke 
relay. Irvine's other victory came in the 200 butterfly relay, and El Toro's 
Alice Park, Lindsey Rock, Katie Lowes and Christie Kennedy won the 400 
freestyle relay (3:41.96). Park, Katie Simmons, Keri Wilson and Angela Toubeaux 
took the 200 medley relay (1:56.07). 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said the Chargers used the meet as a warm-up for next weekend's Southern 
Section Relays at Long Beach Belmont Plaza, where they will attempt to win 
their fifth consecutive title. But undefeated El Toro (5-0) will have to do it 
without sophomore Lowe and freshman Kennedy, who will be in North Dakota for a 
junior national meet. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro expects another stiff challenge from Irvine, which the Chargers 
defeated by eight points in the earlier meet and by six points Saturday. KIM Q.

LOUISIANA DERBY; LONGSHOT KANDALY USES A FAST FINISH TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kandaly, an 8-1 shot with new ties to the Louisiana team that took Risen Star 
to two Triple Crown victories, closed rapidly in the stretch Saturday to win 
the $300,000 Louisiana Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Running in only his fourth race, Kandaly was well back early while Argolid set 
fast fractions of 22 3/5, 45 4/5 and 1:10 3/5.But Craig Perret guided Kandaly 
to the outside to win by 1 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly covered 1 1/16 miles at the Fair Grounds in 1:42 4/5. Game Coin was 
second and Argolid third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell those people in Kentucky, they're in trouble," said Kandaly's co-owner, 
Ronnie Lamarque, who purchased a half-share in the colt with trainer Louie 
Roussel III on Feb. 26. "We're coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Lamarque-Roussel team that owned Risen Star when he won the 1988 
Louisiana Derby before finishing third in the Kentucky Derby and winning the 
Preakness and Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamarque said he and Roussel negotiated to buy half of Kandaly from New 
York-based owner Roz Cole after the horse beat Clev Er Irish, another colt they 
own, in a February allowance race at the Fair Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly Cry, who had won both local prep races for the Louisiana Derby, tying a 
stakes record set by Risen Star in one of them, ran fourth after going off as 
the 9-5 favorite.

SANTA ANITA; SLOW PACE LETS POSSIBLY PERFECT LEAD ALL THE WAY IN SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unplaced with You And I in the Louisiana Derby, trainer Bobby Frankel had 
better luck at Santa Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly Perfect, one of Frankel's two entrants in the $158,500 Santa Ana 
Handicap, took advantage of a paceless field and led every step of the way to 
win her second Grade I race over the Santa Anita turf course. The 4-year-old 
Northern Baby filly won the Yellow Ribbon in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from testifying in the lengthy hearing over The Wicked North's 
disqualification in the Santa Anita Handicap, Kent Desormeaux slowed the 
fractions down over a yielding surface and the 2-1 second choice won by nearly 
two lengths over favored Hero's Love. Possibly Perfect covered the 1 1/8 miles 
in a very slow 1:51. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth behind Lady Blessington, Skimble and Hero's Love in the Buena Vista 
last month, Possibly Perfect had a couple of excuses that day. She hadn't raced 
since the Yellow Ribbon victory and she also lost a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't lose any shoes today," said Desormeaux, who completed a sweep of 
the late double with a come-from-behind victory on Buckmeister in the ninth. 
"Last time, we let (Skimble, also trained by Frankel) go because it was my 
filly's first race back. We elected to sit off her. My horse came up tired and 
lost that shoe, which hurt her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, Bobby said put her on the lead and don't worry about anything. I got 
to gallop on the lead, and my filly, she can run. She handled the course just 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Hero's Love finished 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Waitryst, who was later 
disqualified and placed last for interfering with Skimble and Lady Blessington 
in midstretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winner went so easy the first part that when I came up to her, she still 
had enough left," said Laffit Pincay, Hero's Love's rider. "I got to maybe a 
length from the winner, but then she just left me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rain and muddy track, Valiant Nature probably will run in the 
$210,000 San Felipe Stakes today while Brocco's status is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horse couldn't be better, and we're probably going to run," said Brocco's 
trainer, Randy Winick. "My concern is the track condition, and if the track is 
unsafe (today), we won't run. Another concern is the San Felipe will go as the 
fourth race, not the eighth, so that gives us two hours less to make a 
decision. I won't make the decision until as late as possible, probably by the 
second race. But I need to run, and I want to run." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco is the 6-5 morning-line favorite in the 1 1/16-mile San Felipe, which 
would be his first start since he finished second to Valiant Nature in the

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JOSE DE LA TORRE: INTERNATIONAL FINANCE HAS BECOME 
THE DOG-WAGGING TAIL OF '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSE DE LA TORRE, Jose de la Torre is a professor of international business 
strategy in UCLA's Graduate School of Management and director of the 
university's Center for International Business Education and Research. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 World financial markets once again have suffered a bad case of the jitters. 
Large speculative flows are pushing interest rates up and causing exchange 
rates to bounce about with increased volatility. For most of us who work in the 
"real" economy, the resulting changes in relative prices and demand can have 
serious repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seeking someone to blame have an ample choice of villains: Alan 
Greenspan for reining in the U.S. economy too soon, the German Bundesbank for 
acting selfishly, the Japanese for their indecision, or George Soros and other 
"hedge funds" operators who -- having bet wrongly on the direction of interest 
rates and bond prices -- are scurrying to cover their huge exposed positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, we live in a new world of international finance that is scarcely 
a decade old. As recently as 1984, financial markets remained essentially 
domestic. Since then, new telecommunications and information technologies -- 
coupled with advances in financial theory, radical innovation in financial 
products and a universal process of market deregulation -- have transformed 
financial markets dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1984 dollar-yen agreement allowed Japanese investors greater access to 
foreign markets and removed barriers to yen convertibility. The Plaza Accord of 
1985 encouraged a trend toward market-opening measures throughout the 
industrialized world. The deregulation of London's securities market -- the Big 
Bang of 1986 -- was followed by similar, if less dramatic, actions in other 
European capitals, as well as in many emergent markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined effects of these forces can be illustrated by a few key figures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Market capitalization of the world's major stock exchanges grew from $1.7 
trillion in 1978 to $10.6 trillion in 1993, increasing significantly the 
world's stock of risk capital. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cross-border trading in corporate equities has grown from about $120 billion 
in 1979 to $1.3 trillion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transactions involving foreign securities listed in domestic markets boomed 
from less than $50 billion in 1979 to nearly $900 billion in 1990. On Wall 
Street alone, trading in the American Depository Receipts of foreign firms went 
from 1.3 billion shares in 1985 to more than 5 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * The share of U.S. initial public offerings abroad increased from 1.4% in 
1985 to 19.3% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * In spite of the near collapse of international lending to developing 
countries following the 1982 debt crisis, the international portfolios of major 
banks have grown dramatically during the decade. From 1980 to 1992, the stock 
of international loans ballooned from $324 billion to $7.5 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 * And the market in derivatives -- which barely existed before 1980 -- grew to 
nearly $9 trillion by 1992, much of that in interest and currency swaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, one in every five transactions in equity markets today involves 
cross-border trading. Such investors are estimated to own 10% of world 
equities, a proportion that will rise to 15% to 20% by the end of the decade. 
Financial transactions with foreigners have grown by a factor of 10 or more for 
all major industrial economies since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no denying that freer international capital markets have functioned 
precisely as expected, leveling differences in the return on -- and therefore 
in the cost of -- capital between similar risks. No longer can U.S. companies 
complain that Japanese or German firms have access to cheaper capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But these developments pale in comparison to the explosion that has 
characterized foreign exchange markets in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 From an annual volume of roughly $18 trillion in 1979, foreign exchange 
transactions doubled to about $35 trillion by 1984. Thereafter, the rate of 
growth only accelerated, with current estimates citing a daily volume of more 
than $1.2 trillion, the equivalent of 5% of the world's total production of 
goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it in perspective, the ratio of transactions in foreign exchange to 
those in international trade in goods and services increased during the decade 
from just above 8 to 1 to more than 80 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The determination of real exchange rates, and therefore cost competitiveness, 
is increasingly divorced from underlying fundamentals in the real sectors of 
the economy. Large variations in effective exchange rates, often 30% to 40% 
above or below "parity" rates, can be sustained for five years or more; witness 
the persistent overvaluation of the dollar from 1981 to 1985 and its subsequent 
undervaluation since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 These long swings in currency values have been accompanied by increased 
volatility in foreign exchange rates. As governments manipulate financial 
variables for domestic purposes, massive flows of short-term capital act to 
exploit any opportunity for gain. Exporters and importers are caught in the 
vise. 
</P>
<P>
 How can business escape this dilemma? 
</P>
<P>
 Given the high cost of short-term hedging and the imperfections of longer-term 
instruments, one solution is to balance a company's costs and revenue within 
broadly defined areas tied to a particular currency -- the dollar or yen or 
mark -- where greater stability exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies need not make everything they sell within each area; rather, they 
can simply manage manufacturing and procurement activities in such a way that 
they match regional revenues. Currency swings between areas can be handled by 
building flexibility at the margin -- that is, with excess capacity and 
short-term sourcing contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar, the U.S. heavy-equipment maker, seems to have engineered just 
such flexibility into its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, some 80% of its goods were produced in the United States, though 
America already accounted for less than 50% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1991, U.S. production had dropped to 60% of the company's total. And over 
the decade, Caterpillar almost doubled its use of parts and supplies from 
non-U.S. sources, boosting those purchases to 45% of its total. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Cat's Japanese competitor Komatsu -- which continued to rely 
predominantly on domestic production -- was seriously exposed to a loss of 
competitive position as the yen rose. That forced Komatsu to acquire U.S. 
production, in the form of a joint venture with Dresser Industries in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers need not despair. One cannot change this brave new world of 
electronic financial manipulation. But one can avoid its worst consequences by 
following a prudent policy of market and production diversification.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HEED RULES IN TAKING IRA FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. Two years after being forced to take an early retirement, I find I could 
really use some of my individual retirement account funds to cover my living 
expenses. The only problem is that I am 57 years old. I understand that there 
is some provision in the tax code permitting taxpayers under age 59 1/2 to make 
early withdrawals without penalty. Can you explain the rules? -- J.P . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Able-bodied taxpayers under age 59 1/2 are permitted to withdraw funds from 
their IRAs without penalty if the disbursements are made under one of three 
annuity-type formulas approved by the Internal Revenue Service. Although no 
penalty will be imposed for early withdrawal, the funds will still be subject 
to ordinary income tax unless they consist of after-tax contributions. Disabled 
taxpayers are entitled to make early withdrawals without penalty under a 
different, more lenient set of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers who make early withdrawals must take disbursements, at the rate 
determined by the formula of their choosing, for either five years or until 
reaching age 59 1/2, whichever occurs later. The withdrawal formula cannot 
change until the minimum period has been completed. In your case, this would 
mean you would have to take disbursements for at least five years. After that 
point, you could change the withdrawal amount or discontinue payments without 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the disbursement formulas? First is the simple life expectancy 
method, which is the easiest to calculate but generally provides smaller annual 
payments than the other methods: 
</P>
<P>
 You calculate the annual withdrawal by dividing your account balance by your 
life expectancy, as determined by IRS actuarial tables. (You may also use your 
life expectancy and that of your IRA beneficiary, although this would give you 
an even lower annual withdrawal.) The IRS life expectancy tables are detailed 
in IRS Publication No. 939. 
</P>
<P>
 The second method is often referred to as the amortization method because you 
amortize your account balance like a mortgage, using one of the life expectancy 
tables mentioned above plus a long-term interest rate deemed appropriate by the 
IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 In private rulings, the IRS has approved the use of interest rates based on 
certain prevailing market conditions. Under this system, your annual withdrawal 
will be higher than under the life expectancy method because the balance is 
increased each year by the selected interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The third method is similar to the amortization formula but allows taxpayers 
to use insurance mortality tables, which project shorter life expectancy than 
the IRS tables. The result is a higher annual disbursement than for either of 
the above formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 One last note: If you decide to use either the second or third formula, you 
would be wise to consult a tax professional to make sure your disbursements 
qualify for the penalty exception. Calculating Cost Basis of Inherited Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My uncle died, leaving us some stocks. What is the cost basis of those 
shares? Some people tell us it is their fair market value on the date of his 
death; others say they can be valued at any point within six months after his 
death. -- W.L.W . 
</P>
<P>
 A. If no estate taxes are due, assets are generally valued as of the date of 
death. However, if taxes are due, the estate executor may value the assets as 
of the date of death, as of six months after the death or as of the date of 
sale of any of the assets in the estate if the sale occurs within six months of 
the death. The selection, which covers all the assets in an estate, must be 
made upon the filing of the estate tax return, which is generally due nine 
months after the death. Heir Can Escape Tax Liability on Home 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I own my home and want to leave it to my girlfriend, who has been taking 
care of me in what I think may be my final days. I have never used the $125,000 
profit exemption on a home sale. I am thinking of entering into a sales 
agreement with her that says she has paid me $140,000 for the home in order to 
establish that as her cost basis. The grant deed turning the house over to her 
will be filed upon my death. Will the trustee of my living trust be able to 
claim the $125,000 deduction on my home sale profit under this arrangement? -- 
M.R.S . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Our experts believe you are going to a lot of trouble to achieve your ends, 
which essentially are to give your girlfriend your home upon your death without 
sticking her with a huge potential capital gain upon its sale. Rather than the 
convoluted scheme you propose, why not just leave the home to her in your will? 
The value of the house will be reset as of your date of death, so she will not 
be getting an appreciated asset on which there will be unpaid tax. So what if 
you die without ever having used your $125,000 deduction? There could be worse 
things left undone at death. 
</P>
<P>
 Another alternative would be to "sell" your girlfriend the home with no money 
down right now. You could use your $125,000 exemption, and in your will you 
could forgive your girlfriend the unpaid balance. If your estate is valued at 
less than $600,000, there will be no estate taxes due the government. Giving 
Without Gift Tax Consequences 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am confused about how much money a couple can give to their son and his 
spouse without triggering gift tax consequences. F.F . 
</P>
<P>
 A. You and your wife may each give $10,000 per year to as many people as you 
want without gift tax consequences. Under these limits, you and your wife could 
give your son and his wife a total of $40,000 per year -- $10,000 from each of 
you to each of them.

 OUT OF THE SKY: Along with the pouring rain Saturday came sirens at dawn, a 
road closure and the postponement of about 50 outdoor athletics events. (B4) 
Laguna Canyon Road was closed for a time. About 6:05 a.m. a warning siren near 
the San Onofre nuclear plant mistakenly sounded in San Clemente and wailed for 
20 minutes. . . . And, right on schedule, swallows were spotted at Mission San 
Juan Capistrano around 8 a.m., bells rang, and the annual celebration of St.

 FINDING SALVATION: The Salvation Army has long helped people break alcohol and 
drug addictions. Now it wants to help addicts break their tobacco habits as 
well. Beginning April 1, the 140 addicts at its rehabilitation center in 
Anaheim will be prohibited from smoking. . . . While society condemns drugs and 
alcohol, says director Bradley Hayton, "in reality, the number of deaths from 
tobacco and secondhand smoke far outweighs alcohol and drug-related 
fatalities."

 THE SHOE FITS: It's true that homeless people need food and blankets, but what 
they need most , some will tell you, is shoes. Local podiatric surgeon Victor 
Cachia led a shoe drive here last year that was so successful the county's 
Podiatric Medical Assn. is doing it again. . . . "Many homeless people don't 
have the resources to purchase shoes," Cachia says. "It exposes them to foot 
ailments that could be prevented." You can turn in your old or spare shoes at 
MainPlace/Santa Ana or the Walking Store in Huntington Beach.

 A man accused of trying to kill his ex-girlfriend and her son was mistakenly 
released from jail for the second time in four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Alexander, 41, was able to leave the county jail Wednesday because his 
bond was incorrectly recorded as $500, instead of $500,000, Sheriff's 
Cmdr.Marvin Wusthoff said. A friend posted the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander was returned to jail Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Alexander was mistakenly released on an eight-hour furlough, 
without police escort, to attend a brother's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Harris, whom Alexander is accused of shooting, waited with her 
children in the sheriff's office Thursday until Alexander was back in jail. 
When Alexander was released in December, Harris and her children stayed at a 
shelter for battered women.

<P>
 Alexander's trial is scheduled for April 25.

A BIT OF HISTORY ON THE NAME 'CANOGA PARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * All local historians are happy to see the identity of any community defended 
(Letters, March 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Winnetka was indeed founded by Charles Weeks in 1922.His concept was that the 
one-acre lots, if managed according to his master plan, would make make the 
owners totally self-sufficient. Some of the original owners are still there. 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park received its name in 1931. Many members of the town did not like 
the name given to it -- Owensmouth -- when it was founded in 1912. The name 
Canoga was the one given to the original goods depot established by the 
railroad in 1893 on the south side of Sherman Way, east of Canoga Avenue. Back 
then, Mr. Weeks was a young boy growing up in Winnetka, Ill.

TOO LITTLE LEADERSHIP, TOO MANY PARROTS IN LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Chip Johnson's interview with former police officer Charlie Meter (Valley 
Interview, Feb. 15) was right on target. 
</P>
<P>
 While I never knew Charlie, I served on similar assignments from 1961 through 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Ed Davis regime, the Los Angeles Police Department bought into the 
management and business-textbook method of management for management's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Leadership does not grow in an organization staffed with parrots of the party 
line concerned with little more than their own aggrandizement. Nice things do 
not happen in the careers of those who fail to see the emperor's new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie was right on. Managers in the LAPD are a dime a dozen. Leadership is 
sorely lacking. I have the distinction and pride of being one of the "cowboys" 
Charlie refers to in his comments about the perception management has of 
disagreement from sergeants and below. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the displeasure of working for my share of "managers," and wouldn't give 
that same dime for their callous attitude toward rank-and-file, their inability 
to make an efficient decision in the face of overwhelming fact and their 
parroting of the party line. I could at least look in the mirror each morning 
and at the faces of my officers knowing that I tried to bring some leadership 
to my watch. And, oh yes, I caught plenty of hell for it! 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD isn't what it was, and won't be until it stops trying to be 
everything to everybody, like another social agency.

MOTEL CRACKDOWN IS GOOD POLICING TOOL; CONDITIONS PLACED ON SEPULVEDA BLVD. 
ESTABLISHMENTS ARE REASONABLE USE OF ZONING RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six more motels have been cited in the continuing effort to wrest Sepulveda 
Boulevard from the grip of prostitution and crime. For the most part, the 
requirements placed on the establishments seem to be a reasonable, proper use 
of zoning regulations and other measures as tools for community-based policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five motels on the boulevard in Van Nuys, for example, have been 
the scene of as many as 87 arrests in a given calendar year. Of the five Van 
Nuys motels cited, only the El Cortez may have represented something of a 
stretch, with 19 crimes in a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 All five establishments have been ordered by a city zoning administrator to 
fulfill 27 conditions or risk being shut down. The order includes hiring their 
own security guards and working more closely with police. There is also the not 
inconsequential matter of reimbursing the city for the cost of its 
investigations, which amounted to more than $4,000 in the case of one of the 
motels. 
</P>
<P>
 Such investigations are labor intensive, and that was why we criticized the 
original request, from City Councilman Marvin Braude's office, to investigate 
all 11 of the Sepulveda Boulevard motels in his district. Police figured that 
only about five of the establishments were the source of the troubles, 
precisely the number cited. 
</P>
<P>
 A clear example of the type of motel that deserves such attention is the 
Redwood Inn, on Sepulveda in North Hills. During investigations there, a 
manager was arrested on pandering charges and another was caught renting rooms 
for an hour or two at a time, a clear violation of restrictions that had 
already been ordered by the city. The Planning and Land Use Committee of the 
Los Angeles City Council has now upheld the conditions placed on the Redwood 
Inn's operations, and it added one more: a guard who will patrol the motel 16 
hours a day. A couple of new managers might also be a good idea.

METROLINK'S FARE CUT IS ON RIGHT TRACK; L.A. CAN LEARN FROM BAY AREA, WHERE 
MASS TRANSIT DECLINED AFTER LOMA PRIETA QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation officials who want to persuade more residents in the San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys to use mass transit instead of 
their cars should borrow a few lessons from a northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, according to the San Francisco 
Chronicle, only 5% of Bay Area commuters made long-term commitments to mass 
transit. In fact, the brief love affairs with other forms of transportation in 
the Bay Area didn't just sour -- as they have begun to here. One year after the 
Loma Prieta quake, single-occupant vehicles accounted for virtually all of the 
growth in traffic in that region. And mass transit and car-pools accounted for 
smaller shares of Bay Area traffic than they had before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 That bodes ill for the Los Angeles area, where a repeat seems already to be in 
progress. The same commuters who flocked to Metrolink trains in the immediate 
aftermath of the Northridge quake have already begun to return to their cars. 
That is most unfortunate because this region must attempt to eliminate traffic 
gridlock and begin to work toward a more efficient and far less vulnerable 
21st-Century transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Metrolink has begun to take some steps to recapture some of its 
post-quake ridership surge. It announced this past week that the cost of 
monthly commuter passes from the Antelope Valley to Burbank, Glendale and Los 
Angeles will be cut in half for the next three months. The cost of a pass for 
travel from Santa Clarita to the same destinations were reduced by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Metrolink went further by announcing across-the-board fare 
reductions for Burbank-bound passengers from Ventura County and the west San 
Fernando Valley. Prices have also been scaled back on single and 10-trip 
tickets. (Metrolink officials say that they expect to be reimbursed by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency for the costs of the temporary reductions.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lower fares are a sensible idea that might encourage more car commuters to 
give up the agony of the streets for an anxiety-free ride to work.

CLAS SCORES PROVIDE A LOOK AT WHAT WORKS; PROGRAMS AT SEPULVEDA SHINE; 
NORTHRIDGE'S NEED RETOOLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've all had time to regain our composure after the release of the California 
Learning Assessment System results. Among other things, the new and rigorous 
state tests showed that students at the best public school districts too often 
showed only "limited mathematical thinking" abilities. That was also true for a 
staggering 80% of the pupils in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and 
for one-third of all students statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 But what should happen now? The switchboards are already busy at private 
schools around the Valley. Undoubtedly, another series of meetings by those who 
are most emphatic about breaking up the LAUSD into smaller districts is in the 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 We think that these energies would be best spent on a different kind of 
examination. Simply put, the CLAS results represent an excellent opportunity to 
study the individual academic programs and philosophies offered by each school. 
It's a chance to duplicate those that have been successful or at least appear 
to be on the right track. It's another chance to retool or scuttle those 
programs that clearly seem to be headed in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those that clearly seemed to have gone awry last year involved the 
Northridge Middle School. It was a campus at which high academic standards and 
tough grading were discouraged and believed to be damaging to a large and 
growing segment of minority students. Classroom order and deportment was not 
important. High self esteem among students was a primary goal, even if that did 
not appear to be backed up by the most common academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the California Learning Assessment System results served as yet another 
indication of the fact that changes are in order at Northridge. That is 
particularly important now, as the school struggles to recover a semblance of 
normalcy just two months after the Northridge quake. Its eighth-grade students, 
who took the exams long before the temblor and its aftershocks, fell woefully 
short of even the LAUSD's lousy showing in reading, writing and math. Most 
telling was the fact that the Northridge Middle School results were also far 
behind those at the 100 schools judged to be more comparable to it in terms of 
student demographics and socioeconomic status. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the expectations for student performance are high at the 
Sepulveda Middle School in North Hills, according to Times reporter Beth 
Shuster. It's a place where a noisy classroom more often means that students 
are fully engaged, such as in the science class where students are using Slinky 
toys to learn about earthquake waves. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sepulveda, officials believe a more rigorous curriculum will result in 
progressively higher test scores, as long as it is combined with hands-on 
learning, team teaching and other new approaches to learning. 
</P>
<P>
 On the California Learning Assessment System, which measures students against 
highly challenging state standards, Sepulveda Middle School faired much better 
than most. Its eighth-grade students clearly outshined their state and LAUSD 
counterparts in reading and math, and trailed them only on the writing section 
of the test. About one-third of Sepulveda's school's students attend its 
gifted/high ability magnet program. Its overall score was significantly higher 
than those of the 100 schools with similar programs and student 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 To make even more improvements, a school leadership committee has already 
agreed to pay for additional teacher training by professors at UCLA, and 
Sepulveda instructors are also giving students more reading and writing 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's efforts to date provide some clues as to the kind of changes that 
will be required at many LAUSD campuses. That is the context in which an 
otherwise gloomy tale of low test scores should be viewed.

NO CRUELTY INVOLVED IN KEEPING BIMBO ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As the veterinarian responsible for the care of Bimbo, the dog burned during 
the earthquake, I feel compelled to respond to the letter (March 6) regarding 
the "cruelty" involved in trying to save her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo's owner, Jim Menzi, his family and friends, myself and my dedicated 
staff worked very hard day and night for almost a month in an effort to return 
Bimbo to the life she loved. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for a single moment during her treatment was her "quality of life" 
ignored. She never missed a meal. She looked forward to her walks in the fresh 
air. She stood patiently for each of her baths and treatments. She was given 
pain medication regularly despite her not showing evidence of being in pain. My 
staff grew to love her and grieved her loss right along with her family. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the letter writer and others of similar opinions are judging from 
their own quite personal and quite human perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 I would ask them to be less quick to judge and to perhaps rethink their own 
philosophies with regard to animal medicine vs. animal suffering. Many pets are 
needlessly destroyed each year under the umbrella of "humaneness" when the 
degree of suffering necessary to return them to a normal life would have been 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo's life was precious, probably to her and certainly to her master. Her 
fight for life took courage on the part of everyone involved. It would have 
been easier for Jim to put her to sleep, but he wanted something better for his 
dog. I can't say he was wrong. Neither can anyone else.

IT'S LOOTING OF A DIFFERENT TYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It has been several weeks since the Northridge earthquake, and my husband 
and I are still not sleeping. But it's not from the tremors that we all feel 
nor the destruction that we all see.It is from the selfishness, deceptiveness 
and ignorance which unfortunately have become our neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 We moved to Northridge over four years ago but have never really gotten 
involved with our neighbors. The earthquake on Jan. 17 changed that forever. 
Overnight, Northridge was declared a disaster area, which meant federal 
disaster aid would be distributed and insurance deductibles had to be exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly our quiet neighborhood became a theater for con artists performing 
for insurance adjusters and Federal Emergency Management Agency inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Our relatives, friends and neighbors devised lists of lost personal items they 
never owned in order to exceed the high deductible on their insurance policies. 
Carpet, tiling and roofing destroyed before the earthquake were now held to be 
due to the earthquake. "How could they prove it didn't happen during the 
quake?" was everyone's reply when confronted. "You have to fudge a little or 
you won't get anything" was the advice of our neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastation of the earthquake has gone deeper than structural damage. It 
has brought about "financial looting" on every street in every neighborhood.

ARTICLE ON BATHHOUSE AMOUNTS TO GAY BASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article describing sexual behavior in a bathhouse (Around the Valley, 
March 10) is shameful gay bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 You damn the whole community for the behavior of a few -- bad logic. Do we 
castigate all women for the number that are prostitutes? Or an individual's 
whole life for an indiscretion never repeated? 
</P>
<P>
 You have, in effect, joined that segment of society unable to accept behavior 
that by all scientific evidence is within normal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But then you too are permitted errors, and we'll sigh, lift our eyes to the 
heavens and continue to peruse your paper.

VITAL WATER SUPPLY MUST BE PRESERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * With water shortages in the news again (March 11), it's time to take a 
careful look at how we plan for our ground water basins. 
</P>
<P>
 We in the Santa Clarita Valley are blessed with a high quality ground-water 
supply.That may change if local developers have their way and the county 
continues to allow berming and channelizing of the Santa Clara River and its 
tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
 As was observed by the Army Corps of Engineers during the flooding of the 
Mississippi this past summer, narrowing and berming of a river's natural banks 
causes an increased velocity of surface flow and increases downstream damage 
and erosion. This has also occurred along the Santa Clara River because of the 
concrete channelization of Bouquet Creek and the narrowing of the Santa Clara's 
natural flood plain. Flood flow rates have increased by 100%, now reaching 
Ventura in only four hours where it previously took eight. 
</P>
<P>
 This has severely reduced the amount of water that recharges the alluvial and 
Saugus ground water basins, our two main sources of water, by simply wasting 
the water to the ocean. In addition, this increased velocity has the adverse 
side effect of causing erosion to downstream orchards as well as the habitat of 
several endangered species and erosion of the Ventura beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clara River is a major source of water for all the communities along 
its banks, from Acton to Ventura. Its proper management will insure reduced use 
of Northern California water, leaving more for other areas that are not so 
naturally endowed. This will mean hard decisions from planners to not allow 
projects that will reduce this public resource.

GM'S PENALTY FOR WATER POLLUTION WAS TOO LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I live near what is left of the Los Angeles River and understand the 
importance of this and other water sources for local wildlife and public use. 
Clean, open water is rare in this dry, urban region, so I feel any pollution of 
our watershed is of critical importance.For this reason I must comment on your 
article "Judge Finds GM Guilty in Waste Water Dumping Case" (March 3). 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors dumped 17,000 gallons of chemically contaminated and toxic 
water into the sensitive Tujunga Wash and the Los Angeles River watershed. 
However, the corporation was fined only $9,594. 
</P>
<P>
 GM probably spends more than that sum on stationery supplies each year. Such a 
paltry penalty does nothing to discourage environmental polluters. On the 
contrary, it makes dumping toxic waste an attractive risk. Fines become merely 
an unexpected cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Will $9,594 pay for cleaning up this spill and assuring that the wash is safe 
and clean for people and wildlife? Is any restoration of the wash planned? 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to reduce pollution is to throw the book at the few violators 
that somehow get caught. GM and other guilty corporate polluters should be 
fined in amounts commensurate with their profits and at a level that really 
hurts. Only then will they be motivated to stop their harmful actions.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; YOU CAN'T BE TOO PREPARED; SO, YOU HAVE FLASHLIGHTS,

<P>
 My wife and I used to feel guilty about not being prepared for an earthquake. 
Our emergency kit consisted of a fire extinguisher, a can opener and one size-D 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Whittier earthquake, we decided it was finally time to become 
survivalists in case we were still around when the Big One hit. 
</P>
<P>
 We went to the front of the telephone book and followed the instructions, 
which said we should have enough supplies on hand for 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 We bought flashlights, batteries and blankets. We studied the water-allocation 
advice and bought five five-gallon bottles for just the two of us. 
</P>
<P>
 For food, we purchased canned goods such as fruit cocktail, vegetables, chili 
and juices. We also bought an endless supply of ramen noodles, since they would 
require only hot water that we could boil on the grill. 
</P>
<P>
 We had three bags of charcoal, two bottles of starter fluid and two boxes of 
matches. We had wrenches, extra shoes, a radio and a first aid kit. We had $20 
in cash. We were ready for the next disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For years we bragged to our friends and neighbors that they could come on over 
if they ran out of supplies after the Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Jan. 17. Look out, earthquake, here we come! 
</P>
<P>
 As I ran to the front door of our house behind my wife, who was shouting, "Oh 
my God!" I kept thinking we would be in fat city if the house was left 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few minutes the earth quieted down, and we decided it was safe to go back 
inside. I located the flashlights and the extra batteries. The batteries were 
good -- I'd just bought a new set -- but the bulbs apparently had gone dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The blankets that we kept in the closet by the door had been ripening too long 
for my wife, so two weeks earlier she had given them to the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been on a closet-cleaning binge myself around Christmas and had thrown 
away the spare shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The water was down to one five-gallon bottle. The weather had been hot for 
three weeks, so we drank the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-aid kit had been pillaged through the years of its Band-Aids and 
aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 We had forgotten to rotate the canned goods for a couple of years, so cans 
that had green things on the labels had beige things inside. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried barbecuing chicken from the freezer before it spoiled, but without 
spices or barbecue sauce (all shattered and spilled) it was grim chewing. 
</P>
<P>
 By the second night we were down to crackers, Cup-a-Soup and ramen noodles. We 
tried the noodles, boiling them up and dropping in the little "flavor packets." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know about new ramen noodles, but 6 1/2-year-old ramen noodles are 
really, really terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the crisis, no neighbors came over to share our provisions. One 
night we went next door for grilled chicken, lamb and beef with another couple. 
They didn't even need our matches. 
</P>
<P>
 When the phones came back on Thursday, I had to decide whom to call first. I 
thought of letting my family on the East Coast know we were OK. I thought of 
calling my church to ask for prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I dialed information and asked for Domino's Pizza. We ordered a large 
bell-pepper-and-mushroom with extra cheese. I knew that $20 was going to be 
enough.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; THE DEBATE ON BILINGUAL EDUCATION POLARIZES SCHOOL 
FACULTIES; TEACHERS OPPOSED TO INSTRUCTION METHODS AIMED AT EDUCATING 
LIMITED-ENGLISH STUDENTS FORGET THAT THEIR OWN ANCESTORS OFTEN SPOKE IN OTHER 
TONGUES. 
</P>

Angeles Public Schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when teachers begin to nod off at a faculty meeting, someone mentions 
bilingual education. Eyes click open, and teachers divide into pro and con 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of their opinions, all teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District are receiving 24 hours of bilingual education training during four 
pupil-free days. Skip the mandated workshops and a teacher risks transfer or 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all attend, many grumble so vehemently that they're not hearing the 
message. Instead they describe how their European ancestors learned English 
without any special help. 
</P>
<P>
 This is America, and they shouldn't come here if they're not going to speak 
English.  
</P>
<P>
 Who's saying immigrants don't want to speak English? Check out any night 
school and you'll find classrooms with standing room only.  
</P>
<P>
 How quickly we forget that our Colonial ancestors lived in a multilingual 
community and that assimilation took generations. When Benjamin Franklin 
promoted a program to phase out all but English instruction in 1750, the 
Pennsylvania Germans voted him out of the Colonial assembly. Bilingual 
education stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the facts, there is little movement from one camp to the other. 
Everyone has an opinion, and few listen to anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
 During one of these compulsory workshops, Michael Genzuk, director of the USC 
School of Education Latino Teacher Project, hauled out some statistics. In the 
LAUSD, 86 languages are spoken. In California, 1,179,000 public school students 
are identified as having limited English proficiency. That's 23% of the state 
student population, and the number is growing. The Los Angeles figure is closer 
to 66%. 
</P>
<P>
 Our student population with primary languages other than English continues to 
grow. And that's the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the facts, opponents of bilingual education argue that it's 
impossible to teach in 86 languages. And they are absolutely right. In one of 
my English classes my students' primary languages include Vietnamese, Tagalog, 
Spanish, Mandarin and Egyptian. And there are only 20 students in the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Although teaching to a diverse student population is a formidable task, it is 
not impossible. Although called bilingual, the workshops do not demand that 
teachers speak Spanish. They offer strategies for teaching in "sheltered 
English," using devices which are helpful and relatively simple to employ. 
Things like slowing down, repeating the same idea in different ways, using 
visuals to supplement the reading, previewing the text so students have an idea 
what to expect, connecting new material to curriculum already mastered. It's 
just good teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there is a great reluctance to do what is perceived as dumbing 
down the curriculum. Outspoken critics, usually faculty members who are closest 
to retirement, can be heard defiantly declaring, "I'm not changing, and you 
can't make me." Fortunately, their numbers are dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind the compulsory training, and the hope, is that once 
educators confront the myths and examine the current school demographics, 
they'll be ready to learn the techniques for teaching a linguistically diverse 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, other issues cloud the debate. There's considerable resentment 
of the inclusion of politically correct hyphenated nationalisms which, I and 
many of my colleagues believe, further alienates us from one another and seems 
to endorse the non-acquisition of English. It doesn't help that the 
pro-bilingual advocates often insinuate that anyone who doesn't agree with them 
is a racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sparks have been flying in the faculty lounge, teachers try to keep 
their frustrations out of the classroom. We aren't always successful. 
</P>
<P>
 I share many of my colleagues' frustration over the fact that, in additions to 
the curriculum, I must teach about sex and AIDS, must counsel kids in crisis, 
must try to steer them away from drugs, must watch for signs of hunger and 
child abuse. In eighth-grade English we're working on manners. 
</P>
<P>
 On bilingual education I sit in the pro camp. The other issues are matters to 
be fought in other venues. The federal government has to re-examine its 
immigration policies. Parents have to be educated to feed and shelter and love 
their children so the schools won't have to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers have control only of their classrooms. And if the kids walking in the 
doors are unable to speak English, then we'll have to adjust our lessons, like 
it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, after all, for both advocates of bilingual education and for those 
who'd toss it out, is for all our graduates to be English-language proficient.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; MTA DEAL WITH MCA SELLS OUT THE PUBLIC; TRANSIT AGENCY'S 
CONCESSIONS TO THE ENTERTAINMENT GIANT OVER SUBWAY STATION SETS A DANGEROUS 
PRECEDENT THAT WILL PROVE COSTLY TO THE TAXPAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICK PATSAOURAS, Nick Patsaouras of Tarzana is an electrical engineer, a 
former board president of the Rapid Transit District and an alternate board 
member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month's agreement between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and 
the Music Corp. of America ending the controversy over the subway station in 
Universal City has been applauded in just about all quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, am not applauding. The agreement sells out the public and the MTA 
and sets precedents that will only mean more costs to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had been lobbying to force the MTA to make a costly change in 
plans and build the Metro Red Line station half a mile nearer to its hilltop 
entertainment complex. This complex includes Universal Studios and the CityWalk 
shopping center and will clearly benefit from easy access from a subway 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute ended with an agreement reached Feb. 23 that will leave the 
station on Lankershim Boulevard at the Hollywood Freeway. In return for MCA's 
withdrawal of its objections, the transportation agency agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Build two additional station entrances on the east side (the MCA side) of 
Lankershim and a tunnel under the street connecting them to the station, for an 
estimated $2 million. From there, MCA can build its own "people mover" to haul 
its customers up the hill to its parks, movie houses and CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spend about $4 million to widen Lankershim and add new ramps to and from the 
Hollywood Freeway to make it easier to get to the station -- and incidentally 
to MCA's entertainment businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy the adjacent MCA-owned property it needs for the new entrances, parking 
and other amenities surrounding the station, for $8.3 million if the appraised 
value is confirmed. The transportation agency was planning to condemn and 
purchase this property anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most significantly, not collect the assessment fees that property owners 
near enough to benefit from the station would otherwise be expected to pay. In 
the case of MCA, this amounts to about $6 million; of other property owners, 
about $2 million more. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that MCA apparently had planned to exercise its legal right to 
demand an election and vote down the fees, which it could have done since it 
owns three-fourths of the property immediately surrounding the station. But I 
believe it was a serious mistake for the MTA to make this part of the 
agreement. We ended up getting nothing at the negotiating table. Given the 
outcome, what was the point of negotiating? 
</P>
<P>
 Note that the giant entertainment company pays nothing. We taxpayers pay for 
everything.  
</P>
<P>
 We in public transportation worked hard to establish the principle that 
improvements in transportation enhance the value of private commercial 
property. We spent time, effort and money defending this program all the way to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. The MCA deal thus negates a decade of hard work and 
public policy development. Extended to other businesses in the future, the 
assessment giveaway could cost public transportation tens of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other property owners, meanwhile, will pay for proximity to subway stations 
already built or under construction. North Hollywood will pay the assessment 
for its station, because property owners agreed that they will benefit from it 
and the majority did not demand an election. It is too late for them to vote it 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we ask them, along with property owners along Wilshire Boulevard, 
Hollywood Boulevard, Vermont Avenue and downtown Los Angeles, to pay for the 
Metro Rail subway while MCA is exempted? 
</P>
<P>
 Some will claim that the agreement imposes a $20-million cost contribution for 
the people-mover to be paid by MCA. Hogwash! The agreement specifically leaves 
the decision on whether to build the people-mover up to MCA "in its sole 
discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding MTA's payment for traffic improvements, it agreed to restrict 
its station parking to 575 spaces instead of the 2,500 we planned originally. 
The agreement leaves MCA well-positioned to provide parking for subway riders 
and generate substantial income. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's look at the $8.3-million land deal. The agreement gives MCA all air 
rights and easements to develop its people-mover. But we have also granted the 
company the right of first offer should we seek to develop the land, for 
example with housing or shops. This will prevent us from soliciting competitive 
offers to help develop our landholdings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment company used all its local and federal political clout and a 
bevy of lobbyists to make this deal happen. Local politicians accepted the deal 
because it relieved them of the responsibility to fund some of the new 
improvements by transferring the cost to the MTA and to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a political settlement that gave away hard-won rights of a public 
agency for nothing in return.

STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; UNBEATEN BREA SETS STATE MARK WITH FIFTH TITLE; 
DIVISION III GIRLS: LADYCATS DEFEAT SAN JOSE ARCHBISHOP MITTY, 55-44, TO FINISH 
SEASON WITH 33-0 RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Upon pregame introductions at center court, Brea-Olinda basketball players 
handed their opponents shirts emblazoned with "Ladycat basketball" on it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, as they say in the game show biz, a lovely parting gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The shirt was the only thing Brea-Olinda gave to San Jose Archbishop Mitty on 
Saturday, except a 54-44 loss in the State Division III girls' championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats (33-0) walked off the Oakland Coliseum Arena court with 
considerably more than they gave up, including a probable No. 1 ranking in a 
national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 They left with a state-record fifth State championship, including a 
record-tying fourth in a row. Their appearance was a record sixth in a row. 
They left with 54 consecutive victories, and plenty of tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Four seniors -- Nicole Erickson, Colleen Hudson (six points, seven rebounds), 
Sarah Beckley (eight points, eight rebounds) and Susan Rhodabarger -- played on 
four consecutive State championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "For these four years, this has been the best girls' basketball program in the 
state," Brea-Olinda Coach John Hattrup said. "To come here this many years in a 
row -- they'll never be topped as a group. There's no Terri Mann or Cheryl 
Miller. Our 'stud' is 5 foot 6 and she's not the best athlete out there, but 
she plays with a heart as big as this room and everyone feeds off it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann played for San Diego Point Loma, which won four State titles from 
1983-87; Miller played for Riverside Poly, which won 84 consecutive games from 
1978-82. Both were dominant post players who were women among girls in stature 
and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda's star is Erickson, and the program has been 130-5 since she 
started her first varsity game as a freshman. The point guard whose 12-footer 
with 3.5 seconds left gave the Ladycats a 42-41 victory over Fair Oaks Bella 
Vista in last year's State championship, Erickson was unfazed by Archbishop 
Mitty's full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda scored 15 points off of 19 Archbishop Mitty turnovers. The 
Monarchs scored five points off of 12 Brea-Olinda turnovers. Erickson had a 
team-high 16 points, five steals and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her consistency of taking care of the basketball is unbelievable," said 
Archbishop Mitty Coach Sue Phillips, whose team finished 27-3. "It's not just 
her scoring ability, but because of her decision-making. She handled the press 
better than anybody we've seen. I can see why she's going to Purdue." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson's poise was contagious among her teammates. After missing nine of 
their first 10 shots, the Ladycats continued to look for the open man, 
rebounded effectively and never fell prey to Archbishop Mitty's tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had Plan A and B and we went with all of them," Phillips said. "They 
handled our various presses -- we went man press, we went zone press, we went 
man-to-man, we went zone. We tried a variety of things and they were very well 
prepared. They're an experienced group and we're young." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda had four starters from last year's State champion. Archbishop 
Mitty started one senior, two juniors and two sophomores, and the disparity 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbishop Mitty's last lead was 14-13 with 7:20 left in the second quarter. 
Then Brea-Olinda reveled in the rhythm of the game. They put on a passing 
clinic and scored six in a row: Hudson scored on a layup, Erickson scored on a 
6-foot running jumper and Beckley scored on a layup off Hudson's nifty pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats also were scoring on second and third shots. And junior Lee 
Moulin (11 points) asserted herself at the end of the quarter, scoring six of 
Brea-Olinda's final eight points to give the Ladycats a 31-25 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbishop Mitty continued to tinker with its plans, and opened the third 
quarter in a zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad idea. Moulin buried her second three-pointer, Erickson was good from 15 
feet and the Monarchs went back to a man defense. Sophomore Kiyoko Miller was 
good from 15 feet and then Erickson came back with a three-pointer as the shot 
clock expired. Brea-Olinda's lead was 12 entering the fourth quarter, 45-33. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson scored off her steal to open the fourth. It was then a 14-point game, 
and Archbishop Mitty had not scored more than 13 points in any quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54 points was Brea-Olinda's lowest total of the season (they beat Lynwood, 
55-40) and the 10-point margin of victory was the second-lowest. The Ladycats 
beat Lake Oswego (Ore.) Lakeridge by nine points and Garfield Heights (Ohio) 
Trinity by 10. At the time, Brea-Olinda was ranked fifth and Trinity sixth in 
the nation in a USA Today poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda's two previous State championship victories had been much closer. 
The Ladycats won by one last year, and beat Healdsburg, 47-44, the year before 
as Erickson's three-pointer with 30 seconds left iced the victory. They 
defeated Hayward Moreau, 54-46, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats were ranked second in the nation going into the game. Trinity, 
the team they beat earlier, defeated the No. 1 team, Pickerington, 59-54, in 
Saturday's Ohio State girls' championship. 
</P>
<P>
 After being through so much together -- setting their goal of being an 
unbeaten State champion and then beating three nationally rated teams to do it 
-- the postgame scene was emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like the ending of a piece of our lives we can never have back 
again," Erickson said, fighting back tears. "We've worked so hard for this. 
We've reached the dream. It's so hard when you reach your dream and do 
everything you've wanted to do. It's really special for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST IN U.S.?: Brea-Olinda probably will be No. 1 in this week's national 
girls' poll. C12 
</P>
<P>
 * FINISHING THE JOB: Mater Dei's conqueror, Los Angeles Crenshaw, wins the 
Division I boys' title. C12 The Streak

DEATH HITS PAINFULLY CLOSE TO HOME AGAIN FOR MICKEY MANTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Death was always so close to Mickey Mantle's consciousness that they became 
joking companions. But Mantle was always laughing at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd have known I was going to live so long, I'd have taken better care of 
myself," he said when he reached 60. It was his way of kidding the late-night 
mileage he'd burned off that marvelously imperfect body. 
</P>
<P>
 No male Mantle that he knew had lived past 40. He could deal with his own 
mortality. Losing a son is another kind of tragedy. Children are supposed to 
outlive their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Mantle, 36, died Saturday after collapsing at a drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation center near Dallas. The cause of death was a heart attack, a 
condition apparently worsened by Hodgkin's disease, according to Roy True, a 
close friend and Mantle's lawyer. Billy had Hodgkin's since he was 19. He'd had 
a heart problem for two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Mantle's other three sons, Billy was seldom involved in his father's 
businesses. He'd work on occasion at the fantasy camp Mantle and Whitey Ford 
ran together for a time. Billy didn't care to work on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of times were in spring training when the families of the players 
often would be in the same hotel. Joan and Whitey Ford walked in Fort 
Lauderdale Tuesday and remembered. "The Rizzutos would be on the second floor 
and the Mantles on the fourth and we'd be on the ground floor," Whitey Ford 
recalled wistfully. "Joan would always have the tub full of hot water because 
the kids would come out of the ocean frozen. At any time there would be two 
Mantles, two Fords and a Rizzuto in the tub. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought they were going to lose Billy a while ago. Then he got better; 
it's hard to figure. I think of all the years and good times." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgkin's was in Mickey's family. And his father, Mutt Mantle -- the man who 
named him Mickey after the great catcher Mickey Cochrane and the man who made 
him a switch hitter -- left him with a pattern for living. "So what the hell," 
Mutt said. "Live while you can." And Mickey did. 
</P>
<P>
 That first season with the Yankees, Mantle tore up a knee in the 1951 World 
Series. Mutt took Mickey to be examined at Lenox Hill Hospital. Getting out of 
the taxi, Mickey placed his hand for support on the shoulder of his father, who 
had played ball with him, who had swung the sledge beside him in the lead mines 
near Commerce, Okla. Mutt Mantle collapsed from the weight, his spine already 
ravaged by Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first Mickey knew of his father's condition. He'd known of his 
family's medical history since he was a child. He wrote in his 1985 
autobiography "The Mick" with Herb Gluck: 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1944 with me in ninth grade, Grandpa Charlie got very sick. He had 
Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer that attacks the lymph nodes and eventually 
penetrates bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I didn't understand death and sickness very well. . . . It just seemed 
that all my relatives were dying around me. First my Uncle Tunney, the tough 
one, then my Uncle Emmett. Within a few years -- before I was 13 -- they had 
died of the same disease . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I never forgot that moment, standing beside the casket with my little twin 
brothers Ray and Roy, the three of us looking down on him and my father 
whispering, 'Say goodbye to Grandpa.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey was playing football at Commerce High when he was kicked in the left 
shin, and by the next morning his ankle was grotesquely swollen and he had a 
fever of 104. Doctors talked for a time of amputation before penicillin 
controlled the condition. But there was another scar in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951 at Lenox Hill they put Mickey and his father in the same hospital 
room. They watched the rest of the World Series on television. Mantle wrote of 
the doctor knocking at their door: "It's . . . well, it's Hodgkin's disease, 
I'm afraid there's not much we can do. . . . You can take him home. Let him go 
back to work or whatever he wants. I'm sorry, Mick." 
</P>
<P>
 The next spring Mutt Mantle was gone. "What had happened to him in the 39 
years of his life, with all the scrambling and disappointments and 
frustrations?" Mantle asked in print 33 years later. "Where did it get him?" 
</P>
<P>
 So Mickey Mantle lived his own life to his father's bit of advice. Mickey 
laughed at himself and his drinking. He had such a good time. And he was great. 
One time he came off the disabled list a day earlier than he expected and was 
called on to pinch hit through the gray haze of his hangover. And he hit a home 
run. "Boys," he said, "you'll never know how hard that was." 
</P>
<P>
 It was just last month that Mantle realized there were whole segments of his 
career, of his life, that were lost in that gray haze. He admitted himself to 
the Betty Ford Clinic to try to fight the grip of 43 years of hard drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been out two weeks when Billy Mantle, the third of his four sons, the 
one named for Billy Martin, collapsed after leaving the cafeteria at the 
Intervention Judicial Treatment Center near Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 In later years Mantle lamented the time he didn't spend with his sons. They 
had spring training and usually wouldn't be together again until the end of the 
World Series. The boys had lives of their own in Dallas, and Mickey didn't have 
the All-Star break as a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, at 19, something else happened," Mantle wrote. "A small lump developed 
behind (Billy's) ear. . . . It turned out to be Hodgkin's disease, the same 
disease. . . . "I often wondered why the disease had skipped me. . . . I had 
been expecting it all my life. For that matter, why had it spared my brothers, 
my sister, and their children? Why had it picked Billy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Billy's spleen was removed. The disease slowed. Five years later the cancer 
had spread and he was given a 25% chance of survival. "Then Billy went into 
remission," Mantle wrote. "A miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd been in remission since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Mantle used to say he'd never live to collect his baseball pension. He 
was the first Mantle he knew to live past 40. He's 62. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't tried to call him yet," Ford said. "Let him have this time. I'll 
wait a day or two. I'll call."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; YOUNG TERPS MAKE SWEET 16; MIDWEST 
REGIONAL: LED BY FRESHMAN SMITH, 10TH-SEEDED MARYLAND SURPRISES SECOND-SEEDED 
MASSACHUSETTS, 95-87. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It served as a clear-cut warning to the teams remaining in the NCAA 
tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland has come of age. 
</P>
<P>
 With one of the youngest teams in Division I, the Terrapins celebrated their 
coming-out party with a come-from-behind 95-87 upset of second-seeded 
Massachusetts in the second round of the Midwest Regional at the Kansas 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 It was billed as a matchup between two of the most heralded freshmen in 
college basketball: centers Marcus Camby of Massachusetts and Joe Smith of 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Camby won the individual battle, but it was 10th-seeded Maryland that clearly 
won the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Camby finished with a career-high 32 points and 10 rebounds, Smith 
more than held his own in a more balanced Maryland attack. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored 22 points to join five other Maryland players in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same total he scored when Massachusetts defeated the Terrapins in 
December, 94-80. 
</P>
<P>
 That was about the only similarity between the games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just hot today," Massachusetts point guard Derek Kellogg said. 
"When you don't miss many of your shots and you make your free throws, you're 
going to be tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrapins (18-11) made 60% of their shots, 70.4% in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having a starting lineup that has two freshmen and three sophomores, 
Maryland maintained its poise from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrapins led most of the half behind the inside play of Smith and forward 
Keith Booth, another highly regarded freshman, and the outside shooting of 
guard Duane Simpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 They twice led by as many as six points, an alley-oop dunk by sophomore 
forward Exree Hipp giving Maryland a 30-24 lead with 6:55 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minutemen (28-7) took control for a while after that, going on a 13-0 run 
to take a 37-30 lead. The final points in the run came on a three-point basket 
by guard Mike Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts held a 43-38 lead at the half, nearly identical to its 45-40 
lead over the Terrapins in the first meeting between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Minutemen extended their advantage to 54-44 on a dunk by Camby 
early in the second half, the Terrapins regained control and kept it. 
</P>
<P>
 They went ahead to stay, 66-65, on a jumper by Hipp with 10:39 remaining and 
increased their lead to 14 several times. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, perhaps nobody was more impressed than Massachusetts Coach 
John Calipari. He remembered a conversation he had with Maryland Coach Gary 
Williams after the teams' first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Gary . . . that they were maybe two players away from being a Final 
Four team," Calipari said. "Maybe I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Calipari was happy with the performance of Camby, although he couldn't say the 
same for the rest of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcus Camby had simply a phenomenal game for us," he said. "There's no doubt 
that he's one of the best freshmen in the nation. But when it's all said and 
done, we have to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask what we could have 
done better." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing he could think of was guard Maryland's shooters a little 
more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shot 60%, and I can't tell you the last time a team did that against 
us," Calipari said. "They just wanted the game more than we did, plain and 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Maryland's Booth: "Coming into this tournament, we didn't know what to 
expect. But I think we showed what we're made of with our intensity today."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; WEAK POINTS EXPOSED; UCLA: TULSA 
IMMEDIATELY EXPLOITED PROBLEMS THAT TURNED THE BRUINS FROM A 14-0 TEAM INTO A 
7-7 ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After they turned off the television lights that were shining in his face 
Friday in the loser's locker room, Ed O'Bannon of UCLA hesitated slightly when 
he heard the question. 
</P>
<P>
 How did he think the Bruins were going to play against Tulsa? 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea, to be honest," O'Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the record show that nobody else did, either. The once-proud Bruins were 
totally out of their league against Tulsa, regular-season champion of the 
Missouri Valley Conference, in the first round of the Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Tulsa's 112-102 victory over the No. 17-ranked Bruins might be UCLA's 
worst NCAA tournament defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Bruins' second opening-game defeat since 1983, when UCLA was dumped 
by Utah, 67-61. Penn State upset the Bruins, 74-69, in the first round in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the 1983 team nor the 1991 team had been 14-0 and ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1981, the last time UCLA lost its opening game in the tournament was in 
1956, when Bill Russell scored 21 points in a San Francisco victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Add it all up, and losing to a 12th-seeded team, trailing by 46-17 at one 
point, does not end a season on an upbeat note. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins finished 21-7 and 13-5 in the Pacific 10 Conference, tied for 
second with California. 
</P>
<P>
 But losing to Tulsa? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's huge," O'Bannon said. "The expectations were huge, too. We tried not to 
worry about that. But I think our biggest problem was we played not to lose 
instead of to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Was the season a washout? 
</P>
<P>
 "We did some good things," he said. "Next year, hopefully we can do a little 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon has indicated he will be back at UCLA for his senior season, which 
means the only key players the Bruins will lose are 6-foot-6 shooting guard 
Shon Tarver and 6-9 backup center Rodney Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins have four key recruits coming in, including 6-11 center omm'A 
Givens, 6-9 J.R. Henderson, 6-4 Kris Johnson and 6-4 Toby Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's next season. This one can be traced to failures that never were 
corrected: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bruins were exposed as poor outside shooters, which made them 
vulnerable to zone defenses and enabled opponents to double-team UCLA's low 
post players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA did not play well in a half-court offense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defensively, UCLA did not get enough easy baskets on steals, rarely pressed 
and could be beaten back downcourt by a quick team. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa exploited UCLA's weaknesses from the opening tipoff. The fallout 
probably will come to rest on Coach Jim Harrick, who expects it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players always win the games, the coach always loses the games," he said. 
"That's the way things go." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick, who likes to point out the 20-victory seasons and NCAA tournament 
appearances in each of his six years at UCLA, said his record speaks for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "How big can you win, and how big are we going to need to win and can you 
survive without going to the Final Four?" Harrick said. "You will always be 
judged in Los Angeles unless you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is difficult to judge their numbers, the critics are always there, 
including many at Pauley Pavilion. Harrick will acknowledge only "a few" alumni 
who don't like him. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but after the Louisville game, his postgame news conference was held 
near the UCLA locker room to prevent a repeat of what happened at the end of 
the Cal game when he was derided as he walked across the court to an interview 
room at the other end of his own home court. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick said the loss to Tulsa did not damage his program and that the 
foundation for success is in place. He also would not say that a first-round 
defeat makes UCLA's season a failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tremendous disappointment, that's what it makes it," he said. The Harrick 
Era

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; TROJANS SURVIVE A SCARE; WOMEN: ATWATER, 
LESLIE MAKE KEY SHOTS TO HELP USC DEFEAT GEORGE WASHINGTON, 76-72, AFTER 
BLOWING 13-POINT LEAD.

 Lisa Leslie, in her final home game, powered the USC women's basketball team 
to a 76-72 NCAA tournament victory over George Washington Saturday night at the 
Sports Arena.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans thus survived the second round of the tournament and will move on 
to Fayetteville, Ark., site of the Mideast Regional semifinals and final 
Thursday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (25-3) plays Virginia (27-4) Thursday night, with Louisiana Tech (28-3) 
playing No. 1-ranked and top-seeded Tennessee (31-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Before an announced crowd of 1,776, Coach Cheryl Miller's team blew a 13-point 
halftime lead and even fell behind to the Colonials (22-8) in the stretch, but 
the 6-5 Leslie took over at crunch time and powered her team into the 
tournament's round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie picked up her fourth foul with 3:11 remaining, but still made a huge 
play that gave the Trojans breathing room in the frantic final seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 With 32 seconds to play and USC ahead, 71-70, Leslie took a pass from point 
guard Nicky McCrimmon. Guarded by Martha Williams, also 6-5, Leslie drove down 
the lane and made a six-foot jump shot to give the Trojans a 73-70 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 With 1:26 to play, George Washington's Darlene Saar had made two free throws 
to give the Colonials a 70-68 lead, but Tracy Atwater then made a three-point 
shot from the corner with 1:08 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After Leslie's drive down the lane for 73-70, George Washington called time 
out. Colleen McCrea of the Colonials missed a three-point shot with 15 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scramble for the rebound, USC freshman Tina Thompson was fouled. She 
made two free throws with 10 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it'd be close," Miller said. "George Washington has intensity, 
they're fundamentally sound and they have the athletes. Not once did we feel 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie scored a game-high 23 points in 29 minutes. She also had eight 
rebounds, three blocks and three steals.  
</P>
<P>
 George Washington made 10 of 19 three-point shots, three by Debbie Hemery.  
</P>
<P>
 Atwater's critical three-point basket notwithstanding, USC was again cold from 
long distance, making four of 12 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 How far can the Trojans go? 
</P>
<P>
 "They can win the national championship," George Washington Coach Joe McKeown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made big, big plays when they had to in the stretch. We've played very 
good teams -- Vanderbilt and Rutgers -- and SC has much more athleticism and 
better quickness than those teams. Also, they have a great bailout player in 
Leslie. Leslie made great plays against us, at both ends. She changed some of 
our shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "McCrimmon is a solid point guard, one of the best in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans seemed headed for a rout, particularly after they outscored the 
Colonials, 10-0, in the last 4:24 of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jualeah Woods had a three-pointer and a fast break layup in the streak 
as USC's lead grew from 31-28 to 41-28. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Miller started the second half without Leslie, who had three fouls, 
the Trojans frittered away their halftime away.

 Quick recovery: NCAA probation often seems a mere annoyance, rather than 
devastation to a basketball program.On probation in recent years, Illinois, 
Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and Syracuse recovered quickly enough to play in 
the NCAA tournament this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the company: Word is that there was much grousing on the New York 
Yankee bus from Sarasota, Fla., back to their spring base at Ft. Lauderdale 
after a game against the Chicago White Sox. Word is that it might have been 
because owner George Steinbrenner was aboard. JIM HODGES

 Turn out the lights, the polka's over. 
</P>
<P>
 That Cinderella of America's dairyland, Wisconsin Green Bay, bowed out of the 
Big Polka, falling to fourth-seeded Syracuse, 64-59, Saturday, leaving without 
ever realizing what an underdog it had been. 
</P>
<P>
 UWGB chased the Orangemen into the last two minutes when its best shooter, 
guard John Martinez, found himself unexpectedly open at eight feet and, with a 
chance to put his team ahead, missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the clock struck 12 when John's runner rimmed out," said Coach Dick 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I heard the clock strike 12. I thought I saw the big pumpkin roll 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 It was fun while it lasted, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about these North men was colorful, from their names -- Ludvigson, 
Nordgaard, VanderVelden, Grzesk -- to their cheerleaders who actually did 
polkas, to their Cheese Head pep band, to their local hostelry, a truck stop 
called the Flying J, to their witty coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Their upset of California was Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim's worst nightmare, 
subjecting him to yet another round of questions suggesting that Bennett had 
unskilled players with superior intelligence, not to mention coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeheim countered that the Green Bay players were underrated athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I'm Olympic caliber," said Bennett, a short man in his 50s, laughing, 
"because I think I can outrun all our guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Loath to abandon the David role in this morality play, Bennett joked about 
everything, like comparisons of his team to Princeton, another slow-down slayer 
of the mighty. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really smart," he said. "We're a state school. Doesn't cost a lot to 
go to Wisconsin Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get them (Princeton) to come down to our holiday tournament. 
Coach Pete (Carrill) is interested in coming. Probably set basketball back 100 
years, but people in Green Bay will enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Bennett's troupe of "discerning players without options" did what 
they usually do, throw a monkey wrench into the works of a superior machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Cal, Syracuse was prepared, psychologically and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the Orangemen 12:04 to get their first lead, but they went up, 37-26, 
at halftime and 50-37 before the improbable happened again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin Green Bay rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse led, 58-57, with 1:40 left when Martinez drove to the baseline, 
popped into the clear, and, surprised, pulled the string on his shot and left 
it short. 
</P>
<P>
 "I passed the first guy and I thought someone else was coming," Martinez said. 
"I was actually looking to pass the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 With 35 seconds left and the Orangemen ahead, 61-57, Green Bay's Ben Berlowski 
drove the baseline, hit a layup, bounced off a Syracuse player, fell to the 
floor . . . and was called for charging by referee Lenny Wirtz, who also wiped 
out the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who'd he run into?" asked someone on press row. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran into Lenny Wirtz," said a member of the statistics crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said later that as soon as the disappointment ebbed, he expected to 
feel proud. Indeed, he thought it might do wonders for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there's somebody out there," he said, "who thinks, 'I don't mind 
wearing a parka for nine months. I want to be there."' 
</P>
<P>
 Polka on, Dick.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; WEST REGIONAL / AT OGDEN, UTAH; 
MISSOURI HAS NO PROBLEM DUMPING WISCONSIN

 If the NCAA tournament was over-Wisconsined, the balance was redressed 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin Green Bay lost in the opener, and Wisconsin Madison fell in the 
nightcap, put to the torch by top-seeded Missouri, 109-96. Now America's 
Dairyland is down to a single representative, Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri moves on to face Syracuse Thursday in the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Norm Stewart unleased his 11-deep bench on the young, clumsy Badgers. 
After 40 minutes of pressing defense and red-hot shooting, Missouri advanced 
easily, having led by as many as 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers shot 68%. 
</P>
<P>
 They made 12 of 19 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Melvin Booker scored 35 points in 29 minutes, making 11 of 14 shots and 
six of eight three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Badgers fell all over themselves. Rashard Griffith, Wisconsin's 
6-foot-11, 265-pound freshman center, got into foul trouble, played only 16 
minutes and was outscored by Missouri's 6-9 Jevon Crudup, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some great teams at Missouri," Coach Norm Stewart said, "but we 
haven't had any that's done better with what they have." 
</P>
<P>
 Just in the nick of time too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers were picked to finish third in the Big Eight, but went 14-0. Their 
storybook season was interrupted by the suspensions of Crudup, arrested for 
driving under the influence of alcohol at the start of the season, and reserve 
guard Paul O'Liney for Thursday's first-round game after he was accused of 
hitting a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri had lost in the first round in six of its last eight NCAA tournament 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers' game Thursday was held up while the game clock was repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said he began wondering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played at Greensboro one year and the building was hit by lightning three 
times,"he said. "We spent an hour in the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Maybe somebody really doesn't want me here.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's getting less. From cancer (Stewart sat out the 1989 tournament while 
undergoing surgery for colon cancer) through lightning. We're down to just 
losing the clock."

TOP-SEEDED MISSOURI SHOOTS DOWN WISCONSIN'S UPSET BID, 109-96

<P>
 Melvin Booker scored a career-high 35 points, and Missouri took advantage of 
Rashard Griffith's sparse playing time to beat Wisconsin 109-96 Saturday in the 
second round of the West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk-on Paul O'Liney returned from a one-game suspension to score 14 
first-half points for Missouri in a game that saw the teams set an NCAA 
tournament record with 27 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Liney, suspended for punching a woman in a Missouri bar, sparked a 
first-half rally that helped the Tigers overcome a career-high 36 points by 
Michael Finley. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri, the region's No. 1 seed and the nation's fifth-ranked team, advanced 
to a West semifinal Thursday against Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin played much of the game without Griffith, its freshman center 
sensation, who got in foul trouble early and wasn't a factor. Griffith, who had 
22 points and 15 rebounds in a first-round victory over Cincinnati, had only 
six points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri center Jevon Crudup also sat out much of the first half with foul 
trouble, but outside shooters for the two teams more than made up for the 
absence of the big men. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Tracy Webster's seven 3-pointers, the teams topped the previous 
tournament record of 25 3-points in a 1990 game between Loyola Marymount and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri shot 71 percent in the second half and 68 percent for the game. 
Wisconsin shot 42 percent.

WEST REGIONAL / AT OGDEN, UTAH; SYRACUSE POPS WISCONSIN GREEN BAY'S BUBBLE

<P>
 Adrian Autry refused to panic when Wisconsin-Green Bay rallied against his 
Syracuse. Instead, he went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry scored 16 points, including a key basket and free throw in the final 
minute, as the 15th-ranked Orangemen beat the Phoenix 64-59 Saturday and 
advanced to next week's NCAA West Regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our games this year have been close -- we know how to win the close 
games," he said. "It was just a hard-fought game. We made the right adjustments 
and made the shots when we needed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Moten led the fourth-seeded Orangemen (23-6) with 17 points, while 
John Wallace added 16 as Syracuse, which missed last year's tournament because 
of NCAA probation, advanced to the Sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Boeheim credited the Orangemen's tight zone defense for frustrating 
the Phoenix's deliberate halfcourt offensive style. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin-Green Bay made just 39 percent of its shots, while Syracuse shot 49 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt we didn't want to play them man-to-man," Boeheim said. "It wasn't 
meant to be a whole game of zone, but it was so effective we couldn't come out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Nordgaard scored 19 points for Wisconsin-Green Bay (27-7), which ended 
its second NCAA trip as its best. In 1991, the Phoenix lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 John Martinez added 13 points for the 12th-seeded Phoenix, who upset 
California on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't grind zones the way we can man-to-man," Wisconsin-Green Bay coach 
Dick Bennett said. "Had they been playing man in the second half, I think we 
could've gotten that thing ... nailed them and gotten the right people open." 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse, which now goes on to Los Angeles next week, had led by 14 points 
with 15 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's 3-pointer began a 16-6 run and the Phoenix closed to 52-48. Jeremy 
Ludvigson's free throws and, with 3:01 remaining, a driving layup cut the lead 
to 58-57. But the rally stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucious Jackson made the first of two free throws, and Otis Hill rebounded the 
miss, giving the Orangemen possession with 1:28 left. As the game entered its 
final minute, Autry pulled up for an eight-foot jumper to re-establish 
Syracuse's lead at 61-57. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Berlowski made two free throws with 17 seconds left, leaving 
Wisconsin-Green Bay down by three points. But Autry made the second of two free 
throws a second later to wrap it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix, getting two early 3-pointers from Martinez, led 12-7 seven 
minutes into the game. But the Orangemen soon got their fast break going and 
pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Moten's two layups -- one off his own steal, the other off a blocked shot -- 
keyed a 16-3 run that gave Syracuse a 23-15 lead 5:35 before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-2 spurt, capped by Autry's 20-footer, put Syracuse ahead by 16 points, 
but Nordgaard's jumper and a 3-pointer in the final minute trimmed the halftime 
deficit to 37-26.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; MIDWEST REGIONAL / AT WICHITA, 
KAN.; MICHIGAN BEST IN THE STRETCH, DEFEATS TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Michigan has apparently mastered the fine art of walking a tightrope. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving an overtime scare against Pepperdine in the first round of the 
NCAA Midwest Regional on Thursday, the Wolverines were tested again by Texas in 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 This time they had a little more margin for error. But only a little. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind junior Juwan Howard, who had a career-high 34 points and a season-high 
18 rebounds, Michigan held on for an 84-79 victory in the Midwest Regional at 
the Kansas Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you say, this was a sweet win for us," Michigan Coach Steve 
Fisher said. "Texas is a great team, and it was great to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 The third-seeded Wolverines (23-7) withstood a challenge by Texas in the final 
minute to advance to the Sweet 16 for the third season in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas (26-8) closed to within 76-75 on a jumper in the lane and a free throw 
with 55.8 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michigan made all eight of its free throws after that to secure another 
victory. Guards Jimmy King and Jalen Rose each made four. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the Wolverines' secret to winning the close ones? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just a strong team, and we play well under pressure," forward Ray 
Jackson said. "Every team we've played in the tournament since I can remember 
has given us their best shot, and we've withstood it." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan had every reason to expect the worst against Texas. The sixth-seeded 
Longhorns had won 19 of their last 20 games and defeated Western Kentucky by 14 
points in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 And, midway through the second half, Texas took a 58-52 lead on a dunk by 
forward Albert Burditt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michigan regained control in the closing minutes, going ahead to stay at 
68-66 on two free throws by Rose with 4:22 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Coach Tom Penders gave much of the credit to Michigan's defense. The 
Wolverines were particularly effective in neutralizing the Longhorns' usually 
reliable three-point shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Longhorns made only five of 21 three-point shots and senior guard B.J. 
Tyler was only six of 24 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his shooting difficulty, Tyler still led Texas with 22 points. Guard 
Terrence Rencher scored 16 points before fouling out late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 For Michigan, Rose had 17 points, Jackson 15 points and 14 rebounds and King 
12 points.

 Juwan Howard scored 34 points, and Michigan made 10 of 11 free throws in the 
final 1:27 to beat Texas 84-79 Saturday night in the second round of the NCAA 
Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-seeded Wolverines, 10-for-10 from the line in a 78-74 overtime 
victory over Pepperdine in the first round, need two more wins for their third 
consectuive trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan (23-7) plays Maryland in the Regional semifinals at Dallas on 
Thursday. The Terrapins upset Massachusetts 95-87. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy King, a 68-percent foul shooter, made a free throw for a 75-70 lead with 
1:27 left, but the Longhorns closed to 76-75 with 55 seconds remaining on a 
three-point play by slump-ridden B.J. Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
 King made two free throws for a 78-75 lead with 41 seconds to go, and 15 
seconds later made two more for an 80-75 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jalen Rose was 4-for-4 at the line during the final 87 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-seeded Wolverines, who lost to Duke and North Carolina in the last 
two championship games, refused to let the quick-hitting Longhorns (26-8) 
dictate their run-and-gun style of play and made full use of the inside muscle 
and height advantage of the 6-foot-9 Howard and the 6-8 Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second loss in 21 games for Texas, the lone team in the 
tournament from the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler, the Southwest Conference player of the year, was 6-for-24 following a 
2-for-13 slump against Western Kentucky on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tyler's best stretch, he made three free throws after he was fouled on 
a 3-point attempt, then converted a three-point play. The Longhorns came back 
from a five-point deficit and took a 52-48 lead with 14:55 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead changed hands five times in the next eight minutes, with Howard 
scoring three straight baskets for the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard also had 18 rebounds for Michigan, which got 17 points from Rose and 15 
ponts and 14 rebounds from Ray Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, which tied its school record for victories, got 22 points from Tyler, 
13 from Roderick Anderson and 16 from Terrence Rencher. Center Albert Burditt, 
who had 26 points in the first-round victory over Western Kentucky, scored 
eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, working mostly against former Wolverine-turned-Longhorn Rich McIver, 
made three straight baskets on a 9-1 spurt that gave Michigan a 28-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas came back with a 10-0 run, and led 32-30 after Burditt's basket.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; SOUTHEAST REGIONAL / AT LEXINGTON, 
KY.; KANSAS FRESHMEN HEED THEIR ELDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kansas is a team with NCAA tournament veterans who were ready to offer some 
advice to freshmen Scot Pollard and Jacque Vaughn on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe offer is too mild a term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seniors got on us pretty hard at halftime," Pollard said. The Jayhawks 
trailed by four points at the break. "They told us we have to step up our play. 
</P>
<P>
 They did, Pollard completing two three-point plays during a decisive 11-0 run 
and Vaughn scoring 12 points in the final 20 minutes in sparking Kansas to a 
69-58 victory over Wake Forest in the NCAA Southeast Regional at Rupp Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, I didn't want it to be my last game," Pollard said. "I wanted to get 
out there and play, and play well. We came out a lot harder and played our 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-seeded Kansas (27-7) will face top-seeded Purdue on Thursday night in 
Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest (21-12) rallied from a 43-39 deficit to go ahead, 49-48, on 
Randolph Childress' shot in the lane with 9:08 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollard, who finished with 13 points, then started Kansas' decisive run with a 
jump hook and free throw. After Steve Woodberry made a layup, Pollard made 
another three-point play for a 56-49 Kansas lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just doing what I was supposed to be doing -- just posting up inside," 
said Pollard. "I was excited. Hopefully I won't have to make those kinds of 
plays in the future. I'm not used to that kind of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn capped Kansas' run with a three-pointer from the left wing for a 59-49 
margin with 6:21 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-seeded Wake Forest went 8:06 without a field goal after Childress' 
go-ahead basket, ending the drought on Rusty LaRue's three-pointer with 1:02 to 
go. The Demon Deacons missed 10 shots and turned the ball over four times 
during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last 10 minutes of the game belonged to Kansas," said Childress. "Their 
defensive pressure toughened and Kansas made all the keys plays when they had 
to have them."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; SOUTHEAST REGIONAL / AT LEXINGTON, 
KY.; ROBINSON GETS HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS

 Glenn Robinson and his supporting cast, that's Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final 15 minutes Saturday, Robinson needed support in the top-seeded 
Boilermakers' 83-73 victory over Alabama at Rupp Arena in the second round of 
the NCAA Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to step up as a team, and we did," Purdue guard Matt Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, the nation's leading scorer, finished with 33 points, but had only 
six in the final 15 minutes and only two in the last four minutes while his 
teammates put the Crimson Tide away. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (28-4) appeared to have control at halftime, leading, 40-31. Robinson 
had scored half of the Boilermakers' points. Alabama (20-10) started the second 
half with a 13-2 run to take a 44-42 lead with 16:40 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always tell the team to set the tone in the first five minutes of a half," 
Alabama Coach David Hobbs said. "We've been behind before and didn't think it 
would be be very difficult to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. Staying ahead was another matter, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue regained the lead for good, 47-46, with 15:10 left on a layup by 
Robinson, who scored the Boilermakers' first seven points of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his teammates took over because Alabama shut Robinson down, usually with 
a shorter defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddell and Cuonzo Martin each had 11 points for the Boilermakers and Waddell 
added eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to disrespect Glenn Robinson, but we didn't come out in awe of 
Glenn Robinson," said Jamal Faulkner, who led Alabama with 25 points and 11 
rebounds. "We had to contend with Purdue as a team, and they beat us as a team, 
not one man." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the perception exists as Purdue heads for a game against Kansas on 
Thursday in the region semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But not in the mind of Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have won, 73-33, if we just played Glenn Robinson," he said. 
"Everybody's got good players at this level. To make it Glenn Robinson and 
nobody else, that's a bunch of bull."

 Matt Maloney majors in history at an Ivy League school, which should help him 
land a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 He also could get a union card as a mason. 
</P>
<P>
 Maloney, Pennsylvania's leading scorer all season, laid plenty of bricks 
Saturday in the Quakers' 70-58 loss to Florida in the second round of the NCAA 
East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made some bad decisions on shot selection," Maloney said. "I knew I wasn't 
shooting well, but I had confidence that the next one was going in." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. Normally a 34% shooter from long range, Maloney missed 14 of 16 
three-point shots and made only four of 21 shots overall. 
</P>
<P>
 While he kept missing, Florida's Dan Cross and Craig Brown scored 16 points 
during a 20-9 run midway through the second half that led the third-seeded 
Gators (23-7) to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn (25-3) closed to within 44-43, but Maloney pulled up from 20 feet and 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next 90 seconds, Cross made two free throws, Brown made a three-point 
basket, Maloney missed another three-point shot and Brown made his third of the 
game to put the Gators in control, 52-43.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; EAST REGIONAL / AT UNIONDALE, N.Y.; 
DARE CAN'T HANDLE HUSKIES BY HIMSELF 
</P>

<P>
 There was no question where George Washington wanted the ball to go, and no 
question that Connecticut was going to try to cut it off at the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies didn't let 7-foot-1 Yinka Dare beat them, and George Washington 
didn't have anyone else who could help in UConn's 75-63 victory Saturday in the 
second round of the NCAA East Regional at the Nassau Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Connecticut (29-4) advanced to a game against Florida -- a 
winner over Pennsylvania on Saturday -- in the final 16 of the NCAA tournament 
by holding the Colonials to 29% shooting. Dare scored 19 points, making nine of 
15 shots, but his teammates missed 46 of 58. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-pointer by Brian Fair and a three-point play by Doron Sheffer sparked 
a 17-4 burst that broke a 43-43 tie and sent UConn ahead, 60-47, with 5:19 
left. Dare got one shot during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put two or three people on Yinka Dare and that forced their guards to take 
outside shots," said Donyell Marshall, who led the Huskies with 18 points. "I 
think he got tired at the end and didn't want the ball as much." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no, said Dare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired, but that wasn't the reason I wasn't getting the ball," the 
Nigerian said. "It was more that they did a great job with their collapsing 
zone, keeping the ball away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall capped the run with four free throws and a layup, his first basket in 
nearly 24 minutes and the only one he hit in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed six of his last seven shots but made eight of nine free throws in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennis and golf are individual sports where you worry about how you do 
individually," said Marshall, who was held below 20 points for only the fourth 
time all season. "If I keep playing like this and we keep winning, I'm OK. This 
team is good enough to pick it up when I'm in a slump." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall scored 11 points in the first 11 minutes and seven in the last nine 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut built a 38-30 lead after scoring the first five points of the 
second half, but the Colonials, who never led, came back to tie the score three 
times, the last, 43-43, with 12:31 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington Coach Mike Jarvis, a former assistant at Northeastern under 
Jim Calhoun, Connecticut's coach, said his team's inability to take the lead 
after tying the score was a huge factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a tremendous amount of pressure on Connecticut," Jarvis said. "I 
think they'll play better when they play teams the public regards as a 
legitimate threat. Everyone looked at this region as the Connecticut 
Invitational, and it made them play tight. If we had ever taken the lead, I 
think it would have made them even tighter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonials closed to 66-59 with 1:47 left. But UConn sealed the victory at 
the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwame Evans had 21 points and 10 rebounds for George Washington, and Dare had 
12 rebounds. Donny Marshall scored 14 points and Sheffer 13 for UConn. 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington (18-12) missed its first seven shots and 14 of its first 16. 
The Colonials trailed by as many as 11 points before pulling within three at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the gate, we were moving the ball and playing defense, then we hit a 
lull," Calhoun said. "I don't think we were celebrating too early. We just quit 
paying attention to the little details of the game."

'CONTAINED' OIL SPILL REACHES RIVER; ENVIRONMENT: LEAK FROM A UNOCAL TANK FLOWS 
INTO THE SANTA CLARA. IT'S THIRD INCIDENT TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT REPORTING 
SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An oil spill, uninvestigated for eight days after it was reported as minor, 
flowed into the Santa Clara River on Saturday, prompting state inspectors to 
converge on a Santa Paula oil field to assess damage and blame. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials acknowledged that they were embarrassed by their failure to 
move faster, but said Unocal reported March 12 that the spill had been 
contained without threatening nearby waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 The leak is the third in three months in Ventura County to raise questions 
about the reporting system that state officials and environmentalist watchdogs 
rely on to safeguard sensitive habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest spill, a 30,000-gallon mixture of light crude oil and water, wound 
its way down a remote Santa Paula canyon and into the Santa Clara River after 
overflowing from a Unocal storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt it's in the Santa Clara River and on its way to the ocean," 
said state Department of Fish and Game Lt. Chris Long, assigned to the case 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports from Fish and Game wardens said no wildlife or habitat were 
severely damaged as a result of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Thick globs of oil covered the edges of Adams Barranca on Saturday -- seven 
days after the state Office of Emergency Services was told of the release. The 
barranca is a small tributary that merges into the Santa Clara River before 
moving water on to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators at the site said the state was notified by telephone of the 
release by Unocal executives March 12, but that information from the oil 
company prompted wardens to delay their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Long, Unocal told the state that the release was contained and 
had not entered any waterways. Based on that information, a local investigator 
"did not see it as something he had to respond to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was reported in the waterways, we would have responded (immediately)," 
Long said. "It's embarrassing for all of us."  
</P>
<P>
 But Dick Marshall, a field superintendent for Unocal, defended his report to 
state officials, saying the rain Saturday might have caused some of the oily 
residue to flow into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said his interpretation of the law was that the barranca is not a waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 "A waterway is something like the Santa Clara River," he said. "Not Adams 
Barranca." 
</P>
<P>
 Long, who interviewed Unocal workers at the company's Santa Paula facility for 
much of Saturday, has requested internal company documents relating to the 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said that although Unocal told the state March 12 that the spill was 
contained, he received reports of crude oil in the barranca under the Foothill 
Road bridge within the past three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no free-flowing oil, but there were signs that someone was cleaning 
up," Long said. "There were booms, sheen on rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said seismic activity, apparently after the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, had caused a substantial increase in the amount of oil 
that seeps naturally from century-old tunnels in Adams Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Production foreman Walker Kozer said the company maintains a series of pipes 
along the tunnel edges that collect the crude and transport it to nearby 
storage tanks. But the tanks can only hold 100 barrels -- 4,200 gallons -- 
before overflowing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw some oil going over the weir, and that cascaded over into a sheen," 
Kozer said. "There's no way to shut it off." 
</P>
<P>
 The company replaced the 100-barrel storage tanks with 500-barrel tanks last 
week, Kozer said. At least two dozen workers were on site every day to clean up 
the oil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dammed it up, sopped it all up and cleaned it up," said Kozer, who called 
the effort 80% complete on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal estimated that just 500 of the 30,000 gallons that flowed over the edge 
of the storage tank were actual crude oil. But Kozer later said that the 
estimate was a guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been 10 barrels, it could have been 15," he said. "But it 
looked like about 12 to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The spill was reported to county fire officials Friday evening by Ken and Joy 
Chapman, who own seven acres of citrus and avocado trees along the barranca. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response was they came out and said they didn't see anything," computer 
programmer Ken Chapman said Saturday afternoon as he watched the oily sheen 
travel downstream. "Now it's been like this for the past 20 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Capt. Norm Plott said he sent a crew to investigate the Chapmans' 
report moments after their phone call Friday evening. But it was too dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't see any oil in the river," he said. "With flashlights, a sheen 
is a hard thing to detect." 
</P>
<P>
 Plott and the county hazardous materials team, which was called out Saturday 
morning after the fire crew returned to reinspect the site, were called off the 
incident at midday and replaced by Fish and Game inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Roger Reese, who heads the local Fish and Game office, said the Unocal 
spill was relatively small. But it is dangerous enough to disrupt the sensitive 
ecosystem that inhabits the rivershed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time that you have oil in water in this way, it presents a hazard," Reese 
said. "It's toxic for fish or animals that come in contact with it, and it can 
be taken up into the food chain, presenting hazards to creatures higher up in 
the food chain." 
</P>
<P>
 James Greaves, an environmental biologist based in Santa Barbara, said the 
spill could threaten an array of ecologically sensitive species, including 
federally endangered birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the main breeding grounds for the least Bells vireo," said 
Greaves, inspecting the barranca near the Chapmans' home Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill "will have an immediate effect on the vegetation, but it has the 
potential to severely impact other food sources," Greaves said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental watchdogs and government officials say several recent spills 
have been misreported. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 84,000 gallons of thick crude oil leaked into McGrath Lake near 
Oxnard after a state park ranger and six other law enforcement agencies ignored 
early reports of the spill. Bush Oil Co. executives admitted that a pipeline 
leaked for three days before it was noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, local prosecutors served a search warrant at a Texaco facility 
in Ventura, suspecting that the oil company failed to report the true extent of 
a 370,000-gallon release of a petroleum byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing reporting system "seems to allow self-monitoring and 
self-regulation by the polluter," said John Buse, a staff attorney with the 
Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changes in the reporting (requirements) should at least be looked at, and if 
necessary adopted." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Baggerly of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County agreed that the 
laws should be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Self-reporting isn't working well in all cases," she said. "The (state) 
hasn't demonstrated that it is exercising its duties as an enforcement agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal has failed to come clean about its spills in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a San Luis Obispo court ordered the company to pay $1.5 million 
for failing to report that up to 8.5 million gallons of a diesel-like liquid 
had leaked at the firm's Guadalupe oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crews in Santa Barbara County worked Saturday to clean up 2,000 
gallons of crude that spilled from a Mobil Oil processing facility at Elwood 
Beach north of Santa Barbara late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil Oil confirmed that the spill was detected when golfers noticed oil 
oozing into an area near the 12th hole tee at the Sandpiper Golf Course, which 
is next to Mobil's Elwood Beach facility, said Mobil spokeswoman Shauna Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said that crews worked all day Friday and most of Saturday to build 
holding dams on the beach, where the light crude had flowed, Clarke said.

RAINS CAUSE FLOODING, ACCIDENTS; WEATHER: INTENSE SHOWERS KEEP AUTHORITIES AND 
UTILITIES BUSY. THE STORM IS EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE TODAY.

 An intense storm that dropped nearly an inch of rain on Ventura County on 
Saturday, causing fender-benders and power outages, should dissipate today 
after morning showers, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's semi-tropical system, which forecasters said had been hovering over 
the Pacific Ocean for several days before moving across Southern California 
this weekend, caused several minor traffic accidents and a power failure after 
lightning struck a transformer in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Another storm system from the Gulf of Alaska is expected to move into the 
region later this week, and could bring more rain Thursday, forecasters said. 
Highs today, the first day of spring, will be in the mid-60s to low 70s with 
cloudy skies. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning for possible mud 
and debris slides in the canyon areas that burned during last October's fires, 
but officials and nearby residents said the charred hillsides were not washed 
out by the brief but heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm brought periods of heavy rain that caused minor flooding in some 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a few areas in Camarillo that reported backed-up drains," Lt. Gary 
Backman said. "We did have a considerable amount of alarms going off, which may 
have been due to power failures. It could have also been caused by the rain." 
</P>
<P>
 The intense showers and lightning flashes kept law enforcement officials and 
power companies scrambling Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very busy," said Southern California Edison spokesman Steven Conroy. 
"The lightning has caused small interruptions of service in some areas." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department said fire officials were 
busy Saturday morning responding to traffic accident calls but said that as the 
storm tapered off in the afternoon, so did the number of incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 One accident involving four vehicles on the Ventura Freeway in Thousand Oaks 
resulted in a woman being transported to the hospital and her dog rescued from 
her car by animal control. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, also on the Ventura Freeway near Rice Road in Oxnard, left two 
Camarillo residents shaken after their car spun out. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain caused some county events to be canceled, while others went ahead, 
rain or shine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like it rained the least here. The pavement's dry," said Brian 
Smith, a Lake Casitas park ranger. Smith said sporadic showers there didn't 
dampen the spirits of those attending the Ojai Renaissance Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans at Oxnard College to lay sod for another soccer field to be used by 
teams training for the upcoming World Cup were postponed, as were presentations 
for children at the Moorpark College Teaching Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about ready to float away," zoo worker Amy Hopkins said. "It was just 
pouring." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins said the animals, especially the tigers and mountain lions, were 
hiding indoors because of the wet weather. "They kind of come out and shake 
their paws, but that's about it. They won't come out when it rains." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, at least three people were killed in traffic accidents on 
slick streets.

CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS; EDUCATION: CHILDREN ABOUT TO MAKE THE MOVE FROM ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL TO JUNIOR HIGH OR MIDDLE SCHOOL HARBOR A NUMBER OF FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every spring, officials from junior high and middle schools across Ventura 
County visit local elementary schools to field questions from children who are 
about to graduate from the primary grades. 
</P>
<P>
 And every year many of the questions are the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question I most often get asked when I go out to talk to fifth-graders," 
said Charlotte McElroy, principal of Anacapa Middle School in Ventura, is, 'Is 
it true I'm going to get put in a trash can?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trash-canning, a form of hazing, is when older students dump a younger 
classmate into a large trash can. Although McElroy said she's not aware of a 
single instance of trash-canning at Anacapa in at least 10 years, the fear 
persists. 
</P>
<P>
 So does the fear of middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 For children about to make the transition from the cloistered atmosphere of 
elementary school to the more or less structured environment of junior high or 
middle school, the prospect of getting picked on by older students is only one 
of their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 They also worry about how they will remember their locker combinations, 
whether they will be able to make it to their different classes before the late 
bells ring and if they will make friends with the new children they meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transition from sixth grade to junior high is the most difficult" of any 
in a student's school career, said Phil Parish, principal of Manzanita School 
in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 And some parents may have just as much fear of the transition as their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Some private and parochial schools around Ventura County report that one of 
the most common times for parents to pull children out of public school is when 
the youngsters leave elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, parents' fears about sending their children to junior high or 
middle school reflect a natural concern about their youngsters' becoming more 
independent, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of psychologically a time that they know that their child is really 
going to be growing up," McElroy said. "They're facing the idea that their 
child is going to be leaving the nest." 
</P>
<P>
 In elementary school, children generally stay in the same classroom all day 
with one or possibly two teachers who get to know their students -- and even 
some families -- fairly well. But students at junior high and middle schools 
change classes, having anywhere from three to six teachers each day. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents' concerns on middle school or junior high are more than just 
anxiety over their children growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle schools and junior highs have, educators concede, more fights, more 
drugs, more students carrying weapons than in elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And parents know it. 
</P>
<P>
 School safety is one of the most common reasons parents cite when enrolling 
their sixth- or seventh-grade children in private school rather than sending 
them to a public middle school or junior high, private school principals say. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Reina High, a private Catholic school in Thousand Oaks, Principal Stan 
Hirsch said the number of applications for the seventh grade has risen about 
15% in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question about safety" is the chief reason cited by parents, Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the principal of the exclusive Ojai Valley School said he has also seen an 
increase in applications from parents in Ventura County and elsewhere who want 
to take their children out of public school rather than enroll them in junior 
high or middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are concerned about social situations, neighborhood situations and peer 
pressure," Ojai Valley Principal Mike Hall-Mounsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 While elementary schools typically draw children from only one neighborhood, 
junior high and middle schools take students from a larger, more diverse area. 
</P>
<P>
 "All kinds of kids from all kinds of neighborhoods are going to be meshing and 
mixing," McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 So students in junior high and middle school have a wider selection of peer 
groups to choose from, educators say, which leads parents to worry if their 
children will fall in with the wrong crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks parent Eve Dixon said that when her daughter entered the seventh 
grade last year at a local intermediate school, the girl became friends with a 
group of girls who drank. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to fit in," Dixon said. "She went from being this really great kid 
to being just a terribly unhappy kid." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Dixon and her husband began home-schooling the 13-year-old. Away 
from the influence of her intermediate-school friends, the girl is thriving, 
her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials say parents' fears of alcohol and drug abuse, weapons and 
other problems exceed the reality. Most Ventura County schools, educators say, 
are still safer than those in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 To calm parents' fears, some junior high and middle schools hold forums for 
families of students who are about to graduate from elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other schools send counselors or other emissaries to local elementary 
schools to answer children's questions. And some school officials bring 
students who are about to become elementary school graduates on visits to 
junior high or middle school campuses during the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, some children who are on the verge of entering junior high or 
middle school said they have mixed feelings about the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Kemptner, 12, a sixth-grader at Manzanita School in Thousand Oaks, said 
she is worried that when she attends Sequoia Intermediate School next year she 
will have trouble keeping track of the various homework assignments from her 
six teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Sandy said, there can be advantages to having more than one 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get sick of one teacher and you don't like them, you don't have to 
stay with them all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who already are in the seventh grade said they had the same fears as 
Sandy and her classmates. But they got over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as hard as you think," said Katie Moore, a seventh-grade student at 
Matilija Junior High in Ojai.

<P>
 A 24-year-old Oxnard woman died following a head-on collision on a stretch of 
Santa Rosa Road in Camarillo Saturday morning, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Aldape died of head and chest injuries at Pleasant Valley Hospital at 
8:47 a.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other people were injured in the collision, which occurred on a curve of 
Santa Rosa Road by the Camrosa Water District headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred shortly after 7 a.m. when Aldape's husband, Fernando 
Jimenez, crossed over the center divider in his small pickup truck and collided 
with a full-size pickup driven by Ramon Garcia of Oxnard, Lt. Gary Backman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez and his four adult passengers -- Aldape and another in the cab and two 
in the truck bed -- were all injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center with internal injuries 
and was listed in serious condition in the intensive care unit Saturday night, 
a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was taken to Pleasant Valley Hospital with moderate injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 He was treated and released, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions and injuries of Jimenez's other three passengers were not reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said they were unsure whether the accident was caused by 
speeding or rain. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three other people have died in automobile accidents on Santa Rosa 
Road in recent years. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BOY SCOUTS TO PLANT TREES IN BURN AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of local Boy Scouts will hike into the recently burned area of Deer 
Creek Ridge in Newbury Park today to plant oak trees as part of a re-vegetation 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Vlasic, a 17-year-old senior at Thousand Oaks High School, needed to 
devise a community service project to become an Eagle Scout. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the vast charred acres near Newbury Park last fall, Vlasic knew what 
his project would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire had totally destroyed some areas of Newbury Park and I didn't think 
Mother Nature could get everything back the way it used to be," Vlasic said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I figured I'd do something about it. I figured it would be a great Eagle 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic said he started working on his re-vegetation plan in January.  
</P>
<P>
 His project is being funded by the Rotary Club's Westlake Sunrise Chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Scout has to come up with a project that benefits the community," troop 
leader Patrick Bird said. "It was just something he wanted to do. He saw a need 
because of the fires. He felt very strongly about restoring the natural 
habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic said he and 10 to 15 fellow Scouts will plant 40 coast live oaks in 
random areas where vegetation is needed around Deer Creek Ridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic hopes to plant each tree near where an oak burned last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A ranger from the Conejo Recreation and Park District will help the Scouts 
determine what areas need re-vegetation.  
</P>
<P>
 The Scouts will return to Deer Creek Ridge on April 2 to water and inspect the 
trees. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; FILM EDITOR HONORED FOR 'BAND PLAYED ON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Smack in the middle of Lois Freeman-Fox's dining room table stands a pewter 
statue of a man holding scissors and a plaque reading American Cinema Editors. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, when she calms down from the thrill of receiving the award at the 
Regent Beverly Wilshire earlier this month, Freeman-Fox plans to move it to the 
piano.But not quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fillmore resident, Freeman-Fox, 46, has worked in the Hollywood film editing 
industry for the past 19 years. On March 12, she received her profession's 
greatest honor, the Eddie award, for her work on the HBO movie "And the Band 
Played On." 
</P>
<P>
 The film is based on journalist Randy Shilts' landmark book chronicling the 
spread of the AIDS virus, the government's indifference to the havoc it wreaked 
on gays and the gay community's refusal to take responsibility for stopping the 
spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very difficult project," Freeman-Fox said. "It was very sensitive 
politically." 
</P>
<P>
 While she felt the project was the best work she has ever done, Freeman-Fox 
said she would certainly not call it fun, what with every interest group 
portrayed in the film reviewing preliminary versions and asking to have their 
group portrayed more favorably or extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became quite complicated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cinema Editors Award is one of Hollywood's most low-key award 
shows. This year, the award for best edited motion picture of 1993 went to 
veteran film editor Michael Kahn for "Schindler's List." Freeman-Fox won the 
award for best edited motion picture for non-commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman-Fox has also edited the feature films "Turner and Hooch" and "Stop or 
My Mom Will Shoot." CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COMMISSION TO DEBATE ZONING PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seemingly endless battle between Thousand Oaks and developer Nedjatollah 
Cohan over a 47-acre parcel in Newbury Park will return to the Planning 
Commission on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners are scheduled to debate a proposal to change the zoning 
of the Cohan property, a move that would limit the number of homes that can be 
built there. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate between Cohan and the city has included lawsuits, numerous planning 
sessions and a hearing where Cohan collapsed and was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's hearing should have its own fireworks, according to Irving Wasserman, 
the Planning Commission chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been at this for a long time," Wasserman said. "The emotions involved 
are quite high." 
</P>
<P>
 The zoning proposals stem in part from a proposed change to the city's General 
Plan, which would rezone a portion of the Cohan property that is currently 
designated for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal is approved, some of Cohan's property could not be developed 
and some would be zoned to allow only a limited number of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Cohan's son, Albert Cohen, submitted a 1994 study to the 
commission that contends the property is economically viable for commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents to the development have argued that the property should be preserved 
because water runoff at the property has created a wetlands environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Commissioner Mervyn Kopp said he still believes Cohan should be able to 
develop his property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people in that neighborhood should have been prepared to see a 
development go in there," Kopp said. "After all, the property is his, and he 
does have a right to use it." MATTHEW MOSK

THE TEEN-AGE CANDIDATE; ASSEMBLY HOPEFUL JOSH ARCE MAY BE ONLY 18, BUT HE'S NO 
POLITICAL NOVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There he was again, Josh Arce, working the telephone in his UCLA dorm room 
trying to drum up support for his campaign to represent northeastern Ventura 
County and the northwestern San Fernando Valley in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be only an 18-year-old college freshman, but this is no political 
novice at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Arce -- then a Chatsworth High School senior -- became the youngest 
candidate for elected office in Los Angeles history, running unsuccessfully for 
the community college board at age 17. He was so young he couldn't even vote 
for himself in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 His tenacity intact, Arce, a Democrat, now hopes to oust Republican Paula 
Boland in the 38th Assembly District, which includes Fillmore, Simi Valley, 
Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Northridge, Mission Hills and Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear in my mind a phrase that my high school football coach used to say to 
me," Arce says. "You can't win the game if you don't step out on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 So what if his campaign war chest holds a mere $150? 
</P>
<P>
 Arce learned how to grab many votes with little money during last year's race, 
when he garnered 28,753 votes on a $50 budget, spending 0.17 a cent for each 
vote -- well short of, for example, the $2.11 per vote that it cost Barbara 
Boxer to win a U. S. Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 And so what if he can't count on his own family for support? 
</P>
<P>
 When his grandmother not only refused to loan him the money to pay his filing 
fee, but informed him that she plans to vote for Boland, Arce turned around and 
found someone else to spot him the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that his best friend and campaign manager, Jason Sattler, lives two 
counties away in Santa Barbara, where he's attending UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what telephones are for. 
</P>
<P>
 And never mind that Arce has yet to complete his first year at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Why just study politics when you can practice it instead, Arce says. Besides, 
he reasons, if he is elected, he could finish up his degree going part-time to 
UC Davis, which is near the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce is vying with Ventura Democrat Donald Cocquyt and Green Party member 
Charles Wilken in the primary election. And although he has yet to win the 
Democratic Party endorsement over Cocquyt, it's clear that Arce views incumbent 
Boland as his chief competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to show people that I can be more effective than Boland," Arce 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to a survey published in this month's issue of the California 
Journal, in which Boland ranks 71 out of 78 Assembly members for effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to suggest that on Jan. 17, we hit a crossroad," Arce says. "It's 
time to decide: Are we going to continue what we've been doing in the past? Or 
are we going to look at what happened during the earthquake and take it as a 
sign that change is needed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arce is running on a platform calling for cutbacks in fees at community 
colleges and universities and for breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District into smaller districts. He also proposes slapping harsher penalties on 
businesses that hire illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a couple of friends from high school have already collected 400 
signatures to qualify for the June primary and the endorsements of the 
California Democratic Council and Local 660 of the Service Employees 
International Union, which represents 42,000 county employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to spend his vacation walking the San Fernando Valley in search of 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce talks about his plans at his dorm room desk, cluttered with papers, 
bottles of vitamins, an orthodontic retainer and a couple of trophies from his 
high school football days. Posters from the Chatsworth movie theater where he 
was once an usher hang alongside a picture of actress Sharon Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I wrote her and asked for an endorsement and a contribution, but 
she sent back an autographed picture instead," he explains with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arce's books about conspiracy theories surrounding the John F. Kennedy 
assassination also sit on a nearby shelf. At least one trait that the former 
high school homecoming king and his presidential idol seem to have in common is 
their appeal to women. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, four college women offered to vote for Arce in the five 
minutes it took him to buy a temporary parking permit at his dorm office. (When 
he asked, however, it turned out only one of the women lives in his district.) 
</P>
<P>
 The encouragement he receives from his peers, however, is offset by his 
staunchly Republican family's response to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them, if the worst thing I'm doing is running for political office, then 
that's not too bad," Arce says. "I could be out selling drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he acknowledges that he found it more than just a little discouraging when 
his grandmother, who belongs to the Northridge Republican Women's Club, refused 
to loan him the $400 filing fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I don't love him, but politically we don't agree" says Jane 
Bergquist, Arce's grandmother, who lives in the Chatsworth house next door to 
the one where Arce grew up. "This is kind of a funny thing -- but I'm so proud 
of him anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergquist let out a chuckle when asked if she would really pass over her own 
grandson's name on the June ballot in favor of Boland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we never know, do we, what we'll do when we get to the polls?" she 
said.

PLANNERS OUT OF TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the March 13 article on the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission 
("Planners Frustrated by Overturned Decisions"): 
</P>
<P>
 No one doubts that the Planning Commission has a complex and difficult job. 
But to rely on a 5-year-old public opinion survey to define the public interest 
suggests that commission members may be out of touch with reality.Since 1989, 
housing prices have continued to fall, unemployment has increased, quality 
employers have left the area and public funding for critical quality of life 
services has eroded.  
</P>
<P>
 In this current context, government has a responsibility to see that 
development promotes a local economy sufficiently strong to support and sustain 
the kind of community we all desire. 
</P>
<P>
 At Amgen's recent City Council appeal of a negative Planning Commission 
decision, 35 speakers from the community were on hand to support the 
development proposal and none stood in opposition. The council's approval of 
the appeal suggests that it recognizes the need to move away from an overly 
complicated and rigid regulatory posture. Let's hope the Planning Commission 
also gets the message.

 On Feb. 23, you published an article about the city of Oxnard's intention to 
file a tax lien on the Oxnard Town Center. I was terribly disappointed to see 
that your paper chose to include photographs of our property, 1000 Town 
Center.This is very misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedford Property Investors recently purchased the building, all cash, and has 
reserved funds up front for any new leasing or capital improvements. All 
property taxes and bond assessments associated with the building are current. 
</P>
<P>
 The article refers to some nearby unimproved land parcels, in which we have no 
interest. Your publication no doubt chose our building to photograph due to its 
prominent appearance and proximity to the strawberry fields, which are the 
subject of the article. Rest assured, Bedford Property Investors has long-term 
plans for 1000 Town Center Drive.

SPURIOUS SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sulphur Mountain group consistently uses the term "radiation" in 
describing the Doppler radar's microwave energy, purposefully evoking the 
mental image of radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "emission" when describing microwaves is equally correct but less 
evocative.Just remember, your light bulbs "radiate" visible light. They also 
"emit" light as well. Are you fearful of your light bulb? 
</P>
<P>
 As far as acceptable risks go, just remember: electricity kills many Americans 
every year. Are you willing to live without electricity? We all know that 
simple precautions limit this possibility to an acceptable risk. Yet this real 
risk remains. It is also quite manageable. So is the Doppler radar. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the removal of the weather station would be borne by all of us 
through our tax dollars. Will that enhance our health prospects? No. Will it 
help Upper Ojai land values? Unknown. Time will tell. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is sure: While the National Weather Service acted in an insensitive 
and ham-fisted manner, the Upper-Ojaians could have built a wider coalition if 
they had limited their outrage to just that issue. To use spurious science to 
frighten needlessly their neighbors in the valley in order to advance their 
cause is disappointing in the extreme.

OAK PARK'S PRIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 15 at Oak Park High School, Rep. Anthony Beilenson presented Cliff 
Moore with a flag signifying that our school was honored as a National Blue 
Ribbon award winner. For the record, this award was presented to only 210 high 
schools in the United States, only 35 in the state of California, and Oak Park 
High School was the only high school to receive the award in Ventura 
County.Such a distinction deserves recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Park Unified School District has come a long way since it opened as a 
school district in September, 1978. Now with six schools (two of which have 
received national recognition and two of which have received state recognition) 
in our district and continuous growth ahead, our family is proud to be a part 
of the Oak Park Unified School District.

ZIP CODE VEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk expressed regret that she could not give the 
community of Oak Park a new ZIP code, as requested by our community's elected 
leaders ("Annexation Is Urged for Oak Park," March 11). 
</P>
<P>
 I am upset that she never seriously tried to resolve this problem that too 
often causes Oak Park residents to be treated as if they live in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting the process for a new ZIP code would have been easy. VanderKolk 
merely had to introduce a resolution at a meeting of the Board of Supervisors, 
requesting the Postal Service to begin the process. But despite repeated 
requests from Oak Park residents, VanderKolk never introduced the required 
resolution to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 I just do not understand her position that "They want things, like a new ZIP 
code, that I can't give them." She never really tried.

THOUSAND OAKS OFFICIALS TRAPPED IN CITY COUNCIL'S CROSS-FIRE; GOVERNMENT: 
BUREAUCRATS TREAD CAREFULLY BETWEEN FACTIONS SPLIT ON DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. 
ELECTIONS MAKE IT EVEN TRICKIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Some Tuesday nights, City Manager Grant Brimhall leaves the Thousand Oaks 
council meeting half expecting to find his nose crumpled by an errant punch or 
his double-breasted blazer spattered with mud. 
</P>
<P>
 From his high-backed seat in the center of the council dais, Brimhall sees a 
fair share of nasty politicking. And increasingly, he and other top city 
officials say they feel shoved into an ever more bruising fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staff members are sometimes put in the boxing arena, and when that happens, 
staff members have their hands tied behind them," Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brimhall's top aide, Assistant City Manager MaryJane Lazz, agreed. "It's not a 
fun analogy," she said. "But it's a very relevant analogy." 
</P>
<P>
 With Thousand Oaks council members intractably split on major development and 
planning issues, top city bureaucrats must tread between two highly partisan 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, they must heed votes by the majority -- council members Alex 
Fiore, Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo. At the same time, they must respect the 
concerns of the minority -- Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff tightrope walking has become even trickier because the upcoming 
election, with three seats open, could potentially swing power to the 
Zeanah-Zukowski faction. Whoever controls the council controls the hiring and 
firing of city staff. If purely in the interest of job security, bureaucrats 
must please both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key thing is to try with all your heart to maintain an objective, 
professional perspective and to be honest and forthright," said Brimhall, who 
has been city manager for 16 years. "You can't play games." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ever-warring council members don't make it easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Factional disputes among the politicians have lately grown so intense that the 
anger has spilled over into council-staff relationships. That tension crops up 
more and more frequently during televised Tuesday night council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Voice icy beneath her trademark smile, Zeanah may grill the city manager on 
his decision to schedule a controversial issue early on the agenda, before most 
residents return from work. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran politician Fiore may fire loaded questions at the city attorney about 
council protocol, his tone and words suggesting that his rivals have broken the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 More calm, but still severe, Zukowski may complain to the city clerk that the 
typed summary of council actions does not reflect her views. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontations all happen in public, and they are captured live and in 
re-runs on the government cable station. And that makes some city staffers 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern is that council members don't call us and talk about (such 
issues) before the meeting," said Nancy Dillon, who has served as city clerk 
for a dozen years. "That's one reason we produce an agenda on Thursday, to give 
them an opportunity to call us if something isn't clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Top city employees are reluctant to talk on the record about tensions with 
individual politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I can't comment -- I'm right in the middle of this thing," City 
Atty. Mark Sellers said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his reserve, however, Sellers did express frustration with 
council-staff relations, which he described as "a little more sensitive now."  
</P>
<P>
 "The other day the mayor yelled at the city manager for having a long agenda," 
Sellers said. "Well, what are we supposed to do? If we knock items off the 
agenda, people will yell at the council and say, 'Why wasn't my item heard?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, several council members admit that bureaucrats occasionally 
become surrogate punching bags. Nearly unanimously, they express distaste for 
such public bickering. Yet they cannot agree on the reason for the tension -- 
or the best way to ease it. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only solution they concur on, in fact, is for everyone to hang on 
until November. 
</P>
<P>
 "An election always clears things up," Schillo said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, council members must deal with the many issues facing the 
city, from zone changes to development proposals to overcrowding laws. And, 
reluctantly, they concede they will probably continue drawing city staff into 
their debates. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style is to do as much as I can behind the scenes," Zeanah said. "However, 
if I have to take something public, I will." 
</P>
<P>
 As mayor, Zeanah said she considers it her job to monitor the bureaucrats who 
carry out council policies. She expects a professional, objective staff. And 
her constituents, she says, have the right to know if she's disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo views the monitoring as meddling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not get involved with the daily business of staff," Schillo said. 
"It's a paranoia, trying to interject (the council) into every aspect of 
government." Pointedly targeting Zeanah, a rival in the upcoming council 
election, Lazar added: "Nobody else criticizes city staff like she does. 
Nobody. There's only one person who really drags city staff into the fray. I 
think that's inappropriate."  
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic example came during a recent debate about the Civic Arts 
Plaza, when Zeanah accused the city attorney of concealing key information from 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 In dropping-a-bombshell tones, Zeanah announced during a public meeting that 
the city attorney had refused to show her an appraisal of the former civic 
center at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive. The city has long planned to sell that 
property for at least $11 million to pay for the new government headquarters 
being constructed in the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when she made a fuss, Zeanah said, did Sellers let her see the appraisal 
-- and even then, he would not allow her to copy it. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one citizen in the audience that night reacted with outrage, 
scribbling letters to local newspaper editors denouncing city staff for 
withholding information from the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sellers, at the public meeting and later in a an interview, insisted: 
"I've never kept any information from the mayor. In fact, I spent a half-hour 
with her, going over the appraisal page by page." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers acknowledged that at first, he asked Zeanah not to copy the appraisal, 
which is supposed to be a confidential city document. But when he discovered 
that copies had been circulated to a citizens' committee, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah, however, stuck with her interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her foes, she said, did not want her to see the appraisal because it assumed 
that the property would be subdivided into three separate lots for 
condominiums, a restaurant and other commercial uses. With such zoning, the 
appraiser estimated the property would be worth about $13.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeanah considers such intense development unlikely, and therefore 
concluded that the property is worth far less than city staff indicated. 
Convinced that the appraisal -- and her difficulty obtaining it -- were 
noteworthy, she aired the issue during a televised meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "As council members, we have an obligation to serve as watchdogs over the 
bureaucracy, and I take that obligation very seriously," Zeanah said. "If the 
government is not being responsive to a critical need, I'll take it public." 
</P>
<P>
 To that, Lazar responded: "You don't resolve the problems by airing them 
publicly." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that philosophy, however, Lazar could not resist jumping into another 
recent bout between Zeanah and city officials, this time the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Following up on a concern voiced first by her ally Zukowski, the mayor 
directed the city clerk to include dissenting views in the minutes that 
summarize council action. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar swiftly intervened, telling Zeanah that the minutes have for years 
recorded only votes, without detailing each council member's reasons for 
supporting or rejecting the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could we ask the city clerk about this?" Lazar suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the ensuing debate, no one found time to question City Clerk Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
 If they had, they would have learned that some recent minutes have included a 
synopsis of the debate while others have dryly recorded the vote. Dillon later 
attributed the disparity to the fact that she's been training a new recording 
secretary. Yet her explanation was lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Sellers has found himself in similar situations, ostensibly asked 
questions by both sides, but never given an opportunity to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when you get into a quarrel at home," Lazar said. "You keep saying, 
'Is that true? Yes, of course it's true.' And you don't give the other person a 
chance to respond." Sellers says he doesn't mind being cut out of debate -- 
even debate that concerns parliamentary procedure or legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect that they are elected representatives of the people," he said. "If 
that's how the community decides to run the local government, that's a 
community decision and I respect that."

DRAWING THE PLANS FOR A MORE LIVABLE L.A.; REDEVELOPMENT: URBAN PLANNERS ARE 
HOLDING A SERIES OF MEETINGS TO SHOW RESIDENTS WHAT THE FUTURE COULD HOLD FOR 
THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Now more than ever, Los Angeles is looking for a future. 
</P>
<P>
 It could look something like this: A metropolis where neglected boulevards are 
teeming with life, where more people move more easily through the urban 
landscape, where the isolation born of freeways and gate-guarded enclaves gives 
way to a sense of community, and where the benefits and burdens of new 
development are spread evenly throughout the city's fractured neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the two-year process of redrawing the city's long-term 
blueprint for growth, that is the Los Angeles that residents from communities 
as diverse as Westwood and South-Central and San Pedro are telling local 
officials they want. 
</P>
<P>
 How to get there is the subject of a series of community meetings taking place 
across Los Angeles. Armed with colorful sketches of different communities, 
urban planners are showing residents what the future could hold for their 
neighborhoods and explaining how to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings are scheduled Wednesday in West Los Angeles and March 31 for the 
Hollywood and Wilshire areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners hope to present the plans to the city Planning Commission in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet whether the vision of planners and residents leaps from colorful maps and 
charts into reality depends on the will of politicians and the willingness of 
residents to accept changes that may be unpopular in the short term, those 
involved in the process agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling this as a plan for people's children," said Los Angeles planner 
Ron Maben, who is helping update the city's General Plan, the document that 
guides future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan -- last updated in 1974 -- establishes broad policy. Although 
it does not govern how individual pieces of property should be developed, it 
sets the tone for smaller, more specific community plans that do. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several weeks -- and continuing until next month -- planners 
have taken preliminary ideas on the road to ask residents across the city what 
they think of a plan that seeks to accommodate more people without overloading 
the freeways and the sewers or worsening the quality of the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary ideas stem from community meetings held last year, at which 
community members told planners what they did and did not want Los Angeles to 
be. Although each neighborhood had specific ideas about its future, planners 
were struck by the similarities in what residents wanted in Los Angeles as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted more parks, more livable neighborhoods and more affordable 
housing. They did not want more traffic, more smog or more of the other 
headaches that go with urban living. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, they all agreed that something has to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, early data compiled by planners demonstrate that if Los Angeles 
continues to grow as it has -- namely, an auto-dependent suburban sprawl -- the 
results could be disastrous. Sewer systems will be overloaded. Roads will be 
gridlocked. Air quality will worsen. And the need for imported water will 
outpace supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we continue the rules as they are, the net outcome will exacerbate 
existing conditions," said Woodie Tescher, the consultant preparing the plan. 
"If all land is built out at current zoning, average speed on local streets 
would be 4 m.p.h. -- that's on every street." 
</P>
<P>
 So planners devised a preliminary vision for the future that borrows heavily 
from the past. Their preliminary ideas include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Encouraging denser development around mass transit centers and along major 
transportation corridors. That would allow more people to live within walking 
distance of subways or buses, thus reducing the need for automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mixing different types of development, such as putting apartments or 
condominiums on top of retail shops or commercial offices. That way, 
shopkeepers or office workers could live and work in the same area. Even if 
they did drive to work, most of their daily errands -- such as trips to the 
grocery, the cleaners or picking up the kids at day care -- could be done on 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Converting flood control channels and utility rights of way into greenbelts 
that connect regional parks, thus opening up recreational areas in communities 
where vacant land is scarce. If bike paths are built, planners speculate that 
more people might be willing to pedal to work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Directing growth into those areas where streets and utility lines can handle 
it and discouraging it in areas that are already overbuilt. For example, 
manufacturing centers might be proposed off a railroad freight line, but not in 
the middle of a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preserving neighborhoods of single-family homes. Wherever denser areas are 
proposed, planners suggest buffering them from existing neighborhoods with 
duplexes or townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Streamlining the complicated and costly permit process that precedes new 
development projects. By creating a master environmental impact report and 
establishing firm guidelines, planners hope developers will have more time and 
money to devote to building better projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the diversity of the city's neighborhoods, planners are drawing 
preliminary sketches to detail how the broad guidelines might be applied in 
different communities. Venice, for instance, might develop with a different 
"feel" than, say, Pico-Union, but both communities would be subject to the same 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The community meetings are a chance for residents to make changes before the 
ideas are fine-tuned and more formally presented later this year. Planners hope 
to present the plans to the city Planning Commission in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the ideas actually were contained in the city's last General Plan, 
adopted in 1974. That plan called for major urban hubs such as Downtown, Los 
Angeles International Airport and Warner Center to be connected by a network of 
transit lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Except the rail lines never got built. And many elements of the plan were 
never followed. Now the plan is out of date. Some of the centers envisioned in 
the plan developed; others did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of that, many in the city are doubtful that a new General Plan will be 
any more useful than the old one. "What's going on here is politics," said one 
man who attended a recent community meeting in Venice. "This is really a waste 
of time."

REAL ESTATE'S REALITY CHECK; AS INFLATED HOME PRICES BOTTOM OUT, BUYERS, 
SELLERS TAKE STOCK 
</P>

 Software engineer Chris Farrar put his three-bedroom Hawthorne home up for 
sale three weeks ago, but even at $84,000 less than he bought it for five years 
ago, he's not sure he'll find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel administrator Penny Polston closed escrow on her Torrance home March 
11, but it sold for less than what she owed on her mortgage. She got relief, 
however: She worked out a deal with her lender to forgive part of her debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Business manager Kathleen McNamara once thought the $600,000-plus luxury homes 
in Torrance's Pacific Colony were well out of her reach. But at an auction in 
January, she bought one of the gated community's homes at almost half off, and 
moved in last month. 
</P>
<P>
 How's the local housing market? It depends on if you are a buyer or a seller. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the South Bay, dreams have been fulfilled or fortunes have been 
busted. For buyers, there are bargains to be had, as many experts predict that 
prices are at or near rock-bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the unfortunate seller, success is just staying afloat. And many of 
these sellers, especially those forced to move because they lost their job or 
are being relocated, often leave the South Bay with maxed-out credit cards, a 
hefty tax bill and a feeling of disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the younger, first-time buyers (from the late 1980s) are kind of beat 
up emotionally," said Torrance tax attorney Tim Moore, who gives seminars to 
those who face selling their home at a loss. "They saved up for years to buy 
their home, then lost (the equity)." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, home prices continued to fall. According to Dataquick, the 
average median price of a previously owned home in the South Bay dropped 7.3% 
to $237,400 in the fourth quarter of 1993, from $256,200 in the same period a 
year earlier. Values have fallen almost 20% since the fourth quarter of 1990, 
according to Dataquick Information Systems, which analyzes government records 
of completed transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many properties upside down right now," said Donna Shultze, a 
broker at Century 21 Union Realty in Torrance. The bright side is that families 
who before couldn't own a home are "now realizing the American dream. But some 
of those dreams are at the expense of the seller." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers who stand to lose the most are those who bought when home prices were 
at their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, or those who added to their 
mortgages by taking out home equity loans, said Torrance real estate broker 
Robbie Mills.  
</P>
<P>
 Farrar, the Hawthorne homeowner, bought his home to gain equity after years of 
renting. He liked the quiet location on 140th Street and the layout of the 
house. It was built in the post-World-War-II-boom era of the late 1940s and 
featured hardwood floors. Paint and stucco work have masked similarities to the 
other tract houses on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that it was the type of house to own to see an appreciation of 
property values," said the 38-year-old Farrar, who is single. 
</P>
<P>
 As his employer, NCR Corp. El Segundo, began cutting back its staff a year 
ago, he considered selling. But he was in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew property values had gone down," he said. "I just hadn't realized they 
had sunk that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when his firm offered him a separation package in December, he grabbed 
the chance, fearing that his options would only worsen as the company further 
cut staff. And recently, he found a job at Tandem Computer Corp. in Cupertino, 
which led to him putting his house on the market. He bought it for $273,000. It 
is listed for sale at $189,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy at the peak, sell at the trough," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cupertino, he plans to rent for a while until he can save enough for 
another down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take me a while to recover, but I don't think it's diminished my 
interest in owning a plot of land, owning a piece of America, as they say." 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeowners are not as optimistic. Their houses, from ocean-view mansions 
on the peninsula to tract homes in Torrance, are worth thousands of dollars 
less than their mortgage debt.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have extremes of income in the South Bay, but it doesn't matter," Mills 
said. "I have seen people devastated by this. Their business went under, they 
got a divorce, their overtime got cut or they lost their job."

HOMELESS SHELTER IS OPPOSED; SAN PEDRO: A COALITION VOWS TO FIGHT THE PROPOSAL 
TO CONVERT EMPTY NAVY BARRACKS INTO HOUSING FOR 600 PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the one week since San Pedro residents discovered that a homeless shelter 
is proposed for surplus Navy housing in the middle of a residential area, they 
have turned their anger into a united front, vowing to halt the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and real estate agents formed a group, Concerned Citizens, just 
days after they found out that Turner's Technical Institute, a homeless 
advocacy organization based in South-Central Los Angeles, planned to run the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical plans to run a housing program for up to 600 homeless 
people in 144 units of Navy property at 2300 Taper Ave. The plan already has 
been approved by the federal Health and Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned Citizens countered by distributing 4,000 flyers by early last week, 
rallying 1,000 people to protest the plan Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Community opposition is not a case of just saying "not in my back yard," 
residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is 'San Pedro Cares,' but we've done more than our share," resident 
Bonnie Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The community was not told about the plan before approval was given, and it 
already has a number of homeless shelters, subsidized housing programs and 
churches that feed the hungry, residents said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of Rancho Palos Verdes has rallied behind the movement to stop the 
housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At its own meeting Tuesday night, the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council 
unanimously agreed to begin lobbying Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, 
the League of California Cities and the secretary of the Navy. It is also 
looking at possible litigation, Mayor Steven Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders and individuals heatedly voiced their concerns at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know someone personally who was going to write up an offer (to buy a house) 
until this hit the paper and she decided not to put an offer on the property," 
said Ann DiBernardo, of the San Pedro-Wilmington Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't willing to move her family into San Pedro until she was sure what 
was going to happen with that area." 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy is closing down the Long Beach Naval Station and will move out 
enlisted personnel and their families from 44 buildings on the 27-acre site, 
which is surrounded by single-family homes in San Pedro and Rancho Palos 
Verdes.  
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, homeless advocacy groups such as Turner's Technical 
Institute are given priority on federal land that has been declared surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health and Human Services Department decides which organization gets the 
property and has already approved the Turner's application to use the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical is not required to get permission from the community, and 
the Navy "can't arbitrarily overturn the decision by HHS," said Long Beach Navy 
spokesman Lt. Carl Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy prefers that all parties come to an agreement or compromise before 
we give our stamp of approval. Obviously, we recognize that that might not be 
possible in all cases, and we can't delay these matters indefinitely because 
that wouldn't be in keeping with the spirit of the legislation," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical Institute made an impassioned plea for community support. 
Representatives say the housing will be used for an atypical group of homeless 
families and individuals, those displaced by natural disasters or the recession 
who are too proud to seek welfare help. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the site would be gated, and no foot traffic to or from the premises 
would be allowed.

OFFERING COMFORT IN BAD TIMES; TORRANCE: THE EIGHT VOLUNTEER MINISTERS ARE ON 
CALL 24 HOURS A DAY TO HELP CALM THE PUBLIC AND TO AID OVERWHELMED OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When two police officers were shot in a Torrance hotel recently, one of the 
first calls the officer in charge of the case made was to the Torrance Police 
Department's chaplain corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, Dean Mayeda and three other volunteer chaplains were on their 
way to the Holiday Inn. "I got down there and it was sort of chaos in the 
lobby," said Mayeda, a minister at Hope Chapel Gateway, a Christian church on 
Maple Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates Police Capt. Michael Tracy and Sgt. Vernon Thomas 
Vanderpool had been shot when a gunman burst into a room where police were 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayeda and another chaplain accompanied Torrance Police Chief Joseph C. 
DeLadurantey as he informed the other officers that the two had died. 
</P>
<P>
 To help them deal with the tragedy, Mayeda and Richard Olsen, deacon at Little 
Company of Mary Hospital, led the officers in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I learned is that just the fact that we were there made a big 
difference," Mayeda said. "People said, 'You guys took an unholy situation and 
made it holy again.' . . . It was good to be there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Husband-and-wife chaplains George and Nancy Johnson of the Cathedral of Life 
Foursquare Church on Prairie Avenue, meanwhile, went to the hospital to comfort 
the dead officers' families. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaplains are among eight volunteer ministers who are on call 24 hours a 
day to help Torrance police with everything from notifying people that a family 
member has died to calming down couples at domestic-violence calls. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of their time is spent helping officers deal with the public, the 
main purpose of the chaplain program is to lend an understanding ear to 
overwhelmed officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have found them to be as valuable a component in running a police 
department as any other element," DeLadurantey said. "To me they have become as 
important as a car or a gun or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance created the Chaplain Corps in December, 1992. Of the first six 
trained in the city, three remain. In January, the city swore in five more 
clergymen. The Police Department advertised openings in the program, then 
tested and trained volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 All religious denominations were welcome to apply, but all the current 
chaplains are Christians, said Sgt. David Smith, who coordinates the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The department doesn't require that volunteers serve a fixed amount of time, 
just that the chaplains trade off carrying a beeper so one is available at all 
times. Mayeda said in his first year he was called out about 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, each chaplain decides how much time to spend at the station 
getting to know the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to demand too much of them because of those times we call at 3 
o'clock in the morning. But we have yet to have anyone say, 'No I can't make 
it, I'm too tired.' It's always, 'What more can I do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new chaplains is Wayne Holbrook, an assistant pastor at Believer's 
Family Fellowship on 237th Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Two of Holbrook's brothers work in law enforcement, one for the Los Angeles 
Police Department and another for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought I would be a cop," Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school student, he worked in the LAPD's Explorer program. After he 
earned a two-year degree in police science, Holbrook began working with young 
people and later went to divinity school. Now, he said, he can use his 
knowledge of police officers and his skills as a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with background, Holbrook said, he realizes it will take time to 
develop relationships in the station house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't come in and expect to be buddy-buddy right away," Holbrook said. 
"That's something that will take time. We've got to let them know we're not 
here to be Bible-thumping." 
</P>
<P>
 The chaplains' work with officers de-emphasizes the differences between 
religious groups, Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They drop that at the door," Smith said. "Officers talk to them as a 
chaplain, not as a Baptist minister or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Ron Ruby, who helped organize the chaplain program in Torrance, said 
its members fill a void. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police officers are basically caring people, even though sometimes they 
appear to be very hard," Ruby said. "When these tragedies happen, the officers 
feel that they have to deal with the facts and get the situation resolved . . . 
but it does take an emotional toll on the officers."  
</P>
<P>
 The officers who have been counseled by the chaplains have had nothing but 
positive things to say about them, Ruby said.  
</P>
<P>
 People in law enforcement need a place to talk about their experiences, said 
David W. DeRevere, director of the International Conference of Police Chaplains 
and a chaplain for the FBI.  
</P>
<P>
 "We teach our police officers that they are in charge. The cop is supposed to 
be able to handle it. What do they do when they have a problem?" he asked. "If 
a chaplain can be available who has earned their respect and trust, then a cop 
has someone to turn to." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the department also contracts with professional counselors in 
particularly difficult situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance gives its chaplains 20 hours of training as reserve police officers. 
They study radio procedures, report-writing and techniques for restraining 
suspects. Experts give them some points on relating to police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really understand what the officer goes through," Mayeda said. "I see it 
as empathy training." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they do not carry guns, the chaplains spend time on the firing range 
learning how to handle a weapon in case an officer drops one in a scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could use the gun to protect their own lives if they had to," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaplain's equipment is limited. On ride-alongs they wear a bulletproof 
vest, but most of the time their uniform is a blue wind breaker similar to what 
police officers wear during a raid. Big yellow letters across the back read: 
"CHAPLAIN." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope that people that see (the jacket) don't misread it for 'CAPTAIN,' 
" Holbrook said.

DIE-HARD CANYON RESIDENTS STILL LOYAL TO LAS FLORES; MALIBU: NEITHER FIRES NOR 
FLOODS NOR MUD DAMPEN THE SPIRIT OF THOSE COMMITTED TO LIVING IN THE PRECARIOUS 
CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Name a year and they can name a disaster. There was the 1970 wildfire. The 
1984 mudslides. The 1992 flood. And, worst of all, last fall's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, residents of Malibu's Las Flores Canyon have managed to overcome 
what nature dished out. 
</P>
<P>
 They built retaining walls in the face of floods, planted vegetation to ward 
off landslides, cleared brush and installed sprinkler systems to protect their 
houses against fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that entire mountains have been denuded by the area's worst wildfire 
in memory, several hundred canyon residents have ever more reason to worry 
about floods, mudslides and debris flows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like living next to a time bomb," said Valerie Titus, who sleeps on the 
living room floor whenever it rains for fear the hillside behind her apartment 
will crash through the bedroom wall. Two years ago, she lived a few hundred 
yards up the canyon when a raging Las Flores Creek swept through her triplex 
and destroyed her possessions. Last month she lost her car in a mudslide. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, like many Las Flores residents, Titus has no desire to leave. "Even with 
all its troubles, this is a remarkably beautiful place to live," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A rugged gash on the coastal landscape, Las Flores Canyon stretches for more 
than a mile from north to south, hemmed by mountains on three sides and by the 
Pacific Ocean at its lower end. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon's namesake creek, which once brimmed with salmon and steelhead 
trout, is a magnet for deer and other wildlife. Its shady glens and ocean 
vistas have made it popular with writers, artists and others looking for 
solitude. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a price: Calamity seems never far away. 
</P>
<P>
 This is by no means Malibu's only ecological trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1983 landslide at nearby Big Rock Mesa damaged or destroyed 240 homes, 
causing $97 million in damage. During heavy rains, muddy debris from eroding 
bluffs often force the closure of Pacific Coast Highway and inundate expensive 
beach houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Las Flores Canyon's precarious geology, coupled with its popularity as a 
locale for million-dollar country homes, places it in a league of its own when 
it comes to natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower canyon lies at the foot of a giant landslide, which in 1984 gobbled 
up eight hillside homes and wiped out half a mile of Rambla Pacifico Road, 
cutting off the only direct route to Pacific Coast Highway for 550 residents on 
the canyon's west rim. The slide changed the course of Las Flores Creek, 
shoving it 60 yards to the east. Engineers say the slide still poses a threat 
to the creek and to Las Flores Canyon Road, the only artery leading out of the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on federal flood insurance maps, officials say 10 properties in the 
lower part of the canyon that were destroyed by the fire -- and at least eight 
that weren't -- are in an area likely to be severely flooded during prolonged 
torrential rains. 
</P>
<P>
 To the east, another 50 properties on Las Flores Mesa, whose residents must 
traverse the canyon to escape fire, are in danger of isolation if the canyon 
were to flood. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials are concerned that it will. Because of last fall's fires, soil 
experts say the area could face increased danger from floods and mudslides for 
the next eight years. It may take that long, they say, for the vegetation -- 
vital for absorbing and dispersing rain -- to regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fire's aftermath, Malibu's elected officials have hurriedly begun 
seeking solutions to the hazards. And they hope to persuade the federal 
government to help foot the bill. Depending on what is attempted, costs could 
range from $8 million to tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort, moreover, is controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, including fire victims eager to rebuild in the canyon, heaped scorn 
on a study released this month that, among other things, suggested the part of 
the canyon in a flood plain be declared unsafe for habitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here because the canyon is a great place to live," said Susan Shaw, 
who, with her partner, lost a creek-side home to the fire and wants to rebuild. 
"We don't want to be told that our way of life is expendable." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad luck with the elements aside, Las Flores Canyon has had other troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep outsiders off his sprawling rancho that stretched along the entire 
Malibu coast, pioneer settler Frederick H. Rindge installed gates at the mouth 
of the canyon in 1894. Travelers between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara needed 
permission to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The gates were the focal point of a court battle between Rindge's widow and 
the state that lasted 22 years and was aimed at protecting Rancho Malibu as a 
private preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was slow to end, even after the U.S. Supreme Court granted the 
state an easement through the ranch to build what became Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1923, when state employees arrived to begin work on the road, they were met 
at Las Flores by 40 armed ranch guards who kept the workers off the property 
for three days. The highway finally opened in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon itself lies just outside the Rindge domain, a wild, out-of-the-way 
paradise that had been claimed early in the century by a group of well-to-do 
bankers, lawyers and businessmen -- many of them from Pasadena and Glendale -- 
known as the Uplifters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Uplifters were weekend warriors who built small cabins along the creek for 
their hunting and fishing expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War I, the group formed a trust that claimed title to much of the 
canyon. The road was brought up from the coast in the early 1920s, and the 
cabins were soon replaced with more luxurious timber lodges. 
</P>
<P>
 But the early settlers soon learned of the area's unforgiving environment. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1930s, the three dozen or so lodges that had been built there were 
gone -- lost to fire, flood and mudslides, said James J. C. Cartemanche, whose 
Uplifter grandfather and great-uncle were among Las Flores' original settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartemanche and his wife, Cornelia, can attest to the fragility of life in the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 They live next door to his 81-year-old father on a narrow ridge top that had 
to be blasted with dynamite to make room for the two houses Cartemanche's 
ancestors built after starting to homestead there in 1908. Cartemanche's sister 
and brother-in-law, who lived in the gorge below him, lost their house during 
the fall fire. The Cartemanches came within a whisker of losing theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you filled the train yard at Union Station with locomotives and revved up 
the engines, that's how the firestorm sounded when it came through," 
Cartemanche said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite officials' pleas that they evacuate, the couple rode out the fire with 
three U.S. Forestry Service firefighters who refused to leave them behind. 
</P>
<P>
 They lay next to a concrete wall and doused themselves with water from garbage 
cans to ward off the searing heat, then stamped out the embers that Cartemanche

A JOB WHERE SUCCESS MEANS SORROW; SIERRA MADRE: CREW MEMBERS SEARCHING FOR A 
FATHER AND SON CAUGHT IN A FLASH FLOOD HAVE GRIEVED AS THEY WORKED. THE MAN'S 
BODY WAS FOUND TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As in the preceding week and a half, every time the diesel revved and the 
blade lowered to take another chunk out of the mountain of mud that filled the 
Bailey Canyon Wilderness Park debris basin, all eyes focused on the bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations stopped. Heads turned. Lungs dragged in cigarette smoke and held 
it, exhaling only when the blade lifted clear of the muck and the dozer rumbled 
back to gouge out another load of mud. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't necessarily mean everyone was ready last Tuesday morning about 8 
a.m., when county crews working the bulldozer unearthed the body of John 
Henderson, 33, who disappeared with his 9-year-old son March 6 during a flash 
flood at the Sierra Madre park. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a long, painful vigil for the workers digging day after day in the 
mud in search of the bodies, knowing that success meant putting a tragic end on 
the story of a doting father who took the son he had raised alone since infancy 
for a Sunday walk in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews continued searching Wednesday for Matthew Henderson, who with his father 
was swept away by a vast wall of muddy water that tumbled through the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets really hard to keep your composure," said David Roth, a crewman on 
the 12 p.m. to 12 a.m. shift, as he leaned on one of the floodlights set up to 
provide light for night work and smoked a cigarette. "I really sympathize with 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, 25, said the pair's deaths affected him deeply because his girlfriend is 
a waitress at what was the Hendersons' favorite restaurant, a Coco's Family 
Restaurant in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knew Matt, she's been waiting on them for years," he said. "She's pretty 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
 After the flood, the boy's extended family came to the restaurant as usual, 
and included breakfast for Matthew in the order, he said. They left the boy's 
favorite breakfast meal, a grilled cheese sandwich, on the table when they 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers discussed how hard it was to tell their own 9- and 10-year-olds what 
Daddy was digging for at the debris basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids think I'm this big hero up here," said crew foreman Paul Turner. 
"It's hard to explain to them what I'm really doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old Turner, like many others on his crew, lives far from the 
Sierra Madre work site. He has to drive home to Norco, near Corona, every 
night, and he can count on one hand the hours he sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was visibly upset when Sierra Madre city officials informed him last 
Monday that he would have to scale back his search for the bodies from 24 hours 
a day to 12 hours a day after neighbors complained about the noise from the 
dump trucks and heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite pleas from the Henderson family, who have kept vigil over the debris 
basin since John and Matthew were lost March 6, and statements from neighbors 
in support of letting the digging continue, Sierra Madre Mayor Clem Bartolai 
announced Monday that too many residents are bothered by the round-the-clock 
digging to allow it to go on. Crews were cut back to shifts from 6 a.m. to 6 
p.m., Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew member Jay Crosby just shook his head as he watched county coroner crews 
haul the remains of what family members believed to be John Henderson's body 
out of the mud Tuesday. His noon-to-midnight shift was forced to stop six hours 
early Monday night, and the body was found two hours into the morning shift 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have found him last night," he said. "We quit one shift too early."

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL: A SUMMARY OF SELECTED CITY HALL ACTIONS THIS 
PAST WEEK AFFECTING CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. 
</P>

<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * SOCCER FIELD: Approved a proposal to temporarily turn a vacant lot at 3rd 
Street between Bixel Street and Lucas Avenue into a soccer field. The lot's 
owners, Cathay City Development, do not plan to develop the property in the 
near future and agreed to the proposal by a nearby YMCA. The field is scheduled 
to be completed by July. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE TOKYO CHURCH: Authorized the Community Redevelopment Agency to 
negotiate a pre-development loan, not to exceed $420,000, with the Little Tokyo 
Service Center for the rehabilitation of the Old Union Church at 120 N. San 
Pedro Street. The remaining funding for the project, which is estimated at $3.4 
million, will come from private donations, the National Register of Historic 
Places, and a future, larger loan from the CRA. The church, a Historical 
Cultural Monument, was built in 1923 but has been vacant and deteriorating for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 * HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS: Gave final approval to an ordinance changing the height 
restrictions at Western Avenue and Olympic Boulevard, paving the way for 
construction of the Pacific Trade Center, a 25-story hotel/office building. The 
complex is to include a department store, several restaurants, a youth center 
and 1,000 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * CRA SPENDING: Approved a request by the Community Redevelopment Agency to 
transfer $6 million in loans earmarked for three single-room-occupancy hotels, 
(the Palmer House, the Eugene and the Southern) to several Central City East 
projects, such as park maintenance and emergency shelter beds. The CRA decided 
to minimize its future involvement in the three hotels after a report found 
that the high-vacancy rate at the hotels was likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 * POLICE EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION: Approved using $208,000 in the Police 
Department's General Service Fund to employ 10 non-city, union personnel to 
install communications equipment in 353 newly purchased black-and-white police 
cars. The installation work is usually done by police personnel, but due to the 
large number of vehicles, hiring outside help was judged the quickest way to 
get the cars onto the streets. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * WALKING TO WORK: Endorsed a state Senate bill that would exempt from 
taxation employer subsidies to employees who walk or bike to work. Some 
employers pay employees to car-pool or take public transit to their jobs, and 
this money is exempt from state taxation. In opposing the effort to expand the 
scope of this exemption, Councilman Nate Holden said: "A person with a job gets 
paid to work, not to walk to work." Passed 9-1. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, 
Jackie Goldberg, Mike Hernandez, Rudy Svorinich Jr. Voting no: Holden. Absent: 
Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

RECESSION PROPELS INCREASE IN CHILD ABUSE; FAMILIES: IN CENTRAL LOS ANGELES, 
NEGLECT CASES ARE 25% HIGHER THAN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Propelled by the stress of unemployment, the need for housing and other 
problems related to the poor economy, Los Angeles County recorded an increase 
in child abuse and neglect cases between 1992 and 1993, according to a recent 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll on families was especially high in Central Los Angeles, where the 
number of neglect cases was about 25% higher than in other parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly all major categories of child abuse and neglect charted by the 
county, emergency calls rose 24% between 1992 and 1993, according to an annual 
report by the county Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate county report that broke down calls to the department's child abuse 
hot line by ZIP code revealed that the 90044 area, a 5.3-square mile zone 
bordered by Slauson and El Segundo boulevards and Normandie and Western 
avenues, logged the greatest number of child abuse and neglect reports in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality in L.A. is we have a huge population of people who have been 
dislocated by the economy and unable to get jobs," said Peter Digre, director 
of the Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got this huge population that has slipped out of the ability to really 
raise their kids and has slipped into the welfare system or out of the housing 
market."  
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, reports of general neglect -- including lack of adequate shelter, 
clothing, food, medical care or supervision -- went up 40%, the largest 
increase among eight child abuse categories compared to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of sexual abuse rose 28%, while those regarding exploitation increased 
27%. Exploitation includes coercing a child into prostitution or pornography or 
forcing a young child to work to provide money for a family, department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was based on emergency telephone calls made to the department's hot 
line reporting abuse and neglect cases involving children from birth to age 19. 
There was no breakdown of comparative figures for Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But a separate nine-month survey last year tracking emergency calls from April 
to December showed that the area logged 2,354 calls reporting sexual abuse, 
4,800 for physical abuse, 2,486 for general neglect, 413 for emotional abuse 
and 685 for drug-exposed children. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of calls reporting drug-dependent children countywide came from 
the area. Central Los Angeles has had the highest number of drug-exposed 
infants in the county for the past several years, department officials said. 
Countywide, calls reporting drug-exposed children recorded the only drop 
between 1992 and 1993, falling 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, reported figures for drug-exposed infants may not clearly reflect the 
number of babies born with drugs in their system since not all hospitals test 
mothers or children for the presence of drugs, said Priscilla Drew, a 
reporter-liaison for the department's child abuse hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the hospital is unaware that the mom has a history of drug abuse and if 
she doesn't report it and doesn't show signs, it won't get reported," Drew 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 90044 ZIP code, there was a drop in the past year in reports of 
drug-exposed newborns and general neglect, although the numbers remained higher 
than elsewhere in the county, said Charles Edwards, head of Project Los Angeles 
90044, a three-year pilot program designed to tackle chronic problems of abuse 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty is the main cause of neglect in the 90044 area and other areas, 
department officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The drop in numbers may or may not have something to do with the work we've 
done in the project, but we have been very successful in our approach in 
dealing with these families," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is part of the department's family preservation efforts to keep 
children with their families and work on problems that might lead children to 
be placed in foster care. Most often, Digre said, families in these programs 
have trouble providing enough food, housing and clothing for their children, 
all of which are considered problems of neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than putting five kids in foster care, why not spend $500 for a 
refrigerator if that's what they need?" Digre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew also said an increase in family preservation could result in a drop in 
reporting of cases, but there are no figures to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the increase in calls is due to rising awareness of child abuse and 
neglect, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of calls do not warrant referrals for home visits, the first step in 
dealing with cases in the department, officials said. Whether a case is opened 
is based on criteria discovered during a home visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining calls, about eight out of 10 are resolved within six weeks, 
either through family preservation, counseling or a voluntary referral service. 
The rest become full cases -- often ending up in dependency court and lasting 
three to six months, said Douglas Steinmeyer, program specialist for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 The department handles dependency court cases of about 1,200 children per 
month from throughout the county, Steinmeyer said. Cases usually go to 
dependency court for official permission from a judge ordering family 
preservation measures or placing a child in foster care. Incidents of Child 
Abuse

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; SPIELBERG AND THE GANG; THE 'SCHINDLER' DIRECTOR, 
ALONG WITH DE PALMA, COPPOLA, LUCAS AND SCORSESE, HAS DEFINED FILM SUCCESS -- 
BOTH CRITICALLY AND COMMERCIALLY -- OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS (EVEN THOUGH THE 
GREAT FRIENDS HAVE ONLY ONE BEST DIRECTOR OSCAR AMONG THEM -- SO FAR). WHAT IS 
IT ABOUT THESE GUYS ANYWAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The odds are strong that Steven Spielberg will win the Academy Award Monday 
night, but the Oscar he is likely to get at last, for directing "Schindler's 
List," might seem to some to be merely the old guard's belated concession that 
he is the most important commercial movie maker in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy, after all, is just that -- an academy, a repository of received 
wisdom and guiding tradition. Spielberg and his generation of directors, though 
the first to be trained in film schools, have not always gone about their 
careers in academy-like ways as they pursued younger audiences, indulged 
idiosyncrasy, celebrated technology and sex and, in growing numbers, fled 
Hollywood altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg, at 47, is now old enough to embody the academy, or at least the new 
academy. Furthermore, he's as much a mogul as a director, the emperor of Amblin 
and all he surveys. But before he takes that expected walk up the red-carpeted 
aisle to be industrially sanctified Monday night, it's worth noting that for 20 
years he has been a member of a smaller, more elite fraternity of directors 
brought together by time, talent and friendship -- an extended family that is 
rarely seen together in public yet communicates through its own back channels 
and private screenings, a group that has left an indelible mark on Hollywood, 
yet has only one director's Oscar to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The family does not have a fixed number, but at its center are five men: 
Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese and Brian De 
Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 In the popular imagination, their names conjure up disparate images and 
mythologies, but if you talk to them and their associates, you discover that 
the way they view one another is not at all the way critics and moviegoers see 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They each have different styles, interests and sensibilities, but in a 
business where success can depend on your best friend's failure, they seem to 
have shared a common regard for the talents of the other members. What is more, 
they share history. 
</P>
<P>
 All of them arrived in Hollywood in the late '60s or early '70s, during the 
period when the great studios were losing their grip on the business and a new 
youth culture was clamoring at the gates. Mike Medavoy, the former TriStar and 
Orion chairman who was then an agent, claims to have introduced many of them to 
one another after recruiting them for representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas and Spielberg together would conceive and create the character of 
Indiana Jones in 1977, the year they made "Star Wars" and "Close Encounters of 
the Third Kind," respectively; last year, when Spielberg had to leave for 
Poland to film "Schindler's List," he asked Lucas to supervise the final 
editing of "Jurassic Park." Coppola produced Lucas' "THX 1138" and "American 
Graffiti," then directed the Vietnam movie that Lucas had initially developed 
with writer John Milius, "Apocalypse Now." Lucas' ex-wife, Marcia, a film 
editor, edited Scorsese's "Taxi Driver," whose script was written by Paul 
Schrader, who also had written an early draft of "Close Encounters" and had 
been introduced to Scorsese by De Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 De Palma also introduced Scorsese to Robert De Niro, who would become the star 
of "Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull," "The King of Comedy" and "Cape Fear," not to 
mention Coppola's "Godfather II." (De Niro, then unknown, acted in De Palma's 
first feature, "The Wedding Party," released in 1968.) Coppola recommended 
Scorsese to actress Ellen Burstyn when she was looking for a director for 
"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1990 when De Palma was struggling with the final edit of his 
ill-fated "Bonfire of the Vanities," whom did he call in for an opinion but 
Spielberg. Spielberg introduced De Palma to De Palma's first wife, actress 
Nancy Allen, who later appeared in the Spielberg-produced "I Wanna Hold Your 
Hand." De Palma is the godfather to Spielberg's son, Max, from his marriage to 
actress Amy Irving, who appeared with Allen in De Palma's "Carrie" and starred 
in his thriller "The Fury." And so it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorsese and De Palma eventually returned to New York and Coppola and Lucas 
retreated to San Francisco, but the professional and personal ties have 
stretched across the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us in that group have had very positive, reinforcing relationships 
that have gone on forever and ever," says Lucas, speaking from his headquarters 
in San Rafael, where he is at work producing the mystery comedy "Radioland 
Murders." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has been supportive of one another and always been there if 
someone's in trouble, if there've been any problems. Francis and I have had our 
disagreements over the years, but there's never been anything where we stopped 
talking to each other. I've disagreed with everybody and everybody has 
disagreed with me and that goes from Steven and Brian and Marty and everybody 
else. But I don't believe any of the relationships have ever been strained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, it's harder to spend time with each other because everybody's so 
busy, but if you define friendship in a more spiritual way, I think everybody's 
gotten a lot closer. Because we've all gone down the same roads and have been 
sharing the same experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we all like each other's movies. Brian and Steven and Francis all saw 
'Star Wars' when I was cutting it and offered me advice. I've sat in on a lot 
of first cuts of Marty's pictures, giving him advice. There's been a lot of 
exchange of plots and ideas over the years from that whole group. I know Brian 
and Marty have been very close. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's been fairly successful, everybody's fairly rich and everybody's 
gotten a fair amount of respect and everybody's sort of been equally trashed by 
the media. There's probably more camaraderie in being trashed together than in 
being successful. When filmmakers sit around, they don't really talk about 
their successes, they talk about the people that have gone after them for one 
reason or another. 
</P>
<P>
 'We've all had our 'Howard the Duck,' our '1941,' our 'One From the Heart.' 
And everything you do, in the end, half the people think what you've done is 
terrible and the other half think it's wonderful. You know, even 'Schindler's 
List' is getting blasted, so there's no escape from getting trashed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas went to USC, Coppola to UCLA, Scorsese to NYU, and De Palma to Columbia. 
Spielberg attended Cal State Long Beach but dropped out to direct television 
shows for Universal before his 22nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg is the youngest of the five at 47; Lucas is 49; Scorsese, 51, De 
Palma, 53, and Coppola, 55. Coppola is the only one thus far to win an Oscar, 
for "The Godfather Part II." (He also won a screenwriting Oscar, in 1970, for 
"Patton.") Spielberg has been nominated four times, Scorsese three times, Lucas 
twice and De Palma not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg and Lucas have directed seven of the 10 top grossing films of all 
time, but while they were at it, the Oscar for best director has gone to such 
contemporaries as Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone (twice), Jonathan Demme and 
Michael Cimino. The godfather of the group, Coppola, is old enough to have 
started in the theater, at Hofstra University on Long Island, before heading 
west to enter UCLA's film school. He dropped out to make a B-picture ("Dementia 
13") for drive-in movie czar Roger Corman, though he was later awarded his 
degree for writing and directing the 1967 Warner Bros. feature "You're a Big 
Boy Now" that starred Elizabeth Hartman, Geraldine Page and Julie Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had heard about Francis," says Oscar-winning sound editor Walter Murch, 
who was then a classmate of Lucas' across town at USC. "He was legendary 
because he had managed to get paid for his master's thesis." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas managed to get hired as Coppola's administrative assistant at Warner's 
when they were the only two bearded men on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Mike Medavoy: "What was special about these guys is that they had to 
break through because the older guys were in charge. And remember, some guys 
didn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most promising members of their generation in America dropped out 
of the fray or took other roads: Monte Hellman ("Two Lane Blacktop"), Terrence 
Malick ("Badlands," "Days of Heaven") and Noel Black ("Pretty Poison"). 
</P>
<P>
 But at the time, the film-school turks were on the march. The invention of the 
transistor had made film equipment lighter, cheaper and portable, and opened 
filmmaking to people outside the studio system for the first time. The nouvelle 
auteur theory, raising the status of the director to culture hero, had traveled 
across the Atlantic from France.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now, all of a sudden," Murch recalls, "you could go out with a tape recorder 
and a 16mm portable camera, portable lights. It was a revolution Godard had 
started with 'Breathless,' where he showed that you could make an interesting 
film with that technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early days of Zoetrope (Studio) when George and Francis and I were all 
together in the late '60s was very much part of that aesthetic: 'Let's get some 
of that film-school-type equipment, throw it in the back of the van and travel 
across the country and make a film.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After directing Fred Astaire and Petula Clark in Warner's "Finian's Rainbow," 
Coppola did just that -- took off with Lucas in tow on a transcontinental film 
odyssey to make "The Rain People," the first film for his own mini-studio 
Zoetrope, based in San Francisco and fueled by anti-Hollywood idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned as a kind of film co-op that would make movies on tiny budgets, 
Zoetrope would be famously undone by its own success and financial 
mismanagement. Ironically, the huge box-office bonanza of Lucas' "Star Wars" 
propelled Hollywood into blockbuster fever in the late '70s and led to a 
backlash in which Lucas was blamed for Hollywood's new accountant-driven film 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spirit of the Coppola commune, in some ways, did not die. In 1985, 
when Murch was directing "Return to Oz" for Disney in London and having 
difficulties, Lucas flew in from Japan and Coppola from Los Angeles to lend 
their hands. Spielberg also stopped by, as did Phil Kaufman, another member of 
the Bay Area filmmakers' circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly brought a new sensibility to Hollywood," says screenwriter 
Frank Pierson about Spielberg and the rest of the gang of five. "Whether or not 
it was as revolutionary as it seemed at the time I don't know. But clearly what 
they represented was the wave of change in public taste and attitudes in many 
things, which they brought with them. And they came into the business with a 
kind of technical training that nobody before had."

 This technical proficiency, however, became and remains controversial. 
"Knowing which end of the camera is the lens and which end is the handle is not 
the important thing really," says Pierson, who wrote such films as "Dog Day 
Afternoon" and "Cat Ballou" and is the current president of the Writers Guild. 
"The important thing is what you bring in terms of life experience, of wisdom, 
of insight and all those things that go into making up an artist. I don't know 
that film school is necessarily a very good preparation for life, as opposed to 
a good preparation for making a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "They produced a result, which was a shift to ever-younger market orientation, 
ever-younger executives and an increasing focus on youth and a greater and 
greater discounting of experience." 
</P>
<P>
 It might also be said that Spielberg and his brethren have inspired a legion 
of imitators who seem even less interested in the traditions of 
characterization and drama and more preoccupied with the camera itself -- 
directors like Robert Zemeckis, Chris Columbus, Joe Dante and Phil Joanou. You 
need a long lens indeed to look at the work of Spielberg's imitators and hope 
to see in the distance any traces of the not-so-ancient films of Altman, 
Peckinpah, Nichols, Penn, Benton, Lumet, Mazursky and Schlesinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg himself has professed highest admiration for British director David 
Lean, and together with Scorsese persuaded Columbia to restore and re-release 
Lean's epic "Lawrence of Arabia" in 1988. De Palma looked to Hitchcock for 
inspiration as he developed his suspense thrillers, such as "Carrie," "The 
Fury" and "Dressed to Kill," and endured round after round of public bashing 
from feminists who believed his movies underscored women as targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work is not necessarily me," De Palma said in 1984, defending the release 
of "Body Double," a film in which a woman was murdered with a giant electric 
drill. "I happen to like women. I've said it a hundred-thousand times. If 
anybody believes it, I don't know anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Scorsese became the primary archivist of the group, buying hundreds of films 
for his personal library in New York. Scorsese met Coppola, a fellow Italian 
American, at a film festival in Sorrento in 1970, and would frequently come to 
San Francisco in later years to view movies in Coppola's home. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying film at NYU, Scorsese taught there and then apprenticed with 
Corman ("Boxcar Bertha"). In all, he spent 11 years in Los Angeles. Spielberg 
helped him polish the last 10 minutes of "Taxi Driver" in 1976 and Scorsese 
later directed an episode of Spielberg's "Amazing Stories" for television in 
the '80s. In fact, Spielberg was originally scheduled to direct "Cape Fear" and 
Scorsese "Schindler's List," but they decided to swap projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, De Palma, the other New Yorker, became so friendly with Spielberg 
that it was widely believed the two regularly sent each other their dailies on 
video to analyze and critique each other's work. Someone who has worked closely 
with both men observes, "They're like mechanical junkies, like these kids who 
would win the science fairs, comparing notes technically all the time. They're 
totally bonded and bound like a fraternity. Beside the spirit of film, the 
technology of film bonds them together. They're like little Trekkies." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The careers and images of the five men hardly suggest the common ground they 
seem to have found together. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Coppola, the operatic conductor who made some undeniably great movies 
a long time ago but more recently has made "Godfather III," "Bram Stoker's 
Dracula" and vintages of premium wine; Lucas, the modern myth maker who has put 
directing aside to produce films by other directors and oversee an empire of 
special-effects technology; De Palma, the fabulous voyeur and thrill-seeker 
whose taste is the raunchiest and least respectable; Scorsese, famous for his 
fervent dramas like "GoodFellas" and "Mean Streets," as well as for trying to 
show Jesus as a man with lust in his heart, and Spielberg, the greatest 
crowd-pleaser of all for his science-fiction melodramas like "Close Encounters" 
and "Jurassic Park," and children's stories that appealed to grown-ups ("E.T.," 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark"). 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from some critical blows he has taken along the way, as when he ventured 
into more literary territory in "The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun," 
Spielberg has enjoyed probably the most benign depiction in the media.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with scores of other powerful players, he was tarred with broad strokes 
by producer-author Julia Phillips (who produced "Close Encounters") in her 
best-selling "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again." And his integrity and 
general wholesomeness were questioned by writers Stephen Farber and Marc Green 
in the 1988 book "Outrageous Conduct," which investigated the fatal 1982 
helicopter crash on the set of the movie "The Twilight Zone" that Spielberg 
produced. But these are exceptions. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Because of the high offices each of the five occupies in the movie kingdom, 
all have been at the center of periodic storms of controversy about one film or 
another, with the result that they have sometimes been broadly typecast. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 on the set of "The Age of Innocence" in New York, Scorsese responded, 
"Ultimately I'm trying to be a director: not necessarily a filmmaker or a 
maverick filmmaker -- they try to give you these titles and suddenly I've 
discovered I'm a maverick. What is that? I'm not made up in the same way as 
Woody Allen, who has wonderful control of his material because he writes a 
picture a year within a certain framework production-wise. But I find different 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I can be a director in terms of the old Hollywood system, in 
which they were able to do anything that was given to them. In most cases, a 
lot of the men who directed brought the same enthusiasm to every project. But 
I'm tempted to do that, though I'm not interested in everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas agrees. "None of us is one-dimensional," he says. "People forget. I've 
done movies with Francis that get lost because they were unsuccessful." He's 
referring to the pair's producing of independent films like Paul Schrader's 
Japanese-themed "Mishima" and Godfrey Reggio's wordless Third World documentary 
"Powaqqatsi." 
</P>
<P>
 "People do movies for different reasons and get attached to certain subjects 
for different reasons and they're motivated by different kinds of things," 
Lucas goes on. "I don't think any of us would want to make the movies that the 
other guys are making. Brian wouldn't want to make my kind of movies, I 
wouldn't make Steven's kind of movies, Steven wouldn't want to make Marty's 
kind of movies, Marty wouldn't want to make Francis' kind of movies."  
</P>
<P>
 It's nearly forgotten now that Scorsese was one of the film editors on NYU 
colleague Michael Wadleigh's 1970 feature documentary "Woodstock," or that it 
was his idea to employ the humorous anachronism of flashing the lyrics to 
certain songs onscreen with a bouncing ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Marty's doing 'The Age of Innocence,' " Lucas says. " 'The Age of 
Innocence' is a perfect Scorsese movie. It's a movie about constraint and 
manners and convention -- that looms very big for Marty. He loves period epics. 
It's only if you think of everything as 'Raging Bull' are you surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we know a lot more about each other (than the public) and because 
we're good friends, to me when Steve brings out 'Schindler's List' it's 
absolutely no surprise at all. Of course he would do that and of course it 
would turn out like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are films I've always wanted to do that I've never managed to get 
around to doing that are very different from the kind of things I've done. 
Someday if I ever make any of those movies, people will be equally shocked and 
think, 'My God, how could he have done that!?' "

LOOKING FOR ROOM TO GROW; CHILDREN'S MUSEUM: A PLAN TO TAKE OVER ADJACENT MALL 
MOVES FORWARD, BUT OPERATORS ARE WEIGHING OTHER CHOICES. ONE OPTION IS MOVING 
TO A NEW SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The long-awaited expansion of the Children's Museum appeared to take a step 
forward last month when the City Council approved, in concept, a years-old 
proposal under which the museum would take over operation of the bedraggled, 
city-owned Los Angeles Mall that adjoins it. 
</P>
<P>
 But although city and museum officials say they are proceeding with the plan, 
museum officials are also keeping themselves open to other options for 
expansion -- including the possibility of leaving Downtown for another site. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials said the Los Angeles Mall plan, in the works for five years, 
is the favored option. But museum officials have also had talks with the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art about moving part or all of the Children's Museum 
to property the county facility hopes to buy in the Mid-Wilshire area for its 
own expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 And Vincent Beggs, Children's Museum executive director, said another entity, 
which he declined to identify, recently offered the museum an alternative 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials say they want to find the best location for the 225,000 
visitors they draw annually. "We're looking at all options right now," Beggs 
said. "Our biggest concern is, how can we best serve our constituency?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old museum began assessing future needs in 1985. It was already 
feeling squeezed in the 15,000-square-foot space at 310 N. Main St., at the end 
of the Los Angeles Mall, which was always meant to be a temporary site, Beggs 
said. "The space we're in was originally designed for a restaurant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the city in 1989 put out a call for new operators to take over the 
mall, which runs under City Hall East between Main and Los Angeles streets, the 
Children's Museum responded with its proposal to expand into the mall and take 
over its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the City Council approved a letter of intent to lease the mall, 
negotiated by city staff and Children's Museum supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that plan, the Children's Museum would expand to 80,000 square feet for 
an estimated $20 million. The museum would also renovate the underground 
shopping center, expected to cost $10 million, and take over mall operations 
and maintenance. The museum would lease the mall for $1 a year for 34 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit museum could also benefit from mall revenues, which would go 
toward operating expenses and which donors hope will recoup their investment. 
In a 1990 evaluation, consultants estimated that the mall made a profit of 
$66,000 on revenues of $676,000 that year. 
</P>
<P>
 City administrative officials herald the plan as a way for the city to get out 
of the mall business. The 20-year-old mall is in desperate need of repair that 
the city hasn't been able to afford, and the Children's Museum would pay for 
the renovation as well as hire a management company to run the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the improvements the mall needs, according to city officials, are new 
access ways for visitors with disabilities, new paving and air conditioning, 
and basic repairs and replacement of fixtures such as the fountains, drains, 
planters and electrical system. Asbestos clearing may also be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials believe that the renovations and a better mix of tenants will 
boost business at the mall, which empties on weeknights because it is dependent 
on government and business workers. The museum itself draws visitors on 
evenings and weekends, and that could translate into more mall business, said 
museum board member David Houk. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials are now in the middle of a 60-day inspection period during 
which they are checking the mall's structural features to determine whether it 
is feasible to proceed with the project or pull out. If museum officials decide 
to go ahead, the city and museum will spend the next year negotiating detailed 
lease agreements and other necessary documents to solidify the plan. The museum 
must also secure $3 million in donor pledges during that time to demonstrate 
its ability to raise money for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the contract documents are approved, the museum would launch its 
fund-raising campaign and have a year to draft design plans for both the mall 
renovation and its own expansion. Once it begins, construction is expected to 
take 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost or extent of repair work needed at the mall could conceivably scare 
museum officials away from the project. Beggs acknowledged that the vast 
changes in economic and real estate conditions since the project was first 
proposed could affect the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the County Museum offers a central location with good access. The 
museum is working to buy the vacant May Co. building next door on Wilshire 
Boulevard and is talking to a number of arts and cultural organizations about 
using that space or building its own structures on the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary analyses have indicated that there is room for a 
35,000-square-foot building at the Wilshire site, which would drop the 
Children's expansion cost to about $10 million but may not be enough space for 
the entire museum, Beggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Wilshire location for a second, auxiliary facility is another 
option, Beggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Children's Museum opts to back out of the mall plan, the city will 
continue to look for an operator to take over the shopping center, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the museum has been the only operator so far willing to pay for the 
renovation as well as run the mall, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers worry that a move out of Downtown by the Children's Museum will 
hurt the area's already struggling public image. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be good for Downtown, especially when we believe that 
'Downtown's Back,' " said Carol Schatz, vice president of the Central City 
Assn., an organization of Downtown businesses. "With (the renovations of) 
Pershing Square, the Convention Center, the Central Library and the Disney 
Concert Hall, . . . there are all these forces for positive change happening 
now."

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; THEY DON'T WRITE THE SONGS; BUT HAL KANTER AND BUZ 
KOHAN DO WRITE THE OSCAR SHOW -- MOST OF IT ANYWAY. HOW DO THEY DO THAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, Jack Matthews is the film critic of Newsday and New York 
Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've seen it many times. A star, on stage to present an award, is reading 
from prepared material when he suddenly leans forward, squints and begins 
speaking haltingly, as if the lines on the TelePrompTer are so unutterably 
stupid, his mind is too embarrassed to relay them to his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 As awkward as it may seem, the moment is actually a slick piece of acting, a 
little body performance pleading, "Don't blame me, I didn't write this crap!" 
</P>
<P>
 For veteran writers Hal Kanter and Buz Kohan, multiple Emmy winners for their 
work on past Oscar shows, the stars' lean-and-dodge maneuver is Pet Peeve No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the worst offense performers can commit," says Kohan, 60. "They agree 
to the material, sign off on it, then when they go out and blow a joke, they 
say, 'I didn't write it.' Well, they didn't write the stuff that made them 
successful, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds the 75-year-old Kanter, who did his first Oscar show while it was still 
on radio in 1952 and is doing his 25th this year: "Giving some actors a joke is 
like handing a straight razor to a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to spend much time with Kohan and Kanter to learn that working 
with presenters, tailoring material for the stars' personalities and images, is 
the hardest part of their job. Some want shorter speeches, some longer, some 
want them funnier, some prefer them serious. And they don't know who wants what 
until they have given them something to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never give an actor a blank piece of paper," Kanter says. "You have 
to give him something with words on it before he can destroy it." 
</P>
<P>
 The presenters' speeches, of course, are only one part of the prepared script. 
There are tributes, introductions to film clips, speeches by Academy and 
industry officials, jokey explanations of Price-Waterhouse's tabulating 
procedures, and the opening monologue of the host (this year Whoopi Goldberg). 
</P>
<P>
 Kohan and Kanter say they wrote Goldberg's Oscar speeches in 1991 and 1992, 
when she was a presenter, and she read them exactly as written. But like Billy 
Crystal and Johnny Carson before her, she reserved the right as host to prepare 
her own monologue, and her staff of three writers has been working on it since 
she was signed on early last month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for what Goldberg will say the rest of the evening, while introducing 
presenters, musical numbers and other speakers, Kohan and Kanter are holding 
their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "We write the first version of what she will say," Kohan says. "Then that goes 
to her writers, and they do their thing, then she has her input. In the end, 
it's up to her. She's out there and the show is live. If she maintains her 
spontaneity without getting too controversial, she'll be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohan and Kanter have worked together on the Oscar show for the last four 
years and they bring vastly different backgrounds to the task. Kanter started 
his career as a contract writer at Paramount, and between building a reputation 
as Hollywood's funniest luncheon and dinner speaker, wrote scripts for a pair 
of Elvis Presley movies ("Loving You" and "Blue Hawaii") and Frank Capra's 1960 
"Pocketful of Miracles." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohan, a 13-time Emmy winner, somehow converted a masters degree in 
composition from the Eastman School of Music into a career as a variety show 
writer ("They paid more for the word than the note," he says). He wrote for the 
Perry Como, Steve Lawrence and Sammy Davis Jr. programs before becoming head 
writer of the long-running "Carol Burnett Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the demise of variety shows on TV, Kohan has been on the annual awards 
cycle (besides the Oscars, he writes for the Grammys, Tonys, Emmys and People's 
Choice awards), anniversaries ("Bob Hope's 90th Birthday"), and specials ("The 
Jackson Family Honors"). 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, with the show's theme being a tribute to women in film, producer 
Gilbert Cates wanted a woman on the writing team and, at Kanter's suggestion, 
hired former L.A. Times movie critic Sheila Benson. This year, the theme is a 
celebration of the filmmaking process, of the people behind the camera, and 
Kohan and Kanter are back as a duet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohan worked on this year's Grammys right up to the March 1 broadcast, and 
flew back the next day to join Kanter for a meeting at the Academy's Westwood 
production offices. The two had already divided up their responsibilities. 
Kanter defers to Kohan on music categories and song introductions, Kohan defers 
to Kanter on screenwriting and directing. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the rest, we just stare at each other until one flinches," Kohan says. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how soon they begin, or how well they write, they say their words 
are always negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say the show isn't written, it's rewritten," Kanter says. "You spend 
weeks writing it, and in the last couple of days, it's rewritten." 
</P>
<P>
 "The performers, or their PR people, know that the earlier they complain, the 
less chance they'll have of getting what they want," Kohan says. "If they wait 
until three hours before air time and say, 'He doesn't want to say this,' you 
either have to rewrite it or get another presenter." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, of course, stars have hidden agendas, for which there is no 
defense. Last year, presenter Richard Gere made a loopy plea for viewers to 
gather their vibes and drive the Chinese out of Tibet, and a few minutes later, 
Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon segued from their prepared text to remind the 
world of the Haitian boat people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's live, that's what makes it a white-knuckler," Kanter says. "You can't 
make people stick to the script." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff writers' roles are limited by the format and by the heft of its 
participants. Part variety show, part news event, part horse race and all 
promotion, the Academy Awards is a 3 1/3-hour movie ad broken up by TV 
commercials. Kohan and Kanter have to offend no one while trying to please 
everyone, to be informative, witty, even dignified, knowing that afterward, 
most critics will say, "My God, it was even worse than last year!" 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kanter, a member of the Academy's Board of Governors, takes a seat in 
the auditorium for the show, Kohan stays backstage with the host's writers and 
continues coming up with jokes while the event is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember two years ago when Billy Crystal turned Jack Palance's one-armed 
push-ups into a series of running gags so perfect you might have thought the 
whole thing was rigged? Kohan says the lines were all written backstage and 
given to Crystal during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't plan a thing like (Palance's push-ups), you can only take advantage 
of it when it happens," Kohan says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, an engineer named Alan Splet won the Oscar for sound effects editing 
for "The Black Stallion," but he wasn't there to pick up the award, and host 
Johnny Carson, who Kanter says loved spitting out the name "Splet," made him 
the evening's running gag. 
</P>
<P>
 "First George C. Scott doesn't show, then Marlon Brando, and now Alan Splet!," 
Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the show, Carson provided updates on Splet's whereabouts ("He 
missed the off-ramp . . . he's somewhere in Ensenada . . . He's had trouble 
with his carburetor outside Barstow"), then seized the opportunity provided 
when Melvyn Douglas wasn't on hand to receive his award for best supporting 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not Melvyn Douglas' fault he's not here," Carson said. "He's in a car 
pool with Alan Splet." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohan says that when Frank Sinatra was cut off by producers of the recent 
Grammy show, he and the other writers backstage immediately started writing 
jokes to break the tension. But Kohan says host Gary Shandling came up with his 
own quip. "He said, 'I've got the line' and went out and did it. He said, 'I 
just got a call from Lorena Bobbitt, who said "Even I wouldn't cut Frank 
Sinatra." ' Do this year's Oscar show writers have an acceptance speech they'd 
love to hear? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'd like to hear someone say, 'I want to thank the guys who wrote this 
show and made it go so well,"' Kohan laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter says he'd like to give his own acceptance speech, and had one ready two 
years ago when the 64th Academy Awards show won an Emmy for its writers. But 
Crystal was also a member of the credited writing team and he accepted for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the speech Kanter says he would have given: "I want to thank our 
producer, Gil Cates, and those stars who have read the script exactly as we 
wrote it. And you both know who you are."

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; OSKAR'S RACE IS ALL BUT OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, Kenneth Turan is The Times' film critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any gambler's business, the movies love a sure thing. But the business 
also loves action, the rogue excitement of not knowing who is going to come out 
on top. Which is just the kind of uncertainty that looks to be largely absent 
from this year's Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 So, oppressed by the near unanimity about who will win the top four Oscars, 
desperate action junkies have taken to constructing alternative scenarios based 
on this communitywide boredom. What if people have had enough of "Schindler's 
List" and decide to vote for "The Piano"? Or, conversely, what if people have 
had enough of "The Piano's" Holly Hunter and defect to everyone's favorite 
underdog, Angela Bassett in "What's Love Got to Do With It"? And so on into the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Like alternative universes in science fiction, these hypotheses are diverting 
but not necessarily relevant or convincing. For though it takes some of the fun 
out of the proceedings, the question for Monday night is not if "Schindler's 
List" will win but how broad the victory will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by a flood of timely news stories about the film's emotional openings 
in Germany and Israel (a coincidence or a canny move by Universal's marketing 
department?), the buzz around "Schindler's List" has, if anything, grown 
stronger. Nominated for 12 Oscars, it has a decent shot at every last one of 
them, making it possible (though unlikely) that it could surpass the two most 
successful films ever, "Ben-Hur" with 11 awards and "West Side Story" with 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for some specifics: 
</P>
<P>
 Best Picture. So powerful has the "Schindler's" machinery become that who 
among you can still name all four other nominees. (For the record they are "The 
Fugitive," "In the Name of the Father," "The Piano" and "The Remains of the 
Day.") Though "The Piano" has the most die-hard adherents, plus the most 
persistent advertising campaign, even its chances are considered slim at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Director. Though share-the-wealth critics' groups make purists grumble by 
splitting the best picture and best director awards, the academy figures to do 
no such thing. Having given Oscars to the same film and director for three 
seasons running, the voters are unlikely to change in this of all years. 
Biggest suspense of the night will be to see if Steven Spielberg can come up 
with a new wrinkle for his acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Actor. As a good Hollywood soldier starring in the best-intentioned 
"Philadelphia," Tom Hanks has been the favorite in this category for months, 
and though his status has gotten a bit shaky, he is still the front-runner. If 
the support for "Schindler's List" turns into a tidal wave, Liam Neeson could 
get the win, and don't forget that Daniel Day-Lewis turned a lot of heads in 
"In the Name of the Father." 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Actress. Aside from Angela Bassett, who has emerged as a strong 
sentimental favorite, the rest of the contenders for Holly Hunter's throne 
(Stockard Channing, Emma Thompson, Debra Winger) have not worked up much 
momentum. Hunter has won every possible actress award from Cannes to now, and 
Oscar night shouldn't be any different. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: Holly Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Supporting Actress. As if to make up for the way Hunter overshadows the 
actress category, this one is almost impossible to handicap. Neither Hunter nor 
Thompson figures to be factors here, and both Rosie Perez ("Fearless") and 
Winona Ryder ("The Age of Innocence") are well-liked actresses in not terribly 
popular films. Little Anna Paquin, Hunter's daughter in "The Piano," just might 
sneak in under the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: Anna Paquin. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Supporting Actor. Only marginally easier than the supporting actress 
category, this award looked like a lock for Tommy Lee Jones in "The Fugitive" 
until the "Schindler's List" express picked up momentum. A respected Hollywood 
veteran in a swell performance, Jones could still pull it out, but remember 
that many of the factors that point to him also pointed to Nick Nolte in 
"Prince of Tides," and he lost to Brit Anthony Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: Ralph Fiennes. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Original Screenplay. Though the scripts for "Dave," "In the Line of Fire" 
and "Sleepless in Seattle" were terribly entertaining, Jane Campion's 
screenplay for "The Piano" is probably the most accomplished of the bunch, as 
well as representing the film that has the most across-the-board support of all 
the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: Jane Campion. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Adapted Screenplay. Despite the presence of classic novels like "The Age 
of Innocence" (Jay Cocks and Martin Scorsese) and admired screenwriters like 
Ruth Prawer Jhabvala ("The Remains of the Day"), Steven Zaillian, who also did 
an artful adaptation of "Searching for Bobby Fischer," almost can't miss being 
rewarded for his exceptional work on Thomas Keneally's book. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: Steven Zaillian. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Foreign-Language Film. Except for "Hedd Wyn," the Welsh film from 
Britain, all the other nominees are popular enough to have had successful 
theatrical releases. But the three Asian films ("Farewell My Concubine" from 
Hong Kong, "The Scent of Green Papaya" from Vietnam and "The Wedding Banquet" 
from Taiwan) look to cancel one another out, giving the trophy to Spain's 
"Belle Epoque." Anyone who remembers previous Oscar winners like 
"Mediterraneo," "To Begin Again" and "Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears" knows 
the value of well-placed sentiment with this particular group. 
</P>
<P>
 The pick: "Belle Epoque."

RESIDENTS CAMPAIGN TO SCUTTLE SHELTER PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since San Pedro residents discovered that a homeless shelter is proposed for 
surplus Navy housing in the middle of a residential area, they have turned 
their anger into a united front, vowing to halt the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and real estate agents formed a group, Concerned Citizens, just 
days after they found out that Turner's Technical Institute, a homeless 
advocacy organization based in South Central, planned to run the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical plans to run a housing program for up to 600 homeless 
people in 144 units of Navy property at 2300 Taper Ave. The plan already has 
been approved by the federal Health and Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned Citizens countered by distributing 4,000 flyers last week, rallying 
1,000 people to protest the plan Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Community opposition is not a case of just saying "not in my back yard," 
residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is 'San Pedro Cares,' but we've done more than our share," resident 
Bonnie Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The community was not told about the plan before approval was given, and it 
already has a number of homeless shelters, subsidized housing programs and 
churches that feed the hungry, residents said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Navy is closing down the Long Beach Naval Station and will move out 
enlisted personnel and their families from 44 buildings on the 27-acre site, 
which is surrounded by single-family homes in San Pedro and Rancho Palos 
Verdes.  
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, homeless advocacy groups such as Turner's Technical 
Institute are given priority on federal land that has been declared surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health and Human Services Department decides which organization gets the 
property and has already approved the Turner's application to use the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical is not required to get permission from the community, and 
the Navy "can't arbitrarily overturn the decision by HHS," said Long Beach Navy 
spokesman Lt. Carl Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy prefers that all parties come to an agreement or compromise before 
we give our stamp of approval. Obviously, we recognize that that might not be 
possible in all cases, and we can't delay these matters indefinitely because 
that wouldn't be in keeping with the spirit of the legislation," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical Institute made an impassioned plea for community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives say the housing will be used for an atypical group of homeless 
families and individuals, those displaced by natural disasters or the recession 
who are too proud to seek welfare help. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the site would be gated, and no foot traffic to or from the premises 
would be allowed. A committee with community representatives would rigorously 
screen applicants, and no substance abusers would be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical Institute will hold its own meeting to address public 
concerns at Dodson Junior High School in Rancho Palos Verdes on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Concerned Citizens group said it will continue its opposition with 
petitions and more gatherings.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: USC AREA; MOSQUE OPENING DOORS TO COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the Mas Jid Omar Ibn Al Khattab Mosque is being touted as the first 
traditional mosque built in Los Angeles, the center's leaders are taking a less 
orthodox approach to its role in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to have a mosque where everybody can come, not just Muslims," 
said Salaha Abdul-Wahid, a spokesman for the mosque at 1025 Exposition Blvd. 
and director of the nearby Pontifex Media Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the main prayer room, striped carpeting guides worshipers to the east, 
the direction of Mecca. A mimbar, or a wooden podium from which the service is 
conducted, stands in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs, a large multipurpose room serves as an alternate prayer room and 
community service hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're hoping to do is have this be a community hall where we can have 
meetings to discuss crime or education or housing," said Abdul-Wahid as he 
walked around the downstairs hall. 
</P>
<P>
 To make all Muslims feel welcome, the mosque is led by a dawah, or religious 
educator, rather than an imam, or religious leader, Abdul-Wahid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get away from the idea of a personality-driven mosque. There are 
so many divergent issues that to have one leader would have closed it off to 
another group, and if you close it off, then you close off a possible 
dialogue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40,000-square-foot mosque opened in January, nearly a decade after plans 
were made to build the prayer center. The cost of construction was about $7.5 
million, Abdul-Wahid said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although securing building permits was a slow process and construction was 
stop-and-go, Abdul-Wahid said, the mosque has allowed leaders an opportunity to 
establish better ties with residents outside the Muslim community. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosque leaders have been campaigning to have the Metro Blue Line extended to 
the USC area. 
</P>

 The mosque, named after a companion of the prophet Muhammad, drew nearly 2,000 
worshipers when it opened. Since then, more than 700 people continue to attend 
Friday services, the mosque's leaders said. Community leaders estimate that 
300,000 Muslims live in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Wahid said many worshipers were alerted to the new building by the dark 
green dome crowned by a brass crescent moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we put on the dome, it was really a momentous occasion," he said. "We 
filmed it, because most Muslims felt like the mosque was really here when the 
dome was put on."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: JURY WEIGHS DEATH SENTENCE IN KILLINGS

<P>
 A jury continued to deliberate Friday whether to sentence a man found guilty 
of killing two Nickerson Gardens residents to the death penalty or life in 
prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Baptiste Neal, 21, was found guilty March 8 on two counts of first-degree 
murder in the shooting deaths of Tomas Miza, 48, and his nephew, Eliseo Miza, 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were shot Jan. 16, 1993, while sitting in their van on Antwerp Avenue 
in Nickerson Gardens. Neal approached the van and shot Tomas Miza in the head 
and then Eliseo Miza in the chest. Tomas Miza's daughter, Olga, was wounded. 
Prosecutors did not present a motive for the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Neal a few days later at an apartment at Nickerson Gardens. He 
was later charged in the Mizas' deaths and in the fatal shooting of Anders 
Ordaz, another resident of the housing project, that occurred two weeks earlier 
on Jan. 2. The jury deadlocked, 11 to 1, on that murder charge, Carbaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the cold-blooded murders of three innocent people, and that deserves 
the death penalty," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Carbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for Neal, who was 20 at the time of the slayings, asked the 
jury to sentence Neal to life in prison without the possibility of parole. "He 
was a bright young man who should have had an opportunity to grow in the world 
and didn't," said Stanley Perlo, the deputy public defender representing Neal.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you ever want to find a story where everything that could go wrong did go 
wrong, Sean Baptiste Neal is it. Everything that could go wrong did, from 
coming from a broken home, to being a victim of random violence, to being 
isolated in a community filled with gang violence," Perlo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, an alleged gang member, was arrested when he was 16 in connection with 
an armed carjacking, according to Carbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's killings prompted an outcry from residents who said Latinos were 
increasingly preyed upon by gangs. Latinos make up about one-third of the 6,224 
residents at Nickerson Gardens and Jordan Downs. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; STUDENTS' SCIENCE PROJECT GETS A BOOST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teacher Brendhen Van Loo had just exchanged wedding vows last summer when he 
discovered the launching pad to send his students' science project into space. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loo was greeting friends at his reception in Colorado when he and a 
friend, Mike Voorhees, began discussing his Jefferson High School students. 
Voorhees is a scientist at BioServe Space Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Voorhees suggested the two work together on a project that would allow 
students to take part in the Scientific Opportunities for At-Risk Students 
(SOAR), a nationwide project that provides inner-city students a chance to 
explore research using state-of-the-art equipment. The students' $12,000 
project was funded by a grant from Southern California Edison and BioServe, a 
center for commercial development of space at the University of Colorado at 
Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year later, Van Loo and 10 of his students traveled to the Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida to watch their science project take off March 8 aboard 
the space shuttle Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first time I did something like this," said Ramiro Garate, 14, 
referring to the five-day trip that included touring the space center and 
meeting some of the scientists there. "Usually you observe things, but this was 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Astronauts helped in the project by inducing the hatching of killifish, small 
carnivorous fish whose eggs can be held in a state of suspended animation until 
ready to hatch. The project will look at how the eggs survive in this state 
until they are exposed to water. The process is a natural defense to combat the 
evaporation of water in their habitat of Zanzibar. This week the students 
prepared to look at the results. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Van Loo recruited 14- to 18-year-old students who were willing to 
work on a science project over their vacation. For nearly a month students 
volunteered up to four hours daily, helping prepare liquid solutions that would 
work in space and document their experiment, Van Loo said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Van Loo and students like Garate, the aim of the project is to foster a 
hands-on approach to science and get them hooked on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This teaches them organizational skills they'll need to survive in college," 
Van Loo said. "They've been taught how to keep good records, and you have to 
document everything in college. Those are the people that succeed." SANDRA

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTHEAST AREA; GROUP HELPS LATINOS WITH AIDS, HIV

 Ruben Acosta wants local Latinos with HIV to wake up and get help. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Latino homosexuals are unwilling to acknowledge their sexual orientation 
or seek help if they become HIV-positive because of cultural and religious 
traditions, said Acosta, the founder of Action Now, a new general-service AIDS 
organization serving the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, who is 34 and HIV-positive, speaks from experience. He says he married 
and had two children before he admitted to himself that he is gay. Now he hopes 
he can help "tear down the walls of denial" in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do know someone with AIDS," said Acosta, who was diagnosed with the AIDS 
virus two years ago. "They're your gardener or your child's Sunday school 
teacher or your attendant at Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Action Now, which opened March 1 in Downey, will provide assistance to people 
with HIV and AIDS, their caretakers and survivors through free counseling, an 
information and referral center, and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta hopes to target the Latino population in 19 Southeast cities, such as 
Maywood and Huntington Park, where more than 92% of residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 By providing counseling for Spanish speakers and support groups for Latinos, 
Action Now and other agencies are "responding to the changing face of AIDS," 
said Dean Lacitra, a spokesman for AIDS Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 After whites, Latinos have the highest rate of infection, according to the Los 
Angeles County Department of Health Services. But because of machismo and the 
cultural stigma associated with homosexuality, Acosta said, Latino cases are 
severely underreported. 
</P>
<P>
 Action Now may make it easier for Southeast-area residents to come forward and 
get help, Acosta said. The organization attracted about a dozen clients in its 
first two weeks of operation and 250 people to its first major event, a 
candlelight gathering last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The community's positive response demonstrates that Action Now has "hit the 
nail on the head" and reflects the local need for AIDS services, said Enid 
Awad, executive director of the Southern California Rehabilitation Services, a 
nonprofit umbrella group that oversees Action Now and other programs that help 
people with disabilities live independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Action Now clients will be able to tap resources such as job and housing 
placement, transportation and other services that the umbrella group provides, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, an aerospace quality control manager who has become an AIDS activist, 
is planning outreach to all Southeast residents and hopes to make presentations 
at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids have uncles and moms that are dying or have died," Acosta said. 
"They need to be able to talk about it . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta is Action Now's only employee, and the organization operates on a 
$24,000 budget provided through Southern California Rehabilitation Services. 
Acosta has planned a Southwestern cook-off fund-raiser for May 13 and hopes to 
organize a hair cut-a-thon to raise money -- and the organization's profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in Bell Gardens are still traveling to Hollywood and Long Beach 
for help, and we want them to know that there is help right here," Acosta said.

 Under Operation Kid Print, children in Bell and Maywood will be safer and more 
savvy, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Kid Print, a free program sponsored by Assemblywoman Martha M. 
Escutia (D-Huntington Park) in cooperation with the Maywood and Bell city 
councils and police departments, will fingerprint up to 20,000 elementary 
schoolchildren in the Southeast area, a Maywood Police Department spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During presentations at local schools this month and next, police will talk to 
children about safety, avoiding strangers and how to get help. Police also will 
record the physical description, medical information and fingerprints of each 
child to be used in case of disappearance or kidnaping.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL; PLAN TO REOPEN CASINO STILL ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plan to reopen the Bell casino may be troubled but it is still ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, two investor groups pulled out of a deal to open the beleaguered 
poker parlor and the city has returned a $500,000 deposit to Worldwide 
Entertainment Centers of Carlsbad and California Casino of Bell, a Los Angeles 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 James Knapp, the casino building's owner, has submitted a gaming license 
application to the city along with a $500 processing fee, said Robert Rizzo, 
chief administrative officer. Knapp has also submitted a license application to 
state officials, a process that could take as long as six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp has leased the casino to other operators for 14 years, Rizzo said, and 
"now he wants to try it on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp failed to return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The first deal folded because investors could not front the $1.35 million in 
good-faith money that the city required, Councilman George Cole said at the 
time. It is unclear whether the city would require Knapp to pay the same kind 
of deposit, Rizzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Werrlein Jr., who managed the formerly successful card club until he 
pleaded guilty in 1984 to mail fraud and owning an illegal gambling business, 
is still contracted to monitor casino operations, Rizzo said. MARY HELEN BERG

<P>
 The Word of God Alternative School was struggling to stay open last week after 
the Department of Children's Services refused to pay $15,000 in tuition that 
Principal Joshua Smith had been expecting since October. 
</P>
<P>
 Tedji Dessalegn, a special assistant with Children's Services, said Smith 
improperly duplicated and distributed a child care agreement contract that the 
department had sent to him for one student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel for what Mr. Smith is trying to do for the children, but the fact is 
he should never have given out those forms," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessalegn said that while Smith's school qualifies to be paid as a day care 
site, the 22 students are not eligible because they are not under the 
protective custody of Children's Services. The students might qualify for 
subsidies under other county programs, officials said, but that has yet to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith maintains that he simply acted upon the instructions of an employee 
within Children's Services' financial department. "If what I did was wrong, I 
needed to know that up front," he said. "I was led to believe that I was going 
to be paid for the students." Smith said he recruited the students after 
duplicating the form, then hired additional teachers and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has managed to keep its preschool open with the help of parental 
support that Smith called nothing less than divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going day-to-day here," said Smith at his office, cluttered with copies 
of letters he has sent to politicians seeking support for his school. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago Smith sent a letter to parents saying he would have to close 
the campus for good. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, 45 parents convened on the Crenshaw district campus to brainstorm 
about ways to keep the operation going. The non-denominational Christian 
school, which once served about 120 elementary, junior high and high school 
students, had shut down by degrees since October until only the preschool was 
in session. Enrollment has dropped to about 20 preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 Myra Washington said she and other parents simply cannot afford to lose the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Joshua is doing is not only educating kids, giving them the attention 
they need, but allowing mothers on welfare to work at full-time jobs and get 
themselves off welfare," said the 33-year-old mother of two preschool students. 
"He is actually doing what everybody else just talks about doing. We had to get 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Though many of the parents are supported by government aid, they passed the 
hat and came up with $500 to help Smith pay overdue gas and power bills. Then 
they mapped out plans that could help the school get back on its feet: 
fund-raisers and letter-writing campaigns to business people and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin raising the minimum $10,000 that Smith needs to pay teachers, parents 
have agreed to donate whatever extra money they can after paying the monthly 
tuition, which ranges from $150 to $300. They are appealing to local businesses 
to donate money, books, musical instruments, record players and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and other parents are also planning a fashion and talent show 
fund-raiser April 30 at the South Park Recreation Center in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Preschool director Beatrice Kellough said that even though she has not been 
fully paid since November, she "hangs in there" because she loves the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had problems paying rent and other things. I work 12-hour days here. But 
every weekend I rejuvenate," said Kellough. "I believe in my heart that things 
will work out." ERIN J. AUBRY

 Maurice White, an original member of the South-Central Panthers firefighting 
team, died March 5 from gunshot wounds inflicted during a party in 
South-Central Los Angeles. He was 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton Division police said White was shot when a fight broke out at a house 
party on East 22nd Street. It was unclear if White was directly involved in the 
dispute. No arrests had been made as of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 White's violent death is in sharp contrast to his work in the Panthers, a 
group that came to symbolize the possibility for peaceful coexistence and team 
spirit among former gang members. White joined the Panthers last June when the 
job training program, co-sponsored by the U.S. Forestry Service, became 
available through the Crenshaw-based L.A. Unemployed Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dozen Panthers quickly attracted media attention because the one-time 
rival gang members learned to work side by side in life-threatening situations. 
The Panthers received national media coverage last fall when the team spent 
16-hour days battling the disastrous Malibu and Altadena fires. 
</P>
<P>
 White was one of the most inspirational members of the team, recalled fellow 
Panther Clinzell Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he saw you down, he would help you, pump you up, keep you going," said 
Washington. "He gave you this feeling that if he could do it, so could you." 
</P>
<P>
 White, a student at Compton College who said he most enjoyed philosophy 
courses, was also remembered for his constant espousing of black pride and 
discussions of how to improve conditions in African American communities. He 
frequently sported African beads, earrings and other jewelry. Panther Clifton 
Dunlap said White saw the Panthers as a perfect opportunity for black people to 
come together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have had our differences, but we worked together," Dunlap said. 
"Maurice always thought positively about the black community. He used to work 
so hard fighting fires he'd always sleep the whole way back home on the bus. 
But he was a great motivator. We truly lost our brother." 
</P>
<P>
 White's last assignment with the Panthers was early last month, when the crew 
was called on to help distribute food and other disaster relief among 
earthquake victims in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me then, 'Why do people here only get crackers and water, and other 
places they get so much more?' " Dunlap said. "He was always aware that things 
weren't equal, that there was so much to be done in South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 But White didn't get the chance to do any of the things he had talked about 
doing, said girlfriend Nicole Ennis. "He talked most about setting up something 
for kids, young people," she said. "He had so many intentions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice's mother, Barbara White, said her son's greatest asset proved to be 
his downfall. "He loved his friends and his homeys," she said. "He couldn't 
separate himself from them when he needed to." 
</P>
<P>
 White is also survived by a brother, Rayfus Jr.; a sister, Kimberly Nakia 
Stewart, and a daughter, Mahogany. ERIN J. AUBRY

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; WHO'D KNOW BETTER ABOUT THE CREAM OF 1993'S ACTING 
CROP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 T alent has never been the sole criterion in the Oscar race. Awards have been 
granted to sentimental favorites such as John Wayne for 1969's "True Grit" as 
well as to industry stalwarts whose body of work warranted an award -- even if 
their nominated performances might not. (Think Elizabeth Taylor in "Butterfield 
8" or Paul Newman in "The Color of Money.")  
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of Monday's Oscar ceremony, however, The Times asked three 
prominent acting coaches -- Howard Fine, Janet Alhanti and Larry Moss -- to 
size up the best actor and actress and best supporting actor and actress 
categories solely on the basis of the performances . Here are their responses: 
Best Actress 
</P>
<P>
 ANGELA BASSETT ("What's Love Got to Do With It")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: It's very difficult to play someone alive and known -- especially 
someone as raw and passionate as Tina Turner. Bassett made Turner her own not 
through imitation but by finding those parts of the character inside herself. 
The major mistake the filmmakers made was showing Turner herself at the end, 
which reminded us of the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Bassett was a great choice for the role. She has an aliveness as a 
person, a larger-than-life quality, which rivals the passion of Tina Turner. 
From the outset, she creates the feeling that her character is pulsating, ready 
for picking like a big, ripe tomato. She combined great tenderness and 
vulnerability with a (expletive) quality. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCKARD CHANNING ("Six Degrees of Separation")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: The easy choice would have been to "label" the role, to create a 
superficial one-dimensional East Side socialite. Channing instead gave us a 
restless spirit, a woman searching for passion and trapped by comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: Whenever anyone asks me where the intelligent, witty, sophisticated, 
vulnerable actresses of the '30s and '40s are, I point to Channing. She's about 
the only actress working now that has all of those qualities -- and this part 
tapped all of it. Instead of playing the character like a cliche -- a brittle, 
dislikable society woman -- she gave us someone fighting for her life. This is 
the best role yet for her on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 HOLLY HUNTER ("The Piano")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: One of the first things some actors do is underline the number of lines 
they have in a script. The more words, they believe, the better the role. In 
this case, however, Hunter had to communicate without dialogue. Through her 
eyes and body, she had to make us feel her soul. Hunter has an "animal" essence 
-- you never know what she'll do next. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: Hunter's performance was stark, grim, very pilgrim and gothic, and 
never really made me care about the character. I didn't worry about her, 
because she was so strong and willful. She was childlike with her daughter, 
removed from her husband, even wary of her lover. When she finally gave in to 
him I breathed a sigh of relief -- it was like letting air in the room. I also 
never felt her passion for the piano, which was her history, her voice, her 
womanhood. When she touched those keys, we should have been taken to another 
place. I wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Hunter is not a great beauty, but her fierce commitment to what she does 
makes her very charismatic. This was a brave performance, completely 
self-absorbed. She wasn't afraid of the narcissism of the character, which was 
a survival technique in a situation beyond her control. I felt Hunter's 
excitement playing the role. Like Shirley MacLaine in "Terms of Endearment," 
she knew she was made for it. 
</P>
<P>
 EMMA THOMPSON ("The Remains of the Day")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: Thompson combines the best of the British vocal school and American 
emotional gutsiness. Because she's as strong as (Anthony) Hopkins, so evenly 
matched, it's a pleasure to watch the two on screen. Thompson's strength is 
playing high-moral-fiber characters with complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: It took a real piece of acting to play a part this restrictive, since 
Thompson is such a free spirit. She does performance art. She breathed life 
into the movie for me and put her own stamp -- that forthright, chin-up 
approach to the world -- on the part. 
</P>
<P>
 DEBRA WINGER ("Shadowlands")  
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: Winger, herself, is down to earth and unguarded, so there was good 
marriage between actor and character. My only criticism is that she should have 
played it more polished instead of with a brashness and an offensiveness that 
turned people off. Not everyone from the Bronx talks that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Winger faced the considerable challenge of juxtaposing the "bull in a 
china shop" syndrome -- not caring what people think -- with someone insecure 
in her value as a poet and a woman. She brought it off beautifully without a 
trace of sentiment . . . which helped. People don't know what to make of 
Winger, but she knows what she's about. Best Actor  
</P>
<P>
 DANIEL DAY-LEWIS ("In the Name of the Father")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: Played by an inexperienced actor, this character could have been just 
one thing: an angry guy. But Day-Lewis draws from a caldron of emotions and is 
so fluid you never know what he'll do from moment to moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: If a character is a canvas, some actors stay in the corner, some go 
over the top and fall off, while others, such as Day-Lewis, paint the entire 
canvas. Still, I've never seen him cut loose like this. He had to go from a 
naive, petty thief to a decked-out hippie to a terrified victim to a passionate 
resistance fighter so, in effect, was playing four different roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Day-Lewis wasn't afraid to be cruel in those scenes in prison with his 
father. He, like Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken, isn't one of those 
actors who need to be loved. If you don't like his edge, he suggests, it's your 
problem, not his. 
</P>
<P>
 LAURENCE FISHBURNE ("What's Love Got to Do With It")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: The easy trap would have been to play Ike Turner like a villain and to 
distance himself from Ike's essence. Most actors don't want to acknowledge that 
part of themselves. But Fishburne shows us the motor for the behavior. He 
creates a man unable to cope with success -- his or Tina's. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: This is a breakthrough vehicle for Fishburne, the most that has been 
demanded from him as a leading man. Little by little, he keeps exposing more: 
the violence, the cunning, the need to control. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: This movie came out early in the summer, but Fishburne's performance is 
so indelible you can't forget it. He played Ike like a great casting agent, 
someone who saw Tina as his ticket to success and never tried to pastel or 
dilute his vicious behavior. Like De Niro in "Raging Bull," he tapped into the 
terror of being unconscious of oneself -- and this performance was every bit 
the equal of that one. 
</P>
<P>
 TOM HANKS ("Philadelphia")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: This isn't the tour de force Hanks is capable of, because the script 
doesn't permit it. Denzel Washington, more than Hanks, is given a character 
with the kind of growth necessary for an audience to stand up and cheer. Still, 
Hanks did a wonderful job with what he was given. He creates an immediate 
likability and empathy and evidences a real vulnerability without falling into 
the trap of playing stereotypically "gay." 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: As an actor and as a character, Hanks projects the sense that he's on 
the side of right. He's one of those rare human beings who have all 52 cards in 
his deck, and in this case he pulls all of them out. He broke new ground with 
this role. That scene in which he danced to a Maria Callas aria was painful, 
glorious and brave. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: I loved Hanks' wryness and humor, but the strongest part of his 
performance was his use of physicality. He used himself in a gentle and loving 
way, conveying a delicacy and sweetness that had nothing to do with cliches.  
</P>
<P>
 ANTHONY HOPKINS ("The Remains of the Day")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: This isn't a flashy role. An inexperienced actor would have just seen 
its limitations, but Hopkins plays the character more as a man longing to 
express himself rather than someone unable to feel. Many actors just want to 
play the hero, but he picks the scabs and lets the pus run out. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: Hopkins was better in "Shadowlands." In this film, he plays a 
gentleman's gentleman, someone who doesn't permit himself the luxury of 
emotion, and to me, that reserve and stoicism was a little frustrating and 
overbearing. Though Hopkins is an exquisite actor, someone who realizes the 
value of doing less, I felt the part controlled him. 
</P>
<P>
 LIAM NEESON ("Schindler's List")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: It's easier to play black and white, but Neeson paints Schindler in 
shades of gray, an Everyman with all his faults who rises to the occasion. We 
see the building blocks -- the emotional changes -- as the atrocities occur so 
that last scene, in which he addresses his workers, doesn't come from nowhere. 
Neeson's physical stature works to his advantage, but it's his comfort in his 
own body that gives him the necessary power and bearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: Neeson played Schindler like a super-salesman adept at taking 
advantage of any situation. Though by far his most stylized part to date, it 
was also very subtle. You never sensed any arrogance or the fact that he saw 
himself as a savior. If a role is like an onion, Neeson did a magnificent job 
of peeling off the layers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: The strength of Neeson's body was a metaphor for his inner force. You 
had the feeling he could protect the Jews just by his mass. With subject matter 
that devastating, you need a charismatic character to be your guide. Supporting 
Actress  
</P>
<P>
 HOLLY HUNTER ("The Firm")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: Just as Emma Thompson is so good at making ordinary characters 
extraordinary, Hunter excels at making outrageous characters believable. 
Despite her sassiness and strength, this is not a super-woman doing 
extraordinary things but someone who, like any of us would be, is scared to 
death taking those risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: No one can play Southern and gutsy, a little coarse, like Hunter can. 
Hunter is great at comedy, which is the hardest thing to do. It's all about 
timing . . . and some people are tone-deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Hunter was excellent at bringing a slovenly, low-rent sexuality to the 
part, but this role was a good one, not a great one. The fact that she was 
nominated when Gene Hackman, who stole the movie, wasn't, testifies to how few 
good parts there are for women. 
</P>
<P>
 ANNA PAQUIN ("The Piano")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: It's refreshing to see a child actress without a case of "The Cutes." 
Paquin truly has an old soul. She was also sensitively directed. Instead of 
playing on our natural sympathy for children, we're allowed to hate her, at 
times. This is as complete a performance as that given by any of the adults in 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: Paquin was the light in this very dark film. Though she had to be her 
mother's voice, the conduit of communication, she never came across bratty. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: A devilish performance in which Paquin had to walk a tightrope -- 
playing a mother to her mother and, at the same time, utterly lost. It was an 
extraordinary performance, almost scary. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSIE PEREZ ("Fearless")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: Perez is an actress with wonderful emotional facility but hampered by 
her voice production. Emotions have to flow from ease, and her jaw is always 
tense. She's obviously got the goods, but it's grating to listen to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Perez brought to the role a wonderful, sad bewilderment I haven't seen 
in her before. Instead of the tough-talking, got-it-all-together, sexy, 
impenetrable ladies she usually plays, we're given a woman up for grabs with no 
definition or walls, a woman whose life has been busted open and who doesn't 
know if it will come back together again. 
</P>
<P>
 WINONA RYDER ("The Age of Innocence")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: With the exception of Michelle Pfeiffer, I don't think any of the actors 
in this movie had real blood flowing through their veins. (Director Martin) 
Scorsese played externals -- dishes and scenery -- at the expense of 
relationships and human behavior. Who wants to watch frosting on a cake? 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: I regarded this character as a piece of porcelain -- beautiful, 
pristine and a little removed. Not until the end of the film did I see a 
full-blown woman emerge. It's hard to know whether the problem lies with the 
direction, the script or her interpretation of the part. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Ryder plays this part like an iron butterfly -- wily, manipulative, 
steel-willed. She has a gentle, soft-voiced femininity with a certain meanness 
underneath. I haven't seen her this brilliant in anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 EMMA THOMPSON ("In the Name of the Father")  
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: This was a very passionate role, and Thompson filled it. She manages 
to convey a sense of self without ego or arrogance. This is no "best 
supporting" role, though. If an unknown was cast, I'm sure she would never have 
been nominated. Still, it took courage for Thompson to play this part, which 
caused her real problems in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: This is a limited role, but Thompson's intensity of commitment, her 
railing and outrage made it a pivotal one. Her passion -- almost to the point 
of hysteria -- in that last scene helped the film reach a climax. Supporting 
Actor  
</P>
<P>
 LEONARDO DiCAPRIO ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape?")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: The role of a mentally challenged young man poses a minefield of 
problems for an actor. If you don't research it adequately, you could base it 
on your idea of the character instead of on truthful behavior and end up dead 
in the water. DiCaprio threw himself into the role headfirst without 
self-consciousness or going over the top. He's the lifeblood of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: I worked with handicapped children, and after seeing the film, it was 
hard for me to believe that DiCaprio wasn't retarded. Many actors would have 
fallen into the trap of playing the externals, but DiCaprio is a real student 
of human behavior. He showed the playfulness, the impatience, that typifies a 
person with problems like these. 
</P>
<P>
 RALPH FIENNES ("Schindler's List")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: What I love about Fiennes' performance is that he creates a "body 
center" in his stomach. He makes his body a fortress through which he hides and 
protects himself. He's both sexual and repulsive at the same time. Though his 
character commits heinous acts, he shows us his insecurity. You hate him, but 
you understand him, which makes his behavior all the more frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: This was a very clean, precise performance. Fiennes let nothing get 
in his way. Many actors tend to put too much icing on the cake, but he didn't 
do anything not demanded of him. He played a man who was both tortured and a 
torturer, which is very hard to convey. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Fiennes played the character like an adolescent butcher -- wild, 
demented, sensual, desperate, lost, childlike and very charismatic. He was 
oddly touching, which made him more terrifying.  
</P>
<P>
 TOMMY LEE JONES ("The Fugitive")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: Jones did a great job of humanizing a quintessential hard-ass. We see 
someone who, like Harrison Ford's character, is strong-willed, ethical, good at 
what he does -- and capable of growth. And because Jones "owns" every aspect of 
himself to an unusual degree -- there are never any apologies -- he always 
commands our attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: One of the things that made Jones' performance extraordinary was his 
relationship to the men with whom he worked -- his sense of humor and affection 
when dealing with them. This, we saw, was a real living man instead of a cliche 
-- a blue-collar Everyman with no nuance. Though we hated his actions, we liked 
the man, which helped to keep the stakes high. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN MALKOVICH ("In the Line of Fire")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: A lesser actor would have treated the part as the nemesis or enemy of 
Clint Eastwood's character, but Malkovich's brilliance is that he treats him as 
a colleague or an intimate -- almost his other half. This is no stereotypical 
bad guy, like the ones in James Bond. The line between hero and villain is 
blurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss: Few people play rage and evil as well as Malkovich. He demands that you 
be fascinated by him. While you sense his excitement at outfoxing his 
opponents, you feel the pain behind his twisted ego. Malkovich is integral to 
the success of the film, which is essentially a love story between his 
character and Eastwood's. 
</P>
<P>
 PETE POSTLETHWAITE ("In the Name of the Father")  
</P>
<P>
 Fine: Many actors would have played this character as a spineless victim 
unable to express himself, but Postlethwaite played the "positive" -- a man who 
lives cleanly, plays by the rules and is betrayed by the system that he 
respects. That's the true tragedy. We're given a limited man trying to maintain 
his dignity, someone who may have a different set of priorities than we but not 
someone we're likely to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhanti: A wonderful piece of work portraying someone who's both helpless and 
heroic. Instead of playing the character like a victim who was submissive and 
weak, Postlethwaite conveyed the graciousness in the man. The role requires 
great subtlety but carried the plot.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE CENTER; RED LINE SOUND, RADISSON FURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When guests at the Radisson Wilshire Plaza Hotel lose sleep because of the 
noise from the Metro Red Line construction site beneath their windows, the 
hotel loses business. 
</P>
<P>
 Since subway construction between Normandie and Western avenues began more 
than two years ago, dust, noise, construction platforms, heavy equipment and 
traffic obstructions have interfered with commerce on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel at 3515 Wilshire Blvd. has been particularly hard hit and in January 
presented the Metropolitan Transportation Authority with an $18-million claim 
for damages, including loss of business and business good will, property 
damage, increased maintenance costs, noise-related stress and impaired access 
to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is reviewing the claim, said Steven Chesser, an agency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Many regular guests and larger clients -- including one tour agency that 
booked 6,000 rooms annually -- have said they will not stay at the hotel until 
major construction is completed sometime in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Mooney, the hotel's public affairs director, said the hotel does not 
expect subway construction to be invisible, but "we expect reasonable efforts 
to mitigate the impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's claim states that the MTA has been lax in forcing the project 
contractor, Tutor-Saliba Corp., to abide by contractual obligations to lessen 
the impact of disruptions. Moreover, the agency itself responds to community 
concerns only when pressured by city officials, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's specific complaints include construction begun earlier or finished 
later than within specified work hours, obstructions to the hotel's driveways 
and surrounding sidewalks and the MTA's failure to heed independent 
recommendations for reducing the effects of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials have previously acknowledged noise problems but say they are now 
taking a more aggressive trouble-shooting approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Construction is a messy job," said Dennis Alexander, a contract engineer with 
Parsons-Dillingham, the company hired by the agency to inspect subway 
construction. "It's never going to look pretty but we're going to try to 
address specific problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney said: "Talk is cheap, but if it's not accompanied by action, it could 
be very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 At an MTA meeting organized last month to deal with community concerns, 
officials from the agency were unprepared to answer numerous questions about 
its loan program for impacted businesses. The program is administered by 
East-West Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA scheduled another community meeting for 6 p.m. Monday at the hotel to 
discuss construction claims and the loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Wayne Williams, the Radisson's vice president of operations, said in a 
letter to the MTA after the Feb. 17 meeting, "a concerned community on 
Wilshire" is turning into "an angry community." 
</P>
<P>
 The loan program was started last year. As of March 9, three businesses had 
received loans of $25,000 or $50,000; 13 other loan applications are under 
review, Chesser said. The MTA has also made two separate large loans outside 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney said that the hotel has not applied for a loan through the program 
because applicants must waive the right to sue the MTA. "Our damages won't be 
addressed with a loan," he said. "What can a loan do to bring people back? We 
want compensation for damages." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Nate Holden told Wilshire Boulevard merchants that he has 
urged the MTA to implement a construction mitigation program similar to the 
$27.7-million program planned for the Hollywood Boulevard construction phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood program includes some measures for noise reduction and provides 
for a full-time MTA staff to deal with public complaints as well as a citizens 
committee to monitor mitigation measures. JAKE DOHERTY

 Only hours after the massacre of dozens of Muslim worshipers in a mosque in 
Hebron, Jewish and Arab leaders in Los Angeles met to decry the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, undaunted by the lack of communication between Israel and the Palestinian 
leadership, local representatives are taking their dialogue one step further 
with the establishment of a joint speakers bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was born in December at a joint Jewish-Arab dinner, but it took on 
urgency after the Hebron shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers -- Arabs and Jews -- will appear as a team before audiences at 
churches, synagogues, mosques, schools and community groups, said Monir Deeb, a 
board member of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are arguments, let it be," said Deeb, a Palestinian who works with 
an Israeli partner in a San Fernando Valley general contracting business. "This 
is a dialogue that people should be able to initiate, hopefully toward peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizing groups include the Anti-Discrimination Committee and local chapters 
of the National Assn. of Arab Americans, the American Jewish Congress and 
Americans for Peace Now, a support group for the Israeli peace movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone supports the effort. David Lehrer, regional director of the 
Anti-Defamation League, said that his Jewish-sponsored organization has been 
sued by Deeb's group over allegations of spying by a league operative in San 
Francisco. "Given the statements and actions against the ADL, one must wonder 
about the seriousness of their commitment to dialogue with the Jewish 
community," Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Julian White, regional director of Americans for a Safe Israel, said he 
thought that joint appearances would send a misleading message about the 
position of American Jews. A significant number of Jews, he said, oppose the 
Middle East peace accord, signed in Washington last September, calling for the 
establishment of Palestinian self-rule for a transitional period. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting sponsored by White's group Tuesday, West Bank settlers' spokesman 
Elyakim Ha'etzni told a friendly crowd of about 200 at the Beth Jacob synagogue 
in Beverly Hills that the peace process was "a sinister plan for the 
destruction of Israel by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that 33 Israeli Jews have been killed since Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last September, he urged 
American Jews to "use your influence on the American Administration, on the 
Israeli Embassy and the Israeli consulates. Don't let them get away with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha'etzni's call was the sort of thing that organizers of the speakers bureau 
hope to counteract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's going to be part of our discussion group," said Gerald 
Bubis, the local chairman of Americans for Peace Now. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubis said the goal of the speakers bureau is to help people understand their 
differences on the extent of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories 
and the resolution of Jerusalem, among other issues, and to try to identify 
areas of agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The four sponsoring organizations have scheduled a joint session in April, 
with hopes of completing their training and taking their act on the road by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Other outreach efforts have included expressions of sympathy by almost all the 
Jewish organizations in Los Angeles, said Dr. Maher Hothout, spokesman for the 
Islamic Center of Southern California, Los Angeles' largest mosque, at 4th and 
Vermont streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciated that, although we indicated we need more than that," said 
Hothout. "We need to demand that the causes of the problem should be dealt 
with." Specifically, he said, the presence of armed Jewish settlers in the 
midst of the occupied territories must be addressed. MATHIS CHAZANOV

<P>
 The Mothers of East Los Angeles will again be knocking on doors Saturday 
morning to alert families to free vaccinations and tuberculosis tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In a partnership program with White Memorial Medical Center, the group is in 
the middle of a three-month campaign to immunize as many children as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has gone door to door twice in the last two months in Boyle Heights, 
Lincoln Heights and El Sereno, bringing an average of 40 people per day to the 
hospital for immunizations against childhood illnesses, such as measles, mumps 
and rubella. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is a partnership between the group and the hospital's Building a 
Healthier Community program, which has appointed a task force of local school, 
church, business and neighborhood leaders to improve the health of the 
community, said director Socorro Macias. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to county statistics, 34% of Latinos are immunized," Macias said. 
"We're reaching out to our community to get them where they should be. There's 
no reason we can't have 90% or 100% immunized." 
</P>
<P>
 Groups will canvass neighborhoods again April 9 and 23. The hospital, at 1720 
Brooklyn Ave., will give free immunizations to anyone on those days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mothers of East Los Angeles have taken on the community service project to 
help families who may not know about the service, said Juana Gutierrez, 
president of the Santa Isabel chapter. The group provides transportation to 
families who do not have transportation to White Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many mothers haven't started (their children's immunizations) and they don't 
know how serious it is," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital's task force program identifies the community's most critical 
needs, assesses the available resources and creates programs to meet those 
needs. The immunization program is its first project in what members hope is a 
yearlong series of projects to improve residents' health, Macias said. MARY

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; THE MOVIES COME TO HIM; THE WHITE HOUSE THEATER IS 
STILL THE HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN, AND PRESIDENT CLINTON IS ONE FAN WHO DOESN'T 
HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, Paul Richter is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He watches movies, he publicly critiques them, and he even advertises them by 
wearing goofy hats and T-shirts. This year, he's got a role in one, the 
documentary "The War Room," which is nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton may never edge out that old actor Ronald Reagan as the Movie 
President. But it won't be for lack of trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a moviegoer almost to the point of compulsion -- have been since I was a 
boy," Clinton told a Hollywood audience at a fund-raiser in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's passion for the craft is reflected in the way he has made an 
invitation to the White House movie theater about the most sought-after ticket 
in this Administration's Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 An invitation to jog with the President is, of course, much desired by 
power-seekers who want to linger with No. 1 in the camera's eye. But 90 minutes 
of shared goose bumps in the padded comfort of the 51-seat movie theater -- 
well, that's intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater has become a sort of presidential treehouse, a sanctuary from the 
outside world that he repairs to with the people he finds most relaxing. Many 
nights he drifts in with daughter Chelsea, sometimes with one of her friends in 
tow. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, the core movie-hour guest list is most often the inner circle of 
Arkansas pals, beginning with former Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. Hubbell 
(before Hubbell's resignation last week), top adviser Bruce Lindsey and their 
families. (The Clintons took a break from their Whitewater concerns this week 
to watch "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult.") 
</P>
<P>
 The movie-night scene fits in with the generally pared-down scale of social 
affairs favored by the Clintons, who after 14 months have yet to throw a 
full-dress state dinner at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 On many occasions larger groups have been invited. Then, the staff sets up 
tables outside the room with soft drinks and kitchen-popped popcorn -- 
unbuttered, it is claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, 20 feet by 50 feet and located off the East Wing portico, is 
designed to accommodate a small audience comfortably. The oversized armchairs 
could fit a President with the ample proportions of a William Howard Taft or an 
important visitor the size of, say, the 6-foot-4 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
(a Clinton pal who has not yet shared the experience). The chairs are arranged 
in rows of four to six seats, on tiers that rise toward the rear of the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairs are upholstered in a heavy beige fabric, setting off deep red 
carpeting. Red curtains drape the walls for optimal soundproofing. The decor is 
appropriately dignified but subdued, so as not to compete with the 
movie-watching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of new scrutiny of presidential perks, the White House hasn't 
offered to give up the supply of first-run movies it receives from film 
distributors -- arranged, naturally, by the Motion Picture Assn. of America. 
Past presidential staffs have offered the rationale that it would be a security 
risk -- as well as a traffic obstacle -- for the chief executive to roam 
Washington's boulevards on weekend nights in search of a multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has yet to invite any heads of state. But he has apparently overcome 
his anxieties about the perception that he is star-struck and invited a few 
film industry people. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hanks sat in recently, as did Alan J. Pakula, director of last year's "The 
Pelican Brief." Also there was John Grisham, the Arkansas-born thriller writer, 
who, it turns out, is another unexpected member of the Clinton family tree -- a 
distant cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 While he is watching films in the theater, Clinton can contemplate other 
events of personal significance that occurred there. In the very same room in 
fall, 1992, George Bush prepped to debate Clinton and Ross Perot in practice 
sessions with Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. Since then, the Clinton team has 
used it to practice for speeches and debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's tastes in films are catholic. Just as he is reluctant to give up on 
any group of voters, he seems able to find something nice to say about every 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" was not only his favorite movie of 1993, he declared it the 
best in 10 years. Second place went to "Shadowlands," the tear-tugger starring 
Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton thought "The Piano" was "interesting" and liked "The Fugitive" and 
"The Remains of the Day." He called the AIDS epic "Philadelphia" "good" but 
found star Hanks "brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, he enjoyed "Mrs. Doubtfire" but most of all got a kick out of Robin 
Williams, whom the President considers "a comic genius." And he thought Clint 
Eastwood was "terrific" in "In the Line of Fire," the story of a Secret Service 
agent risking his life on the presidential detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton went with Chelsea and a friend to see "My Father, the Hero," a movie 
about a teen-age girl and her father. Partway through, he decided that this was 
a movie a girl would want to enjoy without parents around, and slipped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently he has not seen "In the Name of the Father." That may be just as 
well, since praise or a pan for that one could be awkward, considering how 
difficult Irish-English relations have been for Clinton this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told a group of children in Houston last month that his all-time 
favorite is "High Noon," followed by "Casablanca." And, yes, he's seen all the 
Elvis movies, though he does not have them in a personal collection, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House movie theater was built by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 
the early 1940s, but every occupant since has made good use of it, with the 
possible exception of Harry S. Truman. John F. Kennedy liked adventure movies, 
especially about the Navy; Richard Nixon's love of "Patton" is well known. 
Lyndon B. Johnson also liked Westerns, although it was his habit to fall asleep 
amid a crowd of aides in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan, of course, liked Westerns and science-fiction movies. The Reagans used 
the theater but spent even more time watching films at Camp David on weekends. 
And George and Barbara Bush also spent many an evening in its comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of Clinton's enthusiasm for the movies were there from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 On Election Day, 1992, Clinton, bone-weary from nonstop travel and partisan 
pummeling, took a mental vacation with a John Wayne Western whose title is lost 
to history. Even as a kid in Hot Springs, Ark., friends remember, Clinton would 
collect the 10 bottle caps needed to get him into the free Saturday matinees 
sponsored by a soft-drink company. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, when the New York City mayoral campaign was under way, Clinton was 
filmed jogging while wearing a cap promoting the film "Rudy." Someone may have 
pointed out the political ramifications of this, at a time when he was 
supporting incumbent Democrat David N. Dinkins over Republican challenger (and 
eventual winner) Rudolph W. Giuliani. The next day, anyway, on a trip to New 
York, Clinton had the sense to wear a "Dave" cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has used movie promotional items to show off the odder side of his 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Secret Service arrested a Florida man and accused him of 
stalking Clinton on his mornings jogs and making threats to kill him. The next 
day, Clinton appeared for his run in a black T-shirt from Eastwood's movie -- 
with the words "In the Line of Fire" above gray cross hairs on the back. 
</P>
<P>

no, they won't be there.)Reuters

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; RUE, BRITANNIA; THE BRITISH LIKE IT WHEN THEIR 
OSCAR NOMINEES WIN. REALLY THEY DO. IT'S JUST THAT FIRST, A BIT OF STRUGGLE IS 
REQUIRED -- AND MODESTY'S MANDATORY 
</P>

<P>
 Everyone loves a winner, right? 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe that, it only goes to show you've never spent any time in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 At no time of year is it clearer that the British despise their winners than 
the weeks leading up to Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
 Around this time, Americans who take an interest in such things are animatedly 
speculating whether Tom Hanks, Tommy Lee Jones, Winona Ryder or whomever they 
like will receive a statuette come Oscar night. Should their favored nominees 
win (and make the right kind of modest noises in their acceptance speeches), 
then Americans, good-hearted, generous-spirited people that they are, will be 
genuinely pleased for them. 
</P>
<P>
 We British approach all this rather differently. We are a nation suffering 
from the "tall poppy" syndrome -- which means we take cruel delight in cutting 
down those individuals who distinguish themselves above others. We just about 
tolerate people who restrict their success to Britain. For those who have the 
temerity to achieve fame and respect abroad we reserve our deepest loathing. 
Especially if they do so in America. More especially still if they do so in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why, since Oscar nominations were announced, the British media have 
been sharpening their knives. Prime targets this year are Daniel Day-Lewis and 
Emma Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-Lewis has already stuck his head above the parapet, having won a surprise 
Oscar for 1989's "My Left Foot." This time the media are ready for him; since 
this year's nomination he has been the subject of newspaper profiles that, in 
the absence of any sexual scandal or substance abuse problems surrounding him, 
simply seek to portray him as an obsessive teetering on the very edge of 
sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 His breakdown during a 1989 stage performance of "Hamlet" was exhumed and 
analyzed for clues to his alleged instability. His preparations for his 
Oscar-nominated role in "In the Name of the Father" were lovingly detailed -- 
how he had himself locked into a prison cell on the film set for three days, 
how he hired men to kick at his cell door, shout abuse at him and douse him 
with buckets of water to interrupt his sleep. This, said one headline, was 
"madly obsessive" behavior. An anonymous source said: "A lot of actors pretend 
to be crazy. But with Daniel you can never be sure it's just an act." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the parlous state of their film industry, one might think the British 
would be wildly cheering an actor like Day-Lewis, whose success at the very 
least brings enormous credit to their acting tradition. Instead, the Brits, 
with a wink and a smirk, prefer to insinuate he's gaga. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson comes off even worse. She is someone who, in academy terms, has 
achieved something even more extraordinary: The year after winning an Oscar for 
"Howards End," she is now nominated for two further performances -- in "The 
Remains of the Day" and "In the Name of the Father." Yet she and her husband, 
Kenneth Branagh, are chronic irritants to the British media because they have 
achieved success at an early age, and because they show every sign of relishing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Branagh committed the unforgivably immodest sin (in British eyes) of writing 
an autobiography before his 30th birthday; when it became clear that Hollywood 
regarded him as a major talent, his fate in his homeland was sealed. (If 
Branagh ever wins an Oscar, a good half-dozen journalists in Britain may 
contemplate suicide.) 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson now recalls that the British press initially approved of her, but 
implied after she married Branagh that she only got work through him. "I 
thought, 'Boy, is that ever mean-spirited,' " she said. "And sexist." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Thompson does not talk to Britain's tabloids. But it was a broadsheet film 
critic, the Sunday Times' Julie Burchill, who recently launched the most 
damning attack on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing "In the Name of the Father," Burchill wrote of Thompson: "Fast 
becoming the most mannered, irritating actress since Meryl Streep, her 
performance is a national scandal. She seems like an amateur actress 
auditioning way out of her depth. Even seen from behind, not speaking, 
completely covered, with a raincoat over her head, running, she has the power 
to irritate and dismay in a way that very few actors do." This was a review (in 
a supposedly respectable paper) of work that won Thompson a best supporting 
actress nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with Day-Lewis and Thompson, I suspect, is that neither has yet 
experienced failure or hardship; their rise to their current preeminence 
appears effortless. The British need them to suffer a personal crisis, 
financial problems or a career downturn before being recast as lovable. 
</P>
<P>
 Both actors might find this too high a price to pay; yet it is precisely why 
Anthony Hopkins is respected, even revered, by the same people who long to see 
Thompson and Day-Lewis stumble. Hopkins had the sense to launch a preemptive 
strike against fate long before his current run of acclaim; he already had 
under his belt a broken marriage, a long bout with alcoholism and a movie 
career one might charitably describe as undistinguished. Now he affects modest 
bemusement at his success -- a very British trick. No wonder they love him. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Britain has a long tradition of denigrating its actors and directors 
who flourish in Hollywood. (If they also decide to live in America, the base 
for most film work, the press accuses them of "turning their backs on 
Britain.") Fifty years ago, some of Laurence Olivier's acting colleagues 
thought it irredeemably vulgar of him to pursue a Hollywood career in tandem 
with his "serious" British stage work. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently Michael Caine and Dudley Moore were castigated for going 
Hollywood. In the mid-'80s, Caine was acclaimed in America as an accomplished 
actor who enhanced every film in which he appeared; the British media portrayed 
him as a marginally talented Cockney riding a lucky break. For a couple of 
years Moore, in "10" and "Arthur," was one of Hollywood's leading up-and-coming 
actors; the British wondered why the Oxford graduate was wasting his talent 
and, worse, living in L.A., frying his brain cells. Here were the two actors 
making money and enjoying themselves. The Brits hated that. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar winner Jeremy Irons (1990's "Reversal of Fortune") gets flak in the 
British press for being aloof and superior. After meeting him, profile writer 
Lynn Barber wrote: "I just wanted to boil him in oil." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's next in line for this treatment? Step forward Ralph Fiennes, best 
supporting actor nominee this year for "Schindler's List." He seems a good bet 
for no other reason than the fact he has come a long way quickly; once the 
Fleet Street rat pack get wind of how much Fiennes can command for a film, the 
knives will surely be out for him too. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite our penchant for devouring our actors, we paradoxically love it when, 
like this year, they are well represented in the Oscar nominations. We note 
proudly that in the last five years, nine of 25 best actor nominees have been 
British. We strut around and tell ourselves, yes, we may have a tiny, 
underfinanced film industry, but by God, we can storm Hollywood and teach those 
wealthy, big-mouthed glamorous Yanks a thing or two about movies. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact we're so keen to see a hefty British contingent on Oscar night that we 
temporarily co-opt Irish actors and directors to add to the total. Given the 
way the British have treated the Irish over the centuries, they might 
reasonably take a dim view of this, but the British media ignore such 
considerations: Day-Lewis thinks of himself as Irish, but he was born in 
London, so he's British, right? Liam Neeson's from Northern Ireland, so that 
makes him British. Jim Sheridan? Irish through and through, but -- well, let's 
not complicate things, OK? 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Fricker, who won an Oscar for best supporting actress in Sheridan's "My 
Left Foot," once summed up this tendency of the British press memorably: "Win 
an Oscar and you're a British actress. When they find you face down and drunk 
in a gutter, you're Irish." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strange phenomenon, then, this British craving for Oscar success 
combined with hostility to the individuals who achieve it. Presumably if it 
could somehow become a team sport we would be happier. But even that would not 
change the schizophrenic attitude the British hold toward Hollywood -- an 
uncomfortable blend of wide-eyed fascination and snobbish class-ridden disdain. 
We secretly want our actors to bring home armloads of Academy Awards, but we 
also want to sneer at them for trying in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 For the British, the best of all wins on Monday would be supporting actor 
nominee Pete Postlethwaite of "In the Name of the Father." He has it all; he's 
the perfect "little guy," the quintessential underdog, a plain man with an 
unglamorous name and a career unsullied by fame or riches. But if Postlethwaite 
does win an Oscar to take home to Britain, he should know his problems are just 
beginning.

 Don't be alarmed if three smiling strangers bearing note pads come knocking on 
your door. Chances are, they are Karina Gutierrez, Maria Vera and Dece 
Leonares, a team of "family outreach workers" who recently began canvassing 
Echo Park, Elysian Valley and Silver Lake to talk to parents and youths as part 
of the Hope in Youth gang-prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as the largest anti-gang program in the country because of the nearly 
$8 million in city, county, state and private money backing it, Hope in Youth 
was created in 1992 by a coalition of churches. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 70 community workers have been hired at $30,000 a year to work 
in teams of three all over the county, including South-Central, East Los 
Angeles, Westlake and the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys. Program backers 
hope to hire 75 to 80 more workers in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Program officials said the workers talk to parents and youths to determine 
their concerns and then connect them with other residents to come up with 
community solutions to violence and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for people with talent, a track record of accomplishment and 
people who know their communities," Rosalinda Lugo, Hope in Youth's associate 
director, said of the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, organizers said, outreach teams have talked to more than 9,000 
parents and youths. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been criticisms and questions about the program's reliance on 
community workers who lack expertise in gang and social issues. But that may 
actually be the program's strength, others say, since it will be up to the 
community at large, not the workers, to find solutions. Officials say the 
workers will serve as organizers, not social workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workers are out there listening and trying to find out not only the 
problems, but what resources there are," said Episcopal Bishop Frederick 
Borsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Father David O'Connell of St. Frances X Cabrini Catholic Church in 
South-Central: "It's definitely a different, new way of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 The workers underwent an initial 24 hours of communications training, 
including how to meet and talk to residents, Lugo said. And, she said, after 
their first 90 days of listening and assessing community needs, the workers 
will receive additional training in community organizing to enable them to 
assist residents in setting up parenting classes, youth programs and other ways 
of helping themselves. Training is provided by representatives of Industrial 
Areas Foundation, a community outreach network that is a member of the 
coalition backing Hope in Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of their colleagues, Gutierrez, Vera and Leonares are average 
residents -- parents, students and youth group leaders -- who applied for the 
full-time, community outreach jobs through their churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez will focus on meeting youth, Vera will target parents and Leonares 
will meet with school officials. Gutierrez and Vera speak Spanish as well as 
English, while Leonares can speak Tagalog. The three began working about a 
month ago and have been visiting schools and churches, attending community 
organization meetings and going door to door. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere they go, they jot down notes and names of residents, public 
officials and programs in the area -- valuable future contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vera: "This is the first step: communication." IRIS YOKOI

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; ROBERT WISE, THE JURY; A FILMMAKER AND PAST 
ACADEMY PRESIDENT WHO'S REALLY ENTITLED TO SAY 'IT'S NO "CITIZEN KANE" ' 
ASSESSES THE BEST PICTURE CROP -- PLUS HIS FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, Terry Pristin is a Times staff writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Who could be better qualified to assess the Oscar contenders for best picture 
than a director and producer whose career has spanned most of the modern era of 
filmmaking? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Wise picked up his first Oscar nomination more than a half-century ago, 
when his editing of the 1941 "Citizen Kane" was recognized by the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise, who entered the movie business in 1933 as an assistant editor at RKO, 
directed his first film, "The Curse of the Cat People," in 1944, and his 39th, 
"Rooftops," in 1989. His films, including "West Side Story" (1961) and "The 
Sound of Music" (1965), have won a total of 19 Oscars and 67 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when many directors find themselves typecast -- a predicament Steven 
Spielberg was in until "Schindler's List" -- Wise can boast a tremendous number 
of genres to his credit. Among his other movies are "The Set-Up" (1949), 
considered one of the best boxing films ever made; "The Day the Earth Stood 
Still" (1951); "Somebody Up There Likes Me" (1956); "I Want to Live" (1958); 
"The Haunting" (1963); "The Sand Pebbles" (1966) and "The Andromeda Strain" 
(1971). 
</P>
<P>
 Still active at 79, Wise hopes to make another film in Europe this summer. 
Pleading superstition, he declines to offer any details. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview at his Beverly Hills office, Wise, who served as president 
of the academy from August 1985 until August 1988, said he is "generally happy" 
with the current state of filmmaking and cheered by the success of a number of 
films aimed at adult audiences. He is also gratified by the way the academy has 
selected its best picture nominees. "We don't vote on what's the biggest 
picture budgetwise, or what is the biggest grosser," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Starting in alphabetical order, what was your reaction to "The 
Fugitive"? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I thought it was very well done, an excellent film. I was not aware of 
the director (Andrew Davis, who made 1992's "Under Siege"). I'm not a big 
action-picture guy. But that train wreck in the beginning was an extraordinary 
piece of filmmaking, and he kept up the cinematic style and the marvelous 
photography and the tension and the energy in it wonderfully well.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Yet Davis was not nominated for best director. Doesn't it seem odd when the 
film is nominated but the director is overlooked? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's very rare when that happens. I had a similar thing years ago with "The 
Sand Pebbles," a film I did with Steve McQueen. I was nominated as producer for 
best picture, but I was not nominated for director. You're dealing with two 
different bodies. You've got the directors' branch (which chooses the nominees 
for best director), and then you have the whole academy voting on best picture 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should we infer from Robert Altman's nomination for best director that if 
the directors had made the best picture nominations, "Short Cuts" would have 
been included? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, most directors would tie them together (best picture and best 
director). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the fact that "The Fugitive" was based on a TV series diminish its 
value? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I went in expecting not to like it too much because I sort of regretted 
that we were at such a point where we had to go back and resurrect material 
from another medium in order to make our films. But I guess if it's good 
material and it's excellently treated then it'll stand on its own. So much to 
my surprise, I found myself quite caught up and carried along with the film. 
There's more of those being done now, aren't there (including "Maverick," which 
Warner Bros. plans to release May 20). I guess I'm prejudiced; we should come 
up with new material. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about "In the Name of the Father," which opened in limited release 
late in the year and was perhaps not as well known to academy members? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm so pleased that it did take off because it came into the game very, 
very late. I thought it was beautifully done, beautifully acted. The shadings 
of it were just excellent, the ups and downs, the turns and twists. I think 
particularly the handling of the lead character (played by Daniel Day-Lewis, 
nominated as best actor). He's had such contrasts all throughout his career, 
from "My Beautiful Laundrette" all the way to "A Room With a View" -- I think 
they were almost back to back (in 1985), and you couldn't recognize him from 
one to the other. "The Age of Innocence" couldn't be more of a contrast to what 
he was playing in this. That certainly shows the tremendous range of his 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some people thought Day-Lewis might get nominated for "The Age of 
Innocence," but he didn't. Is it possible to compare the two performances? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I thought his performance in "The Age of Innocence" was much more subdued. 
I didn't feel -- and this is something that is certainly not an actor's fault 
-- but I didn't feel the chemistry between Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer as 
strongly as some of the scenes would seem to call for. There are personal 
chemistries that happen between actors and actresses. Usually people who do 
those roles don't test (for them). Maybe they meet beforehand and they talk to 
one another, but you never really know what the chemistry between actors, 
especially a man and woman, is going to be until you've got them up on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: People admired "The Age of Innocence," but somehow did not feel passionate 
about it. Is that one of the reasons it didn't get nominated? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It could have been. Marty (director Martin Scorsese) did a fine job in 
re-creating the period. I think (the absence of chemistry between the stars) 
might have resulted in a less warm reception by the academy. I've also heard 
that people thought it was a little too studied, with too much emphasis on the 
detail of the period and the lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Getting back to "In the Name of the Father," were you surprised that Emma 
Thompson got a supporting actress nomination? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was surprised. She's a fine actress and I think she handled the role 
well, but it was a very small and not overly colorful role.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the fact that Thompson and Holly Hunter both got nominated in two 
different categories say something about the paucity of top actresses? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (People in the industry) keep talking about getting roles in which a woman 
can carry a picture, but they don't seem to be coming along. I remember years 
and years back when Box Office magazine used to list every year the 10 leading 
box-office stars in the world, and they were usually all American, and it was 
not uncommon to have six men and four women as the top box-office draws. That 
whole ability for a woman to carry a picture is gone -- because of such an 
emphasis over the years on these action pictures.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of strong women's roles, let's move on to "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 A: I loved Jane Campion's idea and her script. The period it was set in, and 
the characters, and the interplay and the plot. I thought it was so refreshing 
and new and different. I applaud her very much for that, as well as for her 
direction of the film, which I thought was just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was at a dinner party the other night, and there were a couple of women 
-- people in the business -- who didn't like the picture at all. They thought 
it was so phony. I was so shocked and so surprised. My wife and I had been so 
caught up in it. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had any questions, I guess I might have questioned why Sam Neill would 
get himself into this kind of relationship, knowing that she was mute. 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl (Oscar nominee Anna Paquin, who plays Holly Hunter's daughter) 
was absolutely a knockout. Harvey Keitel was just excellent, too -- such a 
change of pace for him. And to turn out to be that sympathetic in the end. When 
he first came on, I thought, "How's this going to work?"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But Keitel was not nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 A: He had an awful lot of competition. It's always difficult when you get down 
to making those nominations. I was just looking back over the list I made 
(before the nominations), and for best picture I had 11 films. Most of us make 
a list of maybe the top 10 or 12 or 15. Then it's the winnowing down of that to 
five -- it's tough. You try to replay them in your mind. I think any five of 
those 11 I had there I would have been satisfied with. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Of the five nominated pictures, "The Piano" is the only one with an erotic 
love scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't recall any movie being nominated that had that degree of nudity 
that we had in "The Piano," which I think is a step forward, too, in terms of 
the assessment by the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "The Remains of the Day" is of course the only other best picture nominee 
containing a love story of sorts. What did you think of that picture? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Once again a very unusual story -- maybe not quite the originality of "The 
Piano" -- and the sexiest film I've seen, in a way, without having any sex in 
it. And that scene with the book (when the housekeeper played by Emma Thompson 
and the butler portrayed by Anthony Hopkins gently wrestle over a romance novel 
he is reading but refrain from actually making physical contact) -- that's a 
very, very sexy scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I'm such a fan of Tony's (whom Wise directed in the 1977 "Audrey 
Rose"). He has such a range. I thought the chemistry (in both this picture and 
last year's Oscar-nominated "Howards End") was marvelous between Tony and Emma 
Thompson. They really mesh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And -- last, but of course not least -- "Schindler's List"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was so pleased for Steven that it came off so well. So many people have 
been wondering if he could make anything besides those wonderfully done 
entertainment pieces and take a serious subject matter and do a top job. I 
thought he did an outstanding job. The way he chose to shoot it, in black and 
white, to make it feel much more realistic and almost like shooting a newsreel 
-- he kept a sense of textured reality almost with a grain on it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Steven had done it in color he certainly would have chosen a very, very 
subdued color. We don't see the real world in as strong colors as we see on 
film. Sometimes in my films, I have to try to desaturate the color a little 
bit, to take a little of the Technicolor look out of it -- because that is not 
real life, either. I think the locations were outstanding, the care and 
attention taken with the sets and locations and the customs of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people objected to the color at the end, but it seemed right to me. If 
he'd been actually shooting during the period (of the Holocaust) he'd have been 
shooting in black and white. What he was saying (with the use of color to show 
the surviving Schindler Jews) was this is the modern day. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven and his associates made very fine choices in the actors for all the 
roles. I kept being impressed constantly by the look of the people in the 
crowds. They were obviously very carefully selected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the film's length? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The length didn't bother me. I was caught up in it from the beginning, and 
it held me all the way through. Pace is really interesting. If you can hook an 
audience in at the beginning and keep that hook in, you can go for a long, long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Short Cuts" was obviously a favorite of the directors' branch. Why do you 
think it did not get a best picture nomination? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I thought it was a damn fine picture and very unusual. But it's a long 
film, once again, and kind of a downer. That might have worked against it. (The 
absence of characters you could identify with) might have militated against it. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I assume "Short Cuts" made your list of the 11 top films of the year. What 
else was on that list? 
</P>
<P>
 A: "In the Line of Fire" -- I thought it was right up there with "The 
Fugitive." I would be hard put to make a choice between the two of them. 
Another film I liked -- that a lot of people haven't felt that strongly about 
-- was "Philadelphia." It's the first major movie to deal head-on with AIDS, 
and I had no objection to the script and the development of the story and the 
characters. Also, "Much Ado About Nothing," "Shadowlands" and "The Age of 
Innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would you care to divulge how you voted? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No way. That's a criminal offense around the academy.

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; HOW GENERATION X'ERS WOULD DO THEIR OWN OSCAR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 F or Kalle Matso and Scott White, film critics for the Beach Reporter in 
Manhattan Beach and cool observers of twentysomething culture, the Oscars 
represent at once great theater and an agonizing waste of precious TV air time. 
The Times asked them to deconstruct the telecast -- awards, dance numbers, 
presenters, acceptance speeches -- with a decided eye toward how to capture the 
attention of the younger generation of movie fans.  
</P>
<P>
 Kalle Matso: You know, people often criticize the Oscars, calling it a long 
and tawdry event that does little justice to the art of cinema, and the fact is 
they bring up some good points. But even if this is true, there is no better 
alternative to the Academy Awards. Over the years it has remained the best 
thing going for people who love movies and the people who make them. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott White: I disagree. The idea -- celebrating the best films of the year -- 
is great. But, during that vacuous period between envelope openings, I have to 
employ all my self-discipline not to channel surf over to "Cops." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Are you saying that the only reason you watch is to find out who the 
winners are? 
</P>
<P>
 White: That and to find out who's going to wear which color ribbon for which 
cause. I'm dying to see what hue will be worn by those who want to do away with 
the Electoral College. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: You might as well just watch the recap on Headline News. You're missing 
the whole point of the Oscars -- the pageantry, the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 White: The cheesy dance numbers, the bad cue-card jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I don't think the musical interludes are cheesy. I just think the 
managers make some ill-advised choices sometimes, and I'm sure they learn from 
their mistakes. I'm almost positive that Rob Lowe will no longer be considered 
for any songs that require great vocal range. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I have to admit that I'm looking forward to seeing Bruce Springsteen 
perform his song "Streets of Philadelphia." Still, based on the decisions that 
have been made in the past, I wouldn't be surprised if he was backed up by the 
Brotherly Love Dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: What would you change besides the music? You can't cut the 
retrospective film montages. That's consistently one of the best parts of the 
show -- providing, of course, that they continue to postpone "The Year of the 
Brat Pack." 
</P>
<P>
 White: But seeing that this year's motif is "The Men and Women Behind the 
Camera," I'm afraid what we're going to get is a montage of different 
production assistants being yelled at. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Some of it might be uninteresting, but I think it's about time that 
gaffers and best boys got their due. I also like the idea that we mindless 
filmgoers are going to learn something about movies that's more significant 
than how hot Geena Davis looks in evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I'm not saying those behind the lens shouldn't be lauded. I just don't 
think most movie fans camp out in front of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to 
catch a quick glimpse of "The Piano's" cinematographer. If I had just two 
wishes, I'd have all of these technical awards given out at a totally separate 
ceremony. And then, of course, I'd wish for a lot more wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: But then the whole show would be over in about an hour. Most of the 
cars wouldn't even be parked by then. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Worse things could happen. And if they really do want to stretch it out 
for a couple of hours, they can just add a few more eye-catching categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Like what? Best performance in a nude scene? 
</P>
<P>
 White: Sure. They could even introduce some new specialized endowments, like 
the Michael Caine Award for the actor who appears in the most movies in a 
single year, or the Bobby De Niro Award for the person who, in preparing for a 
role, achieves the greatest weight fluctuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: But flashier categories would turn a time-honored tradition into the 
MTV Awards. The Oscars are supposed to have a little bit of class. It's not 
like these are the People's Choice Awards, where you have to be familiar to all 
readers of US magazine. We're talking about the Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
and Sciences here. 
</P>
<P>
 White: That's another thing. Who is in the academy anyway? Once in, are they 
in for life? I get the feeling they're like the Politburo -- no ousted members 
until the next cultural revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I think they must be the same people who leak to the press whose "year" 
it is. Have you noticed this? Every year, a couple of weeks before the Academy 
Awards, the media decide that certain people have had the best years. Tom Hanks 
is supposedly the favorite to win the Oscar for best actor because it's "his 
year." Why is it his year, besides the fact that he had a nice speech at the 
Golden Globes? Why isn't it Pete Postlethwaite's year? 
</P>
<P>
 White: I have no idea. I also have no idea why this is billed as a classy, 
artistic event when you have all of the major studios spending tons of money 
lobbying for their films. With all the politics that go into the distribution 
of these trophies, I'm surprised that James Carville hasn't been hired as a 
consultant by Miramax. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Now you're really nit-picking, and you still haven't mentioned the 
emcee, the aspect of the show that I think is the best candidate for some 
editing.  
</P>
<P>
 White: You're not looking forward to Whoopi Goldberg? At least we're not going 
to have to put up with Jack (Crude Is Often Funny) Palance. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I just don't think that the Academy Awards should be a second-rate 
version of the "Tonight Show." The most prestigious gathering of cinematic 
talent is definitely not the right place for John Bobbitt jokes. I say cut the 
monologue shtick down a bit and get right into the best part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Which is? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: The human element. I really look forward to hearing what the winners 
will say. That's half the reason I tune in. I say half, because I usually lose 
interest when the six makeup artists line up to thank their kin. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I'm not so hot on the speeches. With few exceptions, I find them 
unoriginal and often laced with political platitudes. You never know when some 
actor will hold up his Oscar and tell the audience that, simply by thinking 
happy thoughts, we can reunify the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Well, if someone wins an Oscar, they've earned the right to a captive 
audience. But the presenters, who haven't been honored for anything, display an 
amazing lack of tact when they revise the script to suit their socioeconomic 
platforms. Pretty soon, the celebrity introductions will include political 
leanings as well as movie credits. "She's the liberal from 'Thelma & Louise.' 
He made millions of dollars in 'The Player' and has a soft spot for Haitians." 
</P>
<P>
 White: I agree. Preachy presenters should face some kind of punitive measures. 
They ought to pay a fine or have to stay after and help clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: On the other hand, it's the idiosyncrasies of the celebrities that keep 
many people glued to the tube. You never know when Kim Basinger is going to 
embarrass herself by telling the entire world what film she thinks should win 
for best picture. People debated for weeks whether Sally Field's exclamation 
"You like me. You really like me!" was touching or tacky. I myself was really 
moved by the simple and sincere way that Gene Hackman accepted his award for 
best supporting actor -- saying it was a great experience to make "Unforgiven" 
and dedicating his award to the memory of his uncle -- last year. These are the 
kind of moments that make it surprisingly pleasurable to spend three hours 
watching extremely affluent people collect more stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 White: With the exception of the Gene Hackman anecdote, those are the moments 
that rekindle my love of the written word. The best thing about the Oscars 
isn't the people; it's being able to re-experience some of the best moments of 
film from that particular year. I wish they'd show longer scenes from each 
movie, especially when reviewing the best picture nominees. It kills me that 
they edit the clips so that the Price Waterhouse guys have more time to explain 
the intricacies of vote tabulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I think my original point is still valid. Yes, the Academy Awards show 
is flawed, but it's the most respected celebration of something we both love: 
movies. Criticize it all you want, I know what you'll be doing on Monday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 White: So do I. I'll be watching "Evening Shade" and the TV movie of the week, 
while my VCR records the Academy Awards. Nothing will give me more pleasure 
than fast-forwarding past the drawn-out dance numbers and forced puns to the 40 
minutes that matter. As long as you don't crank-call me and tell me the winners 
ahead of time, it should be a great night at the Oscars.

CALENDAR'S BIG OSCARS ISSUE; 'SO, DID IT CHANGE YOUR LIFE?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Interviewed by SUSAN KING

<TEXT>

 Winning an acting Oscar is supposed to be a ticket to better roles in bigger 
movies for more money. But does it always work that way? We asked the age-old 
question of some past Oscar winners, and here, with some vintage photos from 
the Academy's archives is what we found out. * 
</P>
<P>
 Celeste Holm, the 1947 best supporting actress for "Gentleman's Agreement" 
(with ABC commentator Frances Scully): 
</P>
<P>
 I did not know when I signed with (20th Century Fox studio head) Darryl Zanuck 
that he hired me to be a threat to Betty Grable. Had I known this I would have 
said, "Forget it." He had heard I was sexy and had been a great success on 
Broadway in "Oklahoma!" He had never seen it. And then I did two dreadful 
musicals. Then Moss Hart rescued me from oblivion by asking me to do 
"Gentleman's Agreement." Mr. Zanuck said, "She can't do that, there is no 
comedy in it." Moss Hart said, "I have known her for several years; she started 
in Shakespeare." So they made me do the big emotional scene at the end as a 
screen test. It went just fine. Mr. Zanuck didn't want me to wear the dress I 
wanted to wear; he wanted me to wear something I didn't like. I had a feeling I 
was always bucking the management. Then I went and embarrassed them all by 
winning an Academy Award. I don't think the Academy Award made as much 
difference in my life as it should have.Zanuck was always afraid I was going to 
come in and ask for more money and raise hell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Gossett Jr., the 1982 best supporting actor for "An Officer and a 
Gentleman": 
</P>
<P>
 In a way it did. What I expected was, of course, to be Wesley Snipes. But 
Hollywood wasn't prepared for that. I got a lot of work on television; I got no 
work in movies. None. Thank God for television. Only now am I getting some kind 
of justice because I am in partnership with (the production company) Viacom. 
The glory I got was from my friends and peers who voted for me -- that changed 
my life considerably. But as far as the industry was concerned, I did not get 
any work. I became quite bitter about it and almost destroyed myself. In the 
meantime, my life has been pretty good. I have two sons, and everything else is 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Jones, the 1960 best supporting actress for "Elmer Gantry" (with Hugh 
Griffith): 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to that I had done the big musicals, which were great and wonderful. 
Then they stopped making musicals and my career in films was virtually over 
because I was so tied into being the musical heroine. (Hollywood) figured if 
you could sing you can't act. Then I went into television. That was when all 
the big live dramatic TV shows were happening. Burt Lancaster saw me do "The 
Big Slide" with Red Skelton on "Playhouse 90." I then got the role (in "Elmer 
Gantry"), and as it turned out, it was a wonderful turning point in my career, 
because after that, I went on to do a string of motion pictures where I didn't 
have to sing. A lot of people say (the Oscar) is a jinx. It never was for me. I 
mean, I never went on to do great big things in movies after that -- but at 
least it wasn't the end of my career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton Heston, the 1959 best actor for "Ben-Hur" (with wife Lydia at the 
Governors' Ball) 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't change my life. I had been a public person for some time, and that 
does change your life. I suppose winning an Academy Award does put you in a 
slightly different category. The best thing I can say is that it put me in a 
small club. Everyone who has won an award understands that it doesn't mean you 
gave the best performance or wrote the best screenplay or directed the best 
film. This is why it remains the most important award to filmmakers -- it 
represents the judgment of your peers. The most significant judgment is made in 
the nominations, not in the award. To be nominated as an actor for an Academy 
Award means that other actors thought you deserved it. I have given better 
performances than I did in "Ben-Hur," but some of those performances were not 
widely seen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Johnson, the 1971 best supporting actor for "The Last Picture Show" (with 
Richard Harrison and Sally Kellerman): 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like when you win one of those Oscars, everybody thinks you know 
something or you are a great pillar in the community or something. It does 
change a lot of people; they get to believing their publicity. I don't think I 
am that great, so I just stayed the way I was. I have always been able to work 
when I wanted to. . . . I was in Mexico doing a picture ("The Train Robbers") 
with Ann-Margret and John Wayne. They called me and said, "You better get up 
here." There had never been a cowboy win one of those things, you know, so I 
didn't prepare anything to say. But I did come to the Oscars, and I won. About 
the only thing I could say was "It couldn't happen to a nicer fella." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Winters, the 1959 best supporting actress for "The Diary of Anne 
Frank" and the 1965 best supporting actress for "A Patch of Blue" (with Edmond 
O'Brien): 
</P>
<P>
 You know what it is good for now? Putting your pension checks in back of. 
That's a joke. A bad joke. I made a great deal of money that I wouldn't have 
made. Your salary goes up and it's very important, especially at my age. The 
Screen Actors Guild takes like 20% out of your salary. Thank God. Now I am 
getting it (as a pension). I think something else happens. You begin to get 
prestigious scripts. For a while there, I got very interesting directors and 
very important directors sending me scripts. One of the things that bothers me 
is I was also nominated for "The Poseidon Adventure" and now when people 
discuss me for a role, it is Jewish. I did 50 other films in which I was WASPy. 
I brought my "Anne Frank" Oscar to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. I'm 
always glad I brought it there. All kinds of kids say now, "Oh, Shelley, we saw 
your Oscar at the Anne Frank House," and some of them send me pictures they 
take. The gold started to wear off because kids used to pick it up and make 
speeches. Now they have it in a glass case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Poitier, the 1963 best actor for "Lilies of the Field" (with producer 
Sidney Skolsky): 
</P>
<P>
 So many wonderful things have happened that it would be, I think, unfair to 
just attribute them all to the Oscar. I cannot dissect my life and say this 
element was influenced by the winning of the Oscar. I think that I had had some 
wonderful experiences and terrific roles before the Oscar. But I would say that 
my career certainly grew and was sustained subsequently from the Oscar for some 
years.

COVER STORY; THE LIGHT OF DAY; A SPANISH LITERACY PROGRAMS ARE BRIGHTENING THE 
LIVES OF LATINO IMMIGRANTS, TEACHING THEM TO BE MOE POLITICALLY AWARE AS THEY 
LEARN TO READ AND WRITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AT A KITCHEN TABLE IN HER SMALL WESTLAKE APARTMENT, Natividad Barrera pens the 
day's lesson: "Housing and health are a right," she writes in Spanish, moving 
slowly from one letter to the next, as sunlight filters through a window of the 
run-down flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the sun brightens the dank room, so too has learning to read and write 
illuminated Barrera's life. Until a year ago, the 40-year-old Guatemalan 
immigrant was illiterate in her native Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to write her name or read street signs, Barrera says she lived in 
virtual darkness. But her life changed after she enrolled in one of a handful 
of Spanish literacy programs for Latino immigrants in Central Los Angeles. She 
now reads and writes in Spanish at about the second-grade level and is enrolled 
in English as a Second Language classes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the literacy programs are run by immigrants themselves. 
Many of them were activists in Central America or Mexico who use techniques 
popularized in Latin American literacy campaigns. Stressing themes such as 
gangs, poverty and housing, the classes not only teach students to read and 
write, but also to become politically aware of issues facing their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to get them to realize that certain things are not acceptable," said 
Marcos Cajina, executive director of the Centro Latino de Educacion Popular, a 
Temple-Beaudry nonprofit organization that has been teaching Spanish literacy 
classes since 1991. "Changes do not happen overnight, but students begin to 
question issues and think critically." 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors say the literacy classes are the first step in providing 
immigrants with basic grammar skills needed to eventually read and write in 
English. They say the programs offer a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dismal 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 A major federal study released in September concluded that nearly half of 
American adults are "at risk" of being left behind in the information age 
because they possess the barest reading and mathematics skills. The study's 
authors said one reason for the bleak findings is the large number of Latino 
immigrants who are not proficient in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators criticize the Spanish literacy programs for setting students 
back in their efforts to learn English. Regardless of their age, the critics 
say, students should be immediately immersed in English language classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no rhyme or reason why we can't teach in English," said Gloria Matta 
Tuchman, an outspoken proponent of English-immersion education and president of 
the Tustin Unified school board in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spanish literacy advocates disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't throw adults who have been illiterate for 20 or 30 years into 
a classroom and expect them to learn English," said Raul Anorve, a linguist 
with California Literacy Inc., a statewide nonprofit organization that has 
funded and set up reading programs for more than 50 years. "If you learn to 
read in your native language first, you then transfer the skills you acquire 
into a second language." 
</P>
<P>
 Though no hard numbers exist, literacy experts estimate that thousands of 
Latino immigrants in Central Los Angeles are unable to read or write not only 
in English, but also in Spanish. Statewide, a 1989 survey of 5,000 Latino 
immigrants found that they had completed an average of 6.5 years of school in 
their native countries. The survey was conducted for the California Department 
of Education to assess skill levels of Latinos who qualified for citizenship 
under the 1986 federal amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Salvador and Guatemala, experts say, more than two-thirds of the 
residents are illiterate, having grown up in the countryside where work is 
valued over schooling or where few opportunities exist for those who want to 
learn. Many of those campesinos , or countryside workers, moved to Los Angeles 
during the immigration wave of the late 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Barrera. 
</P>
<P>
 One of eight children -- four of whom died of childhood diseases -- Barrera 
was relegated to domestic work as a child and teen-ager. Beginning at age 6, 
she awoke daily at 3 a.m. to grind cornmeal and make tortillas for her dad and 
two older brothers, who worked the cotton and coffee fields. Other chores, such 
as cleaning the family's dilapidated shack, cooking dinner and hauling water 
from a nearby well, would last into the evening, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life has always been one of work," Barrera said, pointing to a thick scar 
across her neck from the yoke she wore to carry the buckets of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera, who came to Los Angeles in 1976 and now makes ends meet by cleaning 
homes, said she wanted to go to school as a child, but her father refused to 
send her. "He said, 'You just want to learn to write letters to your 
boyfriends,' " Barrera recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of a storefront evangelical church in Echo Park, Barrera is now able 
to read her Bible during services. Before, she said, she just stared blankly at 
the pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read it for my heart and soul," said Barrera, whose goal is to improve her 
Spanish reading capability and eventually become proficient in English. 
</P>
<P>
 The study released in September by the U.S. Department of Education found that 
Latino immigrants scored in the lowest of five levels that tested reading 
comprehension in English and math skills. The 26,000 test recipients were 
required to read newspaper articles and brochures, balance checkbooks and 
calculate prices on lunch menus. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is not surprising that immigrants with limited English skills would 
score poorly, the results show that a major segment of American society is 
falling behind in an increasingly technological world economy, said Irwin 
Kirsch of the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N.J., which conducted 
the test. The New Jersey firm also administers college placement exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're creating two societies -- those who can do, and those who can't," said 
Kirsch, director of the ETS learning and assessment group. 
</P>
<P>
 And among those who will have the most difficulty adapting in the changing 
society, experts say, are immigrants who cannot read or write in their own 
languages, let alone English. 
</P>
<P>
 To help bridge the gap in education in Central Los Angeles' immigrant 
community, about half a dozen Spanish literacy organizations have sprouted up 
in the past several years. Most of them have developed their own primers and 
rely on "popular education" methodology, which has its roots in the theories of 
Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, perhaps best known in the United States for 
his seminal book "Pedagogy of the Oppressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Popular education instructors teach students to read and write with words that 
are relevant to their daily experiences. For example, instead of using phrases 
such as "See Spot run," students write sentences using words such as poverty, 
housing and racism. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, instructors say, is to prompt discussion on those issues affecting 
their lives and what they can do to improve their communities. The technique 
has been widely used in Cuba, Brazil and Nicaragua, among other Latin American 
countries, to educate and politicize large peasant populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education has to be tied into the social, political and economic reality in 
which the students live," Anorve said. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say "popular education" is steeped in leftist doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very radical agenda," said Sally Peterson, director of Learning 
English Advocates Drive, an organization that has spoken out against bilingual 
education. "Many of the instructors have an ax to grind and lose sight of their 
teaching goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Central Los Angeles literacy organizations are few compared to the 
need, they have changed the lives of some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For Paula Palma, a Guatemalan immigrant, learning to read also meant learning 
that she had a right to be paid a minimum wage. The former garment worker said 
she earned three cents for every blouse she sewed, making about $40 for two 
weeks of full-time work. Palma said she did not know about minimum-wage laws 
until they were discussed in her literacy class at the Temple-Beaudry nonprofit 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that if we work, we have to get the proper pay," said Palma, now a 
cafeteria cook at 9th Street Elementary School in Downtown. "Now, if something 
is not right, I speak out." 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of about 75 students who have attended the free classes at the 
Centro Latino de Educacion Popular, which was founded by Cajina in 1991. A 
literacy teacher in Nicaragua, Cajina realized the need for similar programs 
here while working for a Downtown social service agency. During the course of 
helping garment workers file court grievances seeking back wages, he discovered 
that many could neither read nor write. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has two paid staff members and several volunteers. It has 
received about $110,000 in grants from the Liberty Hill Foundation and Cal 
Literacy Inc., among other groups and corporations. Liberty Hill and Cal 
Literacy also fund other area literacy organizations, including the Centro de 
Educacion Popular de Este Los Angeles in Boyle Heights and the Proyecto 
Educativo Comunitario in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 The South-Central organization has taught 40 students to read and write since 
it started in late 1992. The organization, which offers free classes, was 
founded by Roberto Bustillo, a former law student and human rights activist in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, at St. Columbkille Catholic Church at 64th and Main 
streets, six students learned how to pronounce different sounds created by 
vowels and consonants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bla-ble-blo-blu," Bustillo said, pointing to the letters written on a 
chalkboard. The students repeated: "Bla-ble-blo-blu." 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the name of the material we use to build houses?" Bustillo asked in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 After several wrong answers, student Victoriano Melendez offered the correct 
response: bloque , which means block in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of El Salvador, Melendez grew up in the countryside and worked in the 
coffee, cotton and bean fields since he was 7 years old. The 38-year-old 
South-Central resident emigrated to the United States in 1977 and works at a 
garment factory near Athens County Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how I lived all these years in ignorance, not knowing anything," 
Melendez said. "It was like I was blind." 
</P>
<P>
 Melendez said he feels bad because he was unable to read bedtime stories to 
his daughter when she was little. He says she is now 21, attending Cal State 
Fresno and considering applying to law school. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, I gave her all the support she needed," he said. "And I 
taught her the most important thing: Have respect for herself and others." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Ramirez, who is taking advanced classes offered by the South-Central 
organization, sums up the feeling of many who are learning to read and write. 
"It is beautiful to be able to know what is happening in the world," said the 
43-year-old Mexican immigrant. "To read a book, read a map or look at the 
newspaper is a wonderful feeling." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban immigrant Ana Hatch, 65, takes part in a literacy class at Malabar 
Library in Boyle Heights. Several literacy groups are reaching out to 
illiterate Latino immigrants by teaching them to read and write in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning to read opens up a whole new world for these students," said Gaspar 
Verdugo, executive director of the Centro de Educacion Popular de Este Los 
Angeles, which offers the free classes in Boyle Heights for Hatch and other 
Eastside residents. The Spanish literacy organization is one of a handful that 
have sprouted up during the past several years to bridge the gap in education 
in the area's immigrant community.

TROUBLED CRENSHAW CAFE SERVES ITS LAST CUSTOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financially troubled Crenshaw Cafe, a popular eatery on the Crenshaw strip 
that served up lively conversation with its plates of soul food, closed March 
3. 
</P>
<P>
 The fortunes of the cafe began a fast decline after owner Jamil Shabazz, 40, 
was sentenced to state prison in November on conspiracy and insurance fraud 
charges for his involvement in one of the largest auto insurance fraud rings in 
the country, according to the district attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Cafe head waiter Michael Garrison, who took over management after Shabazz was 
incarcerated, said dwindling business and increased overhead quickly 
overwhelmed him and forced the cafe to close. "It's a shame, but there was 
nothing else to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owner Beryl Robinson, who also owns nearby Coley's Kitchen, a nearby 
Jamaican restaurant, said the cafe had fallen far behind on its $1,600-a-month 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest in a string of closures of notable black-owned restaurants 
in recent years, including Sir Graham's in Inglewood and Sisters on Crenshaw.  
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old cafe was famous for its soul-food cooking that, following 
Shabazz's Muslim beliefs, eschewed pork and emphasized vegetables. Alongside 
the grits smothered in gravy and short ribs were ground turkey burgers, egg and 
broccoli scrambles and steamed vegetable plates.  
</P>
<P>
 As famous as the food was the handwriting that covered the walls at the 
10-table restaurant. Signatures and testaments to the cafe's culinary virtues 
were scrawled in ink by Muhammad Ali, jazz pianist Billy Childs, ex-Laker star 
Michael Cooper, the Dorsey High basketball team, singer Lou Rawls, rappers Kool 
Moe Dee and LL Cool J, to name just a few. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-profile crowd, which included many members of the local Muslim 
community, guaranteed spirited conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Cates of North Hills, a longtime patron, said he often dropped by after 
church on Sunday, Bible in hand, and wound up in friendly philosophical debates 
with Muslim customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was always some kind of dialogue happening," Cates said. "The cafe had 
a cast of characters I didn't see anywhere else."

FATHER, SON ON TRIAL, ACCUSED OF HIRING KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former cable-TV host and his father went to trial Thursday in Norwalk 
Superior Court on charges they hired a hit man last year to kill a 14-year-old 
Pico Rivera girl whom the son was accused of raping. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito David Valdez Jr., 23, and his father, Tito David Valdez, 56, both of 
Downey, are charged with conspiracy and solicitation to murder the girl.Tito 
Valdez Jr. was sentenced earlier this month to 14 years in prison after being 
convicted of rape and lewd conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his father are accused of hiring a contract killer in early December to 
stop the girl from testifying. They were arrested several hours later and no 
murder attempt was made. Both defendants are in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito Valdez Jr. hosted the "Hollywood Haze" program about the 
underground-party scene in the Southland. The show was aired last fall on 
Continental Cablevision, which serves several Southeast cities.

TAXI FIRM WITHOUT L.A. PERMIT FINED 
</P>

<P>
 The growing problem of illegal cabdrivers operating in Los Angeles was 
highlighted earlier this month with the conviction of a Santa Monica company 
that dispatched a taxi into Los Angeles without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Service Co. and its president and chief financial officer, Mehdi 
Charmchi, 27, had been charged with three counts of operating without a Los 
Angeles franchise and proper permits, said Ted Goldstein, a spokesman for the 
Los Angeles city attorney's office.A municipal judge ordered Charmchi to pay a 
$13,510 fine after he pleaded no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles requires taxi permits to ensure that drivers have insurance and 
their cabs meet safety standards. Some illegal cabdrivers have been found to 
take advantage of patrons, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are ruses for taking patrons on rides where they find themselves robbed 
and stranded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Department of Transportation estimates that illegal cab operations 
have more than doubled in the last five years, from 400 to about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The department began investigating Best Service, also known as Best Yellow 
Cab, in 1992 after receiving complaints from licensed cabdrivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators posing as patrons conducted stings from Nov. 4, 1992, to Oct. 
29, 1993.

DRIVE FIGHTS STORM DRAIN DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heal the Bay, a Santa Monica-based environmental group known for its 
grass-roots efforts at cleaning up local waters, will help launch a countywide 
program this week to educate people about the dangers of dumping hazardous 
waste into storm drains, which empty into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Gutter Patrol program, conducted in conjunction with the Los Angeles 
city and county public works departments, volunteers will place 65,000 
stenciled signs reading "No Dumping, This Drains to Ocean" on storm drains 
across Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to be completed in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban storm water runoff contributes the largest amount of pollution to area 
beaches, said Heal the Bay Executive Director Adi Liberman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainwater washes fertilizers, motor oil, pet droppings and other pollutants 
into storm drains, which flush into the sea.

DREAMING UP IDEAS FOR A MORE LIVABLE L.A.; GROWTH: RESIDENTS ARE ASKED TO HELP 
ACHIEVE GOALS PROPOSED FOR AN UPDATED GENERAL PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now more than ever, Los Angeles is looking for a future. 
</P>
<P>
 It could look something like this: A metropolis where neglected boulevards are 
teeming with life, where more people move more easily through the urban 
landscape, where the isolation born of freeways and gate-guarded enclaves gives 
way to a sense of community, and where the benefits and burdens of new 
development are spread evenly throughout the city's fractured neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the two-year process of redrawing the city's long-term 
blueprint for growth, that is the Los Angeles that residents from communities 
as diverse as Westwood and South Central and San Pedro are telling local 
officials they want. 
</P>
<P>
 How to get there is the subject of a series of community meetings taking place 
across Los Angeles. Armed with colorful sketches of different communities, 
urban planners are showing residents what the future could hold for their 
neighborhoods and explaining how to make it happen. Meetings are scheduled 
Wednesday in West Los Angeles and March 31 for the Hollywood and Wilshire 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners hope to present the plans to the city Planning Commission in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the vision of planners and residents leaps from colorful maps and 
charts into reality depends on the will of politicians and the willingness of 
residents to accept changes that may be unpopular in the short term, those 
involved in the process agree. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling this as a plan for people's children," said Los Angeles planner 
Ron Maben, who is helping update the city's General Plan, the document that 
guides future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan -- last updated in 1974 -- establishes broad policy. Although 
it does not govern how individual pieces of property should be developed, it 
sets the tone for smaller, more specific community plans that do. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several weeks -- and continuing until next month -- planners 
have taken preliminary ideas on the road to ask residents across the city what 
they think of a plan that seeks to accommodate more people without overloading 
the freeways and the sewers or worsening the quality of the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary ideas stem from community meetings last year, at which members 
told planners what they did and did not want Los Angeles to be. Although each 
neighborhood had specific ideas about its future, planners were struck by the 
similarities in what residents wanted in Los Angeles as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted more parks, more livable neighborhoods and more affordable 
housing. They did not want more traffic, more smog or more of the other 
headaches that go with urban living. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, they all agreed that something has to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, early data compiled by planners demonstrates that if Los Angeles 
continues to grow as it has -- namely, an auto-dependent suburban sprawl -- the 
results could be disastrous. Sewer systems will be overloaded. Roads will be 
gridlocked. Air quality will worsen. And the need for imported water will 
outpace supply. 
</P>
<P>
 So planners devised a preliminary vision for the future that borrows heavily 
from the past. Their preliminary ideas include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Encouraging denser development around mass-transit centers and along major 
transportation corridors. That would allow more people to live within walking 
distance of subways or buses, thus reducing the need for automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mixing different types of development, such as putting apartments or 
condominiums on top of retail shops or commercial offices. That way, 
shopkeepers or office workers could live and work in the same area.  
</P>
<P>
 * Converting flood-control channels and utility rights of way into greenbelts 
that connect regional parks, thus opening up recreational areas in communities 
where vacant land is scarce. If bike paths are built, planners speculate more 
people might pedal to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the diversity of the city's neighborhoods, planners are drawing 
preliminary sketches to detail how the broad guidelines might be applied in 
different communities. Venice, for instance, might develop with a different 
"feel" than, say, Pico-Union, but both communities would be subject to the same 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners hope to present the ideas to the city Planning Commission in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the ideas actually were contained in the city's last General Plan. 
That plan called for major urban hubs such as Downtown, Los Angeles 
International Airport and Warner Center to be connected by a network of transit 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Except the rail lines never got built. And many elements of the plan were 
never followed. Now the plan is out of date. Some of the centers envisioned in 
the plan developed; others did not. 
</P>
<P>
 But much has changed since 1974. Growth has slowed. The luster of the Golden 
State has faded. Employers are leaving. The federal government is leaning on 
Southern California to clean up its air and its water and to bring its sewer 
systems up to par. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those factors could combine to force Los Angeles to abide by the plan 
it ultimately adopts.

CITY TIMES VOICES: CRIMEBUSTERS; ECHO PARK RESIDENTS WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO 
RID THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS OF GANGS, TAGGING AND DRUG DEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM NETTLES, William Nettles, 38, helped found the Echo Park Improvement 
Assn., a group of residents who fight crime in the community. About 75 people 
are active members, attending graffiti paint-outs, monthly meetings and other 
events. Nettles, a free-lance photographer, was interviewed by Mike Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been living in Echo Park about 10 years. When I moved to Los Angeles, I 
never thought I could live this far from the ocean, but my girlfriend lived in 
Echo Park so I kept visiting. I thought it was real pretty but there were a lot 
of guys selling drugs in the street. A lot of gang members. My tires got 
slashed one night along with about half the other cars on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we got a house. I was going to have to do something about the 
neighborhood or just live with it. We had a guy selling drugs across the street 
and he got shot one day by the people up the street selling drugs. Gang kids 
used to run up our driveway to the hillside to hide from the police. This was 
about '84. 
</P>
<P>
 One night a guy took a shot at my house. The cops came out in the morning. 
They lived out in Newhall or someplace. They said, "Jeez, what do you expect 
when you live here?" I thought that was a pretty crummy attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 I started working on the crime problem. I put security lights up on the house, 
figuring if they're hiding they don't want lights. They never came back. 
</P>
<P>
 I started working with my neighbors to get the drug dealers out. We learned to 
talk to the neighbors living around the dealers. You find out the dealer's 
name, what they're selling and what time they're selling. You give the 
information to the LAPD and they don't need to do a lot of investigating. 
Undercover guys can make the bust and the community is on the way to solving 
the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 We found that a lot of people had similar problems. So people got together and 
held a meeting at St. Athenasius Church. Senior Lead Officer Joe Writer -- we 
call him the Sheriff of Echo Park because he takes our problems personally -- 
helped us get organized.  
</P>
<P>
 When a dealer or a crook gets arrested, Joe offers them three choices: Stop 
what they're doing and clean up their act, go someplace where people don't 
care, or stay in Echo Park and continually be arrested because the community 
isn't going to tolerate it. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lamoyne and Effie streets, a gang was hanging out for a couple of years in 
three houses. The gang thought they controlled that corner. They painted 
everything with their gang tags and their street names. They shot at houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Our people talked to the landlords and let them know they were going to be 
held responsible. We got the police to put pressure on the gang. The LAPD sent 
a special task force that got court orders and posted the properties "Off 
limits to everyone but tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 These guys got the message that it's time to move out. 
</P>
<P>
 At our monthly Echo Park Improvement Assn. meeting, we have a pin map of our 
area that shows the robberies, burglaries, car thefts and recovered stolen 
cars. When you know what's happening, you can do something about it. Some guy 
who steals a car isn't going to drive it to his house, or leave it five miles 
from home. He's going to leave it two or three blocks from where he lives. So 
on the map where you see a lot of recovered grand theft autos, you draw a 
circle and you have a pretty good idea who your car thief is. 
</P>
<P>
 If a gang kid goes out and paints his name on every wall in town, we go around 
and take Polaroids of his mess. We give these to the police and they give them 
to his probation officer. The probation officer calls him up and says, "You 
just got yourself another 100 hours of community service." That cuts down a lot 
on our gang tagging problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Our No. 1 drug problem is liquor stores. Street drugs are nothing compared to 
the damage alcohol has done to Echo Park. We've got 45 places to buy alcohol 
within a mile of Sunset and Echo Park Boulevard. I have a database on the 
liquor stores and some of the violations against them. Some of these places 
have had stabbings, shootings. Some sell crack pipes and most of them are in 
violation of their liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing we did: We got 500 people in the community to pay $10 a month 
and we contracted with a security company. They drive around and the bad guys 
feel a little more insecure and the good people feel a little safer. Then on a 
Friday or Saturday night when you can't get through on 911, we can always get a 
security officer in three or four minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 All the work we do is time-consuming but really rewarding. When you know that 
your neighborhood is safer and you see kids playing in the street and you know 
you have something to do with that, that's worth more than money. I can't 
affect what's happening in Bosnia or even have much effect on Washington. But 
in Echo Park I can make a difference.

DAY LABORERS IN LADERA HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a tenant of the apartment complex directly across the street from where the 
day workers hang out in Ladera Heights ("Toil and Trouble," Feb. 27), I can 
tell you it's been a nightmare these last three-plus years that these men have 
been coming to HomeBase. 
</P>
<P>
 My front windows face the driveway and I have firsthand experience of the 
things these men do. I have seen women walking down the street harassed by 
these men. I have seen these men urinate on the trees in front of my family 
apartment complex. I have watched as these men have scratched the paint off the 
HomeBase sign. 
</P>
<P>
 I personally want these men out of my neighborhood, because they do not 
respect the people who live here or the property. I am sick and tired of 
hearing about these "poor men who are just trying to get work." What about us ? 
We live here, damn it, and we have tried for years to keep our community the 
kind of place where you can walk down the street in the daylight hours and not 
be harassed by anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame that because these men have taken over our neighborhood I can no 
longer go out my front door and walk across the street to shop. I have to drive 
my car across the street to get my nails done. This is not right. I have lived 
in this neighborhood since 1967, before there was a Zody's and then a HomeBase. 
HomeBase may have brought a few jobs to the community, but these men have taken 
the joy of that away. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who tries to turn this into a racist incident is not one who lives in 
this community and has not experienced what I have. I guess what I'm really 
trying to say is: Put yourself in my shoes for three-plus years and see how you 
feel then. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that not all of these men do these things, but one bad apple does spoil 
the whole bunch. If this area were commercial property instead of residential, 
it would not be such a big deal.

 I think the day workers should be allowed to stand out there and get work. 
They are not doing anything against the law. As long as they're not out there 
raping people or stealing things, I think there is nothing wrong with them 
standing out there. I hope a solution can be found that would allow them to 
continue to do that and just find ways to keep them from littering the streets.

 The answer seems simple: The ACLU is concerned about infringing on rights, 
perhaps the ACLU would be willing to post their local street addresses and 
allow the immigrants who are looking for jobs to line up in front of their 
business.

 I live in a 90% Latino neighborhood, Hawaiian Gardens. We also have a HomeBase 
store where laborers hang out. I recognize that there is not enough work for 
everyone who wishes to work. It is admirable of anyone to put themselves on the 
line to beg for work. Much better this than to watch the beggars around Ladera 
Park asking for money, not work.

CITY TIMES VOICES: READING, WRITING AND HELPING; A SALVADORAN REFUGEE HAS SET 
ASIDE HIS GOAL TO BECOME A LAWYER IN FAVOR OF TEACHING LITERACY SKILLS TO 
LATINO ADULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERTO BUSTILLO, Roberto Bustillo, 35, is the director of Proyecto 
Educativo Comunitario (Community Education Project), a South-Central community 
organization designed to improve literacy in Spanish among Latino adults. Last 
year, the 2-year-old PRECO organization provided 512 hours of free instruction 
in reading and writing in Spanish. Bustillo was interviewed by Kirby Lee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latinos are one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in South-Central, but 
there is a great lack of community-based educational services for 
non-English-speaking adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The public library system provides basic literacy in English for 
English-speaking adults and local schools offer English as a Second Language 
classes. Neither, however, addresses the learning needs of those who lack basic 
reading and writing skills in their native language. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to read and write in Spanish is the first step before going on to ESL 
classes. I started PRECO to help serve as this link.  
</P>
<P>
 Classes are offered four nights a week at St. Columbkille and St. Vincent's 
churches. I am one of three teachers, and we have about 30 students, who are 
given individualized and group instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of our students are adult immigrants, ranging from age 18 to 60, who came 
here for economic or political reasons and who have to deal with a lot of 
obstacles to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 We teach Spanish literacy by using the students' culture and experiences as 
immigrants, students and job-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 We focus on teaching words representing the living conditions of the Latino 
community such as vivienda (housing), salud (health) and familia (family). 
Traditional methods use words like manzana (apple) or ventana (window). This 
works for children because at that moment they are learning to know their 
environment, but the traditional method is not effective for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 If you cannot read or write, even in Spanish, it's very hard to find work or 
fill out an application for social services. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew Spanish and it was still a difficult experience. For those who are 
illiterate, it is twice as difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a law student at the National University in El Salvador but was forced 
to come to the United States for my personal security in 1988 because of my 
involvement in a student campaign to demand more funding for the university 
from the government. 
</P>
<P>
 I received anonymous letters threatening me, and for my last six months in El 
Salvador I was followed by government agents who questioned me and followed me 
wherever I went. My wife and 5-year-old daughter are still in El Salvador, but 
I knew if I did not leave I would eventually be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not know any English and worked as a dishwasher when I arrived in this 
country. I taught myself English, and it's still important to me to improve my 
language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECO operates out of my apartment on a budget of about $50,000. Most of our 
money is invested in computer equipment for developing a textbook and flyers 
and school supplies. The churches have donated classroom space and we have 
received grants from foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 I work more than 60 hours each week, teaching and recruiting students, 
teachers and volunteers. I have all but given up on my dream of becoming a 
lawyer, but I have no regrets.

 The Big Bus was making its last stop in Oakland on Saturday. It was the end of 
the line for seniors Kristaan Johnson, Tremaine Fowlkes, Reggie McFerren and 
Tommie Davis, probably the most publicized passengers ever to ride to Crenshaw 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Their transfers expired after the Cougars (28-2) played Carmichael Jesuit 
(31-6) in the CIF State Division I basketball finals Saturday at the Oakland 
Coliseum. It was a rematch of last season's title game, which the Cougars won 
73-66. (See Sports, Section C, for results.) 
</P>
<P>
 All that remains of their high school careers are senior pranks, ditch days 
and a prom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad, real sad," said Johnson, who started at Van Nuys Montclair Prep two 
seasons before transferring to Crenshaw. "I've started for four years and 
played about 130 games and lost only about 10. It's been an awesome run." 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three -- Johnson, Fowlkes and McFerren -- have been together for two 
seasons, leading the Cougars to two City Section 4-A titles, and at least one 
State title. Their two-year record will be 57-4 if they win Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who flew to Oakland on Friday, were nicknamed the "Big Bus" by 
6-foot-5 junior Ronnie Arch before the much anticipated March 12 game against 
Mater Dei of Santa Ana in the Southern California Regionals at the Anaheim 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arch: "Our team is like a big bus; Mater Dei is a little Datsun B-210. 
We're on a mission to run them over." 
</P>
<P>
 The previously undefeated Monarchs pushed the Big Bus to the limit before 
succumbing, 71-67. The big play came with the Cougars leading, 69-66, with 1 
minute and 21 seconds left. Johnson, who has been criticized for being 
immobile, was knocked over by Mike Karich shortly before Clay McKnight sank a 
three-point shot that would have tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Karich was called for an illegal screen. Johnson, who scored a game-high 27 
points, sank one of two free throws to put Crenshaw ahead, 70-66. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get the foul," Johnson said, "so I flopped. I exaggerated a 
little bit to get the ref's attention. He called it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs made only one free throw the rest of the way while Crenshaw 
played keep-away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the little B-210 gave them a scare," Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight 
said. "Willie (West Jr., Crenshaw's coach) has got a great team. A Who's Who of 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Monarchs have the player of the future in freshman Schea Cotton, the 
Cougars had the team of the year, including their own freshman, Travis Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one freshman going to Oakland, and it's not Schea Cotton," Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arch: "The bus is -- honk, honk -- rolling over." 
</P>
<P>
 After winning last season's State title, the Cougars were investigated by the 
Los Angeles Times for allegedly violating residence eligibility requirements. 
The City Section found the allegations groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 West is still questioned about some of the passengers on his Big Bus, which 
began rolling long before the current riders were old enough to travel alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a youth, Kristaan Johnson looked as round as the basketball his small hands 
could dribble. He spent his summers playing ball and hanging out with Willie 
West III, the coach's son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Coach West taking us out for a barbecue dinner," said Johnson, who 
grew to become one of the greatest players to compete at Crenshaw. "I was so 
full, I got sick." 
</P>
<P>
 While his father, Marques, completed his career at UCLA and in the National 
Basketball Assn. with the Milwaukee Bucks, Johnson grew up in the Cougar 
family, idolizing the stars who once made Crenshaw famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to look up to Darwin Cook and John Williams. I was this fat and 
out-of-shape boy. No one knew I could play basketball. They thought I would 
play football." 
</P>
<P>
 Another prominent Cougar used to challenge Crenshaw cheerleader Denise Gibson, 
later West's wife, to a game of one-on-one when he was only 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denise West didn't know my son from the man on the moon," said Reggie 
McFerren Sr. "This little guy used to do his best to beat her." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, another little boy used to run into the Cougar gym and ask West if 
his brother, Aaron, was finished with practice. Two years later, Ronnie Arch 
grew to 6-foot-4 and transferred to Crenshaw from Westchester during his 
sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
 Arch was one of nine players who transferred to Crenshaw in 1992. "Other than 
Kris and Reggie, I didn't know these kids," West said of the nine on their 
first day of practice. "Assistant Coach (Maurice) Duckett pointed to Arch and 
said: 'You know who that is? That's Ronnie Arch.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for a smaller kid," said West, who is 6 feet, "not one who was 
taller than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Another father and son have also competed for the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Palmer Sr. was a teammate of Marques Johnson's on the 1972 Cougar 
team, while Raymond Jr., a 6-5 junior forward, is Kristaan's teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kashan Abdul-Ramahn, who has announced Cougar games for 23 years on KBOX-FM 
99.9, also played on the 1972 team and often teases the younger Palmer. "Hey, 
son. I used to take your father to the hole," said Abdul-Ramahn, who was named 
Ernest Griffin during his playing days. 
</P>
<P>
 West has long considered the 1972 team the best ever to compete at Crenshaw, 
although the squad did not win a City Section title and there was no state 
tournament. The Cougars had to forfeit most of their Western League games for 
using an ineligible player and were not allowed to compete in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Cougars had an outstanding group of players. In addition to Marques 
Johnson, the 1973 City Player of the Year, the team featured Maynard Brown, 
Renard Murray and Reggie Mims, a 6-2 point guard who could post-up defenders. 
Nicknamed the Dynamic Defensive Cougars, or DC-5 for short, Crenshaw gave up 
only 40.6 points a game, while scoring 76.9. No team scored more than 61 points 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great defense, and we didn't press," West said. "We scored a lot of 
points because we overpowered people." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the Cougars went 31-0, winning the City Section, State and an 
exhibition world title in Denmark. The team -- starring Stephen Thompson, Paul 
Weakley, Dion Brown, Ron Caldwell, David Carter and Stanley Brundy -- 
epitomized the full-court pressing defense. The 1985 squad set a school record 
for most points in a game: 197 against Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Thompson was named City Player of the Year for the second consecutive 
season. The Cougars went 25-2, winning their second consecutive State title and 
third City title in a row. Their two losses came in the Beach Ball Classic in 
Myrtle Beach, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the Cougars won 28 consecutive games before losing to Manual Arts in 
the Southern California Regionals. During their winning streak, the 28-1 
Cougars were ranked No. 1 in the nation for six consecutive weeks. Jon 
Staggers, Cornelius Holden, Douglas Meekens, Charlie Hill and Damon Hill, and 
Jalal Abdul-Rahman were the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team had height, speed and quickness," said West, who had eight players 
receive college scholarships. "They were very quick to the ball. Everyone could 
shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 So where does the 1994 team, winners of a 13th City Section title and possible 
winners of a record sixth State title, rank among the legendary Cougars teams? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not the best, but certainly in the top five," West said. "It's probably the 
best perimeter-shooting team I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars return only four of 15 varsity players next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the 53-year-old West return to coach his 24th year at Crenshaw? 
</P>
<P>
 "A young lady who played here and who has a 4- or 5-year-old boy told me I had 
to be here to coach her son." 
</P>
<P>
 One bus trip has ended and another is about to begin.

VERDICT'S IN ON VERBUM DEI'S COACH; TRADING ONE COURT FOR ANOTHER, MIKE KEARNEY 
PUT A LAW CAREER ON HOLD TO COACH BASKETBALL AT THE SCHOOL. HE HAS TAKEN THE 
EAGLES TO THEIR FOURTH APPEARANCE AT THE DIVISION IV FINALS IN FIVE YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 Twenty-seven hundred miles is a long way to travel on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Verbum Dei basketball Coach Mike Kearney, no distance was too great if 
it meant being one step closer to fulfilling his dream of teaching at the high 
school whose team he has admired since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of practicing law in New Jersey after graduating from George Mason 
University Law School in Virginia as he had intended, Kearney volunteered for 
one year as a teacher at Verbum Dei High School in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, Kearney is not only the dean of English at Verbum Dei, but 
also the coach of the area's most successful Southern Section basketball team. 
This season, his Eagles finished 26-3 and made their fourth appearance at the 
Division IV finals in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out through the Jesuit Volunteer Corps that there was a need for a 
teacher at Verbum Dei," Kearney said. "I had always wanted to teach in the 
inner city and I had admired Verbum Dei's basketball program since I was a 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the time, Kearney's plan was to return to his home state of New Jersey 
to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoyed the kids, and I thought the school was a place where 
something positive was happening. I got the opportunity to coach the varsity 
basketball team the following year and it was a pretty easy decision" to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Kearney's decision to remain at Verbum Dei also changed the plans of his wife, 
Kimberly, who teaches government, economics and English there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like watching the kids learn something and take interest in learning new 
things," Kimberly Kearney said. "A lot of these kids are very intelligent and, 
given the right opportunity, could be very, very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 She graduated in the summer of 1991 from Cornell Law School in Ithaca, N.Y. 
They were married that August. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Kearney worked briefly at the Los Angeles law firm of Lightfoot, 
Vandevelde, Woehrle & Sadowsky when she decided to give teaching a try in 1992. 
"I like working with kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei's comfortable size, 320 students in all, was instrumental in her 
decision to join the teaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei "has always been like a family to me," she said. "The faculty is 
very close-knit and the people are there to help the kids. The parents are 
doing a good thing putting their kids in that school." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearney has made the most of his coaching tenure, amassing a 98-41 record in 
five seasons. Under Kearney's guidance, Verbum Dei made Division IV finals 
appearances in 1990, '91, '93 and '94. This year, the Eagles won their first 
Division IV championship before losing to San Diego Lincoln, 94-93, in the 
Southern California Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my best team because (point guard) Jamal Cobbs and (shooting guard) 
Andre Miller were tremendous leaders by example," Kearney said. "They made 
everyone else play hard all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who averaged 24 points, credited Kearney with Verbum Dei's rise to 
prominence: "He is an expert, because we have been to the Finals four times 
since he has been here. He knows what he is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearney has also gained the respect of his players' parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a fantastic person," said Andrea Miller, Andre's mother. "I hope he 
will be with Verbum Dei for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 That is Kearney's intention. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I do not plan to pursue law, because I enjoy what I am doing," 
Kearney said. "The importance for the education of the kids in that community 
can't be discounted, and there is a big responsibility that goes along with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearney was once a student-athlete at St. Joseph's High School (now Monsignor 
Donovan High School) in Toms River, N.J. As a guard, Kearney averaged 20 points 
his senior season, in which St. Joseph's went 23-4 before losing in the state 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kearney red-shirted his freshman season at Assumption College (Division II) in 
Worcester, Mass., in 1980-81. He played a full season his sophomore year but 
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee the following year. 
Kearney coached the junior varsity team at Worcester Vocational Tech his senior 
year. Before attending George Mason, Kearney returned to alma mater Monsignor 
Donovan to coach the freshman team in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been a student-athlete, Kearney said he is better able to communicate 
with his players and overcome racial barriers: 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing for the kids to know at Verb is that you are 
committed to them and that you know what you are talking about. When they know 
this, I don't think color has to do with anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Verb we try to keep things in perspective as to what is important. I don't 
think the public in general understands the pressures that kids in 
South-Central L.A. face. Being a good student, son and athlete in South-Central 
L.A. is the most difficult task a young person can face."

SOCCER; ELIGIBILITY RULING FORCES BELMONT TO GIVE UP TITLE

 Belmont High relinquished its City Section soccer title last week after 
starting fullback Octavio Calvillo was ruled ineligible by a regulations 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wednesday decision could be reversed, pending Belmont's final appeal to 
the City Section Athletics Office. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Interscholastic Athletics Committee rules, Calvillo, who was also 
a starter for the Sentinel football team, could no longer participate in high 
school sports because he was into his ninth semester. Eight semesters is the 
maximum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an oversight on my behalf for not checking his cumulative semesters 
thoroughly," said Jeff Hebron, Belmont athletic director.  
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the number of games Calvillo played for the football team, the 
Sentinels may also have to forfeit their 1993-94 Northern Conference title.

 World Cup officials began sewing soccer seeds in Watts last week as they 
unveiled a high-tech, down-sized soccer field at the Nickerson Gardens housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skills Court, a $100,000 fenced-in synthetic turf covered with sand, is 
one of nine fields that are also being donated in the eight other World Cup 
cities as part of the soccer organization's Legacy Tour '94. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg presided over the March 10 ceremonies, 
which included a soccer clinic and appearances by U.S. national team members 
Desmond Armstrong and Paul Caligiuri. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the disturbances in Los Angeles, we got together with Rebuild LA and 
decided that Nickerson Gardens was the best site to begin our legacy," 
Rothenberg said.

THEATER; WILL IT BE A DAY AT THE BEACH?; 'I'M OPEN TO ALMOST ANYTHING,' SAYS 
MICHAEL GREIF, LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE'S NEW ARTISTIC DIRECTOR. FINE, BUT AFTER DES 
MCANUFF, WILL THAT BE ENOUGH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK PACHECO, Patrick Pacheco is a free-lance writer based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1990, Joseph Papp named 31-year-old Michael Greif to be one of three 
resident directors at the New York Public Theatre. "Michael who?" was the 
response from the New York theater community. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif's work at the Public got some mixed reviews, but he was taken seriously. 
Still, he's not exactly a big name. Yet. Just over a week ago, Greif, known 
mostly as a free-lance director for regional theaters, became the recipient of 
another surprise appointment: As of the 1995 season, he will replace Des 
McAnuff as artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse, one of the most 
prestigious jobs in American regional theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, theater insiders are buzzing, although Playhouse officials say 
choosing a not-yet-too-well-known director is exactly what they'd done when 
they brought McAnuff on board just over a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted someone with directorial talent and institutional experience, but 
we were also looking for a younger person," says Gary L. Wollman, president of 
the Board of Trustees of the La Jolla Playhouse. (Playhouse founding director 
McAnuff, 41, is best known for co-creating "The Who's Tommy," and is leaving to 
pursue film and theater projects.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it stemmed from our experience with Des. Our artistic mission here is 
to be a haven for new work, and there's a whole new generation of theater 
artists whom we expect Michael to bring to the Playhouse. He's certainly 
someone whose work, to some extent, challenges the current assumptions as to 
what theater should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Responses to Greif's eclectic productions prove the point. The same New York 
critics who praised the rich theatricality of his breakthrough 1990 production 
of "Machinal" at the Public Theatre damned his indulgent spectacle of 
"Pericles" at the same venue. Greif is unapologetic about his devotion to the 
expressive possibilities of the stage and its craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in pieces that revel in their own theatricality," Greif said 
in a recent phone interview from Baltimore, where he is currently directing 
rehearsals of Donald Margulies' "The Loman Family Picnic" at the Center Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif's link to the La Jolla Playhouse dates to 1983, the year the theater was 
revived. While a graduate student at UC San Diego, where the theater is 
located, he assisted McAnuff on Playhouse productions of "Romeo and Juliet," 
and, subsequently, "As You Like It" and "Big River," both in 1984. He returned 
to the theater in 1986 to co-direct, with Bill Irwin, "The Three Cuckolds" and 
again in 1992 to direct Joe Orton's "What the Butler Saw." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif caught the public eye in New York, however, during his 1990-91 stint at 
the Public. Among the plays he directed that season were "A Bright Room Called 
Day," Tony Kushner's political allegory about artists and writers living in the 
Weimar Republic; Constance Congdon's "Casanova," a Rashomon-like reappraisal of 
the notorious womanizer told from the points of view of the title character, 
his long-suffering lover and a transvestite; and the maligned "Pericles," 
starring Campbell Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner's first major production in New York was panned, but few of those who 
saw "Bright Room" will forget the first act curtain, when the devil appeared in 
a smoking jacket accompanied by a red-eyed hellhound and clouds of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael has what I feel is exactly the right balance," Kushner said of 
Greif's ability to walk the line between cool intellectualism and melodrama. 
"He's completely unafraid of going to very dark places. On its best nights, the 
play was working not when the audience was sobbing openly at the end, but when 
they were frightened and disturbed and scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif admits that he is comfortable with what he calls the "yin and yang" of 
the theater, accommodating both intellect and emotions. "I feel that our very 
best directors are those who are brilliant interpreters of the material but who 
also have a great sense of the dramatic. I like the idea of an intelligent 
framework but one that is never enforced at the expense of real blood and guts 
and tears between the characters onstage." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif has mined those feelings over wide terrain. "Machinal," for example, is 
an obscure 1928 work by Sophie Treadwell exploring one woman's socially 
claustrophobic journey to murder. This summer, Greif will be part of McAnuff's 
final season as artistic director at the La Jolla Playhouse, directing Neal 
Bell's new play based on the Emile Zola novel "Therese Raquin." Greif's resume 
could well be called eclectic, even allowing for his one excursion into the 
musical theater, directing international and American touring productions of 
Roger Miller's "Big River." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm open to almost anything," Greif said. "I worry about that, being pulled 
in a lot of different directions. But that's one of the reasons I was drawn to 
La Jolla. Its reputation, to a large extent, is based on its diversity, and the 
board is committed to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Common threads are nonetheless apparent in Greif's work. He is invariably 
concerned with how people respond to events and the moral and political 
ramifications of their acts and feelings -- both in microcosm and macrocosm. 
Accountability is a watchword of Greif's focus. "His instincts are very deeply 
moral and very political," Kushner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his career, Greif said the primary function of the theater is to 
teach. He now says it's "to share." 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps I've gotten smarter," Greif said with a touch of self-mockery, "or 
less tolerant of didacticism, since I made that statement. But I'm still very 
much interested in finding politically astute plays that allow you to engage in 
political issues or questions through an individual journey."

<P>
 Greif's political and moral outlooks were nurtured in a childhood spent in 
Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. To one side of his comfortably middle-class Jewish 
home were affluent suburbs; to the other, poverty. The son of an optician 
father and insurance auditor, his experience in the economically mixed 
community made him sensitive to the inherently dramatic conflicts of the "over- 
and underprivileged." 
</P>
<P>
 His sense of being what he calls "the other" -- a feeling of alienation and 
dislocation often expressed in his work -- came from "growing up gay," he says. 
"That can really give you a strong perception of the threat a political system 
can perpetrate on an individual -- whether you're talking about Jews or gays or 
women or people of color." 
</P>
<P>
 After directing musicals in high school, Greif pursued an acting and directing 
career at Northwestern University, where he studied under the first of his 
three mentors -- Frank Galati, Alan Schneider and Des McAnuff. From Galati, who 
directed the Broadway Pulitzer Prize-winning production of "The Grapes of 
Wrath," Greif says he learned about "the spirit and generosity and poetic soul 
of the theater." Later, at UCSD, Greif studied with Schneider, the late 
director credited as among the foremost interpreters of the work of Harold 
Pinter, Samuel Beckett and other icons of avant-garde theater. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Schneider, in fact, who recommended Greif, then his pupil, to McAnuff. 
Both were impressed with his student work there. "We clearly expected 
exceptional things from him," recalled McAnuff. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff was not officially on the search committee for his own replacement, 
but he clearly endorses the choice. "I find Michael refreshingly sane and 
thoughtful. At the same time, he has tremendous integrity and very strong ideas 
about how a theater should be run -- and not run. He has quite a lot of 
experience with the institutional theater and he knows La Jolla. He'll know how 
to fight for what he believes in." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif says he admires McAnuff's ability to connect with an audience: "Des has 
the great strength of taking material he's working on and making it relevant," 
he said. "The approach to 'Big River' was never slight, never commercial. It 
was a play with music that became a musical about race relations in a 
developing country." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, commercialism apparently is not something Greif wants to evade at all 
costs. In fact, Papp once praised Greif for having "some of the best attributes 
of the good commercial directors." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif now says Papp was pointing to his "populist streak. . . . I'm very 
interested in the audience that I'm speaking to." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Greif plans to spend this summer getting to know San Diego 
audiences. "I'm going to spend a lot of time this summer with them. From the 
month of May on, I'll be trying to find out who is going to the theater in San 
Diego -- and who isn't and why they aren't. Regional theaters across the 
country are seeking out new audiences, and quite often people aren't going to 
the theater because they don't see themselves or their issues represented on 
that stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Invariably, part of that ongoing dialogue with the community, as much as with 
the board of directors for the La Jolla Playhouse, will involve the prickly 
debate of "commercial" versus "not-for-profit theater." The idea that regional 
nonprofit theaters like La Jolla are sometimes farm teams for Broadway has 
raised consternation in certain quarters. And Greif understands the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any theater will get in trouble if it sells its soul to develop a project 
just because it might make a lot of money," he said. "But just because 
something makes a lot of money doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile. If something 
is commercially viable but also fascinating, I'm all for it. I get very alarmed 
when anybody starts talking about 'balancing' a season for those reasons. It's 
a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif gets high marks from the theater community for his ability to balance 
such concerns, even as he insists that they will not -- or should not -- affect 
his lineup of plays at La Jolla. Michael David, a partner of the New York 
theater producers the Dodgers, who developed "Big River," "Into the Woods" and 
"Tommy" at the La Jolla Playhouse before presenting these musicals on Broadway, 
says, "Michael seems to have his feet firmly planted where commercial theater 
fears to go, and that's good for the theater. Though the criteria may be 
different and our measure of success is different, I hope that our respective 
agendas will be able to coincide as it has in the past. I don't see why it 
shouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 JoAnne Akalaitis, Papp's controversial successor at the Public Theatre who was 
dismissed from the artistic director's post last year, says she doesn't foresee 
such troubles ahead for her former colleague. Although, she says, "I did tell 
him to get a good contract." 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael is an optimist and, for his age, a seasoned professional," Akalaitis 
said. "His appointment is really about belief in the possibility of a serious 
American theater. It takes tremendous energy, skill and leadership qualities to 
inspire audiences, press and the board of directors to get behind that kind of 
idealism and adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif is clearly stimulated by the challenge. Reminded that the La Jolla 
Playhouse has a $1.6-million deficit, he said, cheerily, "I know. I've got to 
get real smart about identifying alternative funding sources," he said. 
"Actually, I've got to get real smart, real fast, about a lot of things."

POP MUSIC; NOT FADE AWAY; BONNIE RAITT ISN'T ABOUT TO HANG UP HER ROCK 'N' ROLL 
SHOES. IN FACT, HER NEW ALBUM SHOWS SHE MAY BE ENTERING HER PRIME AS A 
SINGER-SONGWRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 44, an age when many pop-rockers are in the twilight of their careers, 
Bonnie Raitt exudes the energy and ambition of someone just entering her prime 
-- which she may well be. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop's most-famous redhead was radiant as she walked into an office at the 
Capitol Tower in Hollywood to talk about her second album since her recording 
career was dramatically rejuvenated. 
</P>
<P>
 Though widely admired throughout the '70s and '80s, the Burbank-born singer 
was largely a cult artist until the February, 1989, night when her "Nick of 
Time" album won three Grammys, including best album, and turned her into a 
mainstream star. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's commercial breakthrough -- nearly 4 million sales -- was all the 
sweeter because her recording future had been in doubt after Warner Bros. 
Records dropped her in the late '80s because of lack of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only have her sales been strong since moving to Capitol (1991's "Luck of 
the Draw" sold 5 million copies), but Raitt has also blossomed as an artist. In 
her new "Longing in Their Hearts," she shows increasing confidence as a writer 
and character as a singer. (See review, Page 72). 
</P>
<P>
 Raitt has gone through an equally dramatic transformation in her private life. 
She turned to Alcoholics Anonymous in the late '80s (recently celebrating her 
seventh year of sobriety) and -- after years of singing about the heartaches of 
romance -- married actor Michael O'Keefe in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the changes, however, much about Raitt remains the same. She and 
O'Keefe (who was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for 1980's "The 
Great Santini" and is now a regular on "Roseanne") live in the same Hollywood 
Hills home she has owned since 1975. She also still devotes much of her time to 
benefit concerts and to championing overlooked blues and folk artists. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the release of her new album, the confident but refreshingly 
unassuming singer-activist spoke about music, marriage and second chances. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: Do you think all the talk after "Nick of Time" about "Bonnie the 
survivor" was over-dramatized? Were your personal problems as severe as some 
people imagined? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think things got sensationalized a bit. It's not like I was (being 
dragged) kicking and screaming to a sanitarium. It was more like I decided to 
hit 40 at a healthy place instead of kind of a sluggish one. In your mid-30s, 
the lifestyle of rock 'n' roll doesn't look as good or feel as good internally 
as it did in your 20s. You can get away with more (then). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Still, that was an important recognition. Weren't there risks in not 
changing your lifestyle? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure . . . and in that sense, yeah, I am a survivor. I know some people 
that have been buckled under by life throwing them a bad deck . . . Richard 
Manuel (of the Band), Paul Butterfield . . . the list goes on and on, who have 
been lost because of drugs and alcohol. There are also a tremendous number of 
people whose careers have suffered from neglect -- by not having opportunities 
given them they deserved. The result is they lost their will and just sort of 
faded away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think that your career could have faded away without the success of 
"Nick of Time"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think so. My career was never at risk in terms of whether I would 
be able to work again. Even though the mainstream of America didn't ever really 
adopt me, my loyal following would still come to see me at the Santa Monica 
Civic, or wherever, every time. It was just that my recording career was 
problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did the success of "Nick of Time" and then "Luck of the Draw" put pressure 
on you? Did you feel you had to live up to that sales and acclaim? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I have never felt any pressure, including after that. The reason I've 
been doing this all along is for my peers to like what I do, and my fans. To 
me, that kind of massive success that "Nick of Time" brought was like winning 
the lottery, which was what the Grammy was. It kind of threw me on the front 
page of a lot of newspapers and people bought it out of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing I could focus on was the quality of the work and I feel I had a 
good team with me in the studio . . . (producer Don Was and engineer Ed 
Cherney) who helped me hit upon some sort of better version of me than I had 
recorded before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One of the most positive things about "Nick of Time" was that it encouraged 
you to do more songwriting instead of depending chiefly on other writers' 
works. Did you feel more confident as a writer? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The fact that record and that song in particular got such an incredible 
response was the most beautiful nurturing of a songwriter that you could 
possibly ask for. Plus, I found it harder and harder to find songs from other 
people that expressed what I wanted to say in my music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Of your songs on the new album, "Circle Dance" seems especially personal. 
Where did the idea -- about the inability to express emotions -- come from? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I started out writing a song about being in a relationship and the things 
that make you avoid being closer . . . the ways you keep coming up against a 
barrier where you can't move any closer and trying to understand how you got 
the barrier in the first place. And I realized that it's about patterns you 
repeat from childhood. That's when I saw that it was going to be a song about 
my dad (Broadway star John Raitt). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you mean? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Childhood was where I got that first lesson about being afraid of people 
leaving . . . the fear of loving someone so much and that person always 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your dad was the one always leaving? 
</P>
<P>
 A: He was a traveling musician. In fact, he is still out on the road. I talked 
to him an hour ago. He's leaving for two concerts today. As a child, I just 
remember how he wasn't home enough and I didn't understand why at the time. I 
played it for him and he was really moved. We had a tearful moment there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you nervous about his reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure, because a parent could get offended by that kind of intimacy or 
revelation in public. But I think he knows that this process of healing is what 
songwriting is all about. He wrote me this beautiful card that night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you get into blues and folk music as a youngster instead of the 
Broadway music associated with your father? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I did start out in school plays, doing little songs from my dad's musicals, 
but folk music was the one that got me. My brothers and I would go to this sort 
of progressive Quaker camp in the early '60s that had a lot of counselors from 
the East Coast colleges where a lot of interest in folk music and civil rights 
and the peace movement was all mushrooming. 
</P>
<P>
 So, that kind of tied music and politics together for me. . . . Pete Seeger, 
Joan Baez, Odetta, Bob Dylan. Then I heard my first acoustic blues record and 
there was a whole new world. . . . Mississippi John Hurt, Mississippi Fred 
McDowell, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After the hundreds of benefits you've done, are you optimistic that social 
conditions are improving? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think I have ever been totally optimistic because I have been 
pretty much against a lot of the government's policies since I was a kid. I've 
always felt the position of people of color and women has not been what it 
should be, including (in) the business I'm in. 
</P>
<P>
 In 22 years, I haven't seen a lot of movement for women to get engineering 
jobs or journalistic jobs. There still seem to be certain kinds of stories 
women cover on the news and certain kinds of jobs they get in record companies. 
It really amazes me that the women's movement hasn't gotten further along . . . 
and that civil rights and human rights around the world didn't get better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you discouraged then? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't get discouraged. I just plow on. Do things change? Yeah. A lot of 
nuclear plants have been shut down. A lot of Native American rights have been 
looked at. I'm also encouraged that (President) Clinton was elected and that 
this generation of kids is much more politically motivated than the one before 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How big a leap was marriage for you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I wasn't particularly expecting to get married because I come from a 
generation that was one of the first that was allowed to live together without 
getting married. Birth control made a whole different lifestyle happen. 
Besides, marriage has such a bad rep . . . what with one out of two breaking 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 I was never concerned with validating my relationships with the state. What 
mattered was the quality of the relationship I had . . . and I've had 
sequentially long relationships, one after the other. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was different this time? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It just felt right. Maybe it was because of the time in my life, but also 
because Michael comes from an Irish Catholic family where people did get 
married. My circle of musician friends tended to not get married, so it was 
charming to be asked and I decided it was time to make a deeper commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you find marriage more difficult than just being in a relationship? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is more work if you take the vows seriously. There's no easy way out . . 
. no sort of closing the door and looking for someone else. My marriage 
coincided with me being sober as well. It was the first really fully alert 
relationship I've had so some of the (personality) things I haven't dealt with 
in the past started coming up. It's a challenge, but it's also really a great 
comfort and a great joy to be able to depend on somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the most important element in making a marriage work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it is helpful if you both have a really good sense of yourself. I'm 
a really strong person, someone who is fiercely independent and used to having 
total control over what goes on in my records and in my touring. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it difficult because you have to be willing to compromise up to a 
point, but you also have to be able to give each other space. We came at this 
from fully developed personalities and we understand that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of the favorite non-show-biz things you do together? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We ride bikes together and we go hiking together. We also love to rent 
videos and eat dinner in. It's kind of fun to nest in. I am on the road so much 
that it's actually fun to be in your own house and play in your garden and hang 
out with your own pets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does that mean you're going to regret going back on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I really love touring. Last summer was the first summer in 22 years 
that I didn't go on the road, and I missed it. I really love being out there. 
It's in my blood, just like it's in my dad's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A lot of rock artists in their 40s seem to go through a real identity 
crisis. They wonder if they can be as relevant or as good as they were in their 
20s and 30s. But you seem to be confident about the future. Do you feel you are 
getting better? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If I thought I wasn't a better singer now, I would hang it up. I can see 
all kinds of examples of people who became better with age: Sippie Wallace, 
Tony Bennett, Muddy Waters, Ella Fitzgerald, my dad. They may sing a little 
different than they once did . . . not the same lung power. But the nuance and 
the depth of feeling is so apparent in their delivery. I'm looking to the year 
2000 and seeing what we all sound like.

ART; HE WILL KEEP YOU IN STITCHES; JIM ISERMANN'S WORLD ENCOMPASSES DECORATION, 
DESIGN AND '50S KITSCH -- HE'S INTO SEWING RIGHT. THERE'S SOMETHING HIGH-END 
ABOUT THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR OF POPULAR DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA-PHILP, Hunter Drohojowska-Philp is chair, department of 
liberal arts and sciences, Otis College of Art and Design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Isermann is a man who sews. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the past year stitching together swatches and remnants purchased at 
swap meets and fabric stores, making bed-sized compositions of faded plaids and 
cornball florals that subtly remind one of an earlier time, a time of "My Three 
Sons" bedspreads and "Shindig" bell-bottoms.  
</P>
<P>
 These works are on view at the Richard Telles Gallery, in an exhibition that 
conjures immediate references to homemade quilts, specifically the AIDS quilt. 
Isermann's patterns are complex and rather strange; his work clearly has as its 
basis a sophisticated awareness of modern painting. Hence, it is doubly useful 
that the nearby Sue Spaid Gallery is offering a survey of the artist's 
unconventional work of the last decade -- from his retro furniture and lamps 
made in '50s and '60s style to his more recent "paintings" composed of 
brilliantly colored stained glass or shag carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 To see these earlier works is essential for viewers who may have missed 
Isermann's debut -- a 1982 installation at the Inn of Tomorrow, near 
Disneyland. The artist filled a motel room with his own re-creations of '50s 
style furniture, including a giant chartreuse console for the TV set. Aware 
that surrealist artists like Hans Arp and Joan Miro had influenced the 
biomorphic shapes of modern design, he felt he was bringing things full circle 
by presenting his furniture as high art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen years ago, when I started that work, I was aware of the high-art 
references. What directly influenced me was the lowest common denominator of 
popular design," Isermann explains. 
</P>
<P>
 A celebration of '50s style has since come into being everywhere from 
"Pee-wee's Playhouse" to Ed Debevic's diner, so it is difficult to imagine the 
initial impact of this work. Isermann recalls that "the old work, when it was 
made, sat on a fence between what was out of style and what is trendy. It had 
an edge you don't see today because those styles have come in and gone out 
again in terms of popular influences. When I show slides of that work to 
students today, they have no idea what it was like to look at that work when it 
was made." 
</P>
<P>
 Spaid's show is notable for another reason. With the accumulating critical 
interest in a younger generation of artists -- Steven Criqui, Chris Finley, 
Carter Potter and others -- who revisit the formal conventions of modern 
painting and sculpture in the materials and colors of popular culture, Isermann 
looks like a stylistic godfather. Yet Isermann appears uncomfortable with this 
notion. "Some of that work I'm drawn to -- I'm attracted to the superficialness 
-- but I don't understand the logic. I think there is a rigorous formal logic 
in everything I've done that I find that lacking in some of this other work." 
</P>
<P>
 He points to his own labyrinthine hand-sewn sheets hung on his studio wall and 
says, "The patterning is so complicated that it's almost impossible to see." 
</P>
<P>
 With his dimpled grin and James Dean haircut, Isermann, 38,looks a bit young 
to be considered anyone's fatherly role model. His Santa Monica loft, where he 
has lived since 1986, is filled with an eclectic mix of '50s and '60s 
paraphernalia, like ceramic hanging lamps from defunct coffee shops and a 
collection of yellow happy-face mugs. There are dozens of white mugs with red 
smiles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother collects them for me. They aren't worth much now. But they will 
be," he says with assurance. In the area serving as his living room hangs a 
drawing by Lari Pittman and several photographs by Judy Fiskin, both of whom he 
met while he was a graduate student at CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
 Isermann moved to Los Angeles in 1977 to get his master's degree but he was 
equally drawn by the L.A. aesthetic and its relationship to classic '50s 
design. "For me, there has never been a separation between decoration, design 
and art. I never looked at furniture or architecture or design as anything but 
art, it is all of equal influence. My earlier work walked some kind of line 
between good and bad taste. I was drawn to the populist nature of these things. 
Part of my interest is the planned obsolescence of design." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he grew up in a modern Prairie-style home in Kenosha, Wis., most of 
his early knowledge of modern design and pop culture came from books. At the 
University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 
fine art, his teachers were less than sympathetic to his paintings of '50s cars 
and his affection for Andy Warhol. In fact, the school forced its students to 
take classes in such crafts as sewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated taking them but I learned to sew," recalls Isermann. 
</P>
<P>
 As his toy fox terrier Riley barks for attention, Isermann confesses some 
startling statistics -- he spent 500 hours sewing his first fabric piece at the 
end of 1992. As he grew more adept, the pieces took some 200 hours to complete. 
"When I saw them hanging together as a group at my opening at Feature (gallery 
in New York in January of 1994), I realized I was looking at a year of my life 
and it meant so much more to me than other shows -- there is an emotional 
impact that wasn't present in the other work." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pieces hanging in his studio nearby pulses with its eye-straining 
combination of Day-Glo colors. It is sewn, in part, from a fabric Isermann 
designed for last summer's "Unite" project, for which an international cast of 
artists -- including Isermann and Raymond Pettibon from L.A. -- was invited to 
create installations in an apartment building designed by Le Corbusier in 
Firminy, France. Isermann designed fabric in a vibrant pattern of overlapping 
crescents of lime, lemon, turquoise and hot pink. "It's a dream of mine," he 
jokes, "to become the Vera of the '90s."  
</P>
<P>
 For the installation, all the walls of one apartment were covered in the 
fabric, the floor in an identical pattern on a larger scale in linoleum. The 
bed, cushions and case for a TV monitor were also covered in the fabric. For 
all its absurdity, the work paralleled the extremity of Le Corbusier's own 
modernist conceit of creating furniture and accessories to match his own 
excruciatingly exacting architecture. With this piece, Isermann turned the 
theory of life-as-design into a hellish cacophony of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with fabric inspired Isermann's decision to sew. "I wanted something I 
could spend an incredible amount of time making, but fold up and have something 
that was easy to move. Part of it is investing that amount of my life into 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the height of the '80s, when it was most fashionable and theoretically 
correct for artists to have their work fabricated, Isermann built his own lamps 
and chairs for installations. Between 1988 and 1990, he not only painted by 
hand the hard-edged geometric panels for his paintings, he hand-hooked the shag 
rugs that became the matching components. Isermann says his obsessive 
involvement in the fabric pieces came after spending two years making stained 
glass pieces that, after all the time spent, were both fragile and difficult to 
move. "All of my work is labor intensive but this is extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 After a long and thoughtful pause, he adds, "There is something about being a 
gay man and making this work that is important. Something to do with interior 
decoration being accepted but not talked about in a way. I've been excluded 
from shows of gay work. I don't know if it's not politically correct enough to 
present or what. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as much a Martian in that world (of gay artists) as in any other 
world. When you see gay shows with naked men and activist work, I obviously 
don't belong in that kind of show. I'm not bitter. The sensibility of what I'm 
making isn't being recognized as gay. But I'm curious about why it's not 
recognized. It's like an unspoken gay sensibility as opposed to the sensibility 
that they want to present to the world. All the things I'm interested in and my 
sensibility are really about the ideas of camp and kitsch that are part of that 
subculture." 
</P>
<P>
 During the '80s, when ironic distance was the privileged position in 
contemporary art, Isermann's retro furniture and his "flower power" shows of 
'60s-derived paintings were received as ironic commentaries on lost innocence. 
But in 1992, Village Voice art critic Peter Schjeldahl praised Isermann's 
stained glass windows for being "without a whisper of irony of any sort." 
Schjeldahl wrote: "They brighten the prospect of art's near future, when we may 
again be going to artworks rather than texts for the important information on 
culture's unfolding ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Isermann, thrilled with this acknowledgment, feels that his art has been 
misunderstood. "My work was suspected of being ironic and arch, but underneath 
there was a total belief in the images and what influenced the images. Maybe 
dropping the specific references helped people see the kind of pure belief that 
was behind all of it. The stained-glass was used to make something that would 
transcend the materials instead of transcending the pop culture reference. But 
my work has always been so private. It's not influenced by a theory." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing for a beat, he adds, "It's more a heartfelt impulse to make things I 
couldn't have, but wanted -- to complete my world somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 * Isermann's current work is on view at the Richard Telles Gallery, 7380 
Beverly Blvd. through April 16. A show of highlights of earlier work continues 
at Sue Spaid Gallery, 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd., through March 30.

GOOD MORNING, VIETNAMESE AMERICANS!; COMMUNICATIONS: AFTER NINE MONTHS ON THE 
AIR, O.C.'S LITTLE SAIGON RADIO HAS BECOME THE SOURCE OF NEWS FOR COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trang Nguyen, president of Little Saigon Radio Broadcasting, barely had time 
to sit down at her desk Tuesday morning before her phone started ringing. It 
would not stop for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports about the Vietnamese American who had gone on a shooting rampage 
at a Santa Fe Springs electronic plant had just hit the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's Vietnamese-speaking listeners wanted to know if the station could 
tell them more about Tuan Nguyen, the Orange County man who had killed three 
people and then himself. Reporters for mainstream media also were on the line, 
asking if Little Saigon Radio could provide additional information for their 
own coverage. Even tearful relatives and friends of the victims called in, 
seeking advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it has been on the air for a mere nine months, Little Saigon Radio has 
become an influential voice in Vietnamese-American affairs throughout Southern 
California at a time when debate over U.S.-Hanoi relations has intensified 
here. The station provides news, a platform for debates on issues and community 
service information. 
</P>
<P>
 Its emerging, multifaceted role was not planned by station founders -- not to 
mention completely unanticipated by skeptics -- when the idea of the first 
extensive Vietnamese-language daily broadcast in Southern California was 
bandied about this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a bold move to start a daylong radio program, especially since 
other, shorter Asian-language programs on the radio at the time were not very 
successful," said Nghia Tran, executive director of the Vietnamese Community of 
Orange County, a nonprofit social service organization. Tran, like many others 
in the expatriate community, had politely dismissed the program's chances of 
success when Trang Nguyen initially asked his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow, against all odds," he now marvels, "it has become an institution, a 
medium which Vietnamese -- those who are not acculturated as well as those who 
are fluent in English -- can turn to for help and information." 
</P>
<P>
 Stroll through almost any store in Little Saigon during business hours any day 
of the week, and chances are that if the radio is on, it is tuned to KWIZ-FM 
(96.7), Little Saigon Radio. Broadcast entirely in Vietnamese, the program 
features music; local, state, national and international news; commentaries and 
talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the station supplies news that Vietnamese Americans from 
Orange County to parts of Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley normally 
can't find or understand in the English-language media. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of need for information in the Vietnamese community, and 
people trust us," Nguyen said. "We're journalists. We're professionals. But our 
listeners also know that we want to extend our hands instead of just doing a 
job. It's not a cliche: We are a community service." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, however, charge that the program at times shows an 
anti-Communist bias in its coverage of Vietnam and the local community. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Co Pham, the president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce who has 
received death threats for openly supporting the normalization of diplomatic 
ties between the United States and Vietnam, cited as an example the September 
demonstration in front of his office -- the first major story broadcast by the 
station since it began airing on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest began with one man staging a hunger strike in the parking lot of 
Pham's Westminster practice and grew into a crowd over two days that totaled 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham alleges, and some others in the community privately concur, that by 
allowing demonstrators to get on the airwaves to ask for participants, Little 
Saigon Radio unduly helped fan the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were only a few hundred anti-Communist protesters at my office several 
months ago but they said on the air there were several thousand," Co recalled. 
"Then their announcer urged listeners to go join the protest. So several hours 
later there were several thousand people. That's irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon Radio said it was merely doing its job by reporting the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Viet Dzung, the morning disc jockey who broadcast the event live, denied he 
encouraged listeners to protest. But "even if I did," Dzung said, "if Dr. Co is 
in the right, if what he does is for the good of the community and not his own, 
then I could have screamed my lungs out for people to show up and protest and 
no one would have come." 
</P>
<P>
 His boss, Nguyen, is just as unabashed. She and other board members of the 
private corporation were disappointed, she admitted, when President Clinton 
ended the economic sanctions against Vietnam last month which allows the two 
former enemies to conduct commercial business. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the critical months to come while the U.S. government mulls over 
whether to renew diplomatic ties with Vietnam, Nguyen said, the station's 
broadcasters will continue to advocate that normalization should only occur 
when human rights and democracy for the Vietnamese are restored. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also will invite those who support normalized relations with Vietnam 
onto the program to present the other side, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen pointed out that in the interests of balance, the station has been 
willing to risk losing advertisers who oppose the ending of economic sanctions. 
For example, the program last year interviewed Nghia Nguyen, an economist who 
works for the World Bank and who favors the lifting of the embargo. Following 
that interview, employees of the station fielded calls and letters from angry 
anti-Communist callers, some threatening to bomb the station, Trang Nguyen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not have supported (the economist's) viewpoint," she said, "but we 
were not going to suppress it either." 
</P>
<P>
 The station "can't tell the listeners what to think about anything," Nguyen 
said. "They will make their own decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Other criticism of Little Saigon Radio has less to do with station's politics 
and more with the broadcasters' ethnocentric approach. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Vietnamese American followers of the station claim that broadcasters 
seem to promote ethnic elitism during the morning and afternoon drive-time talk 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent example, some said, were the closing comments earlier this week by 
Viet Dzung after an on-the-air interview with a witness to the Santa Fe Springs 
shootings. During his address to the listeners, asking Vietnamese to unite in 
the aftermath of the tragedy, the disc jockey labeled mainstream media coverage 
of the shooting as "distant, cold." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they (the media) don't intend to do so, but it seems that because 
they're looking at this tragedy through the eyes of someone not a part of this 
community, they're searching for some reason to blame the tragic shootings on 
something relating to the Vietnamese community as a whole," Viet Dzung said on 
the air Tuesday, a day after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued: "We all know it's not so. . . . The community should show its 
unity by comforting relatives of the victims. . . . We need to show those who 
are not a part of the community that we care for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the broadcasters' practice of "complimenting" the potential 
audience and many of the guest speakers, said Yen Do, editor of the 
Westminster-based Nguoi Viet Daily newspaper, "the listeners get this image 
that our community is all good and we're the victims of the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
 For every critic, Little Saigon Radio owners said, there are thousands of 
listeners who value their program and the community voice it has indisputably 
become. 
</P>
<P>
 When the station first went on the air, the corporation formed by Nguyen and 
three partners had attracted only only five advertising accounts after weeks of 
soliciting. Three weeks into the program, the station had filled all its 
advertising air time. It now has about 200 advertisers with new accounts lining 
up every day, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost the partners, including Nguyen's husband, $150,000 to launch the 
station. They had hoped to be in the black within six months; they reached that 
goal within three. Nguyen declined to discuss the station's profitability 
because of future potential competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The program began with nine hours of daily air time, Monday through Friday. 
Today, it broadcasts from weekdays from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. Sundays. The station, now with 60,000 to 70,000 listeners, is in the 
process of negotiating for Saturday air time. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their reservations about the program, even the critics agree that 
Little Saigon Radio offers many Vietnamese Americans some degree of belonging, 
something mainstream media probably could never match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lessens the stress of homesickness in our community," Dr. Co Pham said. 
"The station gives Vietnamese people a sense of pride in our heritage." Do, the 
editor, added: "It's really given our community a sense of focus. Now, any time 
people have questions or comments, they call up the station." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the occasion for Chi Pham of Garden Grove, whose fiance, Chin Nguyen, 
was one of the three people shot to death last week at Extron Electronics in 
Santa Fe Springs. (None of the Phams or Nguyens in this story are related.) 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the shooting, when official information was still scant, Chi 
Pham frantically called Little Saigon Radio for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's going on," she tearfully told Trang Nguyen in Vietnamese. 
"I don't know who to turn to for information on what happened to my fiance. I 
don't speak English very well. Please help me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen told Pham what the station knew, what Pham couldn't understand in the 
English-language media, and helped calm her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know who else I could trust to give me some information," Pham said 
later in an interview. "The radio was my only link." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon Radio started out as a business venture and as an attempt at 
become a voice where one has not existed before for the Vietnamese community in 
the Southland, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now realize that whether we want to or not, we have become something a 
little bit more -- something like some sort of a leader, I guess" she said. "I 
don't think we could ever live up to that expectation because we are 
journalists, after all. All I can say is I hope we can do our part in 
strengthen the sense of the Vietnamese community."

FROM O.C. TO D.C., IT'S DOWNHILL ALL THE WAY; POLITICS: WASHINGTON INTRIGUE 
DISMAYS, DISGUSTS JANICE JOHNSON, THE WIFE OF A TOP CLINTON APPOINTEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton tapped Roger W. Johnson of Laguna Beach to head the 
General Services Administration last year, it was with the idea that the Orange 
County businessman would help reinvent government by eliminating waste and 
trimming expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Janice -- reluctant to leave her position here as a prominent social 
and arts fund-raiser, but anxious to join her husband -- moved to Washington 
eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, an angry and disillusioned Janice Johnson returned to Orange County 
to visit friends and lashed out at what she feels is a back-stabbing political 
climate that is trying to reinvent them . 
</P>
<P>
 "The harassers on Capitol Hill can all go jump in the Potomac," she said in an 
interview with The Times while her husband was in Sacramento on government 
business. "When I flew into Orange County on Monday, I thought 'Oh boy, what a 
sight for sore eyes, why in the devil did we ever leave?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Johnson was reacting to recent allegations that her husband, the 
Administration's highest ranking Republican -- had misused tax-supported travel 
funds to visit his Laguna Beach home. Questions were raised about five of the 
nine official trips he scheduled during his first seven months in office. She 
was also upset that certain members of Congress and their staff, whom she 
declined to name, have told her husband they "would get him" because they are 
unhappy about his cost-cutting tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the trips, she said: "One time the President asked him to come. Once, Al 
Gore asked him to come. He came home when I told him I was evacuating our house 
during the fires and he paid for that trip. During two other trips, he 
conducted a lot of GSA business. He has done absolutely nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Roger Johnson asked the GSA's inspector general to examine his 
travel records and vowed to reimburse the government for any expenses deemed 
questionable. In the meantime, the agency's chief financial officer issued a 
memo that Johnson's "actions were consistent with federal travel regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 Of threats about his cost-cutting measures, she said: "What has happened is he 
has taken a lot of the pork barrel away. That has prompted at least three 
congressmen to threaten him with, 'I'm going to get you,' which really means, 
'send you back where you came from.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Roger says, 'You know who your friends are in Washington, because they 
stab you in the chest instead of the back.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, isn't it funny that they are looking at his travel expenses, instead of 
looking at all the money he has saved the taxpayers? They don't seem to care 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We left Orange County because Roger really thought he could make a 
difference, help change things, and he is. But they -- the far left wing and 
the far right wing -- don't want change. It's too threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ongoing politics and their frustration at the slow-moving process, 
the couple plans to remain in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess Roger and I were very, very naive. Very naive. We're a little 
disillusioned. But, it's un-American to let the bad guys win, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we'll stick it out. As long as the President wants Roger, as long as he 
can make a contribution. If it comes to the point where he can't, where the 
congressional committees won't let him, then we'll come home." 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy with President Bush's seeming disregard of the country's economic 
woes, the Johnsons in 1991 joined forces with other Orange County Republicans 
to support Clinton, long before the Arkansas governor made his official bid for 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he took office, Clinton appointed Johnson, formerly chief executive 
officer of Western Digital Corp. in Irvine, to his post. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Johnson said the forces aimed at toppling her husband are also aimed at 
the Clintons. They are being attacked via the Whitewater controversy because, 
she believes, Clinton has brought popular issues to the fore, with promising 
results. Clinton has fought for a crime bill, Hillary a health care package. 
"They have taken all of the good ammunition away from the Republicans," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's power harassment and very distracting for the President. Can you imagine 
what it's like? How can he go into a meeting, say with Hussein, and not be 
thinking about it? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole attitude in Washington that you're guilty until proven 
innocent. Maybe they (the Clintons) should have been more up front about it, 
said, 'Here's what it is, take it or leave it,' but I don't think they realized 
they were" not being forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clintons were sent to Washington as a mandate for change and that's the 
last thing anybody -- the insiders -- in Washington wants. They (insiders) are 
more interested in the power and the process because the process takes so long 
and involves so many jobs." She has watched in disbelief as members of the 
Administration have dropped by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such an old boy's club here -- a generation that's about a half a 
generation older than we are -- that control the Congress. They're men and they 
just can't wait to get her (Hillary)." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Johnson has had ample opportunity to become acquainted with the First 
Lady. She has dined with her in the First Family's private quarters. And it was 
Janice Johnson who helped organize a lunch for Hillary Clinton during a 
campaign swing through Orange County. From the moment they met, Johnson has 
been impressed by Hillary Clinton's sincerity and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hillary is extremely bright and capable," Johnson said. "She wants to get her 
health care, or some health care package, through. Talk about powerful lobbies. 
Look at all of the people she's threatening with these changes." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Johnson said she thought about trying to unseat Rep. Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who is running for reelection this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I toyed with the idea," said Johnson, who is known here for her 
organizational ability. But she has put the dream to bed. "Not after being in 
Washington for eight months," she said with a sardonic smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pragmatically, the only way I could win would be to run as a Democrat. 
(Janice Johnson is now a registered Democrat; her husband remains a 
Republican.) There's no way I could have beat him in a Republican primary. With 
the money he's got? No way I could have done it. Plus, I would have had to move 
to that district. It would have been tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she has been appointed by the President to serve on the Committee 
for the Preservation of the White House. Jane Alexander, chairwoman of the 
National Endowment for the Arts, has invited her to join the National Symphony 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was vetted (evaluated) by the White House, though it's not official yet. 
And the symphony position has not yet been ratified," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, she has helped Alexander find artwork for the offices of 
Cabinet members. "We're calling it the Art on the Walls Project," she said. 
"Atty. Gen. Janet Reno wanted some art, (HUD secretary Henry G.) Cisneros 
wanted some. I've had a good time with that. All of a sudden I am more into the 
visual arts than the performing arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, Janice Johnson has been welcomed to Washington with open 
arms. "One of Hillary's assistants has made sure I have met people. She has 
paved the way, made it easier for me. There are some really good people in 
town."

HIGH-POWERED FUND RAISING IS PAYING OFF FOR BROWN; CAMPAIGN: BUT RIVALS FAULT 
PAST PRACTICE OF TAKING MONEY FROM THOSE DOING BUSINESS WITH TREASURER'S 
OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few politicians are as prodigious at fund raising as state Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown, now on a quest to become governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown -- no slouch himself when it comes to raising 
campaign money -- speaks of her as a "fund-raising machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Over evening cocktails or morning coffee, at $500-a-plate lunches, in 
cross-country calls from her car phone, at gala banquets, Brown tirelessly uses 
her charm, family connections and disarming directness to perform a job that 
some politicians view with disgust -- raising money, lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not afraid to ask the question," said Brown's East Coast fund-raiser, 
Susan Torricelli. "She is able to say directly to people, 'I need money from 
you.' She can do it on the phone and do it in person. Many people are 
uncomfortable doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The result: After three years of fund raising, Brown has more cash -- $5 
million -- than incumbent Republican Gov. Pete Wilson or either of her 
Democratic rivals, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom 
Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson and Garamendi have found plenty to criticize in the treasurer's 
fund-raising performance. In particular, their campaigns fault Brown for money 
she has raised from investment bankers and others who do business with her 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown denies that the contributions have influenced her decisions as 
treasurer, and she stopped taking money from the investment bankers last year. 
By that time, she had collected more than $800,000 from employees of bond 
houses and attorneys with law firms that oversee the sale of billions of 
dollars in state bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of Brown's fund-raising records and interviews with dozens of her 
contributors show the broad reach of her fund-raising efforts and the varied 
reasons donors have for giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her contributors are traditional Democratic interests, such as labor 
unions and trial lawyers, eager to end 12 years of GOP control of the 
governor's office. There are also friends and appointees of her father, former 
Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., and brother, ex-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr. She also has received contributions from Hollywood figures such as actor 
Kevin Costner and entertainment mogul David Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more significant, perhaps, is a nationwide network of women, many of them 
professionals, who would be happy to see a woman become chief executive of the 
nation's most populous state. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from the list, for the most part, are large corporate donors and trade 
organizations. But these will come later, Torricelli said, if Brown can win the 
Democratic primary and emerge as a possible winner in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep in mind, if not now, but post-primary, any smart business entity is 
going to give to both sides if both sides look plausible," Torricelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contributions from those who have done business with the treasurer's 
office are proving to be an irresistible target for Brown's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, spokesman for the Wilson campaign, said: "There is an overall 
pattern of firms receiving bond business from Kathleen Brown's treasurer's 
office after having contributed to the Kathleen Brown campaign. (The campaign) 
recognized it, and moved to correct it, albeit after three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said that Brown's acceptance of those contributions is different from 
Wilson's taking payments from major California industries that have interests 
in matters on Wilson's desk. "The governor of the state of California has 
responsibility direct or indirect over almost every aspect of life in this 
state," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown refused to be interviewed on fund-raising issues, but her aides 
emphatically deny that she has ever allowed a contribution to influence a 
decision as treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contracts (to bankers) do not follow contributions," said Brown campaign 
spokesman Michael Reese. "Firms that gave considerable amounts in many cases 
got very little business. Firms that gave little or no contributions got quite 
a lot of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Reese argued, Brown was the first state treasurer in the country to 
stop taking contributions from those that do business with her office. 
</P>
<P>
 But before cutting them off, records show, Brown built a solid foundation of 
cash to launch her campaign and convince potential challengers that she was the 
Democratic front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1992, Brown stopped accepting checks from the investment banking 
firms that package sales of state bonds. But she continued to take sizable 
contributions from individual investment bankers who worked for the firms. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in 1993, charges of improprieties began to erupt in states including 
New Jersey, where aides to the former governor are under investigation for 
allegedly improperly benefiting from bond sales. "We wanted to step out from 
the shadows cast in those states," Reese said. "At that point we extended the 
restrictions to individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Brown cut these sources off, in July, 1993, she had accepted 
$450,000 from the bond houses and their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop the list is First Boston Corp. and its bankers, who gave Brown $52,750 
since she became treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest single contributor, with $10,000, was First Boston's chief 
executive, Archibald Cox Jr., now managing director of Tiger Management Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said his contribution had nothing to do with First Boston's business 
dealings with the treasurer. "I did it purely myself because I think very 
highly of her." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of her self-imposed rule, Brown also has been refusing money from the 
law firms hired to provide the required legal opinions on bond sales. But she 
continues to take contributions from individual attorneys with those firms. In 
three years in office, she has collected more than $350,000 from attorneys with 
the law firms she does business with. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these is the law firm where she once worked as an attorney, O'Melveny & 
Myers. In the past three years, O'Melveny and its attorneys have given her 
$52,900. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is like family, one of us," said Gilbert Ray, the O'Melveny lawyer who 
oversees the firm's donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray said he has never felt pressure to contribute from Brown or any other 
politician. "We have never had a politician infer that there was a 'pay-to-play 
system,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's gubernatorial campaign has also taken more than $50,000 from waste 
disposal companies, utilities and other firms that benefited from bond sales. 
And she continues to accept checks from employees of securities firms and law 
offices that do business with the state's massive pension funds -- the Public 
Employees Retirement System and the State Teachers Retirement System. As 
treasurer, Brown serves as a trustee for both systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign spokesman Reese said that in these cases, Brown is only one member of 
a decision-making board or commission -- in many cases sitting side by side 
with representatives of Wilson and state Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's fund raising extends far beyond those with whom her office does 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 She has held fund-raisers at the homes of Sen. Jay Rockefeller in Washington, 
and financier Jerome Kohlberg in rural New York state. She appeared at a 
two-for-one event in New York City with Texas Gov. Ann Richards -- netting 
$90,000 for each campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards also appeared at a series of fund-raisers in California for Brown -- 
attracting 4,000 contributors who paid more than $500,000 to see them in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has followed Richards' example in reaching out to women, who provide a 
significant part of her support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early money is like yeast," Brown has repeated to early backers -- quoting 
the signature phrase of EMILY's List, a national organization dedicated to 
electing women to public office. Over the past two years, the group has 
collected an estimated $400,000 for Brown from individual contributors 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasurer also has shown an ability to connect in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Beatty introduced her at a $1,000-a-plate dinner at the Beverly Hilton 
Hotel in December and told a story about the time the two went out on a date. 
The yarn was apocryphal, but the event was a success, taking in more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Many supporters open their homes for dinners or receptions. Last year, Brown 
stopped in on 50 smaller events each raising at least $10,000, said campaign 
finance director Ann Hollister. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Brown also is tapping into traditional Democratic Party 
stalwarts such as organized labor. Her critics charge that Brown only captured 
labor backing after she reversed her early support for the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, a pact opposed by much of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half of last year, when Brown was supporting NAFTA, her union 
donations were lagging. After her reversal, the contributions started rolling 
in -- $240,000 in the second half of the year, quadrupling what she had taken 
in during the first half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollister, Brown's fund-raiser, attributed the increase in labor contributions 
to the seasonal nature of fund-raising efforts, and not to Brown's stand on 
NAFTA. "It's reflective of the campaign for governor heating up at that point," 
Hollister said. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, Brown contributors give a range of reasons for sending checks 
to her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Some donors are longtime Democrats who see her as the hope for unseating 
Republican Wilson. A number enjoy rubbing shoulders with political luminaries. 
Some say they just like Brown personally. And several wanted to discuss 
specific issues with a possible future governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Magazine publisher Stephen Adams, chairman of the Affinity Group, gave Brown 
$12,500 and then was introduced to her at an intimate dinner last month, 
arranged by a business associate -- a high school classmate of Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Between courses at a Los Angeles restaurant with the treasurer and her news 
executive husband, Van Gordon Sauter, Adams was able to voice his concerns 
about the high cost of workers' compensation insurance, which has forced him to 
shift jobs out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expressed my view," Adams said. "I don't think she had many arguments with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meal, Adams sent the campaign a check for another $12,500. There are 
no limits on the size of contributions in state races. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the Brown campaign has organized a group of 40 women, 
each pledged to raise $25,000 before the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the members of this women's campaign cabinet is lawyer Roberta Bennett, 
a lesbian activist who has raised $60,000 by filling tables at various 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said she wants "more appointments for the gay and lesbian community," 
more funding to combat AIDS, and a review of ROTC programs on college campuses 
in the state, which "are discriminating against gays and lesbians in violation 
of university and college bylaws." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has not given her a commitment, but does hear her out on these and other 
issues, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Hedges, who runs a law firm in Downtown Los Angeles and contributed 
$10,000 to Brown, explained why many of his legal colleagues are contributing 
to Brown: "Part of your cachet as a lawyer is that you can say to a client, 
'Let's get Kathleen on the phone.' " And he observed that "a lot of lawyers 
want to be judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Kathleen Brown's donors are friends of her father, or were appointees 
of her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 One such supporter of Pat Brown is Fred Furth. A Northern California lawyer, 
he owns the Chalk Hill Winery and was counselor to Democratic presidential 
candidate George McGovern. He was not a fan of Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me you're not just a retread of Moonbeam," Furth recalled telling 
Kathleen Brown in their first conversation. "What hurt Jerry was that he was an 
antiseptic person." 
</P>
<P>
 Furth became convinced when the new Brown told about her three children, a 
divorce, and her career as a lawyer. He has given her $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Her largest single contribution came from John and Rebecca Moores of Sugar 
Land, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown met the couple through Mark Caddell, a Houston lawyer she saw on a 
fund-raising jaunt through Texas. A trustee of the Democratic National 
Committee, Caddell concluded that Brown has "the potential to have national 
stature." He wrote her a check for $5,000 and promptly introduced her to the 
Mooreses. 
</P>
<P>
 John Moores made his fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine at more than $400 
million, by founding BMC Software Inc., in Sugar Land. He is retired and 
devotes much of his time to philanthropic pursuits. The couple own a home in 
Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Mooreses gave Brown a ride to one of her appointments on their 
private plane. At the end of the flight, they "pulled out a checkbook and wrote 
out a check," Caddell said. The amount: $105,000. The Moores could not be 
reached for comment about why they gave her the money. 
</P>
<P>
 A future story will examine the fund raising of gubernatorial candidate John 
Garamendi. Kathleen Brown's Top Contributors

AS U.S. LEAVES, SOMALIA BRACES FOR ROUGH TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the edge of Medina market, about a block from the perimeter of the main 
military compound America is leaving behind, Mahmoud Mohamed sat at a battered 
metal table, selling the last of the American garbage that has fed his family 
and tens of thousands of others for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the leavings of U.S. military MREs -- Meals Ready to Eat. They have 
fueled a booming street market in Medina during the 15 months in which Mohamed 
and his fellow merchants bought them from the back of Somali garbage trucks 
that hauled the trash for an American force that once numbered more than 20,000 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final few hundred troops began heading home this month -- including 
about 225 who departed Saturday -- Mohamed's prices were soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Marble cake in an olive-drab tin went for $1.10. A tiny bottle of Louisiana 
Hot Sauce was a quarter, and a miniature packet of applesauce fetched 30 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prices of everything are going up now that the Americans are leaving -- 
no more supply," Mohamed said, noting sadly that his stand is among the last of 
dozens that once supported thousands of Somalis. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows what will happen now," he added. "But everyone is afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 As Mohamed prepared to close up shop, it was clear that America was leaving 
behind far more than garbage and soaring prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of deepening anarchy, growing street violence and enduring irony swirled 
around him. A car was hijacked in a firefight just down the street within sight 
of a U.N. military checkpoint. Later, Pakistani and Egyptian peacekeepers a 
mile or so away fired wildly at the sound of a single gunshot. A Somali boy was 
killed in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijackings have become a daily event. Looting is rampant. Renewed fighting is 
breaking out among rival clans in several pockets in the countryside. And 
dozens are dying throughout the country from a serious new outbreak of cholera. 
</P>
<P>
 In the capital, Somalis who had learned to survive on contracts with the 
Americans and the European armies that are following them out of the U.N. 
peacekeeping operation now are settling labor disputes with mortar rounds, land 
mines and death threats. Every night before the Italian troops pulled out of 
the city two weeks ago, gunmen attacked their north Mogadishu stronghold. They 
were hired by a man whose father was killed by the Italian troops months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 These are foreboding images of Somalia's uncertain future, U.S. and U.N. 
military commanders say. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of the Pakistani brigade that is inheriting the lead role in the 
less ambitious, largely Third World U.N. military operation that will continue 
to serve here for as long as another year conceded that Somalia's immediate 
future inevitably will be one of increased anarchy, banditry, roving gangs, 
armed roadblocks and street protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the jobs these people had with the Americans will be gone now," said 
Brig. Gen. Saulat Abbas. "They will become more desperate. Banditry, looting -- 
they already are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not going to be a cool, calm and sweet place to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Abbas confirmed that the 20,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping 
force currently under Malaysian command intends to largely sit back in heavily 
defended camps and checkpoints and watch -- the result of a Security Council 
decision to take a more defensive posture. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the Security Council mandate that American and U.N. commanders used to 
hunt Mogadishu's most powerful warlord, Mohammed Farah Aidid. Gone are the 
wanted posters and the $25,000 reward for the former Somali general who eluded 
a two-month, high-tech search by America's most elite military squad, the U.S. 
Army Ranger special forces. Aidid has in fact emerged at center stage in 
U.N.-sponsored negotiations to end the two-year civil war that left Somalia 
with no government, no law, few leaders and little hope. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, diplomats and U.N. military officers said, some signs of progress 
in the political effort to reunite Somalia's warring clans. There also has been 
a burst of small-scale commercial activity throughout the capital -- from 
international telephone-call offices to thriving, open-air movie theaters -- in 
the aftermath of President Clinton's decision to help rehabilitate the image of 
the warlord who tormented the United Nations and whom Clinton's advisers once 
viewed as the principal source of Somalia's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the heart of the potential nightmare the Americans are leaving behind 
is the simple fact that it remains little different from the nightmare that 
greeted the U.S. Marines when they hit the beachheads of anarchic Mogadishu in 
Operation Restore Hope more than one year and several billion dollars ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, based on interviews and images gathered during the final days before the 
scheduled departure of the last U.S. soldier by Friday, is a tapestry of a 
nation still a shambles, still deeply divided, and of the U.N. force that 
remains -- which is concerned as much with its own safety as with the 
still-remote goal of rebuilding Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The battered old donkey carts line up beside their owners early each morning 
at the water well outside Mogadishu's shelled and gutted Polytechnical 
Institute. By sunrise, there are hundreds of them. Hundreds more follow 
throughout the day. And most are like 30-year-old Hassan Hussein, a camel 
herder who fled the Somali countryside for the capital more than two years ago 
when his herd was slaughtered by clan militias during Somalia's brutal civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein and the others make several trips a day to the water pump, where they 
pay 50 cents each time they fill their 200-liter oil drums with water. They use 
their donkeys to deliver them at a daily profit of $2 to families throughout 
the city -- the only water source these days for much of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in some ways, typical of the new grass-roots industries that have 
sprung up in the capital since the United Nations took command of the Somalia 
mission. But the donkey-cart brigade symbolizes more than the Somali 
entrepreneurial spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, Somalis themselves said, living testimony to the potential nightmare 
the U.S. military is leaving behind. And the very need for the water brigade -- 
15 months after the United Nations announced it restored full water service to 
a city with no other basic services -- illustrates the many frustrations and 
failures in the aftermath of the U.S. mission. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in fact, just a few days after the Marines hit Mogadishu's beachheads 
Dec. 9, 1992, that U.N. Development Program officials here proudly flipped the 
switch at the capital's main water source, climaxing their five-month effort to 
provide water to all parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Now entire neighborhoods of the city have been without water for weeks. Others 
receive it for just a few hours a day. Almost every Somali in the city is 
complaining about water shortages. But U.N. officials said just recently that 
they were unaware of a water problem in Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 The UNDP's acting resident representative, Larry De Boice, whose agency is 
still funding and overseeing the water project out of its meager $10-million 
annual budget for Somalia, said the main pumping station is still operating 
fine. And he said he knows of no widespread shortages in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In the donkey-cart line at the Polytechnical well, however, which is just a 
few hundred yards from the UNDP's walled-in headquarters, the explanation was 
simple and basic to Somali society past and present: looting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spreading lawlessness that began when the Western troops withdrew from 
town, Somalis have punched holes in pipes throughout the city and diverted 
water for private sale. Others have dug up and stolen the pipes and sold them 
on the open market. One Somali businessman told of a neighbor who mistakenly 
sold the pipes that provided water to his own house. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a problem that is deep inside us now," said Somali businessman Hirei 
Gassem, who opened a new hotel near Mogadishu's international airport on March 
12. "The problem is, you cannot create only one project and say the job is 
done. You must create a number of projects at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "You, the United Nations, the United States, you come from another place. You 
cannot understand what we are thinking. Until we settle the banditry, the 
looting mentality, until we settle and employ these people, we haven't done 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general feeling is that there will be more of this when the Americans 
leave. More chaos. I don't deny that. But I feel that the people now are tired 
of war. They are fed up. They are ready for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 When the leaders of the United Somali Women's Assn. gathered under the banner 
"Long Live International Women's Day" at Hirei Gassem's new 10-room Quality Inn 
a few days ago, they too wished to speak only of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to the thought of many that there is going to be war when the 
Americans leave, it's going to be very peaceful," said the organization's 
founder, Hawa Mohamed Ossoble, before the daylong women's meeting began. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is different now than when the Americans came. Really. Even the clans, the 
warlords and their militias, they are all tired now. They don't have the 
finances they did before. We are confident we can unite now." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Ossoble spoke, another International Women's Day rally was forming 
across town. It was organized by rival clans, and even Ossoble conceded: "These 
are factional groups that recently formed. We hope we can come together with 
them. We are in this process now. We are, after all, the easiest social sector 
to unite." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is not only the women of the clans who remain deeply divided after 
a civil war left 300,000 dead and a U.S.-led U.N. operation did little to 
reunite them. Nor are the women the only ones who are attempting to resolve 
their differences. U.S. and U.N. officials who are trying to play a catalytic 
role in that reconciliation have effused an almost universal optimism in recent 
weeks over the latest peace efforts by leaders of the best-armed Somali 
militias and their parallel political factions. 
</P>
<P>
 They cite in particular what they call a new flexibility and moderation on the 
part of Aidid, whose militia fought a brutal war with the United Nations that 
left hundreds of Somalis and dozens of American and Pakistani peacekeepers 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an October attack by Aidid's militiamen on U.S. Army commandos that led 
to the U.S. decision to pull out this month. The Rangers were the cutting edge 
of a U.S.-sponsored U.N. hunt for Aidid, who managed to evade the elite 
commando operation for weeks. President Clinton abruptly abandoned the 
Administration's lead role in the hunt after Aidid's militiamen killed 18 U.S. 
soldiers in the Oct. 3 firefight and his supporters dragged dead Americans 
through Mogadishu's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just five months later, U.S. officials are treating Aidid as a 
respectable political leader central to peace in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Aidid) is more moderate than he ever was," said Richard Begosian, the 
senior U.S. diplomat in Mogadishu, who functions as American ambassador to a 
nation with no government. "And it's hard for me to imagine any kind of 
stability that doesn't make room for Aidid." 
</P>
<P>
 Political developments on the ground early this month, however, gave few 
Somalis reason for hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of Aidid's diplomatic advances, leaders of the 12 clan-based political 
groups that have fought Aidid met two weeks ago in Cairo at a gathering 
sponsored by the Egyptian government, which Aidid considers a sworn enemy. 
There his rivals agreed to establish a government with a revolving presidency 
-- a plan Western analysts said could not succeed without Aidid's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Aidid boycotted the Cairo meeting. A few days later, his supporters in 
Mogadishu rejected the plan. Aidid remained in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, 
where he has spent most of the last several months negotiating with various 
clans, apparently in an effort to form a government of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "These leaders in Cairo, they will establish a government. Aidid is in Nairobi 
also establishing a government," said former Somali Maj. Gen. Mohamed Nur 
Galal, who joined Aidid to lead the overthrow of Somali dictator Mohamed Siad 
Barre in 1990 but broke with him when the civil war began after a similar 
Egyptian-sponsored conference appointed a rival clan leader president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have two governments at the same time. And again it will be 
civil war. It's much better, I think, to have no government than (to have) two. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is all about power. Aidid just wants power. The group of 12 wants 
power. If I were them, I wouldn't have struggled so hard for it. Whoever 
becomes president of Somalia, he is just an unlucky man." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the ruins of Mogadishu, Gen. Aidid's palatial villa is ready and waiting 
for his return. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year after it was reduced to rubble by American AC-130 gunships 
and Cobra attack helicopters -- punishment for the massacre of 24 Pakistani 
peacekeepers by Aidid militiamen on June 5 -- the warlord's house has been 
fully restored. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a fresh coat of whitewash on the compound walls. The national flag, a 
single white star in a field of blue, is in place, with a new addition for 
Aidid's Somali National Alliance: the Koranic phrase, "God is great. Mohammed 
is the messenger of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Another addition mirrors the uncertainty that prevails outside Aidid's 
compound: For the first time, every window is covered with thick iron burglar 
bars.

STATE ALLIANCE GIVES WORKERS HEALTH CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty thousand workers at small California businesses will get an 
extraordinary piece of good news on Tuesday: At a time when health insurance 
costs are climbing by 6% to 8% a year, their premiums will actually be reduced 
for the year starting July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 These fortunate few are members of the state's unheralded health alliance, a 
purchasing agency that gives companies with five to 50 workers an opportunity 
to band together and achieve the same buying clout in the health care market as 
giant corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as President Clinton's proposal for alliances covering every citizen is 
being denounced in Washington as a blueprint for a menacing new bureaucracy, a 
staff of just 13 state workers in Sacramento has put together a working 
alliance, the first in the nation. And its customers seem delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was heartbreaking to want to get insurance for your workers and not be 
able to afford it," said Cynthia Chauvie of Van Nuys, whose 
precision-instrument repair firm was once quoted an impossible $2,500-a-month 
premium for its seven workers. Last July she joined the new state health 
alliance, and now she pays $780 a month for the whole office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great relief to have coverage now for all of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, formally called the Health Insurance Plan of California, offers 
something never before available for employees of small companies: a wide 
choice of different insurance programs, with workers -- not management -- 
making the selection. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, for example, a worker whose small company has joined 
the HIPC can choose among 15 plans -- 12 health maintenance organizations and 
three preferred provider organizations -- including such well-known names as 
Kaiser, Aetna, FHP, Healthnet and Prucare. That differs dramatically from the 
conventional situation in which the company makes available one or perhaps two 
health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 All plans must offer the same benefits, but the doctors and hospitals are more 
desirable in some than others. Monthly fees range from $84 to $173.14 for a 
25-year-old worker and from $342.80 a month to $674.44 for a 35-year-old 
employee with a spouse and children. The company must pay an amount equal to at 
least half of the cost of the lowest-priced plan; the worker pays the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get one monthly bill whether you have 13 employees in one health network 
or in 13 different networks," said Diane Bourassa, office manager for 
Telenet-works, a software firm in Petaluma. "It's a great variety of choices 
and avoids a tremendous administrative load on small companies like us, where 
typically you have one person running the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Rates are 10% to 15% below many comparable plans in the conventional insurance 
market, according to a recent study by a HIPC board member. The reason: 
Providers are willing to offer discounts to gain access to as many as 40,000 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no mystery here," said John Ramey, the HIPC's executive director. 
"We're trying to get a large-volume deal for our small employers." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Florida will become the second state to try voluntary alliances when 
it begins enrolling small businesses in a voluntary purchasing group called the 
Community Health Purchasing Alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 The California and Florida experiences may offer some direction for the 
increasingly bitter national debate over health care reform. Clinton's plan is 
being torn apart in Washington by partisan Republicans and skeptical Democrats, 
with enthusiastic lobbying by businesses large and small. 
</P>
<P>
 California and Florida officials are betting that their voluntary approach 
will be a giant step toward Clinton's goals of providing insurance protection 
for everyone while controlling the soaring costs of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 By offering wide choice and low prices, they hope to woo enough businesses to 
make significant inroads in the ranks of the uninsured; among the nearly 40 
million Americans without coverage, about 80% are full-time, low-wage workers, 
their spouses and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton wants to require all employers to offer insurance and pay 80% of the 
cost of an average-priced plan. He also wants to require everyone except 
workers in firms with more than 5,000 employees to enroll in health alliances 
that would negotiate on their behalf with insurance companies, health 
maintenance organizations and other networks of health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of a compulsory national program of alliances made it easier for all 
factions in Florida -- businesses, insurers and politicians -- to work together 
for a voluntary program. Gov. Lawton Chiles said he was grateful that the 
President's plan prodded everyone to get down to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida officials say they hope to get prices down simply by publishing the 
bids offered by insurers to small firms through the alliance. Side-by-side 
comparisons will make businesses aggressive in seeking better deals and force 
the high-priced insurers to bring their prices down, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what we do in Florida will send a message to the nation," said Lynn 
Kislak, chairwoman of the alliance for Dade County. "The wonderful thing 
Florida has is choice." 
</P>
<P>
 But California took a bigger step: Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature decided to give the health alliance real muscle 
by granting it the authority to negotiate rates with insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first set of bids came in last year, the HIPC gave the companies 48 
hours to lower rates -- and many of them did. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the HIPC board will approve its second rate schedule: the figures 
covering 40,000 people from 2,300 employers for the 12 months starting July 1. 
The HIPC will announce that the average insurance premium will decline in 
price, a testament to the negotiating skills of the organization and the 
desires of the insurance companies to crack the important small-group market. 
</P>
<P>
 The average company now enrolled in the HIPC has 10 workers. Companies with as 
few as four employees will be able to join as of July 1, and the threshold will 
drop to three a year later. About three-quarters of the employers in the HIPC 
bought their coverage through insurance agents, a fact that has made agents 
friendly rather than antagonistic toward the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 HIPC membership should double in the coming year and could grow even faster as 
word spreads, Ramey and his staff estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the competitive impact of the HIPC is being felt in the rest of 
the state's sprawling insurance market, where companies are offering more 
choices and trying to slow the rate of increase in premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The HIPC is the "standard by which every other health plan's offerings and 
prices are compared," said Mark Weinberg, executive vice president at Blue 
Cross of California, which covers 5 million Californians and dominates the 
small-group market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, we are having to be more competitive than ever to compete with 
the HIPC," he said. It was "no coincidence," he added, that a slowdown in 
California insurance inflation began last July when the HIPC opened for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the decade, California was grappling with the same thing 
the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who headed the 
Administration's health care reform task force, denounce again and again in 
speeches attacking insurance companies: the specter of sick people crying in 
vain for help and uninsured families ruined by costly medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Many insurers engaged in "cherry-picking" -- insuring the healthy but not 
those who were likely to face big medical bills. This meant seeking out firms 
with young, educated workers in white-collar jobs and giving them bargain 
rates. If their medical bills were higher than expected, insurers' rates would 
go up or the firm's coverage might be canceled without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industries were to be avoided. Insurers didn't like to write policies for 
restaurants because many cooks, busboys, waiters and waitresses were 
transients. They avoided lawyers because they might sue and doctors because 
they would demand a lot of high-cost care. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing this problem, the California law guarantees that no individual or 
company could be refused coverage for any reason. Any insurance product must be 
available to all customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiums may vary with the age, family composition and geographic location of 
the insured. An insurer may ask a 60-year-old to pay more than someone who is 
30, a married woman with three children to pay more than a single woman, and a 
resident of Los Angeles, where medical costs are high, to pay more than someone 
who lives in Ukiah. 
</P>
<P>
 But insurers may make only small adjustments in rates to compensate for 
different health conditions. If the cost of insurance for a typical group of 
five people is $100 a month, the insurer cannot charge more than $120 for a 
group of five people in which two have cancer, two have heart disease and the 
fifth suffers from diabetes. A group of four marathon runners in perfect health 
cannot get a rate lower than $80. 
</P>
<P>
 These ground rules enable the HIPC to avoid becoming the dumping ground for 
companies with sick workers who couldn't get coverage elsewhere. The HIPC's 
aggressively low rates and broad selection of plans make it attractive for 
healthy as well as high-risk groups of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At LG2WB Engineers in Costa Mesa, for example, the $8,000-a-month premium 
under the HIPC represents a savings of as much as 20% from the firm's old 
insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of choices is welcome, if a bit intimidating; Marilyn Hall, the 
firm's vice president, says the 45 workers have enrolled in 11 networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some employees come to me and say: 'Which one should I choose, Marilyn.' I 
say: 'If you have a doctor, find out which network he belongs to.' Once they 
understand it, people love the choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the HIPC, Steve Levine, who owns an ad agency in Venice, got several 
calls a week from people trying to sell him insurance. "I would tell them I'm a 
diabetic who had a kidney transplant, and the phone would go 'click,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid $1,000 a month for insurance for the four workers at his agency, plus 
$1,500 out of his own pocket for special drugs to ensure that his body did not 
reject the kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a monthly bill of $851 from the HIPC covers both Levine and his employees 
-- and drugs are part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has kept down costs and avoided building a new bureaucracy by hiring 
a private firm to act as the HIPC's sales agent, record-keeper and 
administrator. Employers Health Insurance won the contract and collects a fee 
for each person enrolled. The company started with 15 sales representatives and 
now, anticipating a boom year, has 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have forced the market to respond," said Kirk Rothrock, executive vice 
president of the HIPC, talking about the alliance's influence far beyond the 
comparatively small number of people enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance backers in Florida agree. "You don't measure success by the number of 
small businesses they insure but by the impact they have on the market," said 
Bill Hirrle, a Florida business lobbyist. "You invent them to bring health care 
prices down." 
</P>
<P>
 The alliances ultimately could fall short of bringing insurance to everyone. 
After all, they are voluntary and employers remain free to refuse to spend 
money on health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of the HIPC's enrollees already had coverage elsewhere; only 
one-quarter come from the ranks of the uninsured. California still has a 
staggering 6.3 million uninsured people under age 65, and 83% of them are 
workers and their dependents, according to Richard Brown, director of the UCLA 
Center for Health Policy Research. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will need a national health care plan to complete the job," Chiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said he is confident the voluntary approach will make progress in 
his state, "I don't want to second-guess the President" on the call for 
mandatory coverage and compulsory alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got my hand to play and he has his," he said. How the Health Alliance 
Works 
</P>
<P>
 * Who may participate? Firms with five to 50 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * What does it offer? Statewide, a choice of 15 health maintenance 
organizations and three preferred provider networks. Twelve of the HMOs and all 
three PPOs operate in Los Angeles; fewer are available in other parts of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 * What do the HMOs cost? For workers in the standard plan, co-payments of $15 
per doctor's office visit, $100 per hospital admission and $10 per generic drug 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 For workers in the preferred plan, co-payments of $5 per doctor's office 
visit, no co-payment for hospital admissions and $5 for generic drugs and $10 
for brand names. 
</P>
<P>
 The HMO pays if it refers enrollees to outside specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Maximum out-of-pocket cost per year: $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for 
families under both plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * What do the PPOs cost? A 20% co-payment for office visits to network doctors 
and hospitals and 40% to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 For workers in the standard plan, a $500 yearly deductible per person. 
</P>
<P>
 For workers in the preferred plan, a $250 yearly deductible per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription drug co-payments of 20% for generics and 30% for brand names. 
</P>
<P>
 Maximum yearly out-of-pocket payments of $2,000 per person and $4,000 per 
family in the network, and $5,000 per person and $10,000 per family outside the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 * How can I sign up? Call your insurance agent or the HIPC directly at 
1-800-447-2937.

U.S. TO URGE SANCTIONS FOR N. KOREA; STRATEGY: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS MEET 
AFTER PYONGYANG OFFICIAL STORMS OUT OF NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS WITH SEOUL. CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION ALSO WILL PURSUE JOINT MILITARY MANEUVERS WITH S. KOREA.

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, shaken by the acrimonious breakdown of nuclear 
disarmament talks between North and South Korea, on Saturday decided to pursue 
measures ranging from U.N.-imposed sanctions against the North to massive joint 
military maneuvers in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's national security strategists huddled at the White House 
for about three hours after a North Korean negotiator threatened to turn Seoul, 
the South Korean capital, into a "sea of fire" as he stormed out of talks on 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "If circumstances don't change by Monday, (Operation) Team Spirit will be 
rescheduled," a White House official said in a reference to the annual 
maneuvers by U.S. and South Korean military forces. The exercises were canceled 
earlier this month in an attempt, now clearly unsuccessful, to smooth relations 
with the Marxist regime in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to send Patriot missile defense systems to South Korea have also been 
revived, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 These actions could come after the International Atomic Energy Agency board of 
governors meets Monday in Vienna and censures North Korea, as expected, 
Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the North-South talks and Pyongyang's continuing refusal to 
permit full international inspection of its nuclear facilities spurred the 
United States in its decision to ask the U.N. Security Council to impose 
economic sanctions against Kim Il Sung's hard-line regime. 
</P>
<P>
 High-level officials of the Pentagon, State Department, the U.S. mission to 
the United Nations and the CIA met at the White House with National Security 
Adviser Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meeting was to review the situation in light of the meeting between North 
and South Korea," the White House official said. "They discussed a whole range 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
 In the border village of Panmunjom, North Korean delegate Park Young Su pulled 
out of preliminary talks, aimed at making the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free 
area, after only 55 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seoul is not very far from here. Seoul will turn into a sea of fire," Park 
was quoted by South Korean negotiator Song Young Dae as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 With its million-member army and formidable arsenal of missiles and artillery, 
North Korea is a daunting foe. U.S. officials say the regime, one of the most 
isolated on the globe, is dangerously unpredictable. Although U.S. military 
planners are confident that South Korea, with American help, would ultimately 
prevail in any conflict, there is no doubt that a North Korean attack would 
cause substantial casualties and would damage South Korea's burgeoning economy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 36,000 American combat troops in South Korea, most of them stationed 
near the border, where they would come under fire in the first minutes of any 
renewed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest crisis began after North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, touching off fears that it was trying to produce 
nuclear weapons. Last month, in the face of threatened U.N. sanctions, North 
Korea agreed to permit IAEA inspectors to visit its nuclear sites. But earlier 
this month, the Pyongyang regime prevented the inspectors from doing their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 In Panmunjom, Park, the North Korean delegate, refused to even discuss South 
Korean demands that North Korea permit the inspections. Seoul also proposed an 
exchange of high-level envoys between the bitter foes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you act like that, collision is inevitable and war is unavoidable," the 
North Korean was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The North's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo by the 
Associated Press, blamed South Korea for the breakdown and warned that North 
Korea would "take a decisive self-defensive measure" if sanctions are imposed 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mean what we say," it added. 
</P>
<P>
 With North-South tensions growing steadily worse, Seoul dropped its opposition 
to the U.S.-South Korea military maneuvers and to the deployment of Patriot 
missiles. Seoul had sought to block both measures in an effort to build 
goodwill with its northern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Clinton told reporters at the White House that North Korea could 
end its isolation and become part of the world community by agreeing to 
inspection of its nuclear facilities.

JAPAN'S ENERGY PLAN MAY FUEL SPREAD OF PLUTONIUM; ASIA: NEW REACTOR COULD BE 
FIRST STEP IN MAKING JAPAN SELF-SUFFICIENT. BUT CRITICS SAY IT AIDS NORTH 
KOREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While the world struggles to block North Korea from building atomic bombs, 
Japan is pursuing a plutonium energy program that critics say undermines such 
anti-proliferation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 A prototype "fast breeder" plutonium nuclear reactor is set to begin operation 
next month in an isolated coastal valley near this old Japan Sea fishing port. 
It is the first in a planned series of plutonium-fueled reactors that could 
eventually make Japan virtually self-sufficient in energy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program gives North Korea an excuse to pursue its own production of 
plutonium, which seems intended for nuclear arms -- an issue of top concern to 
the Clinton Administration. Washington has been trying, without notable 
success, to block that Communist state's effort through International Atomic 
Energy Agency inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-line Pyongyang regime claims its research is peaceful but charges 
that Japan's effort aims at stockpiling plutonium for possible weapons use. 
Tokyo vehemently denies this charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics at home and abroad say that even if Japan's intentions are 
entirely peaceful, in a world trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, it 
is simply too risky for anyone to build this kind of reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeder reactors not only use plutonium as fuel but also convert uranium into 
more plutonium than they consume. The main attraction of the technology is that 
this newly created plutonium can be concentrated and itself used as fuel in a 
continuing cycle that holds hope for almost inexhaustible energy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But plutonium is a far more dangerous substance than uranium -- the fuel used 
in most nuclear power plants in Japan and abroad. Plutonium is intensely 
radioactive, and in the concentrations needed for breeder reactors, it is 
directly usable as the raw material for atomic bombs, which is not the case for 
other kinds of nuclear reactor fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The new government-owned research reactor near Tsuruga will provide the first 
test of an energy strategy conceived in the 1950s. Plans call for progressively 
larger facilities to be built until the program reaches fruition in the 2030s 
with construction of economically viable plutonium power plants. If all goes 
well, Japan could also export the technology to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. government policy toward Japan's program is ambiguous. Washington has 
never exercised its power, as a supplier of uranium to Japan, to directly block 
the drive to build plutonium-fueled energy plants. But embassy officials here 
have consistently opposed their development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our basic policy, for quite a few years, is that we've been against it," said 
a U.S. diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We are trying to 
discourage the Japanese on plutonium." 
</P>
<P>
 The major immediate problem, this diplomat said, is that Japan's possession of 
large quantities of plutonium makes it all the more difficult to curb plutonium 
production in North Korea. "It's hard to go to North Korea and say, 'You can't 
do this,' when Japan does have a very active program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also some fears that Japan itself might someday make nuclear 
weapons, as well as concerns that terrorists or agents of renegade nations 
could raid Japan's stockpiles to get material for bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the George Bush Administration, the diplomat said, another embassy 
official "tried very hard to get the State Department involved in telling the 
Japanese we're very much against this. But politically it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is unlikely to abandon its program, he added. "Energy security is an 
important part of their national policy," he explained. "If you have your own 
breeder reactor program, you certainly wouldn't need outside energy sources." 
</P>
<P>
 The use of plutonium in a "fast breeder" reactor provides Japan a more 
technically advanced option than current uranium-fueled reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 The description "fast breeder" comes from the use of fast-moving neutrons -- a 
kind of subatomic particle -- to breed more plutonium than is used up. 
</P>
<P>
 At the reactor outside Tsuruga, plutonium pellets are now being packed into a 
core surrounded by uranium. Once enough fuel is inserted -- a process due for 
completion in April -- a chain reaction occurs. The plutonium breaks down into 
other elements, giving off heat, which is used for electric power. Neutrons are 
also emitted, striking uranium atoms and turning them into plutonium. The 
280-megawatt reactor is designed to produce 1.2 tons of plutonium for every ton 
it consumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only resource limitation is the availability of uranium -- and enough of 
that exists to keep this kind of process going on a large scale for many 
centuries, long after the world's supply of oil is exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 In acknowledgment of the risks as well as the potential benefits of their 
endeavor, the builders of this first reactor named it "Monju," a Buddhist 
figure symbolizing wisdom, who sits calm and serene in total mastery upon a 
fearsome lion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Monju Buddha controlled the lion with wisdom," said Tadao Aoki, a senior 
official at Monju. "The rest you can imagine: Monju is controlling nuclear 
power with wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
 For partisans of the program, even the unhappy diplomatic fallout over nuclear 
proliferation and a looming global surplus of uranium and plutonium, as Cold 
War weapons are dismantled, are insufficient reasons to stop and rethink the 
plutonium energy strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking perhaps 30 or 50 or 100 years ahead," Aoki said. "We now have 
the problem of plutonium abundance. But that's just a matter of a few years or 
10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, however, fear that the plutonium lion will prove too wild for human 
wisdom to tame. For them, Monju is a symbol of technology gone wild, of 
national pride and bureaucratic inertia leading to danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "A reactor like Monju has some possibility to explode like a nuclear bomb, 
because the density of fissionable material in the core is very high," said 
Jinzaburo Takagi, a nuclear chemist who is Japan's leading campaigner against 
the program. "Also, because it uses sodium (as a coolant), there is some 
possibility Monju will experience a sodium explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki acknowledged that theoretically Monju could explode "if you allow 
everything to be broken" and "an uncontrollable situation happens." 
</P>
<P>
 But in reality, he asserted, such a disaster is not possible because of the 
safeguards built into Monju's design and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Takagi and other critics also say that the more plutonium in the world, the 
greater the chances that some may be diverted to nuclear weapons. "If plutonium 
is bred at our plants, Japan will possess a huge stockpile of plutonium, and it 
will be a proliferation concern to the whole world," Takagi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other countries, including the United States and France -- which has an even 
more technically advanced breeder reactor called the SuperPhenix -- also once 
shared the dream of virtually endless energy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States dropped its breeder reactor plans in the 1970s, but research 
continued. In February, in an effort to discourage plutonium use by the world's 
nuclear industry, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary canceled $112 million worth of 
research into the use of plutonium in nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 "These projects . . . are totally counter to where we want to go in our 
non-proliferation" efforts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 France's SuperPhenix was shut down in 1990 because of the danger of fires 
caused by leakage of liquid sodium. France has decided to restart the plant, 
but observers generally do not expect Paris to resume wholehearted development 
of breeder reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 This leaves Japan as the only country seriously pursuing a plutonium-based 
energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit by practical difficulties and international pressure, the Japanese program 
faces various delays, but both critics and supporters say the commitment of the 
Japanese government to develop this technology has not wavered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federation of Electric Power Companies decided in January to postpone its 
plan to start construction of a second, larger breeder reactor by the end of 
this decade. Difficulty in determining a site and acquiring land were cited as 
the main reason for the delay. The new target date is 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays are nothing new. Monju itself is starting up two years behind schedule 
because of technical difficulties, but that seems not to have cooled the 
enthusiasm of its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the point of view of Japanese energy security policy, it's very 
important to have . . . the technology to produce electricity from plutonium," 
said Yoshikazu Kato, a Science and Technology Agency official. "I don't think 
that basic point of view will be influenced by concerns about proliferation or 
the international situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan may, however, take steps to cool the criticism, Kato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that there is international suspicion that Japan might develop 
nuclear weapons, and Japan cannot just ignore such things," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted, for example, that while work on Japan's first plutonium reprocessing 
plant is continuing, Japanese media have reported that the second plant, 
originally scheduled for completion in 2010, is now expected to be delayed 
about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Such reprocessing plants can extract plutonium either from spent uranium fuel 
from regular nuclear power plants, or from the uranium packed around the 
plutonium core in a breeder reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 Without quite confirming the revised plan, which has not been formally 
announced, Kato noted that because the cost of uranium has not risen as fast as 
expected, construction of commercial fast-breeder reactors may be delayed. This 
in turn would delay the need for a second reprocessing plant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Japan completes construction of its large-scale reprocessing plant -- a 
project that is now under way -- it will remain dependent on reprocessing 
plants in France and England. Under long-term contracts, Japan is sending used 
fuel to those countries for extraction of plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 The first shipment of plutonium back to Japan from France arrived here early 
last year after an international uproar over the voyage of the Akatsuki Maru 
and its 1.7-ton cargo. Its 20,000-mile journey around Africa's Cape of Good 
Hope, past Australia and through the Pacific drew official protests from more 
than a dozen countries. Critics charged the ship could sink and pollute the 
ocean, or perhaps be attacked by terrorists seeking material for nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's reaction prompted new questioning in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the Akatsuki Maru a treasure ship bearing plentiful energy supplies or a 
ship of gloom that will push the world into an abyss of nuclear proliferation?" 
asked an editorial in Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading newspapers.

 Anti-nuclear activists face "a chronic situation of frustration," said Aileen 
Mioko Smith, an American born in Japan who heads a group called "Stop the 
Monju." Most Japanese, she said, "still sort of believe that without nuclear 
power the lights will go out."

REGISTRATION FLAWS MAR SALVADORAN VOTE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Hernandez, a 67-year-old war refugee, tried to retrieve her voter 
registration card three times before today's national elections. Each time, she 
was told the card was not ready, and now Hernandez cannot vote for what would 
have been her first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearby town of Arcatao, Carlos Franco Chavarria, a former guerrilla 
commander, received his voter card a couple of days ago, but his name does not 
appear on the master list. Franco, who is a member of Arcatao's Municipal 
Election Board, does not think he will be allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have put down our guns," Franco, 29, said of the rebels' decision to 
disarm as part of peace accords that ended more than a decade of civil war. 
"Now, our weapon is our voice and our vote, and that is what they are denying 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and Franco are among tens of thousands of Salvadorans -- many of 
them supporters of the former guerrillas -- who cannot vote today because of 
what U.N. peacekeepers say are flaws in the electoral system that will likely 
benefit the ruling right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena). 
</P>
<P>
 The problems have marred otherwise hopeful elections that are seen as an 
important test of El Salvador's efforts to build a peaceful democracy after 12 
years of war between leftist guerrillas and U.S.-backed forces. The war claimed 
an estimated 75,000 lives and sent a million people fleeing to Los Angeles and 
other cities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 2 million Salvadorans are expected to vote for president, all 84 
members of the legislature and all 262 of this country's mayors. These are the 
first elections since U.N.-brokered peace accords ended the war in 1992, and 
the first with full participation of all elements of the political spectrum, 
including the former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front (FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
 The two leading presidential candidates in this still-polarized country 
represent parties known more for their violent pasts than their democratic 
tendencies. Arena's Armando Calderon Sol, the hard-line former mayor of San 
Salvador, holds a sizable lead in polls over leftist legislator Ruben Zamora, 
who heads a coalition that includes the former rebels. But if no candidate 
among the seven running for president obtains a simple majority, a runoff will 
be held between the two top vote-getters. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections will determine the pace of reforms mandated by the peace 
accords, including the formation of a civilian police force and redistribution 
of land to former rebels. Both reforms have been lagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our suffrage we will decide the path over which the next government 
guides the country," President Alfredo Cristiani, whose five-year term is 
ending, said in a nationally televised speech to encourage voters to go to the 
polls. "We will do this with votes, not with guns. We will do this with the 
force of reason, not the absurdity of force." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the people who do not have voter cards live in the Chalatenango, 
Morazan and Usulutan departments, onetime strongholds of the guerrillas and 
battlefields during the brutal war. The rebels, who are venturing into 
mainstream politics for the first time, contend they will be deprived of more 
than a dozen mayoralties because of registration problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important to the long-range stability of El Salvador, analysts 
and diplomats say, the flaws in the registration process have excluded people 
who were told for decades that elections were fraudulent farces that didn't 
matter. For many people who were to vote for the first time but now cannot, the 
elections were an important step in building trust in a democratic system. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have lived outside the electoral system for years," Zamora said. 
"We invite them to participate . . . and then the door is slammed in their 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Zamora nor U.N. peacekeepers are alleging fraud. Because more than 
3,000 observers will be deployed across the country today, the chances for 
massive fraud seem remote and the elections are likely to be the cleanest in El 
Salvador's murky history, U.N. officials say. And those who are now locked out 
the system represent a very small percentage of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite remaining difficulties with the registration of voters and a 
political climate where mistrust among contenders still persists, the condition 
for the holding of free and fair elections are generally adequate," U.N. 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems nevertheless raised tensions on the eve of El Salvador's most 
important elections. The campaign has been bitter at times, with Arena blaming 
the left for the war and the left reminding voters of Arena's reputed 
association with death squads that killed Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980 and 
thousands of suspected leftist sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a U.N. report on registration flaws, about 74,000 people who 
registered to vote were not given cards because authorities could not find 
their birth certificates. During the war, scores of municipal buildings -- and 
the records housed inside -- were destroyed, and efforts to restore the 
documents after the war were slow and incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The number is small in a pool of 2.6 million potential voters and is not 
expected to have an impact on national results. But the FMLN argues that in 35 
municipalities in former war zones, the number of people who couldn't get cards 
because they didn't have birth certificates is enough to defeat the former 
rebels' mayoral candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The FMLN had targeted the municipal level as a priority in these elections 
because it provides entry-level government experience for political novices who 
until recently were warriors. For villagers, the mayor is the most important 
elected official, the one who has the greatest impact on their day-to-day 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 300,000 other people are on the voting rolls but were not given cards, 
without which Salvadorans cannot vote. It is impossible to determine, however, 
how many of these people ran into problems and how many simply never bothered 
to pick up their cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the government agency in charge of overseeing 
elections, says the flaws are purely technical and to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, he who is going to lose tries from the very start to detract from 
the process," tribunal President Luis Arturo Zaldivar said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring U.N. protests, the tribunal also told people in four villages in the 
Chalatenango department that they would have to travel up to 25 miles over dirt 
roads to vote in the departmental capital, also named Chalatenango. The 
tribunal said the villages, including San Jose Las Flores and Arcatao, are 
"ghost towns" without enough people to justify polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The four villages, which dot the hardscrabble hills and valleys in 
northeastern El Salvador near Honduras, are microcosms of the civil war. They 
are largely populated by FMLN supporters and their families, many of whom 
settled in 1986-87 after years of fleeing army bombings. The current mayors of 
the towns, as well as pro-government townspeople, moved to the department 
capital to escape the FMLN, which often executed or kidnaped mayors who didn't 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to force people to vote in the Chalatenango capital appeared to 
favor the pro-government faction and violated electoral law, according to the 
United Nations. It also outraged opposition parties and the residents of the 
villages, who said they would not leave their hometowns to vote and would not 
recognize a mayor elected in the departmental capital. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the villagers announced they were boycotting the elections. On 
Saturday, bowing to a hailstorm of international pressure, the tribunal 
reversed itself and said residents would be allowed to vote either in their 
hometowns or in the Chalatenango capital. 
</P>
<P>
 That may have solved one problem but did not help people like Franco, 
Hernandez and others who could not obtain voter cards or found themselves 
otherwise blocked from voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were enthusiastic at first because . . . we were going to vote to see if 
the country is changing," said Maria Esperanza Ortega, 40, a community leader 
in Arcatao who supports the FMLN. "We have never voted. But now they want to 
set up obstacles."

WAR-WEARY MUSLIMS, CROATS STRIVE TO BURY A BITTER PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps, concedes an aide to the Croatian leadership on the west bank of this 
divided city, local politicians were a bit "overzealous" in proclaiming their 
own state within Bosnia and driving out their Muslim neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mistakes have been made by both sides," allows Tony Vucic, an Australian 
adviser to the self-styled Bosnian Croat presidency that proclaimed the rogue 
state of Herzeg-Bosna and took most of this once-integrated city for its 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Muslim-held east bank, there is a stunning new willingness to forgive 
the majority of Croats, as long as the outside world does not forget those most 
guilty of bringing this centuries-old cosmopolitan society to segregation and 
ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my hope and belief that we will come to a good understanding for all 
people involved," predicts Alija Alikadic, a member of Muslim-held east 
Mostar's war council, in a reference to the peace talks that engendered a 
Muslim-Croat federation agreement signed Friday. "We want a multicultural 
state, and the Croats, except for the extremists, also realize this is the only 
way. As long as a war crimes tribunal punishes the most guilty, I'm sure a 
cosmopolitan Mostar will survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Croats and Muslims only a few weeks ago were blasting each other with 
artillery and fanning the flames of hate, both now take on the same aggrieved 
tones in contending they would never have been compelled to turn on each other 
if the West had intervened to halt the Serbian aggression that tore the former 
Yugoslav federation apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a reconciling couple eager to blame outsiders for their breakup so each 
can forgive the other, the Croats and Muslims of central Bosnia are so 
desperate for a return to peace that they are accepting without question the 
180-degree turn in the propaganda course executed in recent days by their 
respective political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The suddenly softened rhetoric from both sides of the Neretva River that 
divides this once-scenic city has probably been the most powerful inducement to 
the brutalized and exhausted populations to believe their war may really be 
over, their heartaches on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Balkan peoples are like livestock," a 50-year-old Croatian woman says in 
self-derision. "Whichever way our leaders push us, that's where we go." 
</P>
<P>
 The succession of wars that have ravaged the former Yugoslav republics since 
1991 were largely spurred by propaganda and official manipulation of historic 
grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has long been expected that a change in thinking at the top would be 
the only means of bringing the violence to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 How strongly the Croatian leadership in Zagreb and the Muslim-led Bosnian 
government in Sarajevo are committed to making their newly restored alliance 
work remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the groundswell toward peace has taken on its own momentum now, as Muslim 
and Croatian civilians, equally sickened by a war neither side can win, are 
taking their leaders at their word and struggling to ensure an enduring 
reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops from Spain, Malaysia, Britain and Canada are also scurrying to 
take advantage of the current change of heart, corralling both sides' heavy 
weapons to guard against a resumption of artillery shelling in the event of 
some local flare-up along the circuitous and still-volatile front line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are optimistic about the prospects," says Jose Luis Gutierrez, spokesman 
for the U.N. Spanish battalion in nearby Medjugorje. He noted that not a single 
violation of the March 7 deadline for withdrawal of heavy weapons has been 
discovered in this area, which until last week was one of the bloodiest ethnic 
fault lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a change in will on both sides that I think had to come from the 
top," says Kirsten Young, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' security 
officer for the Mostar region. "The two sides have been having discussions 
about all kinds of things, even about people evicted from west Mostar to east 
Mostar being able to go back to the west side for family visits." 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the official message is most obvious among the designated 
mouthpieces: For most of the past year, they have publicly demonized the rival 
population. Now they assert with great sincerity that reconciliation and 
re-integration are the only paths to a secure future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very difficult, but it has to be that way," Bosnian Croat 
military spokesman Veso Vegar said when asked if he expected Muslims and Croats 
to rebuild Mostar without social walls and ethnic divisions. "Time is the only 
cure for what has happened here. But there is a basic human instinct to push 
out of consciousness what has been most painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Distrust remains rampant, and there are signs that not everyone is so keen to 
simply relegate the past year of savagery to the status of a bad memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the cease-fire will stay in effect, but after all the destruction and 
all the terrible things that have happened here, we can't be that optimistic or 
confident," says Alija Behram, director of an underground radio station on the 
east side. His station has kept the Muslim community's pain fresh with daily 
first-person accounts of atrocities committed by extremist Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Behram concedes that the attitude discernible from Sarajevo is one of 
emphasizing the positive and helping people, through balanced media 
presentation, to come to grips with their fears and resentments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to say to everyone, 'Go home, go back where you belong.' But how 
can I say that when I don't know if someone will shoot at them, or who would 
defend them, or what kind of reception they would get from the Croats on the 
other side?" says Behram, who lost his older sister to a Croatian mortar blast 
and has been holed up with his wife, two daughters, younger sister and 
displaced parents in an apartment cellar shared with 16 other refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the voices of naysayers and antagonists are being drowned out by the 
war-weary civilians who, though still suspicious of a peace proclaimed so 
suddenly, want nothing more than a lasting rapprochement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the shelling that reduced east Mostar to rubble stopped a few hours 
ahead of a March 7 U.N. deadline, life has returned to the streets and a 
daylight curfew has been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who had spent months in dank, fetid cellars have turned the shattered 
landscape into new playgrounds, clambering over bullet-riddled cars and 
shell-toppled fountains and monuments. Lovers kiss and soak up the early spring 
sunshine on park benches, seemingly oblivious to the graves that have been 
tucked into the urban greenbelts for lack of space or access to cemeteries for 
the 1,300 of their neighbors killed over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The more Mostar returns to normal -- or as much normalcy as can be salvaged 
from among the ruins -- the more fiercely civilians on both sides will resist 
any retreat to the ethnic bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I've lost everything, all that I worked for throughout 40 years, 
I can't hate anybody for what has happened," insists 59-year-old Alija 
Hadzajlic, a former military college professor who now teaches math and science 
to refugee children. "There are thousands in Mostar who have suffered at least 
as much as I have, and we all have to realize that hatred is not the way." 
</P>
<P>
 On the west side, 19-year-old Croatian waitress Anna Maria Lovric observes it 
will be hard to ever again trust Muslims, who have been unquestionably blamed 
by state-run Croatian media for the Croat-Muslim rift. But she concedes Mostar 
cannot be divided without losing its soul. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to find some way to live together again," she says, expressing 
perplexity over the eviction last summer of a Muslim friend and neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The cessation of shelling and the reduction in small-arms fire to little more 
than a few stray shots each day has given both communities the confidence to 
dare to think they are heading into better days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a calming on the field, and this will force the political 
process," says Albert Benabou, U.N. civil affairs officer for the region. "This 
may be the turning point, although we should be careful not to jump to 
conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate success of the Muslim-Croat reconciliation may depend on moves 
that neither community can deliver, as their new federal alliance within Bosnia 
counts on recovering considerable territory from the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian nationalist gunmen who instigated Bosnia's fighting by rising in arms 
against an April, 1992, vote for independence have seized 70% of the republic's 
territory and have staunchly resisted Western pressures to rejoin Muslims and 
Croats in a new federation or give up some of the occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
 If Muslims and Croats fail to wrest the areas they have been told by mediators 
are rightfully theirs, the frictions that drove them to fight each other for 
what was left of Bosnia could again break the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 But both sides, for now, are putting out a message that there is reason to 
hope for a common future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Croat rebel leader, Mate Boban, was replaced on the advice of 
Zagreb with a more moderate figure, and Bosnia's Muslim president, Alija 
Izetbegovic, has been relegated to a figurehead position by the republic's 
dynamic prime minister, Haris Silajdzic, who enjoys more domestic and 
international support. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. diplomat helping to broker the confederation between Bosnia and Croatia 
said Boban and Izetbegovic carried too much responsibility for the past year's 
fighting in the eyes of the other people and that their retreat to the 
background made it possible for both sides to save face and push a more 
rational policy of reconciliation.

COLUMN ONE; AN UNSUNG 'SCHINDLER' FROM JAPAN; DEFYING HIS GOVERNMENT AND 
WARTIME DANGER, A CONSUL IN LITHUANIA SAVED THOUSANDS OF JEWS IN 1940. HE 
SACRIFICED HIS OWN BRIGHT FUTURE TO WRITE PRECIOUS VISAS THAT GAVE NEW LIFE TO 
MANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The making of the man known as "Japan's Oskar Schindler" started this way: 
</P>
<P>
 At 5:15 on a chilly summer morning in 1940, Chiune Sugihara awoke to the sound 
of a low rumble outside. He was no industrialist, like the German who saved 
more than 1,000 Jews by employing them in his factories, a story captured in 
the movie "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Sugihara was Japan's consul general in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular morning, he peeked outside the curtained windows of the 
consular building and was startled to see the quiet street choked with a crowd 
of more than 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Unnerved and afraid, Sugihara woke his wife and three children and hid them in 
a closet. But when he took a closer look, he saw that the people outside were 
not hostile. They were desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Their eyes were bloodshot. They looked fatigued. There were older men in 
beards and hats, young boys, mothers holding infants. When they saw him, some 
put their palms together in prayerful entreaty. Others, excited, tried to climb 
over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 They were Polish Jews fleeing the encroaching German army, and Sugihara was 
their last hope to avoid the Nazi death camps. 
</P>
<P>
 As war rumbled through Europe, all escape routes from Poland had been cut off 
except a treacherous journey through the frozen hinterlands of the Soviet Union 
via Lithuania. From the eastern port of Vladivostok, the refugees could sail to 
Japan and, from there, try to flee to China, North America or the Dutch colony 
of Curacao. But they needed a transit visa through Japan. So they lined the 
streets, waiting for days, outside the Japanese mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleas presented Sugihara with the kind of searing dilemma that confronts 
few people in a lifetime: a choice between individual conscience and national 
duty, between life and death. To issue the visas, he would have to defy orders 
from his government not to accommodate the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times the 40-year-old official sent urgent cables to the Japanese 
government seeking permission to proceed; three times he was refused. Japan was 
on the verge of entering a military alliance with Germany and Italy and was 
being pressured to cooperate in addressing "the Jewish problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do something," Sugihara told the U.S. military newspaper Stars and 
Stripes a year before his death at age 86 in 1986. "Those people told me the 
kind of horror they would have to face if they didn't get away from the Nazis, 
and I believed them. There was no place else for them to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to look at it from the standpoint of humanity. I could only be fired 
and returned to Japan. What else were they going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to defy his government, a choice that would change his life 
forever. He was in fact fired by the Foreign Ministry upon returning to Japan 
seven years later. Paradoxically, he remained a diplomat during the war, 
serving in various postings. 
</P>
<P>
 For 28 days, from July 31, 1940, until the Japanese government ordered 
Sugihara out of Lithuania to Berlin, the consul general feverishly handwrote 
transit visas. From morning to night, he interviewed one applicant after 
another and wrote one visa after another. He lost weight and grew weak with 
exhaustion. His wife, Yukiko, also suffered from stress; she became unable to 
nurse their newborn son. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sugihara kept writing permits, even after he closed the consulate and 
moved to a hotel for a few days to wait for the train that would take him and 
his family to Germany. He kept writing even on the train, thrusting the 
precious pieces of paper through the window to waiting hands outside. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he managed to write an estimated 1,600 visas, which the Israeli 
government and various scholars credit with saving the lives of 2,000 to 6,000 
Jews. (An entire family could travel on one visa.) 
</P>
<P>
 As the train rolled slowly out of the station, Sugihara bowed deeply to the 
Jewish refugees still crowding the platform and apologized: "Please forgive me. 
I can't write any more. I will pray for your safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Yukiko still recalls the look of shock on the faces of the remaining refugees. 
Nevertheless, as the train pulled away, one shouted, " Banzai , Japan! 
</P>
<P>
 "Sugihara, we will not forget you!" the refugee shouted as he ran alongside 
the departing train. "We will see you again." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the refugees never did see him again. But few forgot him. One who 
remembers is Samuiel Minski, 73, a retired hosiery salesman living in 
Framington, Mass. Thanks to a visa from Sugihara, the Polish native managed to 
escape to Japan with his mother and two siblings and, from there, join his 
father in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minskis braved capture by the Lithuanian police as they crossed the Polish 
border. They took a two-week Trans-Siberian train journey over Russia and spent 
three months in Japan on an expired visa, departing on one of the last boats to 
leave before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Today, Minski is a father of 
three and grandfather of six. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is talking about Schindler, but he used people as slave labor and 
made money off of them," Minski said. "I'm not minimizing what he did, but I 
feel we are forgetting the people who did these acts for pure good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Sugihara didn't get any money for what he did, and he suffered greatly 
for it. If it were not for his generosity and humanity, I am sure I would not 
be here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite official opposition to Sugihara's acts, however, Jewish scholars say 
the Japanese government paradoxically supported Jews because it viewed them as 
rich potential allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The government reportedly even developed an intriguing scheme, known as the 
"Fugu Plan," to create a haven for Jews in Japanese-controlled Manchuria in 
exchange for financial help in developing the region and political influence in 
improving ties with Washington. Like fugu, the famous blowfish that is 
exquisite to eat when properly prepared but poisonous when not, Jews were seen 
as possible allies who could enrich Japan -- or destroy it if not handled 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was never executed -- some people question whether it actually 
existed -- but Japan did continue to admit Jewish refugees into its settlement 
in Shanghai when other nations had closed their doors, and allowed them to 
overstay their visas by months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jews have a debt they owe Japan, at least (for its actions) during World War 
II, regardless of motivation," said David Kranzler, author of "Japanese, Nazis 
and Jews."

<P>
 Chiune Sugihara was born on a day seeming to brim with promise: Jan. 1, 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 The second son among six children, he quickly distinguished himself. His 
intelligence and sense of responsibility caused him to take on many family 
duties normally given to the eldest son. 
</P>
<P>
 When his father, a tax collector, moved to Japan's colony of Korea to work, 
Sugihara supported the family by doing delivery jobs. After the father retired 
and began running a Japanese inn, the family joined him in Korea. There, the 
young Sugihara saw his father take in impoverished Japanese even though they 
couldn't pay, while his mother cleaned their clothes and hair of lice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugihara proved an ace at foreign languages, entered Tokyo's elite Waseda 
University and, at age 19, went to study Russian in Manchuria. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, he entered the Foreign Ministry. For the next two decades, he would 
teach Russian, work as a translator and be posted to Lithuania, Berlin, 
Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European stations. 
</P>
<P>
 He married a Russian woman in Manchuria, said his sister, Ryuko Nakamura, who 
lived with them. They divorced about 10 years later, and Sugihara married 
Yukiko, whom he met on a visit to Japan. Sugihara was a ladies' man -- a source 
of many marital arguments -- and he loved to dance, play the piano and violin, 
throw parties and play mah-jongg. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, his choice to help the Jews probably shattered his career and his 
dream to become an ambassador to Russia. When he returned to Japan in 1947, he 
was abruptly fired. Yukiko says he was clearly told it was because of the 
insubordination in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foreign Ministry, however, denies any connection and says he was laid off 
because of Allied orders to streamline the bureaucracy. The fact that he was 
given full retirement benefits indicated it was a normal layoff, said Muneo 
Suzuki, a former Foreign Ministry official who investigated the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugihara was reduced to peddling light bulbs, working as a translator for 
international radio broadcasts and running the PX operation for the Allied 
Occupation Forces, a job he considered beneath his dignity, said his son, 
Hiroki. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, he returned to Moscow with a trading firm and stayed there 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 When he went back to Japan in 1975, his family life was in disarray because of 
his long absence. "There was never a sadder life than his," his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hiroki said his father was not disappointed at all and felt he had 
achieved much. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly half a century, Sugihara's case remained virtually unknown in his 
country, although Israel gave him its version of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Yad 
Vashem Prize for Righteous Gentiles, in 1985. A tree was planted in his honor 
near Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 No such laurels were bestowed upon him in Japan. Part of the reason was 
Sugihara himself: A modest man, he did not tell even his siblings about his 
heroic deeds in Lithuania. Nakamura, his sister, read about it in the 
newspapers four decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nation that honors obedience to authority more than individual 
conscience, Sugihara's acts were not viewed as particularly honorable by many 
top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Masamichi Hanabusa, then consul general in New York, appealed to the 
Foreign Ministry to bestow official recognition on Sugihara before a visit by 
the Japanese foreign minister to Israel that year. Hanabusa wanted to improve 
Japan's relations with Israel and the United States, and present the image of a 
Japanese humanitarian. But his faxes were never even acknowledged, said Suzuki, 
who at the time was the ministry's second-highest official. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Suzuki, a politician then serving as the Foreign Ministry's 
parliamentary vice minister, to wrench open the case over the objections of 
reluctant bureaucrats. He was preparing to make Japan's first visit to the 
newly independent Lithuania, and, for better or worse, Sugihara still remained 
the most famous and important Japanese official there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to restore his honor," Suzuki said. "He was a magnificent person who 
did an act of great humanitarianism and courage." 
</P>
<P>
 But top Foreign Ministry officials vehemently objected, saying restoration was 
unnecessary since Sugihara was never dishonorably dismissed. Suzuki spent three 
days persuading them to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzuki met with Sugihara's family in October, 1991. Although he did not 
apologize for Sugihara's firing, he did express regrets for ignoring the family 
for five decades and officially praised Sugihara's acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wrong for him to violate the orders, but it was an honorable act to 
save the lives of human beings," Suzuki said. Shortly thereafter, then-Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa praised Sugihara in a Parliament hearing -- but also 
stopped short of an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the case has begun receiving broader public attention. The 
Education Ministry recently approved a textbook that presents his case for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Fuji Television Co. produced a docudrama about the case, "Visas 
for Life." The program is attracting attention in the United States as well, 
where Boston University communications professor Robert Barram is spearheading 
efforts to circulate the film among colleges, libraries and study groups and 
broadcast it on both local television and PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Sugihara say he would squirm under the limelight, for he 
believed he had done nothing extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were human beings. They needed help. I'm glad I found the strength to 
give it to them," he said in a 1985 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a Japanese, this is a natural thing to do."

VENTURA RIVER FACES MODERN-DAY THREATS; ENVIRONMENT: DEVELOPMENT AND POLLUTION 
ARE THE TWO PRIMARY DANGERS IN AN INCREASINGLY URBAN WORLD.

<P>
 In a rugged mountain canyon five miles northwest of Ojai, Allen Carrozza's 
home near the edge of the rushing Matilija Creek is the most peaceful refuge he 
has ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I drive that last five miles to my house, and I don't see any sign of 
human presence, I feel like I'm going to a timeless, ageless place," Carrozza 
said. "If you don't know how to meditate, you can go sit on a rock anywhere in 
Matilija Canyon and nature will teach you." 
</P>
<P>
 A few canyons to the east, Wheeler Hot Springs -- a wooded complex of secluded 
hot tubs and an elegant restaurant -- sits on the edge of the North Fork of the 
Matilija. Lanny Kaufer and his family built their business here on the tranquil 
trickles and cascades of canyon streams. 
</P>
<P>
 But like its sister creek to the west, the North Fork can be transformed into 
a raging and deadly torrent in the winter. And Kaufer has spent more than 20 
years watching the river's dramatic mood swings. 
</P>
<P>
 "An untamed river can have such destructive power," said Kaufer, whose family 
owned the resort from 1968 until last year. "When it really gets moving, you 
can feel the boulders hitting each other as they roll down the river." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matilija forks are the largest of four major tributaries that feed the 
16-mile-long Ventura River, one of the few remaining mostly natural rivers in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The river provides water not only for families like Carrozza's and Kaufer's, 
but also for entire communities, farmers, fish and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Ventura County's largest river, the 100-mile-long Santa Clara River 
to the east, is now the subject of a large multi-agency task force working to 
plan its future, the Ventura is less-known and, some say, less appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Santa Clara and every other river that winds through increasingly 
urban terrain in Southern California, the Ventura River is at constant risk of 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Threats to its health and existence lurk along the length of its banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some originate in the past, buried like time bombs in the historic Ventura oil 
fields that line the river's path. Just last week, state wildlife officials 
revealed a previously-undisclosed spill by Texaco of 370,000 gallons of toxic 
oil byproducts near the river. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials suspect that the gas condensate may have leaked into School 
Canyon Creek near Ventura Avenue and flowed into the Ventura River during heavy 
rains in January, 1993, -- the biggest oil-related spill in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 But threats to the river are not confined to the past. They come also in a new 
county plan for more houses, a proposed golf course and possible industrial 
development. They come from pesticides and pollution fed by everything from 
storm drains along the river's path to a homeless camp where it meets the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 And they also include the diversion of the river's waters to a multitude of 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River and its tributaries already have four major dams and more 
than 100 wells that siphon off water below ground. Now -- in one of the most 
serious threats to the river's future -- the city of Ventura is considering 
increasing its diversions, possibly taking all the surface water during dry 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five hundred years ago the Ventura River was one of a whole bunch of lovely 
Southern California rivers," said Cat Brown, U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist. 
"Today, it's one of a handful." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything in nature is important, Brown said. But some things, such as 
rivers, are essential to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "To lose any of the natural habitat in Southern California would be like 
cutting off your hands," she said. "But losing rivers and wetlands would be 
like cutting out your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River really begins in the headwaters of its 52 miles of 
tributaries, up above Carrozza's house, beyond Matilija Dam, over the hill from 
Wheeler Hot Springs at a place called Dry Lakes Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Matilija forks originate in the mountains of Los Padres National 
Forest. They are the largest and steepest tributaries in 226 miles of watershed 
that drain into the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 The forest is in many ways the river's savior. It helps keep the water clean 
and cold enough to support fish and wildlife, and it offers open space for 
wildlife to roam, forage and hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose love for animals is reflected in the nickname "Cat" that she uses 
for Cathy, has learned about the Los Padres by hiking its trails, sleeping 
under its sycamores and studying its creeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of Southern California's last huge tracts of essentially native 
habitats," she said. The forest is what enables the Ventura River corridor to 
remain so rich and vibrant with life, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wildlife habitat is only as valuable as what it is connected to," she said. 
"You can have a perfect postage stamp of great habitat, but if it's surrounded 
by development, it's worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 Even during extreme drought, the two Matilija forks run year-round, fed by a 
constant flow of runoff from the mountains and their springs. And like the 
Ventura River itself -- which floods dramatically about once a decade -- the 
tributaries are dangerous when swollen with intense rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "These rivers are incredibly powerful and incredibly violent," Brown said on a 
recent visit to the river. 
</P>
<P>
 As an osprey flew overhead with a newly caught fish in its mouth, Brown 
paused. "That's really cool," she said, and returned to the topic. "They are 
sleepy little dry stream beds 10 months out of the year and for two months, 
they are sheer hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozza has seen that hell firsthand. By day, he commutes to Ventura to make 
a living selling solar energy, and by night, returns to remote Matilija Canyon, 
where 50 families find peace along the creek and look the force of nature in 
the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen it rolling boulders the size of Volkswagens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the streams are steep and cut through mountainous terrain, they carry 
large amounts of sediment downstream and into the Ventura River. When rains are 
heavy, the sediment fills in low spots and redirects the river -- constantly 
moving the river's historical course. 
</P>
<P>
 The confluence of the two Matilija creeks about four miles northwest of Ojai 
marks the beginning of the Ventura River proper. And about 10 miles downstream, 
San Antonio Creek and Coyote Creek join the flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Thacher, who runs Friends Ranch at the confluence of the two Matilija 
forks, grew up on a stream that feeds into the San Antonio. The otherwise 
tranquil San Antonio cost people their homes and one woman her life when it cut 
a new course during the big floods of 1969, Thacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thacher grew up at Thacher School, founded by his grandfather on Horn Creek, 
which the county now calls Thacher Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "That little creek caused a lot of trouble, too, in 1969," Thacher said. "And 
now that people have built more houses up there, they are trying to keep the 
creek in a little channel." 
</P>
<P>
 He wishes them luck in the next big storm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The seasons and rainfall that periodically transform the river's gentle flow 
into raging waters will always be the dominant force over the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 But human intervention -- with dams and diversions and development -- has 
altered the river's dynamics, some say irrecoverably. 
</P>
<P>
 Before there were dams on the river and its tributaries, the Ventura River was 
a trout fisherman's paradise, where the limit for steelhead was 50 a day, 
according to a 1912 newspaper article. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Ventura residents such as Manny Paquette, who retired as assistant 
fire chief for the Ventura County Fire Department in 1964, remember those days 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fishing season opened on May 1, people would flock to the Main Street 
Bridge and cast their lines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tradition. It was like the county fair -- when it was smaller. 
Everyone talked about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the drought of the 1930s. It dried up the river and the Ojai 
Valley, leaving crops to parch in the sun. After the drought came a devastating 
flood in 1939, one of the most damaging in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 The people needed a way to irrigate crops as well as control catastrophic 
floods. The result was the Matilija Dam, built in 1948. It was a massive 
200-foot high concrete structure that spanned the creek in a concave curve 
about 600 feet across. It was designed to hold 7,000 acre-feet of water, enough 
to supply 14,000 families for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam, which stopped up the flow of the largest tributary of the Ventura 
River, allowed a five-mile pipeline to bring a reliable water source to Ojai 
and area growers for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, the water was spread out to replenish underground water basins. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kept the wells in the Upper Ojai flowing and saved the orchards up 
there, and saved the whole Ojai Valley from burning up," said Kenneth Johnson, 
a newcomer to the Ventura River valley in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 But many complained at the time that the dam was doomed from the start. 
Johnson's wife of 64 years, Liz Johnson, said her family was among those who 
opposed the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad thought it was put in the wrong place and that it wouldn't hold," Liz 
Johnson said. "A lot of people didn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's father turned out to be right. The dam, which engineers now say was 
built of poor-quality concrete, was declared unsafe in 1964. Soon afterward, a 
30-foot notch was cut into the dam to reduce the amount of water it would hold. 
</P>
<P>
 And after heavy storms in 1969, 1978 and 1992, the dam accumulated so much 
debris that its capacity was further reduced. Now, it barely holds 1,000 acre 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Paquette objected to the dam for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam was an insurmountable obstacle for the steelhead trying to swim up to 
the far reaches of the Matilija to spawn, and it ruined the once abundant 
steelhead run up the Ventura River, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Matilija Dam came, there was no fishing anymore," Paquette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Matilija Dam's inadequacies, the federal Bureau of Reclamation 
and the Ventura River Municipal Water District soon went to work on a new means 
to capture and store water, which led to creation of Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau built Casitas Dam on Coyote Creek in 1958, flooding area farms and 
forming Lake Casitas. The Santa Ana Creek's flow was also directed into the 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau also built a diversion dam across the upper Ventura River to siphon 
some of its flow into the lake. The small Robles Diversion dam about two miles 
south of the beginning of the Ventura River proper was built the same year as 
Casitas, further blocking the steelhead from making their way upstream. 
</P>
<P>
 To connect the river diversions to Lake Casitas, a concrete canal was built. 
It wound its way for five miles through open space and pastures, to its 
destination at Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was objection to the Casitas Dam too," said Liz Johnson, who spent much 
of her girlhood on the Santa Ana Ranch, which was flooded by Lake Casitas. Many 
landowners whose property was condemned by the government and flooded by the 
lake contested the plan. In addition, she said, "people said it would never 
fill up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matilija Dam and Robles Diversion dam, which sailed through the scant 
regulatory process more than 25 years ago, might have faced a different fate if 
they were proposed today, said Alex Sheydayi, manager of the Ventura County 
Flood Control District, which owns Matilija Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matilija, was the first large dam constructed in the county, and the 
people of the area, including the Board of Supervisors, were naive about the 
engineering challenges associated with constructing such a piece of work, 
Sheydayi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That dam was sold to the Board of Supervisors by a hotshot consultant from 
Los Angeles for a certain amount of money and it cost considerably more," 
Sheydayi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose and intent was fine," he said. "But I suspect that people in this 
county were pretty green when it came to this kind of issue and were sold a 
bill of goods." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Had he been more than a child at the time, biologist and university lecturer 
Mark Henri Capelli might well have been at the head of the line making sure 
everyone understood the full effect of a project such as the Matilija Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the advent of environmental regulations of the 1970s, the rivers 
would have had some measure of built-in protection they did not have 20 or 30 
years ago, Capelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those regulations included the California Environmental Quality Act, which 
spawned the requirement for environmental impact studies, and the federal 
Endangered Species Act, which protects the habitat of animals threatened with 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura native who has spent his off hours for the last two decades working 
to save the Ventura River from a variety of assaults, Capelli first became 
aware of the river's need for protection as a student at Ventura High School in 
the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was running cross-country and noticed the Caltrans maintenance yard on the 
river, where a bunch of oil had accumulated at the outfall," he said. Capelli 
wrote a letter to then-Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent him a jar of the stuff and asked him what he would do about it," 
Capelli remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing came of the letter, Capelli said. He finished college and graduate 
work in history and science at UC Santa Barbara, where he now teaches. He later 
received another graduate degree at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, he was appointed to the Ventura County Fish and Game Commission, 
which advises the Board of Supervisors how to spend money collected locally 
from fish and game violations. Capelli and fellow commissioners wrote the first 
government-sponsored report on the river. 
</P>
<P>
 After issuing the report, Capelli and other commissioners created the Friends 
of the Ventura River. He has been its voice ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "That report says the same thing we say now," that the river is at risk from 
pollution and development, Capelli said. "It was the first crude attempt at 
finding the issues and solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli and the Friends have battled on many fields since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The group won a fight 20 years ago to force the Ojai Valley Sanitary District 
to upgrade the quality of treated sewage discharged into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends also helped thwart plans in 1989 to build a state university on 
Taylor Ranch west of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli said the university would have brought too much development to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also helped kill an idea to build a mobile home park in the river 
flood plain just south of Rancho Arnaz in the Ventura River valley. That plan, 
proposed in the early 1970s, would have brought pressure on public officials to 
build new flood-control works on the river in the area, Capelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli and the Friends also helped shape the development of Emma Wood State 
Beach just west of the mouth of the river, which was originally planned as a 
large RV park. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would have paved over an important wetlands area, Capelli said. He 
helped get the plan scaled back to include only day-use camping and use by 
organized groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Friends of the Ventura River have also lost some of their skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early 1970s, after an ammonia refining plant closed down near the 
river, Capelli and the Friends were working with the county to buy the property 
and convert it into a park. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a private company said 'We think we can make this live again,' and the 
Board of Supervisors decided not to purchase the property," Capelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Petrochem refinery operated on Ventura Avenue from 1974 to 1984, when the 
refining operation was discontinued. Petrochem still stores oil on the property 
-- a lingering concern to environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Since oil was discovered along Ventura Avenue in the 1920s, oil field wastes 
and drilling muds were routinely dumped into the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that problem was corrected with the advent of environmental 
regulations in the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But oil field operations, some still in use and some capped and abandoned, 
still pepper the hills above Ventura Avenue. And although the industry is 
careful about its discharges, accidents are bound to occur, Capelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent example was last week's disclosure of the 370,000-gallon 
Texaco spill. The California Department of Fish and Game and the Ventura County 
district attorney's office led a raid on Texaco offices along Ventura Avenue 
last week after a year-long investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just illustrates how important it is to protect the whole watershed," 
Capelli said. "We can protect the channel itself all we want, but if we are not 
careful about what drains into the river, we don't have much of a resource." 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue wasn't pollution in the longest and most important of the 
battles waged by Capelli and the Friends of the River. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 10-year struggle against the city of Ventura and the Casitas Municipal 
Water District, the issue was the river itself -- how much of its water could 
be diverted for human use. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Robles dam was built in 1958, Casitas Municipal Water District was 
required to let pass through the dam the first 20 cubic feet per second of 
water, which amounts to about 40 acre feet per day, or about 14,600 acre feet 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 When less water than that was flowing down the river, Casitas diverted no 
water. That guaranteed downstream users such as the city of Ventura and others 
along the river, a minimum supply of water. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came an agreement between Casitas and the city, negotiated in the 
1970s and signed in 1983, in which Ventura agreed to allow Casitas to take all 
of the water on condition that Casitas would sell the city a guaranteed amount 
of water, even during drought. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement could have taken the last drop of water from the river during 
dry periods, Capelli argued. He geared up for what turned out to be the longest 
battle of the Friends' history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fundamental," he said. "It's pretty hard to have a river without 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of the River, employing the Environmental Defense Center, sued the 
city and Casitas to stop the so-called low-flow diversions, looking to 
Patagonia Inc. for $4,000 in financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Yvon (Chouinard, owner of Patagonia) in the parking lot one day and he 
asked me how much we needed to fight this battle," Capelli said. "He had a 
check cut that same day." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle concluded in 1988 when the California Supreme Court refused to hear 
an appeal, letting stand an appellate court ruling that required Casitas to 
allow the first 20 cubic feet per second of water to pass down the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a turning point for a lot of reasons," Capelli said. "It stopped the 
diversion of low flows from the river. But just as important, it convinced the 
state and local officials that the Friends were a force to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli said it also forever changed people's ideas "about what they could get 
away with on the river." 
</P>
<P>
 After that battle, everyone was tired of fighting over water, Capelli said. So 
he began work on a study on the plant life in the river. The study, in 
cooperation with UC Santa Barbara, turned out to be the most complete work of 
its kind on the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was another turning point," Capelli said. "The suit was negative; it 
stopped destruction. The study was a positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to that time, the Friends of the River and the city had frequently been on 
opposite sides. Now, with the study in hand and the Friends and city looking 
together to restore the lower river and the estuary, the city became an 
important and powerful ally, Capelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city really began to understand the value of the resource that was right 
here in their back yard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, with the help of the California Department of Parks and the 
California Coastal Conservancy, has written a draft plan to restore the estuary 
and develop a kind of nature reserve area at the estuary called the Seaside 
Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most significant public effort to protect and restore the river," 
Capelli said. "It's the first evidence of public recognition of the value of 
the resources in the river," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also working on a plan with the County Transportation Commission 
to develop the Ventura River Trail, a six-mile bicycle trail between Main 
Street and Foster Park that would link two existing bike trails. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new controversy looms over the river's future. It concerns new talk 
about siphoning off more water than ever. And it pits the city against 
environmentalists and state wildlife biologists.

 A HISTORY OF CONTROVERSY, FROM DAMS TO DIVERSIONS 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River is one of two major rivers in Ventura County. The confluence 
of its two largest tributaries, the two forks of the Matilija creeks, marks the 
beginning of the river proper. From that point, it flows 16 miles to the sea. 
But the river's waters have a history of controversy that began with the first 
dam on one of its tributaries in 1948. Contention over the river continues to 
this day with a proposal for increased water diversions and pollution threats 
that range from street runoff to a giant reed that invades the river's entire 
length.

 There have been five major floods since records began in Ventura County, their

gushes at about one cubic foot per second.

TERM LIMITS TAKING A BIG TOLL ON LEGISLATURE; POLITICS: PROPOSITION 140 WAS 
INTENDED TO BRING IN NEW LEADERS. IT HAS SUCCEEDED. BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS: 
HAS THE TURNOVER IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Term limits are beginning to take their toll on the state Legislature, as 
nearly one-quarter of its members are running for other offices or retiring 
this year, a large turnover that continues a trend that began two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 29 of the 120 lawmakers in the Senate and Assembly are seeking to move 
along. Twenty-two are in the Assembly, where incumbents are limited to three, 
two-year terms, and seven are in the Senate, where the limit is two, four-year 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus resembles what occurred in 1992, the first election under term 
limits, when 27 freshman members were elected to the Assembly and four lower 
house incumbents moved on to the Senate. By next year, more than half of the 
80-member Assembly will be term limit lawmakers, a dramatic change in just a 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of Proposition 140, the 1990 initiative that imposed term limits on 
the Legislature and those holding statewide office, was to force out career 
politicians and create a revolving door guaranteed to bring in new leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, according to term limit supporters, that part of the initiative is 
working as advertised as new legislators quickly replace the old. 
</P>
<P>
 What is harder to gauge, because term limits are so new, is whether the change 
has improved state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Legislature is more responsive to the public, whether special 
interests and lobbyists are taking more control, whether the new lawmakers are 
more concerned about public policy than reelection, whether, in the end, there 
is any discernible difference, are questions without answers for now. 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear is that term limits are pressuring politicians to make decisions 
about the direction of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first incumbents to announce he was leaving because of term limits 
in 1992 was 10-year Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), chairman of the 
Health Committee, who resigned to take a job as associate dean for the 
University of California at the San Francisco School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his decision, Bronzan said: "It's simple. If you know there is 
absolutely no future in what you're doing, and you have two years, four years 
maximum left, what do you do? 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you wait until the end of your term to decide what to do with the rest of 
your life? No. When the best opportunity comes up for you, that's right for the 
kind of future you want for yourself, you'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others see their opportunity in another political office, either as a 
constitutional officeholder or, as in the case of several Assembly members, in 
the Senate. Either way, the result is a new political time clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Term limits crystallized things for me," said Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San 
Jose), who is running for state controller. "I really don't want to be here (in 
the Assembly) during the last two years when all of these people are going to 
be leaving and things are shutting down. The Assembly is going to be a much 
different place than it was before." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), who is running for the State Board 
of Equalization seat, said: "I would have only one more four-year Senate term, 
but I possibly could have eight more years on the State Board of Equalization." 
</P>
<P>
 One result of this political musical chairs has been $13 million in local 
costs for special elections required to fill Assembly and Senate vacancies, 
according to the secretary of state's office, an expense that is likely to 
recur. The state is reimbursing counties for $8 million of special election 
costs in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those in the Legislature remain convinced that term limits are 
misguided and that the public has thrown open the door to special-interest 
wolves and obstinate bureaucrats who will either feast on or ignore 
inexperienced lawmakers to the detriment of the public good. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most outspoken on that point is Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the 
San Francisco Democrat who must leave his powerful post in two years after 32 
years in the Assembly. Brown has been Speaker longer than anyone in the state's 
history. He is considering a run for a state Senate seat when his Assembly 
career is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate term limits even more now because it is coming to the time where they 
personally affect me," Brown said. "I'm taking it personal now, but term limits 
really hurt the legislative delivery system. There is a such a thing as 
institutional memory that is of tremendous value in the decision-making 
process. You can't just come into the halls of the Legislature and become a 
good legislator. The job doesn't lend itself to your learning all about it the 
day that you are elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said another major weakness of term limits is that new lawmakers will 
immediately start searching for their next job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have folks who are full-time looking for another job," he said. "They 
know they're terminal from the day they're first elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of term limits say the ongoing changing of the guard is exactly 
what they had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles County Supervisor and Republican Assemblyman Pete Schabarum 
of Covina, the man generally credited with getting Proposition 140 on the 
ballot, said he is pleased with the way it is working. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, term limits are beginning to produce the desired results," Schabarum 
said. "That's a lot of old faces who won't be in the Assembly and the Senate 
next year -- and a lot of new faces who will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what term limits were supposed to do. I'm glad I did it. And 
I'm as convinced today as I was four years ago that it is very appropriate for 
good government." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga agrees with 
Schabarum's assessment. The GOP, which supported term limits, believes that it 
stands to increase its numbers in both houses, in part because entrenched 
Democratic incumbents are being forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think term limits are the best public policy innovation in this century," 
Brulte said. "The average chief executive officer of a major corporation in 
this country spends six to eight years in that job and then moves on." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 1992 Assembly freshman class, the first elected under term 
limits, say they are well aware of their short political life span and work to 
compensate for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know you only have a limited time in which to accomplish the things you 
want to do," said Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles), who has received 
high marks from his colleagues. "You've got to learn the ins and outs of what 
it takes to gain support for your bills. You also have to be extremely focused 
about convincing others to see things your way." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most difficult things to gauge is what impact term limits have had 
on lobbyists and the state bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional wisdom, at least that which emanates from many in the 
Legislature, is that veteran lobbyists and state bureaucrats will have the 
upper hand because the newcomers will turn to them for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The counter argument is that lobbyists and bureaucrats will lose their 
hard-earned influence built up over the years with veteran legislators because 
they will not be able to manipulate the newcomers as easily. 
</P>
<P>
 A top lobbyist, Dennis E. Carpenter, who was a state senator from Orange 
County, said: "I suppose the lobbyists and the bureaucrats get more influence 
in the context that they become a more select crowd of people who know what the 
hell is going on and how to do things, so their advantage widens as you get 
greenhorns in the Legislature who don't know these things. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, the idea that either lobbyists or bureaucrats are going to 
run away with control of the whole legislative apparatus seems to me to be 
far-fetched." 
</P>
<P>
 As for term limits, Carpenter said: "Term limits have the distinct arguable 
advantage of getting rid of dead weight and people who should have retired or 
don't bring much to the party. But, on the other hand, it also gets rid of the 
geniuses, the properly motivated and the good people, too, who I think are more 
important to the process than the bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to imposing term limits, Proposition 140 called for a 38% cut in 
the Legislature's staff budget, which prompted many experienced and 
knowledgeable staffers to take other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Capitol observers believe the inner workings of the Legislature 
continue to operate much as they did prior to Proposition 140. "It was not the 
end of the world," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to legislative term limits, Proposition 140 also imposed a limit 
of two, four-year terms on other statewide elected officials, including the 
governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, controller, treasurer and 
superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political observers say that although term limits have had a large 
impact, that is not the only reason so many incumbents are looking to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Center for Politics and 
Economics at the Claremont Graduate School, said: "Term limits definitely are 
having an impact, but there are other contributing factors, including the 
sourness of the current political environment, the voters' anger with the 
political system and politicians. This is a very mean-spirited time." Moving On

STATE PROBES SPILL FROM UNOCAL TANK INTO RIVER; POLLUTION: MIXTURE OF CRUDE OIL 
AND WATER IS HEADING TOWARD THE OCEAN. FIRM DEFENDS ITS REPORT THAT SAID NO 
WATERWAYS WERE AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State officials Saturday began investigating an oil spill flowing into the 
Santa Clara River and toward the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill, 30,000 gallons of water mixed with light crude oil, wound its way 
down a remote Santa Paula canyon into the Santa Clara River after overflowing 
from a Unocal storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt it's in the Santa Clara River and on its way to the ocean," 
said state Fish and Game Lt. Chris Long, who was assigned to the case Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports from Fish and Game wardens said that no wildlife or habitat 
were severely damaged as a result of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Thick globs of oil covered the edges of Adams Barranca on Saturday -- seven 
days after the state Office of Emergency Services was told of the release. The 
barranca is a small tributary that merges with the Santa Clara River before 
moving on to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Unocal executives notified the state of the release March 
12, but that information from the oil company prompted wardens to slow their 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Long, Unocal told the state that the release was contained and 
had not entered any waterways. Based on that information, an investigator "did 
not see it as something he had to respond to," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Marshall, a field superintendent for the oil company, defended his report 
to state officials, saying that rain Saturday might have caused some of the 
oily residue to flow into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said his interpretation of the law was that Adams Barranca is not a 
waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 "A waterway is something like the Santa Clara River," he said. "Not Adams 
Barranca." 
</P>
<P>
 Long interviewed Unocal workers at the company's Santa Paula facility for much 
of Saturday. He said he has requested internal company documents relating to 
the release. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said seismic activity, apparently after the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, caused a substantial increase in the amount of oil that 
naturally seeps from century-old tunnels in Adams Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Production foreman Walker Kozer said the company maintains a series of pipes 
along the tunnel edges that collects the crude and transports it to nearby 
storage tanks. But the tanks can only hold 100 barrels -- 4,200 gallons -- 
before overflowing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company replaced the 100-barrel storage tanks with 500-barrel tanks last 
week, Kozer said. At least two dozen employees were working every day to clean 
up the oil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dammed it up, sopped it all up and cleaned it up," said Kozer, who called 
the cleanup 80% complete Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozer estimated that 500 of the 30,000 gallons that flowed over the edge of 
the storage tank was crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crews in Santa Barbara County worked to clean up 2,000 gallons of 
crude oil that spilled from a Mobil Oil processing facility at Elwood Beach 
north of Santa Barbara late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil said the spill was detected when golfers noticed oil oozing into an area 
near the tee for the 12th hole at Sandpiper Golf Course, which is next to 
Mobil's Elwood Beach facility, said Mobil spokeswoman Shauna Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said crews worked all day Friday and most of Saturday to build holding 
dams on the beach, where the light crude oil had flowed.

BORDER LINES; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S BLIGHT OF TAGGING IS EXPORTED TO TIJUANA, 
WHERE OUTRAGED RESIDENTS HAVE LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR REBELLIOUS YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Taggers have left their mark on Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Defiant slogans are smeared across the slums lining the U.S.-Mexico boundary, 
the gated mansions of hilltop colonias , the downtown malls and boulevards. 
"PK" means police killer (as it does in Los Angeles). "HEM" stands for Hecho en 
Mexico (Made in Mexico). "HAP" alludes to a group of taggers known as Homeless 
Altamira Punks and/or Haciendo Artes Prohibidas (Making Prohibited Art). 
</P>
<P>
 The walls tell the story of how the graffiti culture of Southern California 
has surged over the border in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the fashions of the United States arrive sooner or later," said 
Federico Benitez Lopez, director of a municipal police force that has deployed 
a full-scale anti-graffiti campaign, along with city social workers. "The 
movement of people back and forth is large. It brings these influences." 
</P>
<P>
 An unprecedented rampage by at least 25 newly formed tagging "crews" with 
hundreds of members has become the hot topic of radio talk shows, academic 
forums and angry neighborhood meetings. It is an ironic twist on the perennial 
complaint by some Californians that social ills ooze north from Mexico. The 
ringleaders of the tagging crews tend to be English-speaking teen-agers who go 
to San Diego schools or former immigrants from a number of Mexican families 
that have abandoned Southern California recently. Some youths have brought 
U.S.-style urban marauding back with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The reverse migration is because of "the economy, the riots, the earthquake, 
the fires, you name it," said Angel, the barrel-chested manager of Madness, a 
paint-splattered store that opened on Boulevard Agua Caliente last year. The 
business caters to the craze that has united immigrants from dusty shantytowns, 
"juniors" from elite families and even university students with artistic 
pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not trying to destroy Mexico," said owner Leo Alva, 23. "If anything, 
we are trying to help Mexico by educating the young about hip-hop culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The clothing entrepreneur divides his time between his Eastside garment 
factory and weekends in Tijuana, where his family runs several stores. Alva 
insisted that he does not sell spray paint or encourage lawbreaking, but simply 
responds to the demands of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last two years I was going to Tijuana and seeing there were a lot 
of (taggers)," he said during a telephone interview. "A lot of crews that were 
here in Los Angeles, somebody from here would move there. People from 
California were down there recruiting or teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Madness sells baggy jeans for up to $70, T-shirts for $18, caps and backpacks 
for toting spray-paint cans during "bombing" runs. Ski masks -- head wear made 
fashionable in Mexico by Subcommandante Marcos, the charismatic masked leader 
of this year's armed uprising in the state of Chiapas -- are $18. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebellious vandals of this border city have encountered little of the 
sympathy won by the indigenous guerrillas of the south. During a recent 
appearance by a delegation of taggers on a popular radio forum, irate callers 
denounced them. Mothers alternately scolded and appealed for reason: "Mijo (my 
son), why are you doing this?" one asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of Tijuana are still dazed, said Chance, a husky 17-year-old who 
speaks fluent English and wears his hair shaved close with a braid in back. 
"They don't know what to do. It's not a trend, it's a culture. Or a subculture, 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Chance, who travels to San Diego each weekday to attend high school, said 
Tijuana tagging crews have appeared on local television and in Alarma, a 
Mexican crime tabloid known for gory photos of murder victims. He clearly 
relishes his newfound celebrity. He and his cronies do their clandestine 
handiwork near the international line, "where the tourists and the taggers from 
the other side can see it." 
</P>
<P>
 The taggers have defaced the traffic signs above the steel sea of vehicles at 
the freeway border crossing at San Ysidro. They have "bombed" Tijuana buses and 
the San Diego trolley that serves the border area. Avenida Revolucion provides 
prime targets, including the headquarters of the Tijuana municipal police; the 
most daring culprits add the numbers 1036, the radio code for "fleeing 
suspect," to their scrawls as a taunt to the black-garbed Tactical Group, a 
SWAT-like unit trying to fight rising youth crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many U.S. counterparts, Tijuana taggers claim to be peaceful, 
misunderstood artists, complaining that the public confuses them with violent 
street gangs. They accuse the police of meting out curbside justice, and say 
that officers have sprayed captured taggers head to foot with confiscated 
aerosol cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police over (in San Diego) are tough," Chance said. "The police over here 
are mean." 
</P>
<P>
 As police crack down, graffiti-related arrests have gone from about a dozen a 
month in early 1993 to 83 arrests in January. Curiously, many suspects are 18 
and older. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have arrested people who were 34 years old," said Benitez, the police 
director. "They are what in other times would have been called hippies." 
</P>
<P>
 Hippies, the zoot-suited pachucos of the 1940s and modern-day cholos and 
taggers all flowed into Tijuana as part of an incessant cross-border current of 
styles and subcultures, according to sociologist Jose Manuel Valenzuela Arce of 
Tijuana, an expert on Mexican popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti weave together historical influences of Mexico's socially committed 
mural art, territorial declarations by youth gangs and political sloganeering. 
Since the days of the Mexican revolution, Valenzuela said, "the wall becomes a 
clandestine newspaper of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 It becomes a kind of cultural history text as well: along the facade of a 
building next to Lazaro Cardenas Preparatory School, the fading declaration "El 
Salvador will triumph" -- popular in the 1980s -- has been nearly obscured by a 
bilingual riot of fresh tribal symbols and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has never experienced such a widespread, organized wave of graffiti, 
Valenzuela said. "The taggers have expanded graffiti from the confines of the 
(working-class) neighborhood and spread it through society." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike cholo gangs, the illicit fad crosses Mexico's highly demarcated 
socioeconomic lines. One of Tijuana's first taggers studies at a high-priced 
private school and drives a new Bronco. Another self-described "original 
gangster" is Bens, 17, whose family lives in Colonia Hipodromo, a luxurious 
enclave near the racetrack. His tag decorates a giant HEM insignia across the 
street from Madness, accompanied by the numeral 1993 -- the year the taggers 
invaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Bens spends many nights away from home and does not work or go to school. He 
feels more comfortable speaking Spanish, but slides frequently into English 
slang. His face mixes scorn and melancholy when he dismisses his family as " 
muy stuck-up." After living for two years in Whittier, where his cousins were 
avid graffiti vandals, he returned to Tijuana and joined Made in Mexico, one of 
the biggest crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the name HEM because it's 100% Mexican," Bens said, sitting 
cross-legged on a counter amid a group of friends at Madness. 
</P>
<P>
 Like adolescents everywhere, the Tijuana taggers are driven by a youthful 
drive for danger and adventure. But Valenzuela said that youths at the border 
are also affected by social forces, such as the disintegration of families 
because of immigration and the maquiladora industry, which has made many women 
breadwinners. He also blamed the city's anarchic urban sprawl: Tijuana offers 
meager green spaces, jarringly haphazard architecture and, most significantly, 
a tradition of ignoring the law when it comes to construction safety codes and 
property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visually, it is not always very attractive," Valenzuela said. "The taggers 
tell me, 'The city is ugly, the city is sad. I am giving it more life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The municipal government disagrees. In addition to tougher law enforcement, 
city officials emphasize their desire to engage in dialogue with youths and are 
working on a binational prevention program with officials in San Diego. Both 
cities will conduct an "anti-graffiti day" next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an attack" on taggers, said Rosa Alicia Luna, a doctor in Tijuana's 
public health department. "We are trying to channel them into appropriate 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities do not have the money for the repeated cleanups that have become 
standard million-dollar expenditures by city and state agencies in California. 
When graffiti goes up in Tijuana, it has a better chance of staying up. 
</P>
<P>
 Alva, the owner of Madness, is banking on the potential of hip-hop clothes, 
music and art. He already has customers in Guadalajara. And he has developed a 
bilingual hip-hop magazine that will begin publishing in both nations this 
spring.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE SONG WE FORGET TO SING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She stood posed against a fence post in her straw hat and khaki sun dress. He 
was dressed in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, and he peered through a camera that 
was set on a tripod in the middle of a country road. Behind her ran a wide 
pasture covered with a yellow wildflower known as fiddleneck. And behind the 
pasture rose the Sierra foothills, lit up with new grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Toy and Cindy Amery had come to this setting on the east side of the San 
Joaquin Valley from San Francisco. They had traveled in style, making the trip 
on a warm Sunday in March in his 1959 pearl white Cadillac convertible, top 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their first encounter with the so-called Blossom Trail, a 67-mile 
scenic tour concocted by boosters as a way to attract spring visitors to the 
valley. The route runs along the back roads, cutting through orchards of 
almonds, nectarines, peaches and pears. Around this time each year, the trees 
for a couple of weeks or so will sprout blossoms of pink and white, while the 
neighboring pastures and foothills come alive with wildflowers -- golden 
poppies, blue lupine, fiddlenecks. It's quite a sight, laid out against a 
backdrop of snowy Sierra mountains and, higher above, deep blue skies. The 
newcomers struggled to find words to match the beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gorgeous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breathtaking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was it we called it earlier?" he said, groping for a phrase. "Simple 
splendor. That's what this is." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 That's the way it is all over this California in this season, and in most 
seasons: beautiful. The point seems obvious, banal even. And yet it also seems 
so easily overlooked. Sometimes, it takes outsiders to remind us. A few weeks 
ago, as the first taste of spring was warming California, a friend came out 
from New York. We walked through San Francisco's North Beach in the late 
afternoon. He had lived in the city before, but had forgotten how good it can 
look on certain days, at certain hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the light," he said, studying how the cream and pastel walls of the 
apartment houses glowed in the late afternoon sun. "There is no light like that 
anywhere but California." 
</P>
<P>
 Even amid the worst disasters the beauty can prove irresistible. I remember 
after the big fires above Laguna Beach watching a clutch of out-of-town 
reporters stand beside a burned-out canyon house and marvel at the panoramic 
view of the sparkling coastline below. "I guess that's why people live here," 
one said, belaboring, again, what should be obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, though, California's simple splendor seems to have been lost on many 
Californians. No longer do we sing of bowers of flowers blooming in the sun, 
and all the rest. To do so would be to expose ourselves as saps or hucksters, 
to miss the point, to not get it. Instead, the smart talk is of problems. 
Murder and mayhem, faltering schools and bumbling government, the invasion of 
immigrants, the exodus of "jobs," disasters of every kind, bankruptcy in every 
form -- this is California in current context. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That this is a political year will only add volume to the chorus of despair. 
For the next several months, would-be governors and legislators and the rest 
will preach to us of problems, and only problems. They will pose for photo ops 
at murder scenes and oil spills and overcrowded classrooms. They will rant and 
whine and browbeat and blame and do their best to persuade everyone that 
California is sinking, fast. 
</P>
<P>
 And certainly California has its share of problems. And certainly it makes 
political sense to harp on them. The governing rule of modern politics seems to 
be that everybody has a pet gripe, or a particular fear, and to define the 
correct set of problems, to give voice to the right combination of fears, is to 
build a winning coalition of complainants. 
</P>
<P>
 Myself, though, I'm waiting for a candidate who will take media crews into a 
field of fiddlenecks and contemplate the perfect word to describe its beauty, a 
candidate who understands that California's significant charms are not merely 
decoration, not trivial, but instead are fundamental to its purpose and a 
principal reason why 30 million or so of us remain here -- and that, yes, while 
this beauty needs to be preserved, it also ought to be celebrated, and there is 
a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 I am waiting for the candidate who sees the state through the lens of Phil 
Toy, out here in the middle of nowhere, on the Blossom Trail. "Everybody should 
see this," he said, squinting into the viewfinder. "It gives you balance." 
Balance. Now there's a word.

19-YEAR-OLD MURDERER OF 3 BOYS SENTENCED TO DEATH; COURTS: A 16-YEAR-OLD 
ACCOMPLICE IS GIVEN A LIFE TERM IN ARKANSAS. THE BATTERED VICTIMS WERE ALL 
SECOND-GRADERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager was sentenced to death Saturday for the murder of three 8-year-old 
boys whose bodies were found naked, battered and hogtied. An accomplice was 
sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Damien Echols, 19, and Charles Jason Baldwin, 16, each were convicted Friday 
of three counts of capital murder. The same jury that convicted them 
recommended death by injection for Echols and life in prison without parole for 
Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, second-graders Steve Branch, Chris Byers and Michael Moore, 
disappeared May 5 while riding bicycles through their West Memphis, Ark., 
neighborhood. Their bodies were pulled from a drainage ditch the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 When Circuit Judge David Burnett asked Baldwin if there was any reason he 
should not impose the sentence, Baldwin said: "Because I'm innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked the same question, Echols replied: "No, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 A witness said two of the 8-year-olds were raped and one was castrated. 
Prosecutors presented evidence suggesting that Echols was a devil worshiper and 
Baldwin was his loyal follower. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett set Echols' execution for May 5, exactly a year after the boys were 
killed. However, an appeal is automatic and the execution date was set as a 
matter of record only. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury heard about 2 1/2 hours of testimony from defense witnesses for 
Echols before beginning deliberations on the sentences. No one testified for 
Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Echols' father, Joe Hutchison, said he blamed himself for his son's problems. 
"I've had regrets for eight years. I didn't do what I should have done." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution pointed out that in interviews with a psychologist, Echols 
referred to himself as another Ted Bundy or Charles Manson and said "people 
will remember me." 
</P>
<P>
 Echols and Baldwin were arrested on June 3 after a friend, Jessie Lloyd 
Misskelley Jr., made incriminating statements to police. Misskelley, 18, was 
convicted in a separate trial of one count of first-degree murder and two 
counts of second-degree murder. He is serving a prison sentence of life plus 40 
years.

TOWER'S FINAL BLAST MAKES MONEY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city made the best of a sinking situation Saturday, blasting a tottering 
office tower into a pile of rubble amid money-making hoopla featuring $5 
commemorative bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands cheered the controlled explosion that erased the seven-story 
Corporate Plaza from the downtown skyline in about 20 seconds.The honor of 
pushing the button that set off the blast went to Steve Pucszyn, a store worker 
who won a city-sponsored raffle. Three thousand raffle tickets sold for $5 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 The building began to slowly collapse last month when a 40-foot-long sinkhole 
cut through the city center. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else are you going to do when Mother Nature deals you a hand like this?" 
asked Robin Turner, director of the Downtown Improvement District Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside the $5 souvenir bricks, sweat shirts bearing the slogan "I Survived the 
Big Bang" sold for $20. The money will be split between the Downtown 
Improvement District Authority and the Lehigh County chapter of the American 
Red Cross.

FINANCE MINISTERS FROM 18 NATIONS AGREE ON STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finance ministers from 18 of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies 
agreed Saturday that their countries need to keep inflation low, increase 
private investment and expand export opportunities in order to maintain their 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Nations at the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum account for about 
half of the world's economic output, foreign exchange reserves and population, 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in his opening remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's interdependent world, this kind of economic performance cannot be 
sustained in a vacuum," Bentsen said. "We all share an interest in economic 
strength for the region as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 The ministers issued a joint statement outlining five principles to guide 
their economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The principles include keeping inflation low to ensure stability and growth; 
increasing cross-border flow of goods and services; getting the private sector 
to be the main engine for growth, and further developing capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The APEC nations with finance ministers attending were the United States, 
Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Brunei, 
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New 
Guinea, Mexico and Chile. Chile is not a member of APEC but has applied for 
membership.

ISRAEL, PLO CLOSER TO RESUMING TALKS; MIDEAST: PERES SAYS TROOPS COULD BE OUT 
OF OCCUPIED LANDS SIX WEEKS AFTER SIDES RETURN TO BARGAINING TABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO moved closer to resuming autonomy talks Saturday, and 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israeli troops could be out of the occupied 
Gaza Strip and Jericho within six weeks of a return to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Israeli delegation, reportedly including chief autonomy negotiator 
Gen. Amnon Shahak, was to leave Sunday for meetings with Palestine Liberation 
Organization leaders in Tunis, Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides are to discuss ways to improve Palestinian security in the 
occupied territories and the resumption of peace talks. One Israeli proposal is 
to deploy a Palestinian police force in Hebron, site of the Feb. 25 massacre 
that led to the suspension of talks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the meetings go well, Peres and PLO chief Yasser Arafat will meet Thursday 
in Paris, and negotiations could resume by March 28, Israel TV said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he called Arafat early Saturday, immediately 
after the U.N. Security Council condemned the massacre. The resolution had been 
one of the PLO's conditions for returning to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said he did not offer Arafat concrete proposals but made a general 
pledge to "give protection to the Palestinians against terrible murderers." 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO suspended talks after a Jewish settler gunned down about 30 worshipers 
in a Hebron mosque last month. The PLO has demanded that Israel remove Jewish 
settlers from Hebron and deploy an international force in the occupied lands 
before negotiations resume. 
</P>
<P>
 A PLO Executive Committee member in Tunis said the leadership would not make 
any decision on resuming talks until the Israeli delegation arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said Israel was proposing that a special Palestinian police force be 
deployed in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres also hinted that Israel might decide unilaterally, though not 
immediately, to dismantle some settlements. Such a decision would be made 
"based on Israeli logic and security needs," not under the pressure of 
negotiations with the PLO, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Israel-PLO talks resume, there could be quick results, he said.

ANC DEMANDS PURGE OF POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ANC on Saturday demanded a purge of all police officers found to have been 
involved in running guns to its Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party rival and 
other dirty tricks to undermine South Africa's transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals Court Judge Richard Goldstone said he had evidence that the deputy 
police commissioner, Lt. Gen. Basie Smit, was among those involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a tip of an iceberg. The ANC believes a lot of people are still 
involved in such dirty tricks. Urgent action must be taken to weed out all 
those involved," said African National Congress spokesman Carl Niehaus. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge told a news conference Friday that fast action was needed to avoid 
further destabilization before the republic's first all-race elections April 
26-28. The ANC is expected to win comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the actions listed by Goldstone, including the supply of weapons and 
the fueling of violence on trains and in migrant worker hostels, were directed 
at helping Inkatha which has said it is boycotting the election. 
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk said Smit, police intelligence chief Maj.-Gen. 
Krappies Engelbrecht, Lt.-Gen. Johan le Roux and other officers were being put 
on compulsory leave. 
</P>
<P>
 He also ordered an investigation by the multi-party Transitional Executive 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi said he was not aware that 
senior members of his party had received guns from top generals. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstone was appointed by the government to investigate the causes of 
political violence, which has killed about 15,000 people in four years of 
apartheid reform.

END OF BALKAN WAR 'CLOSER,' CLINTON TELLS BOSNIA TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a televised exchange with Zlata Filipovic, the Bosnian teen-ager whose 
diary has made her the best-known child of the Balkan war, President Clinton 
said Saturday that the end of the bloody and frustrating conflict may be within 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually people, when they start war, they say, 'With this war, we will get 
things,' " Filipovic told the President. "But I think usually all of them lose 
things. And I think it's really big stupidity. And I would like to ask you . . 
. is the end of that stupidity close?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is closer," Clinton replied. "And I agree with you." 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange came in the White House East Room during a question-and-answer 
session between the President and a carefully selected group of elementary and 
high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipovic, whose moving diary of daily life under fire in Sarajevo became a 
best seller and in the process helped her escape from the war-torn city, was 
the only non-American in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told her that he believes the federation agreement between the Bosnian 
government and Bosnian Croats signed Friday in Washington will help bring the 
conflict to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute program, televised by ABC, seemed to be a tonic to the 
President. Not one of the youths asked about the Whitewater investigation, the 
staple of Clinton's recent exchanges with the adult press. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prevalent theme seemed to be violence -- by adults against children 
and by children against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-year-old Annie Nichol, sister of Polly Klaas, the Petaluma girl who was 
kidnaped from her home and murdered, told Clinton, "I just don't feel very 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 "You do live in a country that's too dangerous," Clinton said. "And we have to 
make it less dangerous. And that is a huge obligation that I feel and I think 
about every day. . . . I want the children of this country to be able to grow 
up on safe streets and safe schools and safer homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, people beat each other up. . . . Nobody ever shot anybody," 
the President said.

 An explosion in a suburban courtyard Saturday injured a man and two children 
in Sarajevo, and Bosnian Serb rebels insisted that U.N. sanctions be lifted 
before they join peace talks, undermining recent diplomatic claims that the war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina is all but over. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured man told doctors and journalists a mortar round had slammed into 
the yard of his high-rise apartment building as he worked in his garden and 
children played nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 But a U.N. spokesman, Maj. Rob Annink, said the blast was believed to have 
been from a hand grenade or other explosive device detonated at the scene of 
the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 If the explosion was a mortar round, as witnesses at the front-line 
residential area claimed, it would constitute the worst violation of a 
six-week-old cease-fire that has nearly brought an end to the heavy artillery 
bombardment that terrorized Sarajevo civilians for 22 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Saturday's explosion in the Alipashino Polje cluster of 
high-rise apartment buildings injured a 44-year-old man, his 7-year-old son and 
a neighbor's 4-year-old child, inflicting a sobering reminder to Sarajevo's 
380,000 residents that war dangers have not completely subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tanks, howitzers and heavy guns Serbian nationalist forces had 
used to pound the capital were moved or surrendered prior to a Feb. 21 deadline 
for withdrawal of artillery from a 12-mile radius of the capital. NATO had 
threatened to launch air strikes against any heavy weapons left within the 
exclusion zone, and Russian pressure on Bosnian Serb leaders compelled the 
rebels to mostly comply. 
</P>
<P>
 But hundreds of artillery pieces remain within the zone under the watch of 
overstretched U.N. forces and within easy reach of Serbian fighters still 
deployed near the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials claimed that a sophisticated French radar system brought in to 
Sarajevo a month ago could precisely locate weapons firing in violation of the 
proclaimed truce. But in the case of at least two previous mortar blasts since 
the cease-fire, neither of which inflicted injuries, the firing positions were 
said by U.N. monitors to be untraceable or too close to the line of 
confrontation to allow retaliatory fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alipashino Polje area was a frequent target of Bosnian Serb gunners prior 
to the cease-fire. One theory among U.N. sources investigating Saturday's blast 
was that an unexploded round had lodged in the garden and was inadvertently 
disturbed by the injured man or the nearby children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mines and unexploded ordnance have been a deadly problem throughout the Balkan 
war zones. On Saturday, a British peacekeeper was killed while preparing to 
detonate explosives that Bosnian government and Croatian forces had turned over 
to the United Nations as part of their bilateral cease-fire, officials said. 
The accident occurred near the town of Stari Vitez, in central Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions in Sarajevo have been markedly better since the cease-fire, despite 
the increasing violations, and a U.N.-brokered agreement Thursday to open some 
roads to limited civilian traffic next week has further spurred hopes that the 
siege of the capital might be drawing to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ultimate success of the current truce depends heavily on enticing the 
Serbian rebel forces to cooperate in a new Muslim-Croat effort to rebuild 
Bosnia as a unified federation of three peoples -- an aim openly rejected by 
the Serbs throughout the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from their patrons in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, the Bosnian 
Serbs may be compelled to take part in negotiations now being mediated by 
special Balkan envoys from the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 But diplomats close to the initial Muslim-Croat talks that took place at the 
U.S. Embassy in Vienna concede privately that the Serbs are interested in the 
negotiating forum only to gain international acceptance of their sovereignty 
over much of the land they have seized since rebelling against Bosnian 
independence in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has already sought to barter his 
cooperation in the federation talks in exchange for lifting of U.N. sanctions 
that have beggared Yugoslavia, whose nationalist leaders have bankrolled the 
Serbian rebellion in Bosnia to gain territory for a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready to sign a peace agreement at any time, but we expect that all 
three sides would be treated equally, which includes the issue of the lifting 
of sanctions," Karadzic was quoted as saying Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 While the tenuous peace in Sarajevo showed signs of fraying, the recent 
reconciliation of Bosnian Muslims and Croats appeared to gain strength with the 
release of more than 800 prisoners of war captured by the two factions during 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Muslims and Croats, who together make up two-thirds of the country, 
initially fought side by side to defend Bosnian territory from the Serbian land 
grab. But they fell to fighting each other last spring after it became apparent 
that a Western-mediated peace settlement would be based largely on ethnic 
partitioning along the territorial status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Committee of the Red Cross in Zagreb reported 500 Muslim 
prisoners released from Croat-run detention camps and jails, and 360 Croats 
freed from Muslim-held east Mostar and the town of Bugojno. 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 more POWs, reportedly the last held by the reconciling factions, 
were to be released in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. special envoy Charles Redman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaly S. Churkin have underscored throughout their efforts to broker peace in 
Bosnia that the success of the new federation and hopes for ending the war 
hinge on the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin told a Washington news conference that he believes the Serbs can be 
persuaded to cooperate with the Croat-Muslim federation agreement even if they 
choose to stay out of the federation. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that the Bosnian Serbs will eventually agree to reduce their own 
holdings from about 70% to about 50% of Bosnian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin bristled at suggestions that Russia is acting as an agent for the 
Serbs, with whom they share a Slavic heritage and Orthodox Christian religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow, he said, "is bearing the burden of trying to find some common sense in 
the position of one party which is a very difficult party."

STATE AIDE SAYS BLACKMUN SHOULD REMOVE SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who will defend California's death penalty law in the Supreme Court 
this week said in an interview that Justice Harry A. Blackmun had violated his 
oath of office by announcing his conclusion in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. William G. Prahl said Blackmun, 85, should remove himself 
from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun announced on Feb. 22 that he would vote to reverse every death 
sentence that came before the high court on grounds that state procedures in 
capital cases were "fraught with arbitrariness." 
</P>
<P>
 "From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prahl said in a telephone interview: "If this were any other issue, there 
would be elements calling for his impeachment. He has prejudged the case based 
on his personal feelings . . . and announced in advance how he is going to 
vote, regardless of the facts or the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it raises a good question: Why is he sitting on this case? If this 
turns out to be a 5-4 vote (against the state), the state of California didn't 
get a fair hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun has precedent for deciding in advance to oppose the death penalty 
without regard for particular circumstances. Former Justices William J. Brennan 
and Thurgood Marshall believed the death penalty was unconstitutional because 
it was "cruel and unusual punishment" banned by the Eighth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prahl, noting that Blackmun, Brennan and Marshall had been the court's three 
oldest justices until Brennan and Marshall retired, said: "Supreme Court 
justices don't age well on the death penalty. They lose their fortitude for 
enforcing criminal law." DAVID G. SAVAGE

BOND FIRMS CONTRIBUTIONS COULD BE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In state after state, the sales of government bonds have been plagued by 
allegations that the firms that package bond deals have, in effect, purchased 
their business through campaign contributions and kickbacks to decision makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the full force of that controversy did not hit California, opponents 
of state Treasurer Kathleen Brown are hoping that the breadth of those scandals 
will taint her campaign to become governor. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in California is Brown's acceptance of campaign contributions from 
the investment bankers who are appointed by the treasurer to underwrite bond 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no evidence that Brown either demanded such payments from 
those seeking state business or that they affected her decisions, her campaign 
did accept checks from investment bankers as well as law firms that oversee 
billions of dollars in government bonds sold by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has slowly phased out the practice, but not before accepting more than 
$800,000 in contributions from the firms and their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's supporters say she deserves credit as one of the first state 
treasurers in the country to recognize the problem and do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 And so do regulators who are proposing a nationwide ban on such contributions 
in an effort to end the practice, referred to as "pay to play." 
</P>
<P>
 "To her credit, I think she has been much more aware and much more sensitive 
to this whole thing than other treasurers and other politicians across the 
country," said Christopher Taylor, executive director of the Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, a self-regulating panel representing the industry, has drafted a 
rule that would bar firms that make such contributions to state and local 
politicians from taking part in bond deals awarded by those officials. The 
proposal is being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. More 
than 50 bond firms have announced that they will voluntarily stop making 
contributions to the decision makers. 
</P>
<P>
 What triggered the movement toward reform were allegations of impropriety in 
New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has been brewing for years, even in places like California that have 
not been touched directly by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 As documented in The Times in 1986, former state Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh 
collected substantial contributions from investment bankers -- in rough 
proportion to their business with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In accepting the investment bankers' money, Brown was following the example of 
Unruh and her immediate predecessor, Thomas W. Hayes. During the 1990 
treasurer's race, Hayes and Brown accepted substantial donations from the bond 
underwriters and legal firms that vie for state bond business, campaign records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown changed her policy to avoid any appearance of impropriety, said her 
campaign finance director, Ann Hollister, tightening it further as she prepared 
to launch her campaign for governor. Why did she wait until July to stop taking 
contributions from individual investment bankers? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an evolving policy," Hollister said. "We were out front on it. . . 
. When you're out front you have to look around and ask: 'What is appropriate? 
What is right today?' "

CLINTON TAKES HIS HEALTH REFORM PLAN TO THE PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton is going back to the basics to sell Americans on his 
battered health care reform plan, insisting that there is a lot more in the 
1,342-page blueprint that will benefit people than they realize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I go families tell me we've got to do something about health care, 
and they're right," Clinton said Saturday in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "the defenders of the status quo are trying to confuse the issue 
by making it seem complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next week and in the months ahead, I'm going to tell people all across 
America about our health reform plan and what it really means." 
</P>
<P>
 He spelled out what he said are its core principles: "Guaranteed private 
insurance, your choice of doctors and health plans, outlawing unfair insurance 
practices, preserving Medicare, guaranteeing health benefits at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that simple. I want to cut through the complexity, the confusion and 
downright distortion." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that as Congress debates his health care plan, the issue should be 
decided by informed citizens, "not by special interests, skilled at spending 
millions of dollars to prevent progress and to promote their own narrow 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face the facts, debate our choices, and make a historic decision to 
build on what's best and fix what's worst in our health care system," Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response, Sen. Hank Brown of Colorado asserted that "the 
President's health care plan is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the proposal is doomed because of its potential cost and the 
creation of new federal bureaucracy. He called on Clinton to work with the GOP 
to develop a new health care plan that would ease paperwork and assure that 
people can take their coverage with them when they change jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also proposed a tax break for small businesses offering health 
insurance.

A FEW DEADLY FLOODS STAND OUT IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a region where steep hills and flashy rivers make flooding a relatively 
common occurrence, a few floods stand out as the most dramatic, damaging and 
deadly in Ventura County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Flooding is the natural system's means of flushing out the channels, clearing 
away brush, sediment and debris to the ocean, scouring the river bottoms to 
make way for new growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent floods, in 1992, provided a perfect example of the system at 
work, said Mark H. Capelli, a lecturer in coastal systems at the University of 
California, Santa Barbara and the executive director of Friends of the Ventura 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw Mother Nature making and remaking wetlands and creating a delta," he 
said about the Ventura River, which swept across the broad expanse of its 
historical path to re-create a second river mouth on Feb. 12. "We were witness 
to a tremendous physical process." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's when humans get too close, with bridges built too low or roads and 
houses too near, that trouble -- and tragedy -- occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the floods of 1992, the storm that struck Feb. 12 followed a week of 
back-to-back storms, which had already saturated the entire 226 miles of the 
Ventura River's watershed. 
</P>
<P>
 The river filled its flood plain, rampaged down new channels and inundated a 
homeless encampment beneath the Main Street bridge. It also washed out the 
Ventura RV Beach Resort in a channel leading to the river's second mouth, 
destroying or damaging dozens of the mobile home park's vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 As sheriff's rescue helicopters hovered over the lower two miles of the 
Ventura River, deputies plucked frightened homeless people and campers from 
islands surrounded by the raging muddy waters. 
</P>
<P>
 But one homeless man could not be saved. He was swept down the river to his 
death, his body later recovered and identified by the man with whom he shared a 
lean-to on the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 And three others living just north of Ventura were killed during the night 
when a mountain of mud slammed through a couple's bedroom wall, suffocating 
them and killing their near-term unborn child as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the deaths and damage from the 1992 flood, it was the flood of 
1978 that still claims the record for sending a torrent of water and debris 
coursing down the Ventura River at greater volume than has been recorded before 
or since. 
</P>
<P>
 In that storm, water was flowing at a rate of 63,600 cubic feet per second -- 
the equivalent of 63,000 fire hydrants gushing full-force at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was classified as a 50-year event, or one that has occurred on average only 
once every 50 years. By contrast, the 1992 flood waters were measured at 47,600 
cubic feet per second, a 20-year event. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its waters were the fastest, the storm of 1978 was neither the most 
damaging or deadly as other major storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Taylor, division engineer for the Ventura County Flood Control 
Department, said, "The great floods of 1969" caused the most property damage in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground became saturated by heavy rain during January storms, followed by 
another eight days from Feb. 6 to Feb. 16. Then came another front on Feb. 22 
that did not let up until the 26th -- 92 straight hours of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 During that storm, the Ventura River took out chunks of roads and bridges and 
the San Antonio Creek ripped out the railroad bridge. The Santa Clara River 
flooded the Ventura Harbor and the city's sewage treatment plant, causing 
millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The north fork of Matilija Creek destroyed a large section of California 33 
four miles north of Ojai when the creek swelled over the top of its banks. 
Entire residences were destroyed when the San Antonio Creek took a new course. 
And one woman, who was believed to have been seeking safety atop a roof, was 
swept down the river to her death, though her body was never found. 
</P>
<P>
 "That creek can build a dam out of debris and just rise around the houses," 
said Marvin Hanson, a hydrographer with the county who has specialized in 
knowledge of San Antonio Creek. "I always wondered if we would ever find the 
body when I was digging around in the area afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the other rivers in this area, it's dry during a drought and a torrent 
during a wet year," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the storms of 1938, the whole state was pelted with one wet front after 
another. Although the largest storm that year was considered only a 10-year 
event, it prompted the 1944 creation of the county's first flood control 
district and was part of the inspiration to build the Matilija Dam in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 It also prompted the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers a decade later to build a 
major levee on the east side of the river from the mouth up 2.6 miles, 
eliminating flooding in the city of Ventura and the Ventura County Fairgrounds 
east of the river's estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1914, the Ventura River became so swift and swollen that it measured 25 to 
30 feet deep and 200 feet wide at Canada Larga, according to newspaper accounts 
from Jan. 23 of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 But with as much damage and loss of life as those floods caused, Taylor of 
flood control said the Ventura River and its tributaries are capable of much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always possible to have a larger storm," she said. In fact, the Flood 
Control Department is planning for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our flood control work is now based on the 100-year event," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 More flood control work is now planned to diminish damage when the next big 
storm arrives. A levy is planned at Live Oak Acres to keep the flow out of 
residences, Taylor said. The project is expected to be built this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is also studying the possibility of putting a levy at Casitas 
Springs to protect residents there. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Sheydayi, manager of the Ventura County Flood Control District, said many 
of the houses and other developments now protected with flood control work 
should never have been built in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes the Ventura RV park, which Sheydayi opposed before it was built 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flooding is a natural event," Sheydayi said. "We only have damage from 
flooding because man has encroached in the flood plain. The best flood control 
is to control development in the flood plain."

STATE'S TOP COURT UPHOLDS BAN ON LOGGING IN 2 REDWOOD GROVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ban on logging in two groves of old-growth redwoods in Humboldt County, home 
to rare species of birds, was left intact Friday by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 While unanimously denying a hearing on an appeal by Pacific Lumber Co., the 
court also eliminated a pro-environmentalist ruling by a lower court as a 
precedent for future cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the ruling strongly affirmed the state's authority to 
regulate private land to protect rare species without having to pay the 
landowner. Justice Joyce L. Kennard cast a dissenting vote to leave the ruling 
on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 One parcel, near Salmon Creek, is part of the Headwaters Forest, the world's 
largest privately owned redwood forest. The other grove is near Owl Creek, 13 
miles away. Each parcel covers about 220 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 A state appeals court rejected Pacific Lumber's plans to cut some of the 
trees, saying protective measures were lacking for several rare wildlife 
species. In particular, the marbled murrelet, a threatened shorebird, has used 
both groves for nesting, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection approved the logging 
plans in 1988, rejecting recommendations by the Department of Fish and Game to 
reduce timber-cutting in nesting areas, near streams and in other sensitive 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Forestry officials later changed their minds and agreed that protective 
measures were needed. But Pacific Lumber argued that the initial approval was 
binding and that the state must reimburse the company for the property value it 
would lose from a halt in logging. 
</P>
<P>
 Upholding lower court decisions, the 1st District Court of Appeal ruled in 
November that the initial approval was improper.

DRIVER CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER IN DEATHS OF 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve vehicular manslaughter charges were filed against the driver of a 
pickup carrying 20 people that crashed in an irrigation ditch, killing 12 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wenndever Ordonez, 23, was to be arraigned on the felony charges this week, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Sinfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordonez was driving a compact pickup south of Barstow on Interstate 15 when it 
crashed in the ditch March 9. The truck was crammed with passengers who 
apparently entered the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The manslaughter charges were filed Friday. Also filed were misdemeanor 
charges of being an unlicensed driver, having a fraudulent driver's license, 
making an unsafe turning movement and not wearing a seat belt.

VISITORS FLOCK TO MISSION FOR SWALLOWS' RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Look, up in the sky, it's a bird. Not just an ordinary bird, mind you, but one 
of hundreds of cliff swallows making their annual 5,000-mile migration from 
Goya, Argentina, to Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an early morning rainfall, thousands of spectators visited the 
historic 218-year-old mission Saturday to catch a glimpse of the fleeting 5 
1/2-inch birds, which were the stars of the St. Joseph's Day celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities began at 8:00 a.m. when town patriarch Paul Arbiso, who is 97, 
rang the mission's "El Campanario" bell to signal the "first sighting" of the 
returning swallows. For the past 60 years, Arbiso has continued the tradition 
handed down to him by his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something I waited a long time to see," said Hank White, 71, a 
recently retired transit union president visiting the mission for the first 
time. "I've wanted to attend this event since I was 15 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who flew in from San Francisco for the weekend, said he was inspired in 
1940 by the song "When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano." 
</P>
<P>
 It was sung Saturday by Raphael Rene, the son of late music composer Leon 
Rene, who may be best remembered for penning "Rockin' Robin," a popular Chubby 
Checker tune. Leon Rene wrote "When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano" in 
1939. "From the time I heard that song, I knew that someday I would go to San 
Juan Capistrano," White said. "I've already seen several swallows this 
morning."  
</P>
<P>
 Others in the crowd were eager to catch a glimpse of the mostly reddish-brown 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen one yet, but I'm on the lookout," said Matt Palmero, 31, from 
Tustin. "Isn't that one over there?" 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a swallow, but one of a few pigeons perched high atop a maze of 
support beams surrounding the mission's main building, which is undergoing the 
first phase of a $20-million structural reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Several television actors who attended the celebration helped raise money for 
the project by signing autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 They included Ana Alicia, formerly of "Falcon Crest," Ted Lange, formerly of 
"Love Boat," Susan Ruttan of "L.A. Law," comedian Ruth Buzzi, and Jerry Mathers 
and Tony Dow, former stars of "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a great time out here -- there is a lot of historical context 
behind this celebration," Mathers said. "I jumped at the chance to be involved 
with this." 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, several classes from the Mission School performed traditional 
Swallows Day dances. Flamenco and Aztec dancers also performed. 
</P>
<P>
 One class of third-graders, dressed in colorful parrot costumes, clucked in 
circles onstage in the mission patio as they performed the "El Pajarito" dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the construction of larger buildings in the city, thousands of swallows 
would migrate directly to the mission because it was the tallest building in a 
modestly developed area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, experts say, because of an increase in population and commotion, only 
several hundred swallows rest their feathers downtown. After nesting is over 
for the summer, the swallows migrate to buildings with similar architecture and 
water canals in Goya. It is believed that they derived their name from their 
ability to feed in flight and scoop up mouthfuls of water as they skim lakes 
and streams.  
</P>
<P>
 In San Juan Capistrano, it is against the law to kill a swallow or destroy its 
nest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Collene Campbell said she did not expect such a large turnout Saturday 
because of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time that it has rained in 20 years," she said. "It really 
tears at the heartstrings to see all these people out here experiencing the 
history together."

KEEPER OF ANCESTRAL ADOBE; RIOS PATRIARCH RELISHES RESPONSIBILITY FOR HISTORIC 
HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As his two smallest children played with their mischievous mutt, Goldie, and a 
couple of young lambs in the front yard of his 200-year-old adobe home, Stephen 
Michael Rios could not help but smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Things seem to be going well for the current patriarch of the Rios family, one 
of the surviving Californio clans -- the powerful Spanish, Mexican and Native 
American cattle ranchers and landowners who ruled the state before it became 
part of the United States in 1850. 
</P>
<P>
 As this town rang the bells at its famous mission to celebrate the traditional 
return of the swallows Saturday, Rios' family marked the clan's 200th 
consecutive year in this adobe home. The home is listed in history books as the 
oldest continuously inhabited house of its kind in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Rios clan will gather sometime at the end of the fall for the 
celebration of the adobe home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to track your heritage when you've got eight generations (of 
Rioses) who never left or moved away -- the patriarchs, anyway," Rios said. Of 
the more than 100 cousins and dozens of aunts, uncles and nephews in the family 
tree, only he and his children are direct descendants, Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and somewhat portly, the 46-year-old lawyer on this day looked the part 
of a patriarch in his dark blue shirt, black slacks, cowboy hat and boots. The 
1975 graduate of UC Berkeley Law School at Boalt Hall knows he carries the 
weight of his family's history on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question about it, I do feel a sense of true responsibility not 
only to my four children, but to my extended family, which is quite large. 
There's no other adult Rios (who is a direct descendant) in the family. I'm the 
only one left to carry the family name." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of keeping up the house alone is quite a load, he says. But being a 
Rios, he quickly adds, is a worthy reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something my father inculcated in me and I'm doing it to my (children) 
as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The whitewashed adobe -- made of mud, straw and clay bricks -- is registered 
as a California historical landmark. The one-story home sits on two acres of 
land tucked in the middle of modern housing, shopping malls and wide roads just 
west of Interstate 5 and just a dozen yards from the Amtrak station. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios calls his spread "a museum," which indeed it appears to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is filled with the trappings of modern living -- a computer, a 
television, a pastel-colored couch and cabinets for compact discs and videos -- 
the adobe has not lost its original proportions or feel. And it is filled with 
memories and heirlooms. 
</P>
<P>
 On the walls are dozens of photographs and paintings of family members: Rios' 
aunt, Juanita, who was named a city matriarch. There is also cowboy Damian 
Rios, his grandfather, who became a world famous amansador , or horse tamer. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is Rios' father, Daniel, who in the 1940s and '50s was the county 
marshal for two terms. Daniel Rios, who also became head of the homicide and 
robbery divisions at the Orange County Sheriff's Department, died at 74. 
</P>
<P>
 The main bedroom holds two tin-and-wood chests filled with family documents, 
photographs and other heirlooms, and an old bed with a cherrywood headboard. In 
a nook hangs a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, surrounded by candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in this house has not been easy, Rios said. Although it now has regular 
plumbing and a bathroom -- past generations had to make do with an outhouse -- 
the adobe must be whitewashed regularly to prevent rainwater from penetrating 
the walls and undermining them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios laughs when visitors point to the house's "tiny doors." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're actually regular doors, but you have to remember that these (wooden) 
floors were dirt floors" when the doors were installed, he said. "When they put 
in floors and doorways, they lowered the (height of the) doors by six inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1794, a Spanish soldier named Feliciano Rios was granted permission by 
mission fathers to build a home just west of the mission. In 1843, Feliciano 
Rios' son, Santiago, was granted 7.7 acres that included the land where the 
family's home was built, the famous "grant within a grant" mentioned by local 
history books. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago Rios became the region's justice of the peace in the 1840s. His son, 
Damian, the horse tamer, died at 93, when he was hit by a train in front of his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was fit enough, he just didn't hear as well" when the train sounded its 
whistle to warn the old man, Stephen Rios said. "He would've lived to be 103." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors stand along the front-yard fence every day and stare at the home, 
which radiates the spirit of old California with its garden of roses and 
greenery of every kind, including several cacti and an olive tree that a local 
monsignor brought many years ago from Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree was for Stephen Rios' late grandmother, Gertrude Rheina, whom he 
lovingly refers to as "Nana Tula." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, there is a barbecue pit, made by Rios from riverbed rocks, that is 
big enough to grill a side of beef. A collection of artifacts from the Old West 
includes an enormous spoke-less iron wheel once used by a borax wagon train 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back yard lies an almost empty farm that once was home to horses, 
goats, chickens and pigs. Nearby is a wooden abode that served as the home of 
the property's mayordomo, or supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios likes to show off his 140-year-old pepper tree, which is rooted in a 
corner of the front yard. Pointing to a hole in the hollow trunk, he says: "Put 
your hand in there. Feel the energy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a spirit in there," he says, only half-jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the home's front yard is a ramada, a porchlike hut made of bamboo stems and 
eucalyptus sticks featuring a frayed couch covered with an old bedspread. Many 
a community matter has been discussed and settled under its shade, said Rios, a 
former member of the city Planning Commission and its historical society. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Capistrano "council members have sat here with (constituents) to 
settle disputes," Rios said. "There's such a feeling of friendship here that it 
is hard to leave here without reaching some kind of compromise or resolution. 
It's the spirit of this house, of the land grant."

HE'S IN NO RUSH TO SEEK A HIGHER SEAT, VASQUEZ SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since his appointment seven years ago, Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez has come to embody nearly unlimited political potential in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A bedrock conservative in one of the nation's most Republican strongholds, 
Vasquez has been seen as someone who could appeal to California's fast-growing 
Latino population. Just a year after he took office, officials talked about 
statewide office for Vasquez by 1994, then a bid for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 1994 and Vasquez remains an Orange County supervisor. And the talk has 
turned to speculation about his missed opportunities, unwillingness to take 
risks and uncertain political future. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the supervisor's closest friends, lobbyist Randy Smith, recently 
suggested that Vasquez has been contemplating an exit from government into 
private business. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he believes Vasquez has grown increasingly concerned with the 
declining "esteem" ascribed to political figures and has been exploring other 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have this perception that Gaddi is a career politician," Smith 
said. "I think they would be shocked to learn that politics now is one of a 
number of competing interests." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vasquez strongly denies any such wayward thinking, saying that he is 
"befuddled" that anyone would think such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard these things before, mostly from the press," Vasquez said. "I am 
always kind of puzzled by people who want me to move along. But I think the 
general public is tired of seeing politicians who use one office to jump to 
another."  
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old former Orange policeman said he intends to seek reelection 
when his term expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to remain on the Board of Supervisors, rather than seek higher 
office, has been largely a personal one, he said. The most recent opportunity 
came when Vasquez was approached to run for statewide office with Gov. Pete 
Wilson this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are political watchers, I guess, place a higher value on attaining 
higher political office than in raising a child," Vasquez said, referring to 
his 14-year-old son. "My child will not be a casualty of my political ambition. 
I'm still in my 30s, relatively young. . . . What's the rush?" 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about Vasquez's future has always been somewhat of a sport in 
Orange County, but rarely have his colleagues, local political consultants and 
friends talked so strongly about their feelings of frustration with his 
decisions to pass on higher office or wondered aloud about his continuing 
interest in government. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has passed up opportunities so many times," said Dan Wooldridge, a local 
political consultant and former longtime aide to county supervisors. "There is 
a clock ticking out there. Gaddi has not been aggressively pursuing things nor 
has he been as energetic on some issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said that while he cannot imagine Vasquez working 
outside of government, there is a sense that "things have not fallen in place 
the way (Vasquez) hoped." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that his goal was to get a position in the public eye," Riley 
said, referring to the oft-rumored opportunities for Vasquez in the former Bush 
Administration. "There are people in Orange County who don't know him." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a local consultant representing candidates of an opposing political 
stripe, Jeff Adler said that Vasquez has always represented a local political 
force but has remained virtually untested since his appointment by Gov. George 
Deukmejian in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been considered the shooting star of the Republican Party, but he has 
not stepped out," Adler said. "By and large, I think he is probably somewhat 
forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, others are more blunt in their assessments but prefer to remain 
anonymous because of their close association with Vasquez.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling that he's losing interest after seven years," said one local 
official. "He's not been a happy camper. I get a sense that the business 
community feels like he can't make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "He's really been frustrated by life in the fishbowl. He wants 
to get out and leave the crap behind." 
</P>
<P>
 All of those assessments, Vasquez says, are simply not accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is concerned about how people view political figures these days. 
But that has not been enough to drive him away from public service. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Johns, a leader in the politically influential Lincoln Club and a big 
contributor to local campaigns, said there will likely be other opportunities 
for Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no such thing as a limited number of shots," Johns said. "Those of 
us who were trying to get one of the most articulate Hispanics who exist to run 
would have loved to see him on the statewide ticket. He would have been a 
wonderful addition. But I can't fault the guy for thinking about it and coming 
to a decision. I wouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said Vasquez's speeches at the past two Republican National Conventions 
made the supervisor "a big name for us. . . . I'd be surprised if he left" 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 There are others, though, who have noticed an increasing hesitation by Vasquez 
to use his bank of political capital to tackle pressing concerns dogging the 
county.  
</P>
<P>
 More recently, and on a matter directly affecting his south-central county 
district, Vasquez could hardly be found as the early debate over who would 
control conversion planning for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station threatened to 
careen out of the supervisors' control, Wooldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On El Toro, he deferred to Riley," Wooldridge said, referring to the 
supervisor whose South County district includes the military base. Vasquez "did 
not play a visible role." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez's early absence was noticed by South County officials and lampooned in 
a cartoon published by the Saddleback Valley News last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooldridge said the most recent gauge of Vasquez's apparent detachment from 
the issue might have been when Lincoln Club leaders approached the board to 
seek approval for a ballot measure that would allow voters to decide whether 
the base should be converted to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not among the first board members that the Lincoln Club people went 
to," Wooldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez also chose to be silent last summer when the Orange County Grand Jury 
issued a controversial report on illegal immigration that called for a 
three-year moratorium on all immigration -- legal and illegal -- into the 
country.  
</P>
<P>
 All of the supervisors were slow to respond publicly to the report, but it was 
Vasquez -- the only Latino on the board -- whose silence was particularly 
noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vasquez said his silence has been misinterpreted, particularly on the 
issue of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is that I was extensively involved in the El Toro 
issue," he said. "I traveled to Washington. I spent a lot of time researching 
and gathering facts. It's just not my style to engage in public exchanges until 
I've had the benefit of knowing all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some people define leadership as 'What have you done for me lately?' 
" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the grand jury report, the supervisor said the board adequately 
addressed the issue when it released its written response, indicating that the 
county had little control over immigration issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself very fortunate to serve in the county in which I was 
raised," he said. "I like local government. I'm not in a hurry."

DANA PARSONS: SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT 'BARBAROUS' ACTS AGAINST RAPISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We know we have an imperfect justice system, but do we have to be reminded of 
it so starkly? And so often? 
</P>
<P>
 An imperfect system often creates problems without solutions; one sure sign of 
a problem without a solution is that it prompts public officials -- apparently 
driven to say something -- to make inane or misguided remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson and Orange County's state Sen. Marian Bergeson filled that role 
nicely in the matter surrounding the imminent prison release of convicted 
serial rapist Melvin Carter. More on that later. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's parole, after a criminal career in which he confessed to more than 
100 rapes, comes at roughly the midpoint of a 25-year sentence. The current 
plan is to release him in the small, remote northern California community of 
Alturas, the backup choice after Bay Area citizens created a ruckus when it was 
suggested Carter go there. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us subscribe, if sometimes grudgingly, to the notion of allowing 
ex-cons the chance at a new life after paying their debt to society. In our 
minds, though, we're thinking of the burglar, the forger, the hit-and-run 
driver and, yes, depending on the circumstances, sometimes even the murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 But it stretches anyone's sense of fair play to ask society to take back 
someone with more than 100 rapes against his name. Even more dangerous than 
someone who killed in a moment of passion or anger, a serial rapist who has 
reached triple figures has, it seems to me, forfeited any legitimate right to 
live among us. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the system is so vexing, because Carter is being paroled according 
to the letter of the law. He's eligible for early release because he's been a 
good prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost comical to note that he hasn't raped a woman during his entire 
incarceration. For that, he's entitled to parole. 
</P>
<P>
 My impulse would have been to give him, at best, a cookie. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure the governor doesn't want Carter released, either, but he sounded 
horribly callous when he suggested it's better to have him in a remote area 
than in a populated one. Lapsing into his sometimes odd-sounding tough-guy 
talk, Wilson called Carter an "animal" who should be released "out in the 
wilderness someplace where he will have absolutely the least possible 
opportunity to hurt another young woman." 
</P>
<P>
 That must have been very comforting to the women of Alturas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also supports Bergeson's bill that would give life sentences without 
parole to first-time rapists and child molesters. Let's hope the Legislature is 
not so far around the bend on crime that it considers passing such an extreme 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't Wilson's fault Carter won't do his 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what to do with the Melvin Carters of the world, who at 49 is not beyond 
his physical potential as a rapist? 
</P>
<P>
 Please indulge me while I borrow from New Yorker magazine. In its lead essay 
in the March 7 issue, the historically liberal magazine raised the question of 
voluntary castration of repeat sex offenders in exchange for sentencing 
considerations. The essay quoted from studies indicating that sex criminals 
repeat their crimes more often than do other offenders, often committing "an 
appalling number of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine pointed out that one of every six offenders in state and federal 
prisons is a sex offender. Ideally, the sex offenders would learn in prison how 
to curb their tendencies, but, obviously, many do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why, then," the New Yorker asks, "resist the demands of men who are willing 
to risk sacrificing sexual activity in order to be free of their damaging 
impulses?" The magazine noted that, far from being barbaric, the technique is 
used in at least eight Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments that castration, even voluntary, is immoral amounts to "an odd 
double standard," the New Yorker noted. Citing for comparative purposes women 
who choose to have their uterus removed because of excessive premenstrual 
tension or those who choose to have abortions, the essay then adds, with mock 
disdain: "But a man who molests children or brutalizes women can't ask to have 
his testicles removed, because that would be barbarous." 
</P>
<P>
 The essay concluded by noting, "Our society is so squeamish when it comes to 
discussing sexual deviance that we tend to demonize sex offenders, forgetting 
that in many cases they themselves are victims, not only of sexual abuse in 
their own childhood but also of their overwhelming sexual impulses. Most of 
them, every time they exercise their sexual preference, break the law. It 
amounts to fraud when we offer these men treatment that doesn't work. If 
castration helps, why not let them have what they want?" 
</P>
<P>
 It has been argued over the years that rape is a crime of violence, not sex. 
Other studies challenge that. Wherever the truth lies, it probably is not a 
distinction that means a great deal to the vast majority of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Two things are certain in the meantime: Prisons will continue filling up with 
sex offenders, some who may get increasingly violent in light of the new "three 
strikes" provision, and women will continue fearing the likes of a Melvin 
Carter suddenly at large in their town.

CARJACK SUSPECT SAYS POLICE ERROR KILLED GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Compton man denied Saturday that he or his girlfriend made any threatening 
moves toward an Anaheim police officer who shot and killed the 26-year-old 
woman at the conclusion of a car chase on the Riverside Freeway Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at the Orange County Jail, Timothy Mark Jackson, 31, who was 
arrested on suspicion of murder and carjacking, said the veteran police officer 
shot the woman -- identified Saturday as Compton resident Tomiko Jones -- as 
the pair tried to flee from a truck that had been carjacked minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police (officer) made a mistake. He shot when he wasn't supposed to," 
Jackson said during an interview at the jail, where he is being held on 
$250,000 bail. "He was trigger-happy." 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma Police Chief Dave S. Barr said Friday that the unidentified officer 
fired after Jackson or Jones made "some kind of movement that the officer was 
protecting himself from" as the pair exited the allegedly carjacked truck near 
the Valley View Street off-ramp in La Palma, shortly after 7:30 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr said Friday that no weapon was found on either person, but a source in 
the Anaheim Police Department has said that investigators have found a weapon 
believed used in the carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma and Anaheim police refused further comment Saturday, except to 
identify Jones for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he told Jones to flee as she slowed the vehicle to a halt on the 
shoulder of the freeway. Police have said Jackson was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her to pull over," Jackson said. "I told her to run. I ran, she ran. I 
heard one shot and she was dead. I laid down howling." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, however, Jones and Jackson tumbled down an embankment 
together after Jones was shot. Jones died at the scene and Jackson was taken 
into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the felony murder rule, a suspect can be charged with homicide whenever 
someone is killed during the commission of certain felonies. As a result, 
Jackson is being held on suspicion of both homicide and carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the unidentified carjacking victim picked up Jones, whom police 
have described as a prostitute, outside the Rustic Inn in the 900 block of 
Beach Boulevard in Anaheim while she was hitchhiking. Jones directed the man to 
an isolated spot near the motel, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jackson appeared, pointed a handgun at the driver and ordered him out of 
the 1993 Ford Ranger, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver called 911, and a police helicopter soon spotted the car heading 
westbound on the Riverside Freeway, where Anaheim police later pulled it over 
on the shoulder. La Palma police arrived after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the shooting, as 
it does all officer-involved shootings. The officer, a sergeant with 21 years 
of experience, has been placed on paid administrative leave for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who said he is a gardener, was sentenced to prison for two years in 
1987 for burglary and grand theft auto before being released in July, 1990, 
according to the California Department of Corrections. He returned to prison 
the same year, after being sentenced to three years for vehicle theft. He was 
released on parole in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he maintained his innocence in connection with Thursday night's 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said the truck was stolen. They said maybe we had a gun. That's not the 
truth. The truck was given to us. We drove off in the truck." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he believes the officer who shot Jones lost control, while other 
officers at the scene remained calm. "If I had asked the other police there if 
they would have shot, they probably wouldn't have shot," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the couple has an 8-month-old daughter, Jasmine, who was in the care 
of an aunt in Compton before Thursday's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how Jones earned a living, he said: "She did what she had to do to 
live." * OFFICER SHOOTS BOY

SCOTT HARRIS: A COMMUNITY IN SEARCH OF A REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps you've heard about the latest effort to redraw the map of the San 
Fernando Valley. Map making is, of course, the favorite pastime in the land 
where West Hills broke away from Canoga Park, where Sepulveda was reborn as 
North Hills, where Sherman Oaks expands and Van Nuys shrinks. To quote the 
philosopher Andre Agassi: "Image is everything." 
</P>
<P>
 This latest map is a work of whimsy getting circulated by fax. "The San 
Fragmented Valley" features such towns as "Reseded," "Calabashedus," and 
"Slightly Further North Hollywood." It offers as landmarks the "Northridge 
Crashin' Center," the "Faultbrook Mauled" and the "Rockendyne" plant. Its 
roadways include "Interquake 5," "Devonsheared Boulevard" and "I Need a Plumber 
Street." 
</P>
<P>
 And a new name for Winnetka is nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Winnetka. You are just so obscure, so anonymous. Even the San Fragmented 
Valley snubs you. And in the latest serious example of the Valley's chronic 
identity crisis, you're being abused by your own people. A group of southside 
Winnetkans who live in an area often confused with Canoga Park want their 
neighborhood to be annexed to Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Got that? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a neighborhood that is dissing Winnetka and Canoga Park at the same 
time. These Woodland Hills wanna-bes can be found in a Neighborhood Watch area 
of 348 homes, bordered by Vanowen Street, Mason Avenue, Victory Boulevard and 
Winnetka Avenue (which is much better known than the community for which it was 
named.) This is a small portion of Winnetka as a whole, as defined by city 
planners and the 91306 ZIP code, roughly bounded by Victory on the south, 
DeSoto on the west, Nordhoff on the north and Corbin on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to understand why these southside Winnetkans often confused for 
Canoga Parkers desire to be nouveau Woodland Hillbillies. To quote the 
philosopher Fred Sands: "Location, location, location." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knows what's going on here. When that southern sliver of Van Nuys 
suddenly became the northern bank of Sherman Oaks, it helped property values. 
Similarly, a Woodland Hills address is more valuable than a Winnetka address. 
Or, given the confusion, a Canoga Park address. "Sure," Melanie Teeter 
acknowledged to my colleague Jill Leovy. "You'd be stupid to say property 
values don't play a role." 
</P>
<P>
 Teeter is a leader of what might be called the "Winnetka, Ferget Ya" movement. 
Property values aren't the only concern. A Woodland Hills moniker, they insist, 
will give them political muscle as well. Indeed, many of these south Winnetkans 
have joined the Woodland Hills Homeowners Assn., which is happy to expand its 
membership and sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining a homeowner group is one thing. But when these constituents approached 
Councilwoman Laura Chick with their petitions, she did not tell them what they 
wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Chick explains it, the Winnetka, Ferget Ya movement has its roots in 
the traffic, parking and trash headaches created by the annual July 4 
celebration across the border in Woodland Hills. Winnetka homeowners sensed 
that Woodland Hills had solved similar problems because of its pull with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick says she promised to help the neighborhood with the problems. But she 
opposes name changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the causes," Chick says. "People are very frustrated that 
serious problems in neighborhoods aren't being addressed." Crime and graffiti 
are eroding the quality of life, Chick says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to feel if they can disassociate their neighborhood with the 
negatives associated with the name, things will be better. But crime and 
graffiti and things like that don't change by changing the name . . . 
Concentrating on that gets in the way of concentrating on the real work that 
needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 She's right, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 But the funny thing about Winnetka isn't that it has a bad reputation. It's 
more like it has no reputation at all. This community, originally subdivided 
and marketed in acre plots for poultry farmers, is a betwixt and between kind 
of place sandwiched by better known communities. Another problem is the name: 
"Winnetka . . . Isn't that some town out in the Midwest?" Last summer, I dialed 
411 and asked for the number for the Winnetka Chamber of Commerce. "There 
really isn't a town called Winnetka," the voice confidently insisted. "It's 
just a street in Canoga Park." 
</P>
<P>
 It took some doing, but I did track down the Winnetka Chamber, and spoke to 
some proud Winnetkans. Not to be patronizing, but some of the nicest people 
I've met in the past year live in Winnetka. Well, come to think of it, they 
live in north Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to the South Winnetka Neighborhood Watch, Chick took care 
to praise the group for its good civic-minded deeds, such as the efforts to 
beautify the railroad right of way along Victory Boulevard. "Your group has 
undertaken tremendous efforts on behalf of the Winnetka community," she pointed 
out. "I take great pride in the Winnetka name and Winnetka residents and I want 
to enhance Winnetka's identity in the community, not chisel away at its 
borders." 
</P>
<P>
 Enhancing Winnetka's identity -- now there's a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Valley in Arleta, homeowners erected a handsome "Welcome to Arleta" 
sign and have campaigned to get their old ZIP code back. Winnetkans, however, 
don't seem the type to tout their community. They seem content with the town's 
anonymity. Would anybody really put a "Where the heck is Winnetka?" bumper 
sticker on their car? 
</P>
<P>
 It almost makes you wonder whether Winnetka is obscure by design . . . as if 
they have something to hide . . . as if the FBI created an entire town for 
participants in the federal witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to Al Capone's accountant, anyway? You think maybe he became 
a chicken rancher in the Valley?

COUNTY LOGS ITS SLOWEST GROWTH RATE IN DECADES; POPULATION: PLANNERS SAY 1.1% 
MAY BE SMALLEST INCREASE SINCE WORLD WAR II. RECESSION BLAMED IN EXODUS OF 
RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County grew at its slowest rate in decades last fiscal year, 
increasing by only 7,700 residents and lagging behind the region and the state 
for the fourth straight year, the state Department of Finance has reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 1.1% growth rate for the year ending last July was by far the 
lowest since annual record keeping began in 1960, and local planners said it is 
probably the lowest since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate was so low, according to state analysts, because for the first time 
more residents moved out of Ventura County than moved in from other states and 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, more residents have moved out of Ventura County than have 
moved here from the other 49 states. But until last year, enough foreign 
immigrants had settled here to more than offset the loss to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's net loss through migration was 647 residents last fiscal year, 
compared to a net gain of 3,577 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall population increase -- from 695,300 in July, 1992, to 703,000 last 
July -- occurred only because the county had 8,347 more births than deaths, 
state analysts reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has changed for nearly all the counties -- not as many people move in as 
move out," said Elizabeth Hoag, the state's principal population analyst. "It's 
a reflection of the recession in California. In the boom times, you rarely saw 
a negative for any county." 
</P>
<P>
 The new statistics reaffirm Ventura County's recession-stalled, slow-growth 
trend of the 1990s, county planner Steve Wood said. But Wood said he is 
surprised by the extent of the reported slowdown and dubious that the state 
growth figure is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no explanation for it, and just off the top of my head I don't think 
that's accurate," he said. "It could be as low as 9,000 or 9,500, but I don't 
think 7,700 is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood noted that two years ago the Department of Finance's fiscal year report 
estimated that Ventura County lost 44 residents to migration, but that the 
final figure was increased by more than 3,000. The state figures are considered 
provisional because they do not include final counts for births and deaths, and 
migration figures are sometimes refined, Hoag said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so sure that when they take another look at this next year that 
they're going to hold to these numbers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Job increase or loss often dictates population growth, Wood said, and Ventura 
County's civilian workers increased from 395,000 to 398,000 during 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 However, two other employment figures support state growth estimates. The 
number of jobs by companies in this county dropped from about 246,000 to 
242,000 over the same period. And the county's unemployment rate was 10.4% last 
July, the highest rate in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local analysts said other factors -- such as housing costs and 
concerns about education and crime -- may also have led to a migration out of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, population growth statewide was only 1.4% last year, the smallest gain 
in two decades, and Southern California grew by only 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The meager statewide growth resulted from a continuing exodus of jobs and 
workers to other states, officials said. The state lost 252,000 people to other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 But California still grew to 31.7 million residents, up 442,000 in one year, 
thanks to 319,000 new residents from foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's growth rate was 49th among California's 58 counties. Of the 
six counties of Southern California, only Los Angeles County's increase of 0.7% 
was less. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial County led the region with a 4.5% increase. Riverside and Orange 
counties were next, with increases of 2.7% and 1.7%. San Bernardino County's 
increase was 1.6% and San Diego's 1.1% 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Central Coast, Santa Barbara County grew 1.1% and San Luis Obispo 
County 1.6% 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing a trend, the Gold Rush country of Northern California remained the 
fastest-growing region, at 2.7%, followed by the San Joaquin Valley at 2.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rural counties grew at the fastest rate. Among large urban counties, only 
Riverside, Fresno, Kern and San Joaquin ranked among the top 30 counties in 
rate of growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Finance bases its twice-a-year population estimates on 
changes in such data as births, deaths, school enrollment, registered voters, 
driver's licenses, address changes, registered autos, housing units and 
income-tax returns. Low Population Growth 
</P>
<P>
 Population increases in Ventura County are the lowest in at least three 
decades, and the rate of growth is only about one-third of peak years in the 
1980s. 04,08,12,10,12 Fiscal Total Yearly Percent of Year Population Increase

AFTER 17 YEARS, DREAM HOME IS STILL THAT -- JUST A DREAM; DEVELOPMENT: COURT 
SAYS COASTAL COMMISSION PUT A MALIBU MAN THROUGH BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS 'BEYOND 
THE RIDICULOUS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ken Healing set out to build his dream home in the mountains above Malibu 
17 years ago, friends warned him to be patient about getting permits approved. 
</P>
<P>
 They understated their advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Healing's 2 1/2-acre parcel overlooking the Pacific Ocean became the focus of 
one the longest disputes ever to involve the California Coastal Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Healing's daughter was in diapers when the conflict began. She was preparing 
to graduate from high school last month when a state appeals court accused the 
Coastal Commission of irrational delays that soared "beyond both the ridiculous 
and the sublime," and ordered the panel to reconsider Healing's application to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted then was to build a house for my growing family," said Healing, 
43. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyers accused the Coastal Commission, which controls development of the 
state's 1,100-mile coastline, of engaging in some world-class foot-dragging as 
a way to prevent Healing from realizing his dream. 
</P>
<P>
 In siding with Healing, the appeals panel ranked the Coastal Commission's 
actions among "many virtuoso performances in the theaters of bureaucracy."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the legal triumph, Healing acknowledges that it still may take years 
to settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 He doubts that he will ever live on his property. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I wanted it for a house," he said. "Then I thought the investment 
value would be nice for retirement.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lately, I'm wondering if my heirs will get something." 
</P>
<P>
 Property rights advocates, who contend that government exercises too strong a 
hand in regulating land use, were pleased with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending his fate before the commission, the judges gave Healing the right to 
have a separate court proceeding to determine whether the agency's regulation 
amounted to an unconstitutional "taking" of his land. A ruling in his favor 
would entitle him to financial compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, such challenges against a state agency have been handled 
administratively, with plaintiffs unable to obtain a jury trial or subpoena 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the court's ruling as highly significant for property owners 
throughout the state who are battling bureaucratic nightmares," said Victor J. 
Wolski, a lawyer with the nonprofit Pacific Legal Foundation, which is 
representing Healing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission is expected to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Healing's saga began after he paid $40,000 for the property, with its gleaming 
views of the ocean and nearby canyon, as an ideal spot for the family home. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was first told by the commission staff that he would be unable to 
build because the property was in an area of environmentally sensitive habitat. 
That same year, the commission turned down a similar request from the owner of 
a nearby parcel. At that point, Healing said, "I put my plans on the shelf," 
figuring it would do no good to persist.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten years went by. In 1987, upon learning that the habitat area's boundaries 
had been changed to exclude his property, he decided to approach the Coastal 
Commission again. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, in what lawyer Wolski called "the classic bureaucratic maze," 
the coastal panel ruled that it could not approve Healing's plans until they 
had passed muster with a county environmental review board. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County, which had for years resisted adopting a local coastal 
protection plan, did not have a review board. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, an appraiser hired by Healing determined that, with a building 
permit, the property was worth $200,000. Without one, it was worth $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
 During hearings, members of the coastal panel said they preferred that the 
property be held as parkland. But the nonprofit Mountains Restoration Trust, 
which had expressed interest in acquiring it, changed its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 After the coastal panel denied his request, Healing turned to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's a case of big government steamrolling the individual," he said. 
"I see them approving huge commercial developments and I only wanted to build a 
2,750-square-foot house." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy state Atty. Gen. Peter Kaufman defends the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the commission had approved (development of) his lot, it would have opened 
the door for 25 others to develop nearby in a significant watershed area," 
Kaufman said. "His is a trigger point for other properties."

BILL BOYARSKY: PLAIN TALK CUTS THROUGH FOG ON COUNTY BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you can pierce the fog of bureaucratese and double talk, the annual budget 
battle among Los Angeles County, Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature is one of 
California's most entertaining and instructive political fights. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, it promises to be more interesting than usual because of a new 
participant, Sally Reed, the county administrative officer. In her last job as 
Santa Clara County administrative officer, she was quick to make tough 
budget-cutting decisions, a quality rare at the Los Angeles County Hall of 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget battle is about how much aid the state will give the county to 
maintain essential services, especially health care for the poor, law 
enforcement and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-but-impenetrable language of the debate is the legacy of years of 
combat and compromise necessary to maintain services no longer affordable under 
the restrictions of Proposition 13, the famous property tax limit imposed by 
the voters in 1978.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reed is a straightforward, serious-looking woman who speaks plain English 
rather than bureaucratese. In her previous job in Santa Clara County, she 
pushed through big spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a troubling experience. "I literally felt people would die because of 
my decisions," she said during a recent lunch with Times writers and editors. 
"But you make those tough decisions and the worst outcome doesn't happen. 
People won't die. The system will manage to handle the most serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 When she took over her post here a few months ago, she analyzed the way Los 
Angeles County has dealt with its budget shortfalls since Proposition 13 
passed, and didn't like what she saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that homeowners love Proposition 13 because it limits property taxes, 
no politician has dared tamper with it. So each year, the county supervisors 
have gambled that the state will bail out the county. Trying to help, state 
legislators have worked with the supervisors to search out every loophole and 
obscure funding provision in the state budget to keep the county hospitals, the 
courts and the jails operating no matter how much Proposition 13 limited taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 During these negotiations, the supes would cry poverty as they tried to 
squeeze every dollar from Sacramento. But later in the year, after the budget 
fight was over, county fiscal officers would report a "miracle," the discovery 
of a previously unnoticed nest egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after the state budget was passed, the supervisors would approve a 
county spending plan. This permitted them to combine state aid with money from 
the previously hidden county funds.  
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the state is even more broke than the county and is extremely 
unlikely to provide the extra funds L.A. County needs to balance its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 With the county facing a $900-million budget deficit in the current fiscal 
year, Reed is proposing to change the rules of the game. As she put it in a 
report to the supes in January: "The county has relied on a number of stopgap 
budgetary practices in order to maintain services in the face of severe 
budgetary shortfalls. In the long run, these practices are detrimental to sound 
fiscal management." And, she added, "with each successive budget miracle, the 
credibility of the county's fiscal plight has been damaged. This has undermined 
our advocacy effort in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 She proposed making big cuts now, and passing the county budget by June 17 
without waiting for the state to bail out L.A. County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will demonstrate that the board has taken all steps necessary to move 
the county toward establishing fiscal stability within its own means," she told 
the board. "Any relief from Sacramento cannot be relied upon at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another side of the story, and it was heard last Tuesday when Reed 
brought the supervisors her proposal to pass the budget in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hundreds of thousands of people dependent on county services are 
mentally ill men, women and children cared for in nonprofit centers that are 
partially financed by county funds. As private donations dwindled during the 
recession, the county money became more important to the survival of these 
psychiatric care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Richard Van Horn, chief executive officer of the Mental Health 
Assn. of Los Angeles County, sat in the audience in the board's hearing room, 
along with Gloria Nebrit, who heads the Kedren mental health center in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kedren provides care to about 3,000, she said. She and Van Horn said they 
opposed the Reed strategy. They wanted a vote on the county budget delayed 
until the state acted. They were confident they could persuade legislators that 
the mental health centers were worthwhile enough to deserve a bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 They proved more persuasive than Reed, whose plan was defeated 3 to 2 by the 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my experience that they are a very powerful lobby, so we ought to give 
them a chance before we cut these mental health programs," said Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, the Board of Supervisors chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a defeat for Reed. Once again, the board refused to come to grips with 
Proposition 13. But because of Reed, at least we know what's going on. Los 
Angeles County is not living within its limited income.

WINTER'S PARTING SHOT; WEATHER: FINAL STORMS OF THE SEASON BRING FLOODING, 
ACCIDENTS, POWER OUTAGES AND HAILSTONES. THREE ARE KILLED ON SLICK ROADS DURING 
THE WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The last storms of winter swept through Los Angeles on Saturday with fast and 
furious downpours that caused traffic accidents, flooding and power outages. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three people were killed in traffic accidents on rain-slick streets 
since late Friday, and emergency officials rushed to respond to nearly nonstop 
reports of vehicle crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-moving series of thunder and lightning storms rumbled in off the 
Pacific Ocean and gained intensity inland, where they closed highways, flooded 
streets and houses, interrupted electrical service to thousands of homes and 
briefly knocked out the power in the Los Angeles County Fire Department 
dispatch center, filling the facility with smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a flash and a boom" as the power and lights went off, Battalion 
Chief Gene Wolfe said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said firefighters at first were worried that a lightning strike had 
crippled the facility's computer dispatching system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just scared the living poo out of us," Wolfe said. However, fire officials 
were able to quickly restore the facility's power except for one bank of 
lights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 calls poured into the dispatch center from Eastside residents 
asking for aid in dealing with flooded streets and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A stretch of the Santa Ana Freeway was under five feet of water on the 
Eastside and it was closed to traffic at Atlantic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters responded to a steady stream of auto accidents caused by the 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic accident after traffic accident all day long," Wolfe said. "It's been 
a pretty busy day." 
</P>
<P>
 A man was killed and two people were injured in a car that went out of control 
and sheared off a power pole in Palmdale about 1 p.m., according to the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Accidents on slick streets also claimed two lives Friday night. One man was 
killed when he lost control of his car on the Foothill Freeway near Glendora 
and was broadsided by a van. In another accident, a passenger was killed when a 
car went out of control and hit a tree on Vallecito Drive in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service issued flash-flood and mudslide warnings for 
Southern California hillside areas that were burned last fall, but by nightfall 
the warnings were canceled for the Green Meadow, Old Topanga and Laguna 
regions. By 9 p.m. the warnings were also canceled for the Kinneloa and Banning 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather officials reported that the storms dropped varying quantities of rain 
over a widespread area. By evening, 1.51 inches of rain had fallen in Monrovia, 
while 0.57 of an inch was reported in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The downpours were sometimes intense. In the Civic Center, 0.74 of an inch of 
rain fell within about 20 minutes during the afternoon, according to weather 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,400 homes in the San Fernando Valley suffered temporary losses of 
electrical power, according to Debra Sass, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 Brief but dramatic hailstorms were reported on the Eastside and in Monterey 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw hailstones the size of big jawbreakers just pelting down," said 
sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear, who was working in the department's headquarters in 
Monterey Park. "I'm glad my car was parked under an awning."

POLITICS '94 / GEBE MARTINEZ; A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S 
POLITICAL LIFE. ; DORNAN DOES HIS HOMEWORK EVERYWHERE -- EVEN IN HIS DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where's Bob?: Local Democratic Party leaders have often claimed that Rep. 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) seems to make more appearances on the Rush 
Limbaugh national radio talk show than in his district. He didn't even come 
home to announce his reelection campaign, they point out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the conservative Republican, who has entertained thoughts of running for 
President in 1996, says he takes his assignments for the House Armed Services 
Committee and House Select Committee on Intelligence seriously and has been 
doing homework in places ranging from the South Pole to Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan says that does not mean he doesn't know what's going on in his central 
Orange County district. Nor has he forgotten that he is the "gang-center 
congressman," a reference to the large amount of violent gang activity in the 
cities he represents. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, he plans to ride the streets of Santa Ana in a police cruiser to 
get a closer look at the crime problem. He will also be scheduling ride-alongs 
with police in Detroit, New York City and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives me a feeling of the differences in the police work in different 
cities," Dornan explains. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the home front: Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) may be the 
Democratic nominee for state attorney general, but he's hardly the general in 
his own home. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, a major in the Army Reserve, is now outranked by his wife, Robin, who 
became a lieutenant colonel during ceremonies Saturday at the Army Reserve 
Center in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 A nurse in the reserve, she was among the weekend warriors called up during 
Operation Desert Storm in 1990. Tom had to balance his duties in Sacramento 
with raising the couple's three children back home in Orange County, earning 
headlines as the Legislature's "Mr. Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 How is life at home now that Lt. Col. Umberg outranks Maj. Umberg? The 
assemblyman makes no bones about it. "It's getting embarrassing," he laments 
only half in jest, "having to salute her in front of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * Let's have lunch: Supervisor Roger R. Stanton says Newport Beach businessman 
George L. Argyros showed a lot of nerve recently when he chewed out the Board 
of Supervisors for not backing a November ballot initiative calling for a 
commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguing for the airport initiative, Argyros said there are already plenty 
of studies on whether commercial passenger and cargo planes can take off from 
El Toro's runways, but that the supervisors "did not have the guts to make the 
decision now." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton replies: "I think it was pretty darn gutsy to tell three powerful 
friends (on the Board of Supervisors) that you don't agree with them. I have no 
hard feelings. I feel I've done my duty." 
</P>
<P>
 * Left out in the middle: In one of the hottest local races this year, the 
three GOP candidates in the 70th Assembly District race met at their first 
candidates' forum last week. Conservatives Tom Reinecke, an attorney, and 
Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond rarely disagreed with each other, but 
they distanced themselves from Marilyn Brewer, a businesswoman who calls 
herself the only "mainstream Republican" in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond and Reinecke, for example, said they support former Orange County Rep. 
William E. Dannemeyer, a Fullerton Republican, in his bid to unseat Democratic 
incumbent U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. But Brewer is backing Rep. Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to differentiate between a "mainstream" and a "moderate" 
Republican, Brewer said mainstreamers are fiscal conservatives who want 
"government out of our bedrooms, we want government out of our pocketbooks, and 
we want government out of our boardrooms." Hammond said a mainstream Orange 
County Republican is on the "conservative side" of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 But the audience laughed when Reinecke responded: "I don't know what 
(mainstream) means. I think it means it would be a moderate or even a liberal." 
UPCOMING EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight: Several local GOP groups hold a candidates' forum to be moderated by 
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), beginning at 6 p.m. at the Balboa Bay 
Club, 1221 Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi will be the Valley 
High School principal for a few hours as part of his campaign program to take 
on the everyday jobs of California workers. Beginning at 12:45 p.m., Garamendi 
speaks to the Democratic Club of Seal Beach Leisure World, at Clubhouse 4 
located near the intersection of Seal Beach Boulevard and Golden Rain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: Coro Orange County sponsors a panel discussion of the county's top 
races at the Irvine Co. Exhibit, 550 Newport Center Drive, at 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: United We Stand holds a forum for candidates in the 70th Assembly 
District race at the Irvine Ranch Water District, 15,600 Sand Canyon Ave., 
beginning at 7 p.m.

CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION; WITH GANG TRUCE HOLDING, LIFE IN EL MODENA AREA IS MORE 
LIVABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Mauro Barron, 12, gazed at friends playing volleyball at the community center 
here Saturday and said he no longer feels any pressure to join one of the 
neighborhood gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They let you mind your own business now," said Barron, accompanied by his 
4-year-old brother, Gregory. "My dad says we have to come inside when it gets 
dark, because he thinks it's not safe at night. But it's much better now. There 
used to be a lot of drive-by shootings." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they tell you to keep it up at school, to pursue your dreams," Barron 
said of the area's Pearl Street and Varrio Modena Locos gangs. "I like to come 
here to play basketball and street hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron was one of about 100 teen-agers and young adults, many with arrest 
records, who came to the El Modena Community Center on Saturday afternoon 
partly to celebrate the gang truce that has calmed this neighborhood since last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Steaks donated by local markets sizzled on the barbecue. Young men pumped iron 
and shot pool in the center's recreation room as rap music blared from a 
stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the truce has been working out pretty good," said a 16-year-old who 
asked that he be referred to only as TJ. He said he was arrested for possessing 
and carrying a gun last year and is now on probation. "The center helped me get 
a job. I worked as a janitor, picking up the trash. . . . Now I work at 
McDonald's. And I bought a car -- a 1982 Pontiac Grand Prix." 
</P>
<P>
 Although TJ retains his gang affiliation, he's a role model for the other 
teen-agers, said Bob Pusavat, Orange County's director of housing and community 
development. "A lot of kids look up to him," he said. "TJ has a good job. He 
may own his own business someday. This is a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that we can get along," Pusavat said. "We don't have to kill 
each other. You don't have to resort to violence to settle something." 
</P>
<P>
 Since June, rival gangs have been meeting here once a month to talk out their 
differences instead of settling them on the street. It doesn't necessarily end 
hostilities, but there have been fewer shootings in the unincorporated, 
sheriff's-patrolled neighborhood near the city of Orange, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center attempts to keep everyone busy with activities ranging from trips 
to Big Bear Lake and Magic Mountain to boxing matches and job counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Once feared in the community as a tough gang leader during his youth, John 
Esquivel now volunteers many hours each week at the center as an adult. 
Esquivel, whose nickname is "Bogart," agreed that the truce that began months 
ago seems to be holding. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want to feel wanted by somebody," Esquivel said of the local teens. 
</P>
<P>
 John Marques, a county employee who helps staff the center, ran upstairs, 
opened a drawer in an old, donated wooden desk, and pulled out a red bandanna. 
"You see this?" said Marques. "Once we wore these to fit in. . . . You don't 
see them anymore. For months, nobody's worn them." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, watching a dozen girls play volleyball, a 20-year-old man who 
requested anonymity said he is still worried about being hassled by the cops. 
But he feels better about the community now, and has invited a friend, Efrain 
Leanos, 21, from Garden Grove, to the barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word is getting out that this is the place to come because it's neutral 
turf," said Leanos, sporting an Oakland A's baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot safer now," added Yvette Sepulveda, 17, one of about 30 girls 
who have become active at the center. "It's the activities, like this 
barbecue," she said. "It keeps everyone off the streets. There's been a real 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Pusavat and other officials agreed. He said graffiti once covered the 
neighborhood but now show up only once in awhile. And violent crime, while not 
extinguished, is much rarer, according to sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Marisa Alaniz, 17, said she found a couple of girls just hanging out in the 
neighborhood and took them into her house. "They were runaways," Alaniz said. 
"I didn't know who to talk to, but I came here and started talking about the 
problem, which involved parents with alcohol problems. The girls went home, but 
the parents came here for help." 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep this place open until 9 at night, which really helps a lot," Alaniz 
said. "As a result, more and more kids come here to kick back. And that's much 
better than the way it was."

TIMES STAFFERS LEAD THE PACK AT O.C. PRESS CLUB AWARDS; JOURNALISM: WATCHDOG 
AWARD GOES TO SERIES ABOUT WATER DISTRICT ABUSES THAT LED TO CHANGES IN STATE 
LAW. REGISTER WINS SECOND MOST.

<P>
 Staffers from The Los Angeles Times Orange County Edition won the Orange 
County Press Club's most prestigious award, along with 50 other prizes, at the 
club's 39th annual awards ceremony Saturday night. Among the paper's prizes 
were 17 first-place honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the ceremony in the Sheraton Newport Beach Hotel, former Times staffer 
Bill Billiter was honored with the Press Club's Sky Dunlap Award for career 
excellence and contribution to the Orange County community. Billiter, 59, 
retired in December after 15 years with the Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Register earned the second most awards, with 28 winners and 
10 first-place awards. Other local publications that earned prizes were the 
Orange County Metropolitan, Orange County Business Journal, South County News, 
North County News and Orange Coast magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Capturing the prestigious Watchdog Award for excellence in reporting about 
public officials were Times reporters Gregory Crouch and Mark Platte, who 
co-authored a series last spring uncovering a series of ethical violations and 
financial abuses by officials of the Santa Margarita Water District. The series 
led to changes in state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges called the Santa Margarita project "an extremely well-written, 
well-researched series that triggered investigations of other public entities 
(and) brought about sweeping changes on the personnel and auditing procedures 
of the water board and led to the resignation of top officials." Shirley 
Grindle, a longtime local activist who has pressed for ethics reforms in all 
levels of county government, presented the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Times photographers Mark Boster and Alexander Gallardo each captured two 
first-place trophies. Boster won the portrait and news photo categories and 
placed second for photo illustration and photo portfolio. Gallardo took top 
honors in the portfolio competition and the sports photo category, and placed 
third in photo illustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Also earning two first-place trophies was Times artist Dennis Lowe, who won 
for best feature page layout and best graphic illustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Times writers picked up first-place prizes in a host of categories: Lily 
Dizon, who received the David McQuay Award for best column or commentary; Steve 
Emmons for best story on science or technology; Susan Howlett for best story on 
social issues; Matt Lait for best entertainment story; Barbie Ludovise for best 
sports story; Nancy Wride for best story on legal issues; and Dennis McLellan 
won the Marjorie Freeman Award for best humorous story. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff photographer Kari Rene Hall earned best photo illustration, while Robert 
Lachman of The Times garnered the award for best feature photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Copy editor Maria Laso Elders won for best headline portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Councilman Robert F. Gentry served as master of ceremonies 
for the event, at which last fall's devastating Laguna fire was the subject of 
winning entries in several categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Register earned top honors in the investigative category for articles 
titled "The Big Refugee Ripoff," by writers Tracy Weber, Kim Christensen and 
Tracey Eaton. Register staffer Jeff Collins won the beat category for his 
coverage of crime and the package/series category for his in-depth story about 
the murder of a teen-age girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Register first-place winners were: Ron Campbell for business/finance; 
Paul Carbo for best informational graphic and best graphic portfolio; Katie 
Hickox and Teri Sforza for best feature; Karen Kelso for best news page layout; 
Bruce Strong for best photo essay; and Tracy Weber and Jeordan Legon for best 
news story. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Giles of the Orange County Metropolitan won first place in the 
politics/government category and the Metropolitan's Tom Singer won for best 
magazine story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Business Journal's Peggy Hesketh won top honors for beat 
coverage among weekly publications, and Hesketh and Rick Reiff earned first 
place in the editorial category. 
</P>
<P>
 Among weekly publications, Petula Dvorak of the South County News won best 
feature and Greg Miller of the South County News won best news story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Press Club also awarded $3,000 in scholarships Saturday to six local 
college students. The winners were selected from 51 students who attended a 
mock press conference and wrote a news story on deadline the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Grice of Irvine Valley College won first place and $750 in the two-year 
college competition, while Michael Rocha of Cal State Fullerton got the top 
honor, and $750, in the four-year school competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Haar of Fullerton College and Adam Schiffer of Chapman each got $500 
for second place; Frances Lee of Fullerton College and Leigh Logan of Cal State 
Fullerton each got $250 for third. 
</P>

SANTA ANA OFFICER SHOOTS, WOUNDS BOY, 15; VIOLENCE: THE TEEN-AGER FLED WHEN HE 
AND 2 OTHERS, SUSPECTED IN A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING, WERE STOPPED IN A STATION 
WAGON, POLICE SAY. THE TEEN'S WOUND WAS TO HIS BACK.

<P>
 A police officer shot a 15-year-old assault suspect Saturday after the youth 
hopped out of a station wagon and tried to flee from officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, a suspect in a drive-by shooting, was in stable condition at 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana Saturday night with a bullet wound to the back 
of his left shoulder, Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said the shooting occurred about 12:45 p.m. after the teen-ager and two 
other youths led officers on a two-block car chase after a drive-by shooting. 
The officer shot the young man, who had been a passenger in the Suburban 
station wagon, at East Warner and South Standard avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication that the youth had fired at the police officer, or was 
carrying a gun at the time, although officers found two guns in the car, Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer involved, a 26-year department veteran, had not been interviewed 
yet Saturday, and investigators said they were unsure why he shot at the youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officer may have thought he saw a weapon, or the man may have reached for 
his waistband, we just don't know," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police did not release the juvenile's name or the name of the patrol 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting is the second officer-involved shooting in Orange County in a 
week. On Thursday, Anaheim police shot and killed a suspected carjacker in La 
Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers trace the beginnings of Saturday's confrontation to suspected gang 
violence earlier in the day, on a street about a mile away.  
</P>
<P>
 Several young men in a brown and beige 1982 Chevrolet Suburban station wagon 
chased a lone driver in a white Cadillac northbound on Halladay Street and 
started shooting at him after they turned west onto the 800 block of East 
Berkeley Street shortly after noon, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cadillac's driver -- 17-year-old Jose L. Monje, of Santa Ana -- was 
unharmed, Helton said. Bullet casings from guns of different calibers were 
found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol officers were alerted to be on the lookout for the station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 minutes later, the veteran officer -- who often patrols the 
neighborhood -- spotted the large station wagon heading south on Standard, 
toward Warner and gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 As another police car sped east on Warner and pulled a quick U-turn at the 
intersection, the veteran officer pulled in behind the station wagon, which 
stopped at the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old jumped out of a back passenger door and tried to flee west on 
Warner across a lawn, Helton said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Santa Ana officer fired at least two rounds, one which struck him in the 
left shoulder," Helton said.  
</P>
<P>
 Two others in the station wagon, ages 19 and 16, were arrested without 
incident on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon.  
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old, Irineo Ruiz of Santa Ana, was booked at the Santa Ana 
Detention Facility and held on $50,000 bail. The 16-year-old, whose name was 
not released because he is a juvenile, was taken to Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found two semiautomatic handguns in the station wagon -- one in 
the front seat, another in the back, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Vega, 11, was watching MTV in his home when he and his family heard two 
shots. "When I came out, the police officers were around a man on the ground," 
said Hugo, a McFadden Intermediate School student. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said shots are routinely heard around the area, part of the Delhi 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 A second bullet fired by the officer lodged between a window screen and a 
window frame of a small house in the 2300 block of South Evergreen Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Camarillo, a 50-year resident of the house, said she heard a noise when 
the bullet hit the home, but was unsure what it was. She became frightened when 
police came to pull the bullet from the window frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were sitting over there," Camarillo said, pointing into her living room, 
"and it had been a little lower, it could have been bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo said police told her to call city officials, who would repair the 
damage at no charge. "Maybe they (police) will be more careful next time," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said that standard Police Department procedure in the use of deadly 
force by an officer dictates that an officer may shoot a fleeing person 
suspected of a violent crime, or anyone who is endangering the life of a police 
officer or other person. He said that an assault with a deadly weapon satisfies 
the definition of a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators will not know whether the officer shot the teen-ager in the 
back, Helton said, until doctors determine the angle of the bullet's entry into 
the youth's shoulder.

SANTA ANA MAN FATALLY SHOT WHEN 'FLYER PARTY' IS CRASHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old man was fatally wounded after several men described as gang 
members opened fire in a crowded party Friday night, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 George John Rodriguez of Santa Ana was shot several times at the party in a 
home in the 1600 block of South Halladay Street, Santa Ana police said.Friends 
drove him to Coastal Communities Hospital, where he was pronounced dead about 
10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Two "party crews," groups of friends who put on parties often advertised by 
leaflets, had organized the party Friday night. At about 10:10 p.m., Sgt. Dan 
Carr said, several gang members crashed the party, where 30 to 50 people were 
in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 When organizers asked the alleged gang members to leave, the young men fired 
several shots, Carr said. Police found Rodriguez, a party guest, with multiple 
gunshot wounds. No arrests were made and no weapons were recovered, police 
said.

GUARD SHOOTS MAN AT KING HOSPITAL

<P>
 A man was in stable condition Saturday at Martin Luther King Jr./Charles Drew 
Medical Center after he was shot by a county safety officer whom he allegedly 
attacked at the hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred in the hospital's Augustus F. Hawkins psychiatric wing, 
but authorities were unsure if the wounded man, identified as Damon Ballou, 18, 
was a patient or a visitor, said Los Angeles Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballou was shot in the abdomen and was being treated at the hospital, Spear 
said. A hospital spokeswoman said Ballou was in stable condition Saturday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting will be investigated as if it were a deputy-involved shooting, 
Spear said. He said Ballou did not appear to have a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 County safety officers are similar to security guards, and work at county-run 
facilities.

VIETNAMESE FILE CLAIMS FOR CONFISCATED PROPERTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Le fled Vietnam in 1978, leaving behind his home, which he claims is now 
occupied by members of the Communist government. The Westminster man said he 
wants Vietnam to return his property, so he can either sell it or rent it out 
to provide income that his family here needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Le was one of the nearly 800 Vietnamese Americans who flooded the offices of 
the Vietnamese Community of Southern California on Saturday to file papers 
listing the properties that they said were confiscated by the Vietnamese 
government after the fall of Saigon in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 Vietnamese expatriates and Vietnamese Americans showed up at the 
office last week to file the forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which includes an elected slate of officials, is attempting 
to represent the interests of local Vietnamese Americans on a variety of 
matters. It will forward the claims to the U.S. State Department and ask the 
U.S. government to help retrieve the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to ask them for the property back," Le said. "I worked hard for that 
house -- with my sweat and tears. We are refugees. We came here empty-handed." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. and Vietnamese governments are to begin negotiations next month on 
the possibility of returning homes and businesses that were confiscated from 
U.S. companies and fleeing Vietnamese citizens when the Communists gained 
control of the country, Vu Nhu, first secretary of the Vietnamese mission to 
the United Nations in New York, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nhu said he could not comment on the likelihood that the property would be 
returned, but said the two governments will try to negotiate an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said claims by Vietnamese who lost their homes will probably reach $1 
billion. But claims by U.S. businesses could total $36 billion, Nhu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid to retrieve the properties has been made possible by warming relations 
between the United States and Vietnam, highlighted by President Clinton's Feb. 
3 decision to lift the economic embargo against Vietnam, said Lien Nguyen, who 
heads the Vietnamese Community organization's assets claims committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a request would have been unthinkable last year, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, the Vietnamese Communists played by the law of the jungle," said Ban 
Bui, president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California. "But now, if 
they want to join the civilized world, they have to play by civilized laws." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese Americans who filled out asset claim forms Saturday said they 
do not know whether their requests will be granted, but they believe that 
listing the lost properties will give them a chance of recovering their homes.

11 YOUTHS ARRESTED AS INGLEWOOD'S TOUGHER CURFEW GOES INTO EFFECT; CRACKDOWN: 
SIX SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS AND A 17-YEAR-OLD WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE ARE HELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inglewood police began a crackdown on loitering youths Friday night as a new 
city curfew took effect. Police arrested 11 minors on the streets between 11 
p.m. and 6 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, including six suspected gang members, were photographed, 
fingerprinted and cited before their parents were called. One of the 11 
arrested, a 17-year-old, was caught with an assault rifle and a loaded, 
30-round clip, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, minors on city streets must be accompanied by their parents or 
have a specific destination. The curfew will be in effect from 10 p.m. to 6 
a.m. Sundays through Thursdays. It begins an hour later on weekend nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy with the results," said Inglewood City Councilman Jose 
Fernandez, who helped design the curfew approved last month. "There were very 
few (violators) on the streets."

3 MEN ROB HOMEOWNER AT GUNPOINT

<P>
 Three men forced their way into a Buena Park house and robbed the owner at 
gunpoint, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men entered the house in the 6000 block of Homewood Avenue at 11:30 a.m. 
Friday and accosted Joseph Maier, 30, police said. He was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the intruders stole several rifles and shotguns from the home and 
then fled in a golden brown, early 1980s model Chevrolet van. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that at least one of the men knew Maier, Sgt. Jim Dixon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not strangers," he said. "There is a dispute going on somewhere."

NUCLEAR PLANT SIREN WAILS A FALSE ALARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A powerful warning siren for the San Onofre nuclear power plant blared a false 
alarm for nearly 20 minutes early Saturday morning, jarring residents awake and 
prompting a spate of worried telephone calls to local police. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities blamed the shrill dawn alarm on a malfunctioning siren that 
apparently was touched off when storm water seeped into the equipment.The siren 
is one of 52 within a 10-mile radius of the San Onofre nuclear power plant and 
one of 18 located about five miles north in the city of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The siren began wailing about 6 a.m. and continued for nearly 20 minutes 
before city officials were able to disconnect it. San Clemente police reported 
receiving dozens of telephone calls about the siren.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Conroy, a spokesman for Southern California Edison Co., which operates 
the plant, said the nuclear power plant was operating smoothly and "there was 
no emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are investigating," said Conroy, "but we believe it was related to the 
heavy rainstorm. Probably water getting inside the field equipment caused it to 
go off." 
</P>
<P>
 Last July another siren mistakenly sounded a warning alarm, blasting for about 
five minutes.

2 SHOT, 1 FATALLY, FROM GUNFIRE BEFORE CRASHES END CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were shot -- one fatally -- after a frantic, three-block car chase 
Saturday night that ended with two car crashes and gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, whose names were not released late last night, were taken to 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where one died from gunshot wounds to the 
back, police said.Also injured were two people in a car caught in the middle of 
the car chase that began at the intersection of Orange Avenue and Grant Street. 
</P>
<P>
 That vehicle was involved in a collision at the intersection of Orange Avenue 
and Bishop Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police said the series of events started after 7:40 p.m. with a 
dispute between the passengers of two cars which were playing a deadly game of 
cat and mouse. At least 12 shots were fired, some while the two cars were still 
racing along city streets, police said.

WILL IT BE COMPASSION OR THE NICKEL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am saddened but not surprised by some of the public reaction to the 
problems faced by Roberto Morales ("Crash Victim's Coma Ends, But Not 
Troubles," March 3). We assert that the United States is a Christian nation.As 
an official policy, we attempt to alleviate suffering in Somalia and other 
areas. Yet at home, when it comes to a choice between compassion and a nickel, 
these people will choose the nickel. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Morales is here illegally. He was injured fleeing authority. His life 
has been destroyed by his actions. Is that not enough punishment? 
</P>
<P>
 Can we not find it in our hearts to think of him as a human being in need of 
help rather than as something to be cast aside and left helpless?

2 ARRESTED AFTER SERIES OF SHOTS, STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were arrested Saturday after they barricaded themselves in a Harper 
Street residence for more than five hours and peppered a back alley with rifle 
shots, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, but deputies from the Orange County Sheriff's Department 
counted at least 10 gunshots after they were called by neighbors to check the 
house at 14901 Harper St. 
</P>

 The incident started at 3:43 a.m. and prompted the Sheriff's Department to 
send out a special tactical unit to surround the house, said Lt. Dan Martini. 
Other deputies sealed off the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 a.m., Gerardo Palma Jr., 23, and Rony Valenzuela, 26, emerged from the 
residence and were arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The shots appeared to have been fired in the direction of a home on Wilson 
Street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure why the weapon was fired, but we do have some weapons that 
were confiscated," said Martini, who did not disclose the types of weapons 
police found.

MAN ARRESTED IN STRING OF GAS STATION HEISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old Santa Ana man was arrested Saturday morning in connection with a 
string of Orange County gas station robberies in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that Darrell Mathew Ellis was first stopped in Anaheim by an 
Anaheim police officer and later arrested there by Fountain Valley police after 
they linked him to an armed robbery a week earlier at the Mobil gas station at 
Harbor Boulevard and Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 A gas station attendant, who was robbed of more than $250, jotted down the 
license number on Ellis' 1981 Honda. That number led investigators to Ellis, 
who police said is also suspected of robbing at least six other gas stations in 
Garden Grove, Costa Mesa and Huntington Beach. Ellis was taken to the 
Huntington Beach City Jail.

CRENSHAW WINS TITLE AGAIN; PREP BASKETBALL: THE COUGARS DEFEAT CARMICHAEL 
JESUIT FOR THE DIVISION I CROWN, 89-79. JOHNSON SCORES 27 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two years of controversy surrounding the Crenshaw High boys' basketball has 
not affected the team's performance on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars won their second State Division I title in a row with an 89-79 
victory over Carmichael Jesuit before 11,564 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (29-2) also defeated Jesuit in the championship game last year, 
73-66. 
</P>
<P>
 The title was the sixth in the last 12 years for Coach Willie West, a state 
record. But the toughest have been the past two, which were accomplished with a 
team made up of several transfer players. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw has been the subject of much finger-pointing, including many 
accusations made by Jesuit Coach Hank Meyer that the team illegally obtained 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
 West and his team were investigated by the City Section after last year's 
title, but were cleared of any violations. Although the complaining continued 
this season, there has been no investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw has done its talking on the court, where it is 57-4 the last two 
seasons. It has saved its finest performances for the State championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 89 points Saturday night set a Division I record, and the teams tied a 
state record for the most points. 
</P>
<P>
 "'We had a tough schedule," West said. "Much tougher than last year, and we 
still prevailed." 
</P>
<P>
 The heroes were numerous for Crenshaw. Kristaan Johnson, a transfer from Van 
Nuys Montclair Prep, scored 15 of his 27 points in the first quarter and added 
seven rebounds. Tommie Davis, who transferred last summer from Fremont, set a 
Division I record with 14 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremaine Fowlkes, a transfer from Culver City, finished with a game-high 30 
points and eight rebounds. He cited added motivation with California Coach Todd 
Bozeman sitting courtside. Fowlkes will attend Cal in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "That gives you a little boost," he said. "This is my soon-to-be-hometown, so 
why not put on a show for the fans?" 
</P>
<P>
 The final score was not indicative of the closeness of the game. Jesuit 
(31-7), champion of the Sac Joaquin Section, trailed by only two points several 
times in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Chris Griffin hit a jump shot with 3:32 remaining to pull Jesuit 
to within 79-77. Crenshaw's depth proved the difference down the stretch, 
however, as it went on a 10-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it would be up and down, but I knew we could compete," Meyer said. "We 
made some mistakes and it hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesuit committed 16 turnovers and Crenshaw nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders started off strong as Omarr Collins scored 14 points in the 
first quarter, including a pair of three-pointers, to lift Jesuit to a 24-21 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw stayed close thanks to Johnson, who made seven of eights shots for 15 
points in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the UCLA-bound Johnson struggled in the second quarter, and seldom-used 
Raymond Palmer, a junior forward, stepped in and scored three key baskets as 
the Cougars took a 46-41 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders were down by 42-41 after a three-pointer by Griffin, but a 
basket by Palmer and a dunk by Fowlkes in the final 25 seconds of the first 
half widened the gap.

MIKE DOWNEY: COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; ARE THEY BOTH PRESIDENT'S 
MEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton, Razorback-in-chief, once gave a big sloppy hug inside the White 
House (relax, this is nothing scandalous) not to the basketball coach from his 
down-home University of Arkansas but instead to towering John Thompson, the 
coach from his undergraduate alma mater, Washington D.C.'s very own Georgetown. 
Then he turned to the First Lady of the United States of America to introduce 
her to the gentleman he was squeezing with the words, "This is my coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson enjoys telling this story, especially now that Georgetown Hoya alum 
Clinton also appears on the cover of a prominent magazine this week in its 
annual men's jump-suit issue, modeling a red-and-white Arkansas basketball 
warm-up suit, holding a basketball and posed beside this not typically 
presidential headline: "WHOOOO, PIG, SOOEY! PRESIDENT CLINTON IS HIGH ON HIS 
HOGS." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, now. Talk about playing the sax from both ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions, decisions. The President faces one today, for whom to cheer, when 
Georgetown meets Arkansas in the second round of the NCAA tournament's Midwest 
Regional. Lucky thing there is no Oxford-Yale game in another bracket, or his 
loyalties could be put even further to the test. As it is, this one ranks as 
difficult a decision to make as the one diners face at the Cattlemen's Cafe, 
where the menu featuring the 17-ounce T-bones notes that George Bush eats 
nowhere else whenever he happens to be in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors flew that the Clintons might be in the stands for today's game. Somehow 
we doubt that either of them would join dozens of other Razorback rooters in 
wearing pink plastic pig masks. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the same, Nolan Richardson wants everyone to know that he would be proud 
as punch to have such powerful support from the gallery. The Arkansas coach 
says, "I guess his brother (Roger) is getting married down in Dallas, so maybe 
we can meet up there if we can get that far." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is fine with Richardson's old friend and foe, Thompson, so long as 
everyone is crystal clear on one thing. "He's our President too," Thompson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The college basketball season is bringing together two of the game's best big 
men -- the coaches. Richardson runs a club with a record of 26-3 that is the 
favorite in this regional. Thomapson's team is 19-11 and more of a longshot 
than back in the Patrick Ewing championship days. Richardson is a golf nut who 
once fooled with the idea of turning pro. Thompson thinks golf is the greatest 
foolishness. Richardson says basketball is "just an occupation," whereas 
Thompson, he says, is a 365-day-a-year workaholic. And Richardson often has a 
whole state on his back. Thompson answers to a much smaller district -- or, as 
some would put it, people there answer to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson is an innovator, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon mentioning this, Richardson busts out with that room-rattling laugh of 
his and says, "Meanwhile, I've never invented any -thing! But one thing I can 
do is copy. I can copy my butt off." 
</P>
<P>
 These are among the many things these contemporaries do not have in common. 
Where they do bond is in age -- each is 52, born three months apart -- in 
mutual regard, certain philosophies and in the admiration they share in the 
eyes of impressionable coaches whose success came later, among them Orlando 
(Tubby) Smith, 42, of Tulsa, who holds these two men in the utmost esteem. 
Tubby, who could end up playing the winner should Tulsa defeat Oklahoma State 
today, says, "Really, they have been pioneers. They have paved the way for the 
young black coaches in the business like myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Giving them a working relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even a personal one," Smith says. "John Thompson and I are from the same part 
of Maryland. His grandparents and my grandparents are related. We didn't even 
know that until just recently." 
</P>
<P>
 The ties between Thompson and Richardson have been ones that bind. When it 
became increasingly clear that a gifted high school recruit, Othella 
Harrington, was not interested in playing for Arkansas, it was the Razorback 
coach who steered him toward Georgetown, where he has become the team's leading 
scorer. And when Richardson lost a daughter to leukemia, Thompson was there 
with a very high shoulder on which to lean. 
</P>
<P>
 They are adversaries today. Thompson will draw X's on a chalkboard trying to 
get his guys around Richardson's big O, 245-pound Corliss Williamson, who set a 
pick the other night that nearly bumped an opponent across the state line. 
Richardson will diagram plays designed to contain Georgetown's George Butler, 
who played in the shadow of Glenn Robinson in high school, but has emerged in 
the tournament, scoring 27 points against Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides will play to win. Both sides will play hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that T-shirt they wear today?" Richardson asks, chortling. "Play hard 
or die, or whatever it is?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson has a much more pleasant whatever it is, saying, "Sometimes you enjoy 
competition with your friends more than with your enemies. Because, this way, 
nobody loses." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson: "John's a competitor. I love John. John's one of the greatest men 
I've ever met in my life. We'll fight, scratch, claw, do the best we can to 
beat one another, and when it's over we'll remain friends." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the President? 
</P>
<P>
 He's high on the Hogs. Yet he gives Hoyas hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 How come Clinton hasn't invited Richardson to the White House for a squeeze? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha!" Richardson reacts with a roar. "Because he came down into our dressing 
room and did it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson thinks this over with his eyeglasses pushed to the tip of his nose. 
He is as droll as Richardson is mirthful. He says, "Well, it's like this. I've 
never had any ill feelings for the President for supporting someone else. He 
hugged me right there in the White House. He said to his wife, 'This is my 
coach.' Now I don't know what he says to somebody else. Don't forget, there are 
politics involved in what you say. Depends on whose company you're in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, I kind of like people who come right out and tell you who they're 
for. I don't like people who stay neutral. I'd rather have an enemy than a 
neutral friend."

JIM MURRAY: STAR POWER PUTS 'NIQUE ABOVE 'NING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I went to a Clipper game the other night. Not to see the Clippers. I've seen 
them. To see Dominique Wilkins.  
</P>
<P>
 The distinction is important. The Clippers only recently got Dominique 
Wilkins. They got him in trade for Danny Manning, their longtime forward. 
</P>
<P>
 I never went to a Clipper game to see Danny Manning. I went to see the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 What we have here is your basic sports dichotomy, the difference between a 
star and a non-star.  
</P>
<P>
 You have to understand, Manning is not a star. He's a very good player, one of 
the best. The Atlanta Hawks are ecstatic. They feel they made a very good deal. 
Danny Manning is six years younger than Dominique Wilkins.  
</P>
<P>
 That's not the point. Manning will help you win games. But he won't fill 
seats. Make headlines.  
</P>
<P>
 He's not what L.A. is looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 We know all about stars here. This is where the word was invented.  
</P>
<P>
 You know the old-time film moguls knew all about stardom. Nobody could really 
explain stardom, but they knew it when they found it. We would have great 
actors, thespians who would awe their fellow players. But the public yawned.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there were some others who had none of these attributes. 
But when they got in the film emulsion, something happened. What happened was 
what Hollywood called "star quality." There was no accounting for it. But there 
was no mistaking it.  
</P>
<P>
 It often had nothing to do with good looks. It frequently eluded great 
beauties. On the male side, for every Paul Newman, there was a Humphrey Bogart. 
Dustin Hoffman. It had to do with personality. Cagney was a star. Clark Gable 
was a star. They brought excitement to the screen. You couldn't teach it, write 
it or direct it. They either had it or they didn't.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the same in the world of sport. Manning is a super player. Steady. 
Dependable. Probably good to his mother. On time for practice. No problem.  
</P>
<P>
 But just a member of the cast. He'll come in on cue, read the right lines, 
play the right shot. Be there for you. Our rock.  
</P>
<P>
 Ho hum.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins is 34, might have peaked. But he's already left his mark. Only the 
great ones get a public nickname, and he's 'Nique. No one ever called Manning 
'Ning, but 'Nique conveys excitement. Cagney going to the electric chair, Bogey 
breaking out of the big house. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning never had a nickname, only a number. 'Nique has been called "the Human 
Highlight Film." He played basketball the way John Wayne fought range wars. 
There was a certain recklessness to it. Like Ruth striking out, even his misses 
had an element of thrill to them.  
</P>
<P>
 That's what L.A. really wants. Gable. Not some Shakespeare-spouter. We like 
stars. We're used to Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Magic Johnson, Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, O.J., Mike Garrett, Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, 
Maury Wills, Fernando, Waterfield, Crazy Legs. We don't want the adequate. 
Manning plays the best friend, if we're casting. He doesn't get the girl.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's nice if you win. Even Michael Jordan had to do that, finally.  
</P>
<P>
 But, for the present, you would have to say the Clippers did the right thing. 
Oh, the "experts" will probably argue they should have taken a chance with some 
young talent with potential. Louis B. Mayer could have told them what potential 
is. Potential is what closes out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers could have gotten a Danny Manning for Danny Manning. Why? They 
already had one. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood will let us know. If Wilkins has it left, look for him to start 
doing Buick commercials, cameo appearances in movies, mall appearances. If 
Billy Crystal suddenly isn't the only mega-star courtside, you'll know 'Nique 
has arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 I went down to the locker room to see how this culture shock is affecting 
L.A.'s first super-player since Magic left. After all, 'Nique had spent his 
whole career in Atlanta. He could have reacted to this quasi-banishment by 
going into an all-court sulk, going through the motions, awaiting another move 
to a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 'Nique isn't. He's throwing up 30 points a night, playing like a guy bucking 
for sergeant, playing both ends of the court with verve and enthusiasm, pulling 
the Clippers along in his wake. You would think he was a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewing Wilkins is like covering him on the fast break. Like interviewing 
a man through the window of a moving bus. He answers, then excuses himself to 
dash across the room to get a tape cutter. Then he takes another question, 
excuses himself in mid-sentence to run into the shower. He seems to be 
listening to three conversations at once and gets into all of them -- two of 
them in a far corner of the room and another one in the next cubicle. He is 
polite, friendly, but you know what the guy guarding him in the post must feel 
like -- "Hey! Anybody here see 'Nique? I was guarding him here just a minute 
ago!" 
</P>
<P>
 If ever a sport cried out for a superstar in this town, it's basketball, 1994. 
Is Wilkins too old? Well, his team made up a 20-point deficit the other night 
to win, 108-105, over Utah, no less. The old Clippers had trouble enough 
winning even when they were leading by 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at it this way: The old Clippers used to advertise about visiting stars. 
They didn't have any of their own. "Come see the Clippers against Patrick 
Ewing!" "Be sure to be there when Barkley and the Suns come to the Sports 
Arena!" "Catch Air Jordan Sunday!" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, their ads say, "Don't miss 'Nique against the visiting Knicks!" 
</P>
<P>
 That right there makes L.A. comfortable. We can relate to that. We're the ones 
supposed to have the stars. What is this, an Italian movie? This is Hollywood, 
babe, not some dumb documentary! As Gloria Swanson said in the original "Sunset 
Boulevard": "We had faces in my day!"

UNMISTAKABLY DINAH'S PLACE; DESPITE FOUNDER SHORE'S PASSING, THE 22ND 
TOURNAMENT THIS WEEK WILL BE MORE THAN EVER HERS, ALTHOUGH IT WON'T BE THE SAME 
WITHOUT BELOVED ENTERTAINER

<P>
 In the finest tradition of the stage, the show will go on, but Dinah Shore's 
golf tournament won't be the same without Dinah. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nabisco Dinah Shore -- a women's LPGA major event known simply as "Dinah's 
tournament" since its beginning in 1972 -- will be played for the 22nd time 
this week at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage. It will be a week 
spent with memories of the golden-haired entertainer -- who died of cancer Feb. 
24 at her home in Beverly Hills -- on everyone's mind. She was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Never again will the desert stillness be 
</P>
<P>
 broken by Shore singing, "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning," as she walked to the 
first tee in her celebrity pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
 Never again will her old friend, Amy Alcott, smile as she hears, "Once in Love 
With Amy" before teeing off. Alcott, the only three-time winner of the 
tournament, will be forever linked with Shore in golfing lore for their jump 
into the lake at the 18th green after Alcott's victory in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There won't be a lot of dry eyes around here by Sunday," said Chipper Cecil, 
head pro at Mission Hills. "But we're going ahead with plans with the attitude 
that Dinah is still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcott probably spoke for everyone who knew Shore when she said, "I thought 
she'd be around forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere on the rolling fairways of Mission Hills' luxurious layout, the LPGA 
should erect a plaque that reads something like: "The LPGA wasn't born here, 
but this, thanks to Dinah Shore, is where it grew up." 
</P>
<P>
 Babe Didriksen Zaharias, Patty Berg, Louise Suggs and a few other women 
started the LPGA in 1950, but it wasn't until Shore and David Foster, then 
president of the Colgate-Palmolive Co., got together to sponsor their first 
tournament that women's golf emerged from the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 When Colgate dropped the tournament in 1982, Nabisco became its sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the first of Shore's tournaments, purses for LPGA events were mostly in 
the $15,000-$30,000 range. The largest payout in 1971 was $50,000. When Foster, 
using Shore's name and Colgate's money, offered $110,000 for a 54-hole event in 
1972, it opened the floodgates for other sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 In five years, Shore's tournament was up to $240,000 and this year's event 
will pay $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the turning point in women's golf, not just for the money, but for 
the exposure," said Jane Blalock, who won the first tournament and earned 
$20,050 -- more than the total purse for each of six other LPGA tournaments 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tour was still Podunk when we went to Palm Springs for the first time, 
and suddenly we were celebrities. We appeared with Dinah on her show, we were 
in commercials, we mingled and played with famous people and it made us feel 
like we were something. 
</P>
<P>
 "It changed the perception of women's golf. The purse was four times what we 
had been getting on the average. To put things in perspective, it would be like 
playing for $5 million today." 
</P>
<P>
 Shore was made an honorary member of the LPGA and received its Patty Berg 
Award for her "contribution to women's golf."  
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's Helen Alfredsson, who is the defending champion this week, knew Shore 
for only two years, but said, "I learned so much from her in a short time. She 
was as genuine a person as anyone I ever met. It

 is going to be rather sad going back to defend when Dinah won't be there." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The tournament itself was only part of the package Shore and Foster produced. 
First, there was a two-day celebrity pro-am in which Shore called on friends in 
the entertainment and sports fields to play with Colgate-Palmolive executives 
and clients. It was not the normal pro-am, where amateurs could pay their way 
in to play with the professionals. Shore's pro-am was by invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's pro-am -- Tuesday and Wednesday at Mission Hills -- will have some 
celebrities who have played in nearly all 21 tournaments. Among them are Robert 
Wagner, Dennis James, Hal Linden, Donald O'Connor, Wayne Rogers, Charles 
Schultz, Robert Stack, McLean Stevenson, Kathleen Sullivan, Johnny Bench, Joe 
DiMaggio, Joe Garagiola and former President Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything will be pretty much as it has been -- except that Dinah won't be 
there," said Terry Wilcox, former director of golf at Mission Hills and now 
tournament director. "It's going to be tough. We'll all be expecting to look up 
and see her strolling down the fairway, cheering on the girls, when the 
tournament starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Another tradition, "An Evening With Dinah," at which she and friends 
entertained tournament guests, will go on as scheduled Tuesday night at the 
Westin Mission Hills Resort. It will probably be an evening-long tribute, with 
the LPGA, Nabisco, Mission Hills, the Palm Springs community and Shore's many 
friends all joining in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember ("An Evening With Dinah") in the first few years, we girls would 
be sitting there, surrounded by all those celebrities and big shots and we'd 
pinch ourselves to see if it was really happening," Blalock said. "There we 
were, linked with Dinah -- she was America's sweetheart then -- and she was 
like a cheerleader for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, she is the tournament, the spirit of the entire 
event." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For those who were there March 31, 1991, or watching on national TV, one of 
the most endearing memories of Shore is of her jumping into the lake on the 
18th hole at Mission Hills with Alcott and her caddie. 
</P>
<P>
 It was something she had talked about, but no one -- especially Alcott -- 
expected her to go through with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hitting balls on the range one day at Hillcrest -- we were both 
members there -- when she mentioned jumping in the lake for the first time," 
Alcott said. "She said the greatest publicity women's golf ever had was when I 
jumped in with my caddie (Bill Kurre) on national TV after I won in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she wanted me to win one more so she could go in the water with me. 
I thought she was joking, but she said her next tournament should be the one. 
My mother had just passed away, and Dinah said I should win it for her, and 
being it was the 20th anniversary of her tournament, she wanted to do something 
to remember it by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I led every day, from start to finish, and the closer I got to Sunday, the 
more she reminded me of our jump in the lake. I still never thought she'd do 
it. The water was really cold and dirty and I remembered from the last time 
what a mess I'd been when I got out. And it was dangerous, the bottom was 
slippery and squishy, and the lady was already in her 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked to the 18th green, I was about eight shots in front, unheard of 
in a major. I was in what I call my 'ultra zone.' It was a very spiritual 
moment, remembering my mother and remembering what Dinah said about making her 
20th something special. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I got to my ball, I didn't think she'd do it, but in the background 
I saw her. She had on black slacks. I knew then she was serious. On the final 
day, she always wore white slacks and her red Nabisco blazer. I said to my 
caddie, 'We've got to talk her out of it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I made my birdie putt for a tournament record and when I looked up, here she 
came. She said, 'I've got my bathrobe and I'm ready,' and she took my hand and 
in we went. I'll never forget her standing on the green, after we were helped 
out, with her hair all wet, that big smile on her face." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, when Foster decided to sponsor a tournament financed by his 
Colgate-Palmolive Co., he talked to Shore about being the celebrity hostess. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Florida to do a little singing and visiting with some of the company 
executives when Mr. Foster invited me for a round of golf," Shore recalled a 
few years ago. "We started betting, about 25 and 50 cents a hole, and the word 
got around how much fun we were having, so on the third day we had a little 
gallery of wives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Foster noticed how interested they seemed to be and along about the 15th 
hole, he asked, 'How would you like to put on a tournament?' I said fine, if it 
was tennis, which I knew something about. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he meant golf, that he wanted to do something to help the LPGA girls 
and he thought it would fit in with the Colgate image. I was doing 'Dinah's 
Place' then and Colgate was one of my sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, once he convinced me it was going to be golf, I had to get home and 
start working on my game -- which was almost nonexistent at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shore enlisted the help of Eric Monti, then head pro at Hillcrest. Rules 
against single women joining a country club cut down her playing opportunities, 
but she spent a lot of time on the range with Monti. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really worked hard to develop her swing," Monti said. "Don't forget, she 
was in her 50s when she started taking golf seriously, and it's not easy to 
pick up the game that late. She was athletically inclined, and had good rhythm, 
so that helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember her saying, before her first tournament, 'Just get me to where I 
look good swinging at the ball.' She was more interested in her image than her 
score. And she did look good." 
</P>
<P>
 Monti was the Hillcrest pro in 1974 when a story in The Times revealed that 
Shore was barred from membership because she was a single female. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember all the talk at the time, but the committee broke all the rules 
and bylaws so she could become a member," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Shore was able to get her own starting times at Hillcrest and Mission 
Hills, she became a golf junkie. 
</P>
<P>
 Monti was her tutor when she was in Beverly Hills and Wilcox was her mentor 
when she was in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dinah really loved the game," Wilcox said. "She would play four or five days 
a week and if she had the time, she would work on her game every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dinah Shore course, third among the Mission Hills complex, opened in 1988, 
and is one of the most difficult in the Palm Springs area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What you saw of Shore on TV -- the enthusiasm and outgoing personality -- was 
what you got in person. She never met a person she didn't like, and never 
encountered a situation in which she couldn't find something good. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most maddening things in golf is to see a putt lip out, watching it 
glide tantalizingly around the cup and not drop. When it happened to Shore, or 
one of her partners, she would break out in song: "Around the World. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Only Dinah Shore could be upbeat at a moment like that.

IN YOUR FACE; IF NOT YOUR HAIR; THAT'S THE PHILLIES' LENNY DYKSTRA, WHO LEADS 
OFF, MOUTHS OFF, BUT WHO NEVER BACKS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dude, as he calls others and is called himself, reflects on his 
record-setting, reputation-enhancing performance of 1993 and says: 
</P>
<P>
 "I basically went from star to superstar. I basically proved I'm more than the 
best leadoff hitter in the game. It's nice to have that recognition, but I'm 
more than a leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I proved I'm the impact player I've always considered myself to be, a 
situation hitter capable of getting the home run, double, walk, whatever the 
situation requires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked hard and made myself into one of the top five players in the 
game. Do they pay leadoff hitters what they're paying me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Dykstra prodded and carried the surprising Philadelphia Phillies to a 
National League championship and Game 6 of the World Series with a virtually 
unparalleled season that was rewarded with a four-year, $24.9-million extension 
that can stretch to five years and $30.4 million if the option is exercised. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension highlighted a winter in which the catalytic Dude proved again he 
is a man for all seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He kept the peace and boosted the European economy while representing the 
major leagues on a five-day trip to Paris, Dusseldorf and Amsterdam during 
which he popped for a $13,000 dinner party at a noted Paris restaurant and 
bought his wife, Terri, a three-carat diamond for $41,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He began what he hopes will be the entrepreneurial phase of his career by 
opening the Lenny Dykstra Car Wash in Corona Hills. He calls it "the Taj Mahal 
of car washes" and arrived for the opening in a rented limo. Attendants wear 
Phillies' uniform tops, and the waiting room features $300,000 worth of 
memorabilia, which may interest the IRS, considering that Dykstra was among 
those interviewed in the card-show inquiry that has focused on Darryl 
Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He also illustrated that some things never change by engaging a 
Pennsylvania state senator in a verbal and -- almost physical -- confrontation 
when the senator objected to Dykstra's language as they dined in a Philadelphia 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He either fired -- or was deserted by -- longtime agent Alan Meersand, who 
announced in mid-January he was fed up with Dykstra's behavior and no longer 
wanted to be associated with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I'll say is that it was an interesting 13 years, and I chose to pass the 
torch," Meersand now says, asked by the players' union, it is believed, to 
desist from slinging mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra, who said he fired Meersand long before the extension was negotiated, 
declined to renew the verbal war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go down that road," he said. "I mean, the things Meersand 
said were a comedy. That's why he has no players left." 
</P>
<P>
 Meersand represents Travis Fryman, Damon Berryhill, Darrin Jackson, Jesse 
Orosco and Steve Trachsel, a Chicago Cub rookie pitcher, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Meersand's attorney, Mark Kalmanshon, said he sent a termination letter to 
Dykstra on Jan. 19, at which point Meersand had not been notified -- orally or 
in writing -- that he was being terminated by Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalmanshon also said Meersand was a member of the team that negotiated the 
extension and is still owed agent's fees from the last year of the pre-existing 
contract, from the extension and from various endorsements. It is a contention, 
he said, Dykstra seems to be disputing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a preliminary stage on that," he said, refusing to speculate on 
possible legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dykstra, of course, life goes on, the controversies almost as persistent 
as the tobacco stains on his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be the player I am if I dwelt on the negative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The year's probation for illegal gambling in Mississippi, the near fatal 
injuries in the alcohol-related auto accident of 1991, the broken arm he 
suffered on opening day of 1992, the Philadelphia magazine account of his 
alleged rude and obscenity-laced treatment of employees and fellow gamblers 
during a night he lost $50,000 in Atlantic City have all had impact on his 
growth and maturity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And last year it could be measured in terms of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fed up with people trying to judge me as a person, how I lead my life," 
he said. "I wanted to shove it in their face by taking my performance to the 
next level." 
</P>
<P>
 He did it in remarkable style, but even that was accompanied by dark rumors 
that refuse to die. Did desire account for the dramatic change in his physical 
stature? Did weight work in preparation for the 1993 season turn Little Lenny 
into a semi-hulk, or was it anabolic steroids? 
</P>
<P>
 "There always has to be a reason," Dykstra said. "It's as if hard work isn't 
good enough. Nobody on this team runs more, lifts more, works more than I do, 
but no, there has to be the false rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I've had so much written and said about me that I don't pay attention 
anymore. All I can tell you is that I knew I had to get stronger -- physically 
and mentally -- and that it didn't happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if I wanted to get the focus off my lifestyle and put it where it 
should be, on the field, I had to be playing every day and I had to be stronger 
to do it. A 162-game season is an absolute grind. I wanted to be strong enough 
to finish it off." 
</P>
<P>
 The only game Dykstra sat out in '93 was the one the day after the Phillies 
clinched the division title. He batted .374 in July, .269 in August and .319 in 
September, closing strong. 
</P>
<P>
 He batted .280 and scored five runs in the six games of the stunning playoff 
victory over the Atlanta Braves, and he batted .348 with nine runs, four home 
runs, eight runs batted in and seven walks in the six-game World Series loss to 
the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way we should have lost," Dykstra said. "I can't take anything 
away from Toronto, but we had them beat in Game 4 and Game 6 and our pitching 
couldn't hold them. We should be world champions, but what can you do? I mean, 
it's disappointing we didn't win, but we had a lot of things to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 His in-your-face season included a major league record 773 plate appearances. 
He led the league in at-bats, walks, hits and runs, the first time anyone has 
led a league in each of those categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The 143 runs were the most in the National League since Chuck Klein scored 152 
for the Phillies in 1932. The only other major leaguer to lead a league in 
at-bats and walks, statistics that work against each other, was Burt Shotton of 
the St. Louis Browns in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra batted .305 with 44 doubles, 19 homers and 66 RBIs. He took pitchers 
deep in the count, exacting a late-inning toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Phillie Manager Jim Fregosi: "I've never seen a hitter have as many 
quality at-bats as Lenny did last year. He absolutely lit our fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dykstra: "To lead the league in both walks and hits is something anyone 
would be proud of. It's as if I got a walk whenever I didn't get a hit, and a 
hit whenever I didn't get a walk, but I was proudest of my consistency." 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra finished second to Barry Bonds in the most-valuable-player voting and 
said there was no disgrace in that. He said that the San Francisco left fielder 
is the game's best player and had another spectacular season, adding, "But I'm 
not afraid to say I was a big part of the Phillies going from last to first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put up some numbers nobody had before, and Bonds had that drought in 
September when they needed him the most. You could point to that and say that's 
why they lost, why they sat home and watched us in the playoffs and World 
Series." 
</P>
<P>
 The expectations mount, and Dykstra said he welcomes the pressure. Can he 
repeat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I said, I did some things last year nobody has ever done before, but 
I'll have to find a way again. The key is that I have to do whatever it takes 
for us to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the Braves in our division now and we could be without (John Kruk) 
until June (as he undergoes radiation after surgery for testicular cancer). 
It's going to be tougher. For us to win again, my job is even more vital." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that the way a superstar should think, dude?

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; TANANA EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, determining that 40-year-old starter Frank Tanana can not remedy 
their pitching woes, turned around Saturday and signed Mark Leiter to a 
one-year, non-guaranteed contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are expected to release Tanana today, enabling Leiter -- who was 
released Tuesday by the Detroit Tigers -- to bid for the fifth spot in the 
rotation. If Leiter, 6-6 with a 4.72 ERA last season, fails to win a starting 
job, he probably will be employed in the bullpen as a long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who until two days ago had no interest in Leiter, were persuaded 
by scout Joe McDonald to sign him. McDonald never saw Leiter pitch this spring, 
but he went on the recommendation of Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not have a lot of interest," General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but we 
were told we better take a look at this guy. With the pitching we have, we 
really cannot afford not to take a look. We were told he's better than what we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter's emergence signifies Tanana's departure. The Angels had hoped that 
Tanana could at least provide insurance until left-hander Joe Magrane returned 
to the rotation, but lost faith after watching his performance in his first 
three outings. Tanana was 0-3 with a 13.50 ERA this spring, allowing 23 
baserunners in 8 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've reached some decisions," Bavasi said, "but we still have to finalize 
some things. If we decide someone can't make the club, we're better off 
releasing them now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also are expected to release reliever Shawn Hillegas today, but 
might wait before releasing reliever Craig Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the addition of Leiter, the Angels, who will have to pay Tanana 
$50,000 in termination pay, will continue to look outside the organization for 
a fifth starter. They will open the season with Mark Langston, Chuck Finley, 
Phil Leftwich and John Dopson. 
</P>
<P>
 They are willing to trade first baseman J.T. Snow to the New York Mets for 
starter Anthony Young, but if they are unhappy with Young's next performance, 
they probably will keep Snow and trade Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are mulling several trade offers for Smith, but have not been 
offered a fourth- or fifth-starter in return. They probably will wait until a 
decision is made on Young before considering any offers for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate question is can we open with Dwight Smith and J.T. Snow," Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers said. "One of them might have to go. We're more concerned 
about our pitching than J.T. Snow and Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "And right now, our pitchers aren't jumping out to the fourth and fifth 
spots." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels trade Snow, Rodgers said he probably will employ a platoon of Bo 
Jackson and Smith in left field. Jim Edmonds would be used primarily as a 
pinch-hitter and defensive replacement in the late innings. Although Jackson 
has been adequate defensively, Smith has struggled, misplaying several balls in 
the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think he could handle it OK," Rodgers said. "Luis (Polonia) was a lot 
worse outfielder than Dwight Smith. He can be a good outfielder because he's 
got speed, but it's up to him if he wants to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers said that second baseman Kevin Flora (.200, one homer, one RBI) must 
show improvement or he will open the season in triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "If opening day was tomorrow," Rodgers said, "he'd be in the minor leagues. 
What's good for the California Angels and what's good for Kevin Flora may be 
conflicting. He's had shaky offense and shaky defense, but I do see good range 
and good speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole key to Kevin is momentum. If his momentum keeps going up, it would 
be better to take him with us. If it levels off or goes down, it's not going to 
help him going to the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also decided that Spike Owen, who is guaranteed $500,000 each of 
the next two seasons, will be kept on the team along with Rod Correia as 
utility infielders. They will attempt to trade Torey Lovullo and Mike Brumley. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Starting pitcher Andrew Lorraine finished the last of his four final 
examinations Friday to complete his degree at Stanford, but instead of a 
feeling of exhilaration, he was informed Saturday that he was being optioned to 
their minor league camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty ironic, huh?" Lorraine said. "I finally get done with my studies, have 
some free time, and this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine, the Angels' 1993 fourth-round pick from Stanford, made a strong 
impression during camp. He is expected to compete for a spot in the rotation 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been good for me," Lorraine said. "It makes me more determined. I 
know I was a longshot, but the longer you're around, the harder it is to 
accept."

AGENT TELLS CLIPPERS WILKINS TO TEST MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Kauffman, who represents Clipper forward Dominique Wilkins, said his 
client will test the free-agent market because he has been unable to reach a 
contract agreement with the Clippers. Kauffman said that he informed the 
Clippers of the decision late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dominique has decided to play the market out and just see what would happen 
in free agency," Kauffman said. "We made some efforts to see if we might be 
able to reach terms with the Clippers, but it just doesn't seem possible at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no hard feelings, but we just want to see what's out there and 
explore our options and see if this is the right fit for him. We're just 
basically not going to do anything until after July 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, in the final year of a contract that pays him $3.5 million this 
season, reportedly is seeking a $21-million, three-year deal from the Clippers. 
Wilkins would be 37 when the contract ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, acquired from the Atlanta Hawks last month for forward Danny Manning 
and a conditional first-round draft pick in 1994 or 1995, can become an 
unrestricted free agent on July 1 if the Clippers don't sign him. However, if 
the Clippers lose Wilkins, they could use his salary slot to sign another free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper spokesman Joe Safety maintains that the club will sign Wilkins, who 
has averaged 30.4 points in 10 games as the Clippers have gone 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope and our plan has always been and still is to have Dominique with us, 
hopefully for the rest of his career," Safety said. "Basically, this is just 
the kind of rhetoric you would expect to hear at this point in a (negotiating) 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kauffman: "I think (Wilkins) still is in the process of deciding whether 
or not he wants to play for the Clippers. I think he feels that a big burden 
has been lifted off his shoulders because this thing has been weighing on his 
mind for the last couple of weeks and now that he knows that he's going to see 
what happens in July and nothing is going to happen for the next several 
months, it's probably a bit of a relief."

HE'S WAITING FOR NFL'S SIGNAL; PRO FOOTBALL: NEWPORT BEACH'S MAY HOPES THAT THE 
LEAGUE WILL ADOPT HIS "AUDIBILIZER" IN TIME FOR HIM TO MAKE ENOUGH OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In addition to the new two-point conversion, NFL owners are also prepared this 
week to increase scoring through the wonders of electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will be a wonder if those electronics can be ready on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that at this week's owners meetings, the influential Competition 
Committee is prepared to recommend full-time use of the "audibilizer" for next 
season. It is a device that helps offensive players hear the quarterback's 
signals near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newport Beach-based inventor Randy May might be in the unenviable position 
of asking the league to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 His six-person company, which currently has one audibilizer in stock, might 
not be able to produce at least 13 others needed for the first game of the 
season in September. 
</P>
<P>
 May will meet with officials here as early as today to discuss the 
recommendation, which could be made to the ownership groups Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we want," said Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboy owner and member 
of the competition committee. "This is something that is badly needed. 
Offensive linemen have got to be able to hear the signals." 
</P>
<P>
 May agreed, but said, "It will be a formidable challenge to get everything in 
place by Labor Day. We don't want to hurry to make the 1994 season, then stub 
our toes along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing May, the league might decide to begin using the device in this 
year's playoffs, which gives him more time and fewer audibilizers to 
manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
 The audibilizer involves a tiny microphone in the quarterback's helmet and 
large speakers on either side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be activated anywhere within the 30- or 20-yard line of either team's 
goal -- owners haven't decided yet. The quarterback simply touches his shoulder 
pads and the microphone is switched on. 
</P>
<P>
 The linemen and wide receivers can then hear his signals through the sideline 
speakers. The microphone is automatically deactivated several seconds later. 
The unit is so small and resilient, it cannot be damaged when the quarterback 
is hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The device was successfully tested during last year's exhibition games, in one 
regular-season game between the Rams and Cincinnati Bengals and in the Pro 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important for its development, according to May, were private tests 
performed during the middle of the season for two influential coaches on the 
Competition Committee, Don Shula and Marty Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shula was so enamored of its function, he tested it for nearly an hour at the 
Miami Dolphins' practice facility amid artificial noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it would not have been cost efficient for his small company to 
manufacture the devices before gaining league-wide approval, May said he has 
waited for this week's vote before proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does this former rock musician have to arrange to build the product, 
he must arrange for installers and workers at each of the 14 game sites each 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "From day one, the league has always looked at 1995 for the start of this 
thing," May said. "We could do it this year, but it would be much tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 May said the league could give him more time by using it during the second 
half of this season, "but that might not go well with teams who play in loud 
locations during the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the expected rule changes, realignment will be discussed. No 
recommendation from the realignment committee is expected, but there probably 
will be much discussion leading to a possible resolution in the owners' 
meetings in May in Miami.

HEARING IS HELD ON BIG 'CAP RULING; APPEAL: DISQUALIFICATION OF THE WICKED 
NORTH IS CHALLENGED BY HERSH, WHO IS SKEPTICAL OF CHANCES AFTERWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 6 1/2-hour hearing on the appeal of the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap was 
held Saturday, with the owner of the disqualified winner, The Wicked North, 
skeptical afterward that the stewards' decision would be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that it's probably 60-40 against," said Phil Hersh, who owns The 
Wicked North. "We had a key witness who didn't get to say as much as we would 
have liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh indicated that if the California Horse Racing Board doesn't give the 
$550,000 victory back to The Wicked North, he won't pursue the case in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Big 'Cap, which was run on March 5, The Wicked North finished first by 
1 1/2 lengths over Stuka. The three stewards moved Stuka up to first and 
disqualified The Wicked North to fourth, placing him behind Myrakalu, the horse 
they said was interfered with by Hersh's horse in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing officer Steven Schwartz said that he will file his opinion with the 
racing board in time for its meeting Friday at Emeryville, but it is unlikely 
that the board will make a decision until its next meeting, April 28 at Los 
Angeles. The board can either accept, reject or modify Schwartz's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh's attorneys argued that The Wicked North ran in a straight line through 
the stretch, not closing a hole on Myrakalu as the stewards had ruled. They 
also argued that Hill Pass, the horse on the rail, came out enough to tighten 
the hole for Myrakalu. The stewards said that Hill Pass ran a straight course 
and was not a factor in their disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh's attorneys presented Carley C. Ward, a biomechanical engineer, as an 
expert witness who tried to demonstrate mathematically that the hole Myrakalu 
was trying to go through was an optical illusion. Ed Stetson, representing the 
racing board, objected to Ward testifying and Schwartz accepted only some of 
her remarks, throwing out the optical-illusion theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward acknowledged that The Wicked North had come in on the hole that Myrakalu 
wanted. "He came in very slightly," she said, and when asked to be specific she 
added: "Three inches, maybe four." 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony was heard from stewards Tom Ward and Pete Pedersen, patrol judge 
Michael Harlow, trainer Ron Ellis, former jockey Bill Harmatz and jockeys Kent 
Desormeaux, Alex Solis and Laffit Pincay. Desormeaux rode The Wicked North and 
is also appealing a five-day suspension that the stewards gave him after the 
Big 'Cap. Solis rode Myrakalu, who finished fourth, a nose behind Bien Bien, 
before the disqualification . 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't anxious to disqualify a horse that could very well have been the 
best horse in the race," Pedersen said. "But the rules don't say anything about 
that. We tried to find some reason not to disqualify the horse, but that reason 
didn't exist."

MOURNING A LOSS; SLOW GRIEVING TAKES DIFFERENT FORMS FOR THE WESTMINSTER FAMILY 
OF A 13-YEAR-OLD KILLED LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gail Martinez's hand trembled as her fingertips traced the image of her son's 
face on the screen. Kneeling in front of the television, she rubbed the back of 
her hand against the flickering ghost, caressing the electronic echo of his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few minutes, it was as if her son was alive again, for a few moments she 
could hear his voice. "I love you," she whispered, leaning forward and kissing 
the cold glass screen. "I miss you, and I'm so glad you were born. I love you, 
Jeff." 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape is of 13-year-old Jeff Martinez and some of his friends 
practicing skateboard jumps on a sunny corner in Westminster. The digital 
read-out in the corner marks the time as August of last year, Friday the 13th, 
4:18 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Just four hours later, riding the same skateboard, Jeff Martinez would have 
his life ended by a drunk driver several blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's death sent shock waves through the quiet Westminster neighborhood, 
as did the subsequent arrest of a local man who was behind the wheel during the 
hit and run. Hundreds of cards poured in, the city's Traffic Commission put up 
more stop signs in the area, church and school groups held the tragedy up as a 
chilling example of the evils of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, with the memorial services and court case long over, life 
goes on for neighbors and for Jeff's classmates, busy with their freshman year 
of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly many people's thoughts occasionally turn to Jeff. But for most, time 
has cushioned the pain. Not so in the Martinez household. For this couple and 
their 7-year-old son, Jonathan, the wounds are still open. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the dim room watching a visual sliver of her child's last hours, 
Jeff's mother could barely find words to describe her loss. "So much," she said 
as she rummaged through a box of cards and photos from the week of Jeff's 
memorial. "Just so much to say." 
</P>
<P>
 The power and duration of the grieving period following a loved one's death 
varies by person. For parents such as Gail and Ed Martinez, whose son died so 
violently, the grief can taint or overwhelm every aspect of their lives, UCLA 
psychiatry professor Robert Coombs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No human problem produces more difficult pathological problems than the loss 
of a loved one," said Coombs, who leads the university's Grief and Bereavement 
Program, counseling mourners from Orange and Los Angeles counties. "And the 
most acute suffering I have seen is among people who have lost a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents naturally expect to outlive their children, and they typically 
visualize their offspring's future from the moment of birth. Those 
expectations, coupled with the strong bond between parent and child, magnify 
grief, Coombs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to move forward is to explore the feelings, perhaps with 
one-on-one counseling or maybe in a group setting, Coombs said. Grievers should 
do what feels right -- be it toiling at work to distract themselves or mourning 
at home. The key is make sure the emotions are released somehow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people like (the Martinezes), they have to make it through a long healing 
process, not unlike the way you would have to heal from a surgery," Coombs 
said. "It's a surgery performed without anesthesia. It's like someone went 
inside them and ripped out their heart and other organs. The healing process is 
of mind, spirit and body. It will take a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The car that killed Jeff Martinez was going 40 m.p.h., maybe 45, when the 
driver dipped toward a gutter to avoid a speed bump, police reports show. Jeff, 
a skateboard lover, was on the edge of the road, beneath a street lamp, when 
the car slammed into him. He suffered assorted injuries, chief among them a 
fractured skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Martinez home, a cherry pie was cooling in the kitchen and Gail 
was standing on the porch, wondering why Jeff and his friend were overdue. She 
had already dismissed the idea of driving around to find him -- the friend was 
visiting from Oceanside, so she was worried that her increasingly 
image-conscious son would be embarrassed. When the phone rang, Gail felt an 
inexplicable sense of dread. 
</P>
<P>
 After witnessing the grisly accident, the visiting friend called the Martinez 
house. Within minutes, police and paramedics were en route, and a frantic Ed 
was standing over his son's crumpled form. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Matthew Thomas Wilbur, 23, was arrested within an hour. Jeff's 
friend gave a description of the car, but police might have pulled Wilbur over 
without it. When he was arrested, Wilbur was speeding down the Garden Grove 
Freeway, headlights off, with a shattered windshield from the impact of the 
teen's body. He had twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system, according 
to police records. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy had been at a party, we found out, and he had been arrested before 
for driving drunk, but that didn't stop him. He left my son in the gutter," Ed 
said. "He hit someone and he knew it, but he didn't do anything but keep 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur is now confined to a state work camp, serving a two-year sentence for 
drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter. He has become a figure of distant 
dread for the Martinez family and a target of sometimes ambiguous sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gail, who said she has been somewhat withdrawn and fragile during her 
grieving, Wilbur's name stirs up feelings of malice and resentment. She says 
she hopes the religious faith she has used as a lifeboat during the long months 
of pain will help her eventually forgive Wilbur's actions. "But I'm not there 
yet," she said in a steely voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband says he has feelings that are more difficult to pin down. "Gail 
and others have exhibited a lot of hatred for him for all the reasons you would 
expect," he said. "But I have not harbored hate for this man, and I don't know 
why. In some ways I wish I did. I can't explain it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed does a better job describing his sentiments toward the courts. "I'm as 
angry with the judicial system as anything. That whole experience was just 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Martinezes were stunned when Wilbur was allowed to go free without bail 
while awaiting trial. Hoping to sway the judge to keep the repeat offender 
behind bars, they gathered several thousand signatures in two days. "The judge 
looked at it, but it didn't make a difference," Ed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their frustration grew when Wilbur was ordered to prison for two years, which 
prosecutors described to the Martinez family as a "middle-of-the road" 
sentence, Ed recalled, shaking his head with in resigned contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drunk driving and killing somebody is treated with more leniency than 
stealing somebody's property," he said. "But we knew there wasn't going to be 
any man's justice that was going to satisfy us. Ten years wouldn't have made us 
feel any better. My son is dead. Only God can pass judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other differences between the way the two parents have dealt with 
the emotions that have buffeted them. Ed immersed himself in his work in custom 
software sales, hoping the labor would stave off the pain, but the stress has 
been building, he says, and things are not getting easier. He also began 
speaking at schools, lecturing students about the dangers of drinking and 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 'My theme is 'Dreams,' the things we dream about," Ed said. "I tell them about 
Jeff's dreams, to play basketball at UNLV, just to grow up. He was denied those 
dreams. Telling these kids about him and what happened makes me cope a little 
better. And maybe just one of these kids will listen and think about it when 
they have to make decisions about drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ed, who felt powerless during the trial, doing something helped him 
establish control in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Gail, activism was not the answer, nor was speaking to crowds. For 
her, plumbing her grief could only be done alone. As a result, she says, she 
has become withdrawn and fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 43 years I had no sorrow, no true sorrow," she said. "Then my son died 
for other people's sins. I want to heal and move forward. I don't want to be 
bitter, I want us all to be well again. But this has been . . . so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of me died with Jeff," she said, looking through a photo album. "And not 
a small part." 
</P>
<P>
 The workweek is a series of emotional peaks and valleys for Gail, an 
elementary schoolteacher. "And the peaks aren't really peaks," she said with a 
bemused smile. Some days, she looks out at the young faces in her class and she 
can only think about her lost child. The weekends are roughest, probably 
because of the time it allows her to look at pictures and think about the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxane Cohen Silver, associate professor of psychology at UC Irvine, said the 
different tack taken by the two parents is healthy and is evidence of the need 
for individuals to cope with their grief in the manner that suits them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite people telling others what they should do, there isn't a right or 
wrong way to respond," Silver said. "Another myth is that people recover from 
these experiences. They don't: They just learn to cope with it; they reach an 
equilibrium. But they don't forget it; they come to terms with it. It's been 
nine months for this family. That's not very long at all. A decade is not a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, who is writing a book about the grieving process, said that because 
every person has a different response and coping mechanism, it's difficult to 
give advice that holds up. The best she can do, she said, is to caution against 
pulling into a shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "People shouldn't shun their social network," she said. "A lot of people 
withdraw because they think their friends will get tired of hearing about it, 
or they think they're being a burden. But that interaction with the people 
around you can be very valuable. To their friends, I would tell them not to 
ignore the situation or form a conspiracy of silence. That only minimizes the 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Martinez, like his big brother, loves physical activity. He loves to 
shoot hoops, and around the house he is a blur, running through rooms chasing 
after his new puppy, Kaspar. The dog, a rambunctious black Labrador, is into 
everything and seems to have almost as much energy as his young master. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog has a lot of life, and that's a good thing for Jonathan right now," 
Ed said. "It's a good thing for this house." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his exuberance, Jonathan is not carefree, his parents say. Since his 
brother was killed, the child has been easily riled and more aggressive. He has 
also become less affectionate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't like to hug," Gail said. "And that's what I need most sometimes. 
It's like he decided, OK, no more of this kid stuff. He grew up a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Coombs said the boy's reaction is a familiar defense of youngsters in 
distress; they put up walls until they can figure out why bad things happen. 
"He's been hurt and is looking to get more control so it doesn't happen again," 
Coombs said. "He looked around and said, 'Why should I form bonds with other 
people if they are just going to unceremoniously leave?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, as does Gail, visits a professional counselor. He says he enjoys the 
talks, and he doesn't mind discussing his brother. "I miss him a lot," he says, 
and he recounts the way his sibling used to wrestle with him and play games. 
</P>
<P>
 In his room, on a shelf above his bed, Jonathan has an ornate, carved red 
horse made in Sweden. The treasure was a gift to Jeff from his grandparents, a 
souvenir bought before Jonathan was born. When Jeff died, the younger boy 
picked it from all of Jeff's things to have as a keepsake. 
</P>
<P>
 Running his fingers over the grooves of the horse's mane, Jonathan tried to 
make sense of his brother's death. "He got hit by a drunk driver," he explains. 
"I loved him. I wish that everyone in the world would not drink." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy is young, his parents say, and they are optimistic that he will grow 
beyond the pain of Jeff's abrupt departure, that he will display the resiliency 
that protects youngsters from life's cruelties. In the meantime, they can only 
wonder how he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we're just not sure where Jonathan's at with all this, how he's 
handling it," Gail said. "We were this loving unit who knew each other, but now 
that's been shot to smithereens. And it makes me mad." 
</P>
<P>
 To grapple with that anger, Gail and Ed have often turned to their religious 
faith and, more specifically, to Pastor John Bradosky at Grace Lutheran Church 
in Westminster. Besides consoling them and offering spiritual insights, 
Bradosky shared his own experiences with grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our son died when he was the age of 6," Bradosky said. "It was, and is, very 
painful for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradosky's child died seven years ago in an automobile accident, and seeing 
the Martinez family grapple with Jeff's death struck the minister hard.  
</P>
<P>
 Two months before he performed Jeff's funeral, Bradosky had watched the tall 
boy walking down the church aisle for a confirmation service. He remembered 
thinking on that day how his own son would have been Jeff's age if he had 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people hurting; there are so many people who have lost 
someone," Bradosky said, thinking of the tragedies that have brushed the lives 
of his congregation members. "They're everywhere."

FOR HEALTH-CONSCIOUS AMERICANS, IT'S WHEEL LOVE; CYCLING: ADVANCES IN

 If you left your old chrome-plated, balloon-tired Schwinn in a closet 40 years 
ago and haven't thought much about bicycles since, these items might surprise 
you: 
</P>
<P>
 * 900 million bicycles are in use worldwide, making the bike the prime source 
of transportation for most people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 100 million bicycles -- that's three times more than cars -- were produced 
globally in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of bikes in the United States has soared to 120 million. That's 
more bikes per capita than there are in China or India.  
</P>
<P>
 * Only "exercise walking" and swimming are more popular participatory 
activities than biking in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over the past decade, the number of Americans who commute by bicycle has 
increased nearly threefold, to 4.3 million. Every state has a staff bicycle 
coordinator attempting to integrate bicycles into the transportation system of 
the future. (In car-clogged Los Angeles, $50 million has been allocated over 
five years for such programs as bike lanes, bike bridges and bike lockers at 
Metrolink stations.) 
</P>
<P>
 Why are Americans getting back into the saddle? 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 reason people give in surveys we conduct every year is always 
health, fitness, exercise," says Chuck McCullagh, publisher of Bicycling 
magazine. "They've embraced the bicycle as they did the running shoe in the 
'70s." 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that advances in bicycle technology and comfort and, well, let some 
bike riders tell it. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Ezra Brown, 54, heads out of his home in West Windsor, Conn., at 6:15 a.m. on 
a 10-speed Peugeot. He turns left on Herman Way, makes his way over to 
Ellington Road, then does some hair-raising navigation on congested Route 5, 
careful to avoid broken glass along the shoulder. The 12-mile trip to Trinity 
College, where he is plant engineer, takes 45 minutes. His estimated annual 
savings in fuel: more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been commuting by bike for about 15 years," he says. "Hartford's not 
bike-friendly, but the drivers are decent and courteous. When I lived in 
Fairbanks (Alaska), I had drunks throw bottles that shattered in front of my 
wheels. In western Pennsylvania, (people) would give me the finger and try to 
run me off the road with their pickups. So Hartford's not bad, but if they want 
to get more people biking to work, they've got to sweep the glass off the edges 
of the street and fill the potholes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Norville Jones, a 64-year-old retired Washington lobbyist, left 
the West Coast on his 21-speed Trek 520, designed for long-distance touring, 
and pedaled for two months until he made it home to Virginia, 4,246 miles away. 
He averaged 74 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he's made a 3,000-mile transcontinental crossing, taken a 
1,500-mile trip through New England, and started planning a big loop through 
the West as he closes in on his goal to bicycle across all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 His only complaint? "The head winds. They're psychologically debilitating, 
like pushing a rock uphill. Other than that, it's been terrific. My bike has 
never broken down. People have been great everywhere. It's just a wonderful way 
to discover America at ground zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Linda Erwin and Dianne Gittins of the Alexandria, Va., Police 
Department, one of 600 law-enforcement agencies in the country that uses bike 
patrols, took some good-natured ribbing from their male colleagues when they 
showed up in shorts and with their own mountain bikes as the first volunteers 
for a pilot program two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty minutes later, they made a heroin bust. Soon each was averaging 30 
arrests a month; the department average for officers in cars was 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a bike, you tend to roll right up on stuff happening, like drug deals," 
Erwin says. Alexandria now has nine full-time bike officers, patrolling 24 
hours a day, and a long list of volunteers who want to join the unit. (Los 
Angeles has 119 officers on bikes.) 
</P>

 When bicycling was at the peak of its popularity a century ago, 400 U.S. 
companies were manufacturing bikes. Today the United States has only six major 
producers and the industry is split into two distinct segments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The mass retail market for low-cost and children's bikes, dominated by three 
U.S. manufacturers: Huffy, Murray and Roadmaster, which are keeping a wary eye 
on imports, particularly from China. This segment accounts for about 8.5 
million of the 12 million bikes sold in the nation annually. (Californians buy 
one out of every six new bicycles). 
</P>
<P>
 * The upscale market, which caters to 5,000 independent dealers. The dominant 
manufacturers in this segment -- Trek, Cannondale and Raleigh -- have always 
faced keen international competition, and, like the Big Three auto makers in 
Detroit, have staked their futures on technology, design and quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Trek is a good example of the renaissance of the U.S. bicycle manufacturer. 
Started in 1975 with one model and four employees working in a rented warehouse 
in Waterloo, the company has grown into a major international producer with 812 
employees, 41 models of advanced design, and sales that have increased 40% 
annually since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 On these busy days of the pre-spring rush, up to 2,000 bicycles a day roll off 
the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we tried to sell the same product as the Chinese, they'd blow us out of 
the water because we can't compete on price," says Thomas Albers, Trek's chief 
operating officer. "So in a global market, we have to differentiate our 
product, and you do that through, among other things, quality and innovation." 
</P>
<P>
 At Trek and other manufacturers, the mountain, or off-road, bike has captured 
the lion's share of the market, and enthusiasts are finding no shortage of 
routes to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 They can roll through 45 states on 6,808 miles of abandoned railroad 
right-of-ways that have been converted into paved recreational pathways. 
</P>
<P>
 One interlinking bike path extends from Washington, D.C., to Pittsburgh, Pa., 
save for a 20-mile section still under construction. The Rails-to-Trails 
Conservancy in Washington, D.C., hopes its off-road bikeways will extend coast 
to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 gives 
states flexibility so that federal funds traditionally set aside for highways 
can now be used for biking, pedestrian and transit improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The act, which will provide $155 million over six years, reflects a major 
revision of the goals of the federal transportation program, created 40 years 
ago to build the interstate highway system. 
</P>
<P>
 One result, transportation planners say, will be more bicycle-friendly cities 
that try to accommodate bike commuters with protected lanes, parking facilities 
and access to public-transit vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of communities are already moving in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers in Santa Monica who regularly bike to work receive an extra $1 a 
day. Pasadena bought 12 bikes and gave them to city employees who promised to 
pedal to work.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles hopes to put bike racks on all 2,000 city buses. Davis, Calif., 
has an extensive network of pathways to virtually every neighborhood. Madison, 
Wis., has a bike thoroughfare that carries 7,000 bikers a day through the heart 
of the city. New York City is planning a 500-mile network of bike routes 
through Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation experts point out that if 10% of car commuters switched to a 
combination of public transit and bicycles, the nation's saving in fuel costs 
would be $1 billion a year. Plus, they say, traffic problems would be reduced 
because 18 bikes can be parked in the space needed by one car. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many companies encouraging bike commuting, Fleetwood Enterprise Inc. in 
Riverside, the world's largest maker of recreational vehicles and manufactured 
homes, is considered among the most innovative. 
</P>
<P>
 Its four-year-old program, known as "Blood, Sweat and Gears," provides 
bike-commuting employees with shower and parking facilities, free helmets, 
reflective vests, discounts at a local bike shop, and a guaranteed ride home -- 
by car -- for family emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, more than 10% of Fleetwood's 650 employees were bicycling to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Roberta Holden, Fleetwood's employee-transportation coordinator: "This 
isn't the answer to all our congestion and pollution problems, but it's 
certainly one of the strategies that needs to be considered."

FRESH AIR, OPEN SPACES: ALL THIS AND YOU GET A GOOD WORKOUT, TOO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN RYAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A aaaah . . . the wind on your face, as the sounds of whirling spokes soothe 
your soul. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing quite like the refreshing tranquillity of bicycling. Few 
exercises offer more variety with such mobility. Hard to believe you get all 
this, plus an excellent workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clearly one of the best exercises available for aerobic training," says 
Jeanne Earley, a cycling enthusiast and physical therapist at Barnes Hospital 
in St. Louis. "Over an extended period of time, cycling trains the heart and 
lungs to become more efficient with the fuel they receive." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder patients recovering from heart attacks are often put on a 
cycling regime. Studies show that biking at least three times a week for 30 
minutes strengthens and protects the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Biking "is a good exercise for a lot of different types of people," says 
Dennis O'Connell, exercise physiologist and director of the Human Performance 
Laboratory at the Health Science Center of the University of Texas, San 
Antonio. "People with orthopedic problems or osteoporosis, elderly people, 
people with diabetes, and (people) who are overweight. It's an excellent mode 
of exercise because it's non-weight-bearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Biking -- which burns 400 to 700 calories an hour -- is also great for legs, 
which hold 65% of the body's main muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a recent study conducted at the University of Vermont found that 
longer workouts at lower intensities burn more fat.  
</P>
<P>
 Bicycling is also a favorite among physical therapists. "We use the exercise 
bike a lot to increase a patient's range of motion," Earley says. "Cycling is a 
great way to restore flexibility in patients who have flexibility problems." 
</P>
<P>
 And a good cycle is also good for the joints. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "a less stressful exercise for the body and a perfect way for joints to 
get the oxygen and nutrients they need to function," Earley says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like any exercise, though, good form is imperative to getting the maximum 
benefit and avoiding injury. "Keep your body aligned so muscles are working in 
the positions they were meant to," Earley says. 
</P>
<P>
 For less stressful biking, use higher gears going down hills and in tail 
winds, and lower gears going up hills and on level ground. Pace yourself and 
restore your energy not only physically, but by shifting gears mentally, too.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; CELEBRATING THE QUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quilting, which nearly disappeared from American homes after World War II, is 
flourishing again and what better place to celebrate the renaissance than the 
1994 Lancaster County Quilt Festival from April 1-10 in Lancaster, 
Penn.Attention will center on quilts made by the Amish, who established their 
first permanent settlement in America in Lancaster, and who kept on quilting 
when others didn't. The People's Place Quilt Museum will display examples of 
Amish quilt patterns such as those pictured from left, Center Diamond; Sunshine 
and Shadow, and Bars (1890-1900). For a free brochure on the festival and a 
visitor's guide to "Pennsylvania Dutch Country and Lancaster County," call 
(800) PA DUTCH, Ext. 2420.

QUAKE-ZONE LEGISLATORS ARE QUICK TO RESPOND; GOVERNMENT: VALLEY LAWMAKERS ARE 
HEEDING THEIR CONSTITUENTS' CALLS FOR CHANGE, RELIEF. SOME MEASURES ALREADY ARE 
LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now, Assemblywoman Paula Boland has hired a contractor to knock down the 
brick chimney towering precariously over her Granada Hills home and 
Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman has buried the grandfather she lost to 
earthquake-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz's cracked tile kitchen floor has been ripped out with 
a jackhammer and state Sen. Tom Hayden -- one of the lucky ones because his 
Santa Monica home was bolted down -- has long since swept up shattered glass 
from pictures that crashed to the floor on Jan 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the constituents they serve, many of the state legislators who live in 
the fault zone have had to cope with property damage from the Northridge quake, 
along with lasting memories of heartache and terror too. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friedman's case, any damage to her district office or home was "way, way 
overshadowed," she noted, by the loss of her 95-year-old grandfather, who died 
due to medical complications after falling and breaking his hip during the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Katz, the worst was not losing objects with sentimental value such as 
an antique desk and his wedding china, but being haunted by a recollection of 
fires and explosions in the pre-dawn hours after the quake. "It was an 
experience I'm not likely to forget anytime soon," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the temblor was a reality check for lawmakers trying to stay in touch 
with real-life concerns, it was also a powerful reminder that political 
survival hinges on swift response to crises on the home front. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after the quake, nearly all of the legislators whose districts fall 
within the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys have heeded that 
call by proposing changes in public policy to help make life easier for 
earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, in some cases, have already passed both houses and been signed 
into law by Gov. Pete Wilson. Other bills are moving more slowly, and may not 
go up for a final vote until June. 
</P>
<P>
 And while much of the earthquake-relief legislation is being offered up by 
lawmakers from outside the stricken districts, a glance at the proposed new 
laws being shepherded by members of the local delegation reveals a wide array 
of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation ranges from practical (allowing retirement account money to be 
used for quake emergencies) to common sense (requiring public notices to be 
displayed on unsafe buildings) to the preventive (retrofitting more freeway 
bridges). 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the lawmakers who are teaming up to jointly author bills say the quake 
sparked a new, urgent spirit of cooperation, nudging the local delegation 
together in pursuit of a common goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the good things that's come out of this is that legislators 
are trying to work with each other to make sure relief is provided to the 
community as a whole," said Friedman (D-North Hollywood). 
</P>
<P>
 Others report being disappointed with the pace of quake-relief efforts in 
Sacramento, noting that, in 1989, funding measures moved quickly after the Loma 
Prieta quake struck Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, what we've seen is a long delay followed by very onerous bond 
measures being proposed as the only solution, putting the burden on taxpayers 
of future generations," said Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who favored a temporary 
sales-tax increase to finance reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Observed Katz (D-Sylmar): "After the Loma Prieta quake . . . all the (funding) 
legislation was passed within three weeks of the quake," compared to the nearly 
two months it took to get bond legislation passed this year. "I think it would 
have been good if the Legislature had moved quicker this year." 
</P>
<P>
 To examine whether state government has been responsive enough, a new 
oversight panel, the Senate Select Committee on the Northridge Earthquake, will 
start hearings later this spring, with state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) 
as its chairman.  
</P>
<P>
 And next Friday, Roberti is hosting a leadership conference in Reseda to 
review legislation and discuss ideas for more remedies. The event, with panels 
on transportation, emergency preparedness, housing and economic development, is 
expected to draw politicians from the city, county, state and federal levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at some of the proposed new laws that local delegation members 
have pushed in Sacramento: ECONOMIC RELIEF 
</P>
<P>
 Known as a conciliator during his 13-year reign as Senate president pro tem, 
Roberti was tapped by the governor to gather bipartisan support for a 
$2-billion bond measure to finance quake recovery costs and highway seismic 
safety improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, signed by Wilson last week, was a result of the governor's 
refusal in an election year to go along with the temporary tax increase 
proposed by Hayden and other Democrats. The bonds will go before voters on the 
June ballot as part of a total package of nearly $4 billion in borrowing 
measures to finance quake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week also saw the signing of a measure by Katz and Boland to give Los 
Angeles County bailout money to help make up for lower tax receipts because of 
earthquake-damaged property. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law also provides needed relief to individuals who suffered heavy 
financial losses because of earthquake damage. Those victims can deduct from 
their 1993 state tax bill the full amount of their uninsured losses that exceed 
10% of their gross income. 
</P>
<P>
 The same deduction can then be applied to state tax returns for five years, 
and for 10 years after that, 50% of the losses can be deducted. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), Friedman and Hayden also 
proposed similar remedies to help victims write off their losses and give local 
government stop-gap funding. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Boland is backing a bill that she says would slice wages for 
repair work on public projects by 20%.  
</P>
<P>
 Boland maintains that if the state suspends the "prevailing wage rate" paid to 
workers repairing shattered freeway bridges, it will save more than $450 
million in salary costs. CONSUMER RELIEF 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to stop price gouging in the aftermath of earthquake were proposed by 
state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), Katz and Friedman.  
</P>
<P>
 And Wright and Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale) both came up 
with the idea of asking the federal government to waive early withdrawal 
penalties for individual retirement accounts if the money is used for 
earthquake-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright is also pursuing legislation to allow quake victims whose records were 
damaged an extension on the tax filing deadline of April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 And Roberti is proposing waiving fees for driver's licenses that were lost or 
destroyed as a result of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have private insurance but need help negotiating the system, 
Hayden is holding a consumer workshop at Dixie Canyon Elementary School in 
Sherman Oaks on Thursday. TRANSPORTATION 
</P>
<P>
 If voters approve the bond measure written by Roberti and supported by other 
Valley-area members, funds will be freed up to pay for reconstruction of 
crippled roadways and collapsed freeway bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other proposals will help traffic flow until the work is completed -- a 
Katz measure to encourage staggered work hours for public employees, and a plan 
proposed separately by Rosenthal and Wright to urge telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz also has authored a bill requiring Caltrans to finish up seismic 
retrofitting of freeway spans before the agency launches any new projects. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hayden is drafting a request to the governor that he include some seismic 
safety experts in his appointments to the state transportation commission. 
PUBLIC SAFETY 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, who has balanced his gubernatorial bid on the back of his indignation 
over California's lack of quake preparedness, blames "official neglect for more 
than half the damage" from the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he is drafting amendments to toughen preparedness requirements, 
particularly in schools. One of his top goals, he says, would be to force 
schools to quake-proof classrooms so objects couldn't fly off shelves and 
strike children should another powerful temblor occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposal he authored would require the posting of public disclosure 
notices on buildings that have not been strengthened to current seismic safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 A measure by Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) would require not only 
that a sign be posted, but that all California hospitals built before 1973 be 
brought up to current safety standards. Friedman is also co-authoring the bill. 
HOUSING 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, whose Sylmar home is located halfway between two mobile home parks that 
exploded into flames after the Northridge quake, has written a bill to toughen 
earthquake standards for such homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood) authored a measure to prevent 
eviction of tenants who are awaiting disaster relief assistance from the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Roberti bill would penalize landlords who raise rents exorbitantly after 
a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no small amount of duplication in the proposals being placed on 
the table, things have improved since the Loma Prieta quake in 1979, when a 
special session produced an avalanche of legislation, said Chris Lindstrom, 
legislative liaison for the Seismic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a greater coordination of efforts so there isn't a free-for-all. 
There hasn't been an influx of bills based on gut reactions," Lindstrom said. 
"It's been more orderly, more definite and more deliberate."

FROM 'BLACK START' TO FULL POWER; DWP: ENERGY CONTROL CENTER BATTLED CRISIS 
AFTER CRISIS TO RESTORE ELECTRICITY KNOCKED OUT BY THE EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no street name on the two-lane road that winds up a rural hillside in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley. At the top is a tall, gray gate but no sign 
offering visitors a clue to the business that takes place beyond, in a 
windowless bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 Such secrecy has its wisdom: This is Los Angeles' energy control center, the 
heart of the Department of Water and Power's electrical network that brings 
power to 1.2 million customers. Protecting that lifeline from sabotage is 
essential. 
</P>
<P>
 But two months after the Northridge quake wrestled the city's 5,000-megawatt 
power system to a sudden, cold halt, workers behind the tall gates offered a 
brief glance inside the secret compound to recount their fretful struggle to 
restore the juice in the morning hours of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The most daunting challenge was reviving a system completely void of energy -- 
what is known in the power business as a "black start." For utility workers, it 
is the worst-case scenario, a challenge historically faced only by a small 
handful of cities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a catastrophe, a real catastrophe, a total catastrophe," Dan 
Connolly, a senior power dispatcher, said as he sat behind his computer console 
overlooking the command center. "But that's what we deal with here. This is 
what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hours and days following the quake, the otherwise restrained activities 
in the control center gained a new sense of urgency. Power dispatchers worked 
around the clock for several days, some sleeping on the floors in bathrooms and 
offices. Meals were brought in by supervisors. Workers ate at their desks and 
some only got up for bathroom breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 To restore power, workers relied on some imaginative engineering to circumvent 
rips in the power distribution web -- lines downed and receiving stations 
damaged by the shaking. In one case, a crane was used as a stand-in for a 
downed transmission tower. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, power to nearly all 1.2 million customers was restored within 24 
hours, despite nearly $118 million in damage to the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was truly dramatic," said Marcie Edwards, chief power dispatcher -- the 
only woman in the nation charged with heading the electrical distribution 
system of a major utility. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, some of the 100 workers at the energy control center wear specially 
made T-shirts and hats that convey their pride in overcoming the crisis. The 
emblem on the shirts and hats depict a broken light bulb and the words "Black 
Start: Been there. Done that." 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the city's power comes from coal-fired plants in Arizona, Utah 
and Nevada and hydroelectric plants in the Pacific Northwest. The rest is 
generated at city-owned thermal and hydrogenerators throughout the Los Angeles 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake knocked out the gigantic network used to import power from 
plants outside the basin and triggered an automatic shut-off system that 
disconnected generators in the basin from the system to protect them from 
further damage. At 4:31 a.m., the city was completely in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 For Edwards, the crisis was evident right from the start, when she called in 
from her home in Santa Clarita to the control center minutes after the quake 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone. It's all gone," the senior power dispatcher on the graveyard shift 
told Edwards, then the line went silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards comes from a long chain of electrical workers, dating back more than 
100 years when her grandfather joined the city's utility even before it was 
called the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of her predecessors has ever had to deal with a black start. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a career breaker, this black start," Edwards said. "I could be back 
scrubbing floors." 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly, who also heard the frantic message when he called the center, drove 
from his home in Valencia to Edwards' home a few miles away. They both headed 
to the control center. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived at the entrance to the control center, they met up with a 
crew of firefighters who were trying to evacuate a top floor of the compound. 
The quake had tripped a fire extinguishing system, flooding the floor with 
halon gas, making it impossible to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the chaos and the collapse of several major freeway routes following 
the quake, about 25 dispatchers and other workers had also reached the center 
by 5 a.m. and were already tackling the black start. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers had even driven in on dirt roads, which follow high-power lines 
over the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the compound, workers headed to the nerve center of the building: a 
huge circular room on the bottom floor that resembles a military command 
headquarters -- its steel walls covered with diagrams of the entire citywide 
electric distribution system. Black lines represent 230,000-volt power lines, 
red lines represent 138,000-volt lines and blue lines represent 500,000 volts. 
Zig-zag lines depict circuit breakers. Boxes show locations of receiving 
stations and generators. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatchers studied the diagram to devise a way to move power around the 
most heavily damaged sections of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of brainstorming," said Edwards as she paused in the middle 
of the command center, two months after the quake. "A lot of people were 
standing around different boards talking about 'If we do this . . . No . . . If 
we close that circuit, then we can open this one . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 The trick to performing a black start is not regaining too much power too 
fast, Edwards said. They knew that an overload could bring the entire system 
crashing down, forcing dispatchers to start at ground zero. In 1977, New York 
was blacked out for 25 hours after a lightning strike, but, partly because of 
overloading, it took three days to completely mend the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in restoring power was reconnecting Los Angeles to the Western 
Interconnection, the power grid that interconnects 68 utilities throughout the 
western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of many victories, dispatchers were able to get power from the 
outside network into the DWP's oldest line, the 287,000-volt 
Victorville-Century line, which is located south of Los Angeles and farthest 
from the quake epicenter. They then channeled power to the Haynes thermal 
generator in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The luckiest residents were just beginning to assess quake damage when their 
lights came on again. The Haynes generator received power five minutes after 
the quake struck. Thirty-three minutes later, power had been restored to 80,000 
customers in south Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 From that small beginning, dispatchers and workers in the field began 
spreading the power from one generator to another through high-power lines, as 
if plugging together a long chain of extension cords around the city. They took 
circuitous routes from the south to the north, working around the most heavily 
damaged areas. By 8 p.m. that evening, portions of all four thermal generators 
in the city were on line. 
</P>
<P>
 An overwhelming problem was the transmission tower that carries power from the 
Castaic hydroelectric plant into the basin. It was thrown to the ground during 
the quake in the hills north of Placerita Canyon. DWP workers raised the lines 
off the ground with a crane and thus reconnected the city with the 
hydroelectric plant by the following afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "That stuff is unheard of," Edwards said. "It's immensely innovative." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the control center, while the team of dispatchers extended the power 
network around the city, a group of "power brokers" hovered nearby, negotiating 
over the phone the purchase of power from other utilities tied into the Western 
Interconnection. "That desk was a madhouse," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kleven, a load dispatcher who lives in Northridge, the epicenter of the 
quake, said that despite the devastation to the system and workers' fears about 
the safety of family and friends, there was never a sense of panic in the 
control center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to get it back," he said. "That's the job. Bit by bit. It's what 
we are trained for." 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks after the quake, news of the black start began to spread among utilities 
throughout the country by way of utility newsletters and magazines, turning the 
normally anonymous bunker workers into celebrities within their own field. 
Edwards said she and her co-workers have been inundated with requests from 
other cities to lecture about restoring utilities from a complete blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only was it the first time ever (for Los Angeles), but the best part is 
we did it so great," Edwards said. "There was so much room for it to be a rough 
road."

LOCAL ARABS, JEWS TO SPEAK FOR PEACE; OUTREACH: SPURRED BY THE HEBRON MASSACRE, 
L.A. GROUPS WILL CREATE A JOINT SPEAKERS BUREAU TO OPEN DIALOGUE ON EFFORTS 
TOWARD PACT IN MIDDLE EAST. 
</P>

<P>
 Only hours after the massacre of dozens of Muslim worshipers in a mosque in 
Hebron, Jewish and Arab leaders in Los Angeles got together to decry the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, undaunted by the lack of communication between Israel and the Palestinian 
leadership, local representatives are taking their dialogue one step further 
with the establishment of a joint speakers bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was born at a joint dinner of Jewish and Arab groups last December, 
but it took on urgency after the Feb. 25 Hebron shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers, Arabs and Jews, will appear as a team before audiences at 
churches, synagogues, mosques, schools and community groups, said Monir Deeb, a 
board member of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are arguments, let it be," said Deeb, a Palestinian who works with 
an Israeli partner in a San Fernando Valley general contracting business. "This 
is a dialogue that people should be able to initiate, hopefully toward peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizing the effort are groups including the Anti-Discrimination Committee 
and local chapters of the National Assn. of Arab Americans, the American Jewish 
Congress and Americans for Peace Now, a support group for the Israeli peace 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to build a consensus to support the peace process in the 
United States, and that's the goal of the this speakers bureau," said Rabbi 
Laura Geller, regional executive director of the Congress, a Westside-based 
organization that calls itself "the progressive voice in the Jewish community." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jews support the government of Israel, and Arab Americans support the 
initiatives of the Palestinian people, and therefore our involvement makes 
sense," she said. "We don't make policy, but our support is not an 
insignificant factor in the whole equation." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone supports the effort. David Lehrer, regional director of the 
Anti-Defamation League, said that his Jewish-sponsored organization has been 
sued by Deeb's group over allegations of spying by an ADL operative in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the statements and actions against the ADL, one must wonder about the 
seriousness of their commitment to dialogue with the Jewish community," Lehrer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Julian White, regional director of Americans for a Safe Israel, said he 
thought that joint appearances would send a misleading message about the 
position of American Jews. A significant number of Jews, he pointed out, oppose 
the surrender of any territory to Palestinian control -- a key component of the 
Middle East peace accord proposed in Washington last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reflects a total self-identification of those two Jewish organizations 
with the Arab position, and the Arab position is the same position as the PLO," 
he said. "We are certainly at the opposite pole in terms of the accord." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting sponsored by White's group last Tuesday, West Bank settlers' 
spokesman Elyakim Ha'etzni told a friendly crowd of about 200 at the Beth Jacob 
synagogue in Beverly Hills that the peace process was "a sinister plan for the 
destruction of Israel by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the killings of 33 Israeli Jews since Prime Minister Yitzhak met with 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last September, he urged American Jews to "use 
your influence on the American Administration, on the Israeli embassy and the 
Israeli consulates. Don't let them get away with this. Help 150,000 Jews whose 
safety is imperiled. We are holding the fort for all of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha'etzni's call was the sort of thing that organizers of the speakers bureau 
hope to counteract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's going to be part of our discussion group," joked Gerald 
Bubis, the local chair of Americans for Peace Now. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubis said the goal of the speakers bureau is to help people understand their 
differences on the extent of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories 
and the final resolution of Jerusalem, among other issues, and to try to 
identify areas of agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not engaged in diplomacy but trying to sensitize," Bubis said. "What 
I'm afraid of is that each community is bleeding, metaphorically and literally, 
and each community is feeling more despair, and the Ha'etznis of the world can 
get many more people out and exercised than moderating speakers and moderate 
voices." 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of meetings to identify speakers within their own groups, the 
four sponsoring organizations have scheduled a joint session in April, with 
hopes of completing their training and taking their act on the road by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who invites them, they will go," said Tony Amsih, a Sherman Oaks real 
estate broker who is president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. 
of Arab Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the killings in Hebron, he said, "We feel the need to push 
forward and the sooner the better, not to give a chance to the opportunists to 
target the whole effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Other outreach efforts have included expressions of sympathy by almost all the 
Jewish organizations in Los Angeles, said Dr. Meher Hothout, spokesman for the 
Islamic Center of Los Angeles, the city's largest mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciated that, although we indicated we need more than that," said 
Hothout. "We need to demand that the causes of the problem should be dealt 
with." Specifically, he said, the presence of armed Jewish settlers in the 
midst of the occupied territories must be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is intense disagreement over the future of the Middle East, he 
said, "the environment of discourse and debate is more in Los Angeles than in 
any other place in the world."

VALLEY BRIEFING: CAN YOU HUM A FEW BARS?; SALUTING THE VALLEY IN SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like a beacon that drew thousands west, with talk of the "cow country" 
and visions of forwarding mail "care of RFD." Moviegoers were the first to hear 
the call in a 1944 Roy Rogers western. But it was Bing Crosby's recording of 
"San Fernando Valley" soon afterward that was on the lips of people throughout 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 This month marks the 50th anniversary of the song hitting the Billboard 
charts, climbing to No. 1 on April 29, 1944. It was on the charts a total of 22 
weeks -- five weeks at the top position -- competing with such tunes as 
"Cow-Cow Boogie" and "Mairzy Doats." It caught the attention of GI's looking 
for a place to settle down and raise a family after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The late composer-arranger-conductor Gordon Jenkins wrote the catchy song when 
he lived in Sherman Oaks, after moving here from New York. "I remember him 
saying it was going to pay for the house," said a son, Gordon Jenkins Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The song was re-released on CD last year by MCA in a commemorative box set 
titled "Bing Crosby -- His Legendary Years." "It was one of his least favorite, 
but it was one of the most popular," said another son, Bruce Jenkins. Searching 
for A Song  
</P>
<P>
 New Yorkers have "New York, New York." San Franciscans have "I Left My Heart 
in San Francisco." Pasadena has "The Little Old Lady From Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 And what does Los Angeles have as its anthem? One songwriter suggested "I Left 
My Liver in the L.A. River." Honest. It was one of thousands of tunes written 
during Los Angeles' long search for an official song. Although Randy Newman's 
"I Love L.A." was honored with a proclamation by the Los Angeles City Council, 
the officials declined to declare it the city's official song. "I'm Just From 
Encino..." 
</P>
<P>

2 SHOT BY INTRUDER IN BOTCHED COMPUTER THEFT

<P>
 Two Reseda men were shot and critically wounded Saturday by an armed intruder 
who pretended to be interested in buying a computer that one of the men had 
recently listed in the Recycler, a weekly advertiser, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in his early 20s knocked on the door of a house in the 18400 block of 
Keswick Street about 6 p.m. and inquired about the computer.Once inside, the 
man allegedly pulled a handgun and bound both men with rope, said Sgt. Roger 
Ferguson of LAPD's West Valley Division.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims managed to free himself and got a handgun of his own. A 
shootout ensued, leaving both victims with chest wounds, Ferguson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police believe at least one shot hit the suspect as he ran from the house. The 
computer, which police believe the intruder intended to steal, was not taken, 
Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two victims were listed in critical condition at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 A woman also was in the house during the attempted holdup, but was not 
injured, police said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

STATE INVESTIGATES SPILL INTO RIVER; POLLUTION: MIXTURE OF CRUDE OIL AND WATER 
IS HEADING TOWARD THE OCEAN. FIRM DEFENDS REPORT THAT SAID NO WATERWAYS WERE 
AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials Saturday began investigating an oil spill flowing into the 
Santa Clara River and toward the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill, 30,000 gallons of water mixed with light crude oil, wound its way 
down a remote Santa Paula canyon into the Santa Clara River after overflowing 
from a Unocal storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt it's in the Santa Clara River and on its way to the ocean," 
said state Fish and Game Lt. Chris Long, who was assigned to the case Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports from Fish and Game wardens said that no wildlife or habitat 
were severely damaged as a result of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Thick globs of oil covered the edges of Adams Barranca on Saturday -- seven 
days after the state Office of Emergency Services was told of the release. The 
barranca is a small tributary that merges with the Santa Clara River before 
moving on to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Unocal executives notified the state of the release March 
12, but that information from the oil company prompted wardens to slow their 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Long, Unocal told the state that the release was contained and 
had not entered any waterways. Based on that information, an investigator "did 
not see it as something he had to respond to," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Marshall, a field superintendent for the oil company, defended his report 
to state officials, saying that rain Saturday might have caused some of the 
oily residue to flow into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said his interpretation of the law was that Adams Barranca is not a 
waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 "A waterway is something like the Santa Clara River," he said. "Not Adams 
Barranca." 
</P>
<P>
 Long interviewed Unocal workers at the company's Santa Paula facility for much 
of Saturday. He said he has requested internal company documents relating to 
the release. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said seismic activity, apparently after the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, caused a substantial increase in the amount of oil that 
naturally seeps from century-old tunnels in Adams Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Production foreman Walker Kozer said the company maintains a series of pipes 
along the tunnel edges that collects the crude and transports it to nearby 
storage tanks. But the tanks can only hold 100 barrels -- 4,200 gallons -- 
before overflowing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company replaced the 100-barrel storage tanks with 500-barrel tanks last 
week, Kozer said. At least two dozen employees were working every day to clean 
up the oil, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dammed it up, sopped it all up and cleaned it up," said Kozer, who called 
the cleanup 80% complete Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozer estimated that 500 of the 30,000 gallons that flowed over the edge of 
the storage tank was crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crews in Santa Barbara County worked to clean up 2,000 gallons of 
crude oil that spilled from a Mobil Oil processing facility at Elwood Beach 
north of Santa Barbara late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil said the spill was detected when golfers noticed oil oozing into an area 
near the tee for the 12th hole at Sandpiper Golf Course, which is next to 
Mobil's Elwood Beach facility, said Mobil spokeswoman Shauna Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said crews worked all day Friday and most of Saturday to build holding 
dams on the beach, where the light crude oil had flowed.

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS LEARN TECHNIQUES IN MEDIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Keppel High School students Tony Montes and Alma Mora glared at each 
other in mock anger across the table, as student mediator Cassandra Rodriguez 
settled into a seat between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He slapped me," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw her talking to some guy, joking around. I didn't like that," Montes 
countered. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez cleared her throat and began explaining the rules of mediation: "I 
don't have the power to make any decision; you have to make it. I will not take 
sides. There's no name-calling or put-downs, no physical fighting, and no 
interrupting." 
</P>
<P>
 The classroom exercise was developed by students in a class on conflict 
resolution. By September, the 24 students will use their skills to intervene in 
a variety of real-life conflicts at their high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the class was a spate of racially charged conflicts between 
Asian and Latino students at Mark Keppel a year ago. During two days of 
fighting, police arrested 12 students and confiscated seven knives and a loaded 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the course, students learn to calm tensions between classmates before 
they reach boiling point. Beyond intercultural conflicts, they'll handle 
boyfriend-girlfriend fights, sibling squabbles and eventually even 
student-teacher disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 English teacher Gabriella Manchester and history teacher Gissella Castro 
designed the class last fall, pooling material from the Anti-Defamation League 
and other sources. Hands-on training in conflict mediation is provided by the 
Martin Luther King Dispute Resolution Center. 
</P>
<P>
 About equally divided between Asians and Latinos, boys and girls, the class 
includes freshmen through seniors, honors students and special-education 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers throughout the school recommended students who could act as leaders 
-- but not only sports captains and student government members.  
</P>
<P>
 "We also chose some non-traditional leaders," Manchester said, including some 
who may be associated with gangs. "Kids who assert what teachers call a 
negative influence, but who nonetheless have great influence." 
</P>
<P>
 The students, earnest and enthusiastic, mix fluidly, as though the racial 
division that prompted the course doesn't exist behind the classroom door. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the training has given them insight into their own conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps you think about what you did wrong and what the other person did 
wrong," said junior Gloria Martinez. "Instead of yelling and getting mad it 
helps you think of what's really going on."

<P>
 A driver who was speeding in the rain crashed his car into a power pole 
Saturday, killing his 29-year-old son, a passenger in the vehicle, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim died at the scene, said Capt. Bob Hancock of the Los Angeles County 
Fire Department.His name was withheld until other relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, a 62-year-old Palmdale man, suffered a broken neck in the accident 
and was in critical but stable condition at Antelope Valley Medical Center, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 1 p.m. when the driver lost control of the car as 
he headed west on Palmdale Boulevard near 190th Street East. A 32-year-old 
woman, also a passenger, was not seriously injured, said California Highway 
Patrol Officer Bruce Ferrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the car "sheared the telephone pole off at the bottom and 
knocked it 10 feet back," Hancock said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

NEW REMOTE OFFICES PLANNED, BUT MANY WORKERS ON ROAD AGAIN; TELECOMMUTING: 
LANCASTER LEADERS WILL OPEN TWO CENTERS DESPITE WANING INTEREST AFTER FREEWAY 
REPAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two months after the Northridge earthquake, civic leaders hope Los Angeles 
employers are still willing to let road-weary commuters work in high-tech 
satellite offices in the Antelope Valley instead of driving downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new remote work centers will open next month in Lancaster to encourage 
more telecommuting. The sites -- one run by Los Angeles County, the other by 
the Antelope Valley Fair Board -- will each offer desks, computers and 
telephone lines, allowing local employees to work many miles away from their 
corporate offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuting was widely discussed after the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged the 
freeways that an estimated 40,000 Antelope Valley residents use to get to work. 
Civic leaders and some employers said satellite offices could help these 
commuters, who were suddenly forced to drive two hours or more to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But when short-term road repairs were finished, interest in telecommuting 
waned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to keep that interest alive, whether people are starting to fade 
on it or not," said Karen Wilson, project manager for the county's 
telecommuting centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's year-old Antelope Valley Telebusiness Center, equipped with 20 
workstations, quickly filled up after the quake. Others were placed on a 
waiting list. "But in getting back to these people, not everybody was ready or 
able to jump on the telecommuting bandwagon," said Suzette Cecchini,, director 
of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 She found that many companies had no policy allowing employees to work in a 
satellite office. According to Cecchini, some companies said: "It's not my 
problem they're living in the Antelope Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Other employers were reluctant to let employees work away from the corporate 
office, without a supervisor on the premises. In such cases, Cecchini urges an 
employer to supervise by checking the tasks that a long-distance worker 
completes each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "What difference does it make where it gets done?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these hurdles, the county next month will open its second Antelope 
Valley telecommuting center, this one with 40 workstations, plus a conference 
room and shared equipment such as fax and copy machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The $200,000 center was put together with federal disaster relief funds. 
Computers and technical services were donated by IBM and GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on East Avenue K-4, the new center will be filled when it opens, 
mainly with workers from the insurance and health care industries. Some workers 
will come from the older telecommuting center a few blocks away, leaving nine 
workstations at the original center free. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill them, Cecchini plans to continue contacting Los Angeles area 
employers, talking up the merits of telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles north, the operators of the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds are also 
banking on expanded interest in satellite offices. Last week, contractors were 
busy converting the fair's 8,000-square-foot photography exhibit hall into yet 
another telecommuting center. 
</P>
<P>
 To set up and operate the center, the fairgrounds received a $164,000 state 
grant. The Antelope Valley Fair Board, which administers the grounds, 
contributed a similar amount, and the Lancaster Redevelopment Agency provided 
another $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is expected to open with 20 fully equipped cubicles for rent, 
although the building could eventually house 65 or 70 workers. The renovated 
building also will include a kitchenette, a conference room and expanded 
restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials plan to charge $350 a month, or $90 a week, per workstation, 
not including long-distance telephone charges. As an incentive, fair officials 
plan to offer six months free rent to anyone who signs a one-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short term, I don't see it as a source of revenue for the fair board," 
said Charla Abbott, fair board president. "We hope it will break even in the 
first year. But we will offer any incentives we can to attract tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that if we get them in there, the employers will see the benefits 
and keep them there." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the county's telecommuting supervisor, does not believe the opening of 
two new centers will create a conflict. "I think that it's healthy," she said. 
"There are 41,000 commuters who come down the (Antelope Valley) Freeway to work 
in Los Angeles or the Valley, so I think there's a need."

JAMES FLANIGAN: DEFENSE TO BE REGULATED MUCH LIKE A PUBLIC UTILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The defense industry of the future is coming into focus, and the big takeover 
battle of Northrop, Martin Marietta and Grumman is only one step in a much 
larger consolidation. The next few years will see further mergers, acquisitions 
and dropouts to whittle down competitors in every type of weapon system. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll get down to two military aircraft makers, say defense experts: Lockheed 
and McDonnell Douglas, backed by two big subcontractors, Boeing and Northrop, 
which today produces the B-2 Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 In military satellites, there are now eight suppliers, but later in the decade 
there will be only two or three, Keith R. Hall, an assistant secretary of 
defense, told Congress last year. Defense consultants figure Hughes Aircraft 
and Martin Marietta, and possibly TRW, will survive in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 In missiles, analysts name Raytheon and Hughes as survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some weapons are already down to a single supplier: General Dynamics is the 
nation's only producer of tanks and submarines. And GD may sell the tank 
business to the subsidiary of FMC and Harsco Corp. that makes the Bradley 
combat vehicle, says analyst Richard Bitzinger of Washington's Defense Budget 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, GD's Electric Boat yard at Groton, Conn., is working on a contract 
for a Seawolf nuclear sub awarded by the Pentagon expressly to keep submarine 
capability alive in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern is clear: Companies that are No. 1 or No. 2 in their specialty 
will remain in defense. Others will drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense will still be a sizable industry, with companies enjoying more than 
$100 billion in annual revenues, fed by a federal budget for weapons 
procurement and research of close to $80 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the business will be changed. In part, defense will become a public 
utility -- a regulated industry providing military weapons for the national 
defense for an allowable rate of return on investment, as other companies 
provide electricity, gas, water and local telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, when the Pentagon needs simple vehicles or airplanes to 
transport troops, it will buy commercial products -- Jeeps from Chrysler, or 
MD-11s and 767s from McDonnell Douglas and Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the outlook emerging from the first serious examination of an industry 
that was born in haste in the 1940s with the nation at war and in dire need of 
planes, tanks, ships and guns. U.S. industry received an emergency commission. 
"We cut a wide, rakehelly swath through the economy," wrote Donald M. Nelson, 
chief of the War Production Board. 
</P>
<P>
 And it worked. Weapons were produced, technology developed. Then, to prevent a 
repeat of such emergency and to build on the technology developed in World War 
II, Gen. H.H. "Hap" Arnold of the Army Air Force and others created the defense 
industry we have known for the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the Cold War, it was an industry that only rarely had to think of 
cutbacks. There were seven manufacturers of aircraft, for example. "If there 
was a problem, we threw money at it," says one Pentagon consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Cold War ended, it became an industry with grievous overcapacity. 
Rationalizing that overcapacity is what the current shakeout is all about, says 
John Harbison, aerospace consultant with Booz, Allen & Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Some saw it coming. C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of Hughes Aircraft, saw 
that his company -- which is a division of General Motors -- had missile plants 
working at only 35% of capacity. So he bought General Dynamics' missile 
business, consolidated work at fewer plants and now operates missile production 
at 80% of capacity and has cut overall costs by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have done likewise. Lockheed, concentrating on aircraft, bought the 
fighter operations of General Dynamics; Loral Corp. has made numerous 
acquisitions in defense electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Efficiency has brought global competitiveness. Defense exports, running at $30 
billion in each of the past two years, have become big business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, consolidation means shrinkage. When companies combine, they can 
immediately cut overhead by eliminating duplicate accounting departments, 
production facilities and so on. Defense employment has already fallen 30% to 
900,000 and will fall another 20% from here, experts predict. 
</P>
<P>
 And a major change in Pentagon contracting philosophy is coming. With only one 
or two suppliers for individual weapons, there will no longer be effective 
competition. That's why the Defense Department is contemplating a system under 
which the government will guarantee a contractor a certain amount of work, and 
a regulated rate of profit for doing that work. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not be a windfall business. As electric companies do now before public 
utility regulators, "contractors will open their books to the government," says 
Robert Paulson, head of aerospace consulting for McKinsey & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 With that approach Defense Secretary William Perry hopes to improve on the 
present situation in which, by his estimate, 40 cents of every contract dollar 
goes for management and oversight rather than for actual engineering, research 
or production. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how good a business defense will be remains a question. "Yes, 
consolidating two companies can cut overhead, but you still have the problem of 
where new business is coming from," says analyst Wolfgang Demisch of BT 
Securities. Military projects will be few and far between for the next 10 years 
and contractors on current work must fight for annual funding from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the stock market continues to accord premium prices to defense 
companies with a strong presence in commercial markets, such as Hughes, 
Rockwell and TRW. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, $80 billion a year for weapons R&D and production is nothing to sneeze 
at. That's why Northrop and Martin Marietta are fighting for a place in the 
defense industry of the future.

FOR FUND INVESTORS, IT'S NERVOUS TIME; MUTUAL FUNDS: WHIFFS OF SCANDAL RAISE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT A TRUSTED INDUSTRY. THE KEY IS KNOWING WHAT TO WORRY ABOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A star stock mutual fund manager is fired for failing to report personal stock 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the fastest-growing fund companies admits that it is under Securities 
and Exchange Commission investigation for improper in-house trading. 
</P>
<P>
 State securities regulators charge that banks are selling funds without 
adequately explaining the risks to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Could this be the same squeaky-clean mutual fund industry that 38 million 
Americans have come to know so well -- and to entrust with $2 trillion of their 
savings? 
</P>
<P>
 It is, of course. And if the question is whether the average fund shareholder 
needs to worry about recent headlines that suggest fraud and abuse, the answer 
is yes. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors' concerns should be focused in the right place, fund industry 
critics say. Thanks to the complex legal structure of funds, the risk of 
outright theft or willful abuse of your money at the hands of faraway portfolio 
managers remains extraordinarily low. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue is whether, after three years of unprecedented growth in fund 
assets, the improprieties now surfacing suggest a breakdown in the industry- 
and government-sponsored policing efforts that have kept mutual funds 
remarkably scandal-free for more than a half century. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if that policing indeed has grown lax, the potential cost to your fund is 
likely to be measured in nickels and dimes, experts say -- higher portfolio 
costs from botched trades, for example, or losses on mispriced securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But nickels and dimes add up over time; it's like someone's stealing from you 
on an installment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-four years ago, the federal government put the mutual fund business on a 
leash so tight that it might have strangled the funds. Instead, federal 
oversight for decades has protected the industry from the wrongdoing that's 
occasionally wreaked havoc on other financial service industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds aren't covered by any form of government insurance -- unlike the 
deposits, say, of the savings and loan industry, which Uncle Sam guaranteed 
even as white-collar bandits openly looted scores of S&Ls nationwide in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But precisely to shelter the funds from that kind of brazen fraud, 
unparalleled structural safeguards have been built into the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important is a series of federally mandated checks and balances that 
govern how fund shareholders' money is received, invested and held -- and the 
requirement that every fund make extensive, regular reports to its 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other financial industry requires so much disclosure to shareholders of 
what's going on with their money," says Joel M. Dickson, a Stanford University 
economist and fund expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these safeguards were hammered out in 1940, in a landmark piece of 
legislation called the Investment Company Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the federal government had left the details of regulating business 
mostly to the states, notes Harvey Pitt, an attorney at Fried, Frank, Harris 
Shriver & Jacobson in New York and a former SEC official. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1940," he says, "Congress said the one exception would be mutual funds." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the funds were a $1-billion business. And to the surprise of 
many observers of that day, rather than fight federal oversight, the fund 
industry endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's acquiescence had a lot to do with its roots. The mutual fund 
was born in 1924 with the creation of Massachusetts Investors Trust -- the 
product, like many of the funds that followed it, of Boston Brahmin money men 
whose upbringing and conduct defined the terms proper and prudent.  
</P>
<P>
 The big idea behind mutual funds was that investors could pool their money and 
name trustees to manage it. It was a populist expansion of the original trustee 
concept that had solved the problem of 19th Century Boston ship captains, who 
needed someone to look after their assets while they were away for months at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Depression-weary Congress decided that fund investors needed better 
protection against potentially unscrupulous operators, the Brahmins had no 
reason to disagree. Keeping the industry clean, after all, was the best way to 
keep money flowing in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the typical fund transaction today: Mrs. Garcia in Los Angeles writes 
a check for $1,000 to Stock Fund X, based 3,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia has never met with anyone from Fund X. She learned about the fund from 
a friend or an ad. Her dealings with the company have been exclusively by phone 
or mail. She received a document, the fund prospectus, before she invested. But 
like most fund shareholders, she didn't read it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Garcia accepts on faith that the fund is a legitimate investment and 
that she'll be treated fairly -- whatever that might mean. 
</P>
<P>
 What she probably doesn't realize is that her fund, by itself, is nothing but 
a shell. It has no employees of its own. It exists only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 How could this be? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Investment Company Act, a fund is required to contract with others, 
at negotiated fees, for the various services it needs performed. Some of the 
providers may be part of the same umbrella company (like, say, giant Fidelity 
Investments), but others are almost always outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, what Garcia has purchased with her investment is a stake in an 
asset pool serviced by a series of contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund X's "transfer agent," for example, is the first stop for Garcia's 
investment. The transfer agent records and processes shareholder accounts and 
handles other aspects of shareholder communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent transfers the money not to the fund's portfolio manager (the 
individual or firm that makes the investment decisions, technically known as 
the "investment adviser"), but to the "custodian," usually an independent bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the act's requirement of independent custody for each fund's assets is 
the key provision that has sheltered the industry from potential trouble for 
half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, separate custody means a fund's parent company can go belly-up 
without any loss to the fund's shareholders, because their assets are held 
apart from other funds' and from the parent's. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, although the fund manager decides how to invest shareholders' money, 
it's the custodian who controls the underlying securities, allowing them to be 
traded or exchanged with other institutional investors only after getting 
proper documentation from the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot of independent custody is that "it's very hard for a fund manager 
to take the money and leave," says Stanford's Dickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrast that with the far less restrictive set-up between individual 
investors and their bankers or stockbrokers, who have direct access to clients' 
accounts -- and who, in any number of notorious incidents, have taken the money 
and run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Investment Company Act adds other layers of investor protection as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent accountants must regularly audit every fund; a fund's board of 
directors, the modern-day trustees, are supposed to negotiate prudent contract 
terms with the fund's service providers and generally oversee the operation; 
and the SEC has the power to inspect funds and bring enforcement action against 
those that break the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But if these many safeguards are working, why the recent headlines suggesting 
that all is not well? 
</P>
<P>
 The devil, as usual, is in the details. The funds' extensive disclosure of 
what they do is one thing; compliance with the rules is another. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the industry may have become a victim of its own success. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 4,600 funds today, nearly 2,000 of which have been created since 
1990. Never have the funds hired so many new people in so short a time. Never 
have so many young, untested, portfolio managers been entrusted with so many 
hundreds of billions of dollars from mom-and-pop investors. 
</P>
<P>
 And, by many accounts, never has the SEC been so woefully understaffed to 
perform its all-important watchdog function. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Barbash, the current chief of the SEC's investment management division, 
concedes that with just 150 examiners nationwide to watch $2 trillion in assets 
-- up from $1 trillion just three years ago -- the SEC's oversight is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be relied upon for compliance," he says flatly. "The funds have to 
be interested in it." 
</P>
<P>
 No one, including Barbash, questions that the majority of fund companies are 
interested in compliance. At giant firms like Fidelity, legions of compliance 
lawyers -- essentially, in-house cops -- are paid to make sure that portfolio 
managers, traders and others follow the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, two of the most disturbing controversies to rock the industry this 
year suggest major gaps in in-house policing. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Jan. 4, Denver-based Invesco Funds fired star manager John Kaweske after 
he admitted making a string of personal trades last year without properly 
notifying the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Under SEC rules, funds are required to have codes of conduct for managers. The 
codes require advance reporting of personal securities transactions so that 
there can be no conflict of interest between a manager's personal trades and 
what he does with his fund's securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious worry: A manager could "front-run" his own fund, personally buying 
or selling securities before the fund trades in them -- to his gain and, 
possibly, the fund's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Invesco says it has no evidence that Kaweske engaged in front-running, and he 
denies any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 But another Kaweske surprise was perhaps more startling, other fund-company 
executives concede: Invesco says it did not know that Kaweske had signed on as 
a director of ID Biomedical Corp., a small company in which one of his Invesco 
funds had invested. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earlier this month, Strong Funds, a fast-growing Milwaukee-based 
organization, revealed that the SEC is probing in-house trades between 
individual Strong funds from 1987 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid the potential for self-dealing -- that is, favoring one fund at the 
expense of another -- the SEC sets down strict guidelines when funds in the 
same company trade a security between one another rather than on the open 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Strong, the firm's founder, insisted in a March 11 memo to employees 
that the SEC hasn't alleged a self-dealing problem. Instead, he said, the probe 
focuses on whether in-houses trades were conducted according to SEC rules "and 
whether the firm's disclosures accurately describe its trading policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to explain how the firm might have slipped in the late 1980s, Strong 
reminds employees in the memo that "we didn't have even one lawyer on staff in 
1990" -- though the company's fund assets were already $1.4 billion by that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the great fear of the SEC's Barbash, other regulators and most of 
the major fund companies: 
</P>

 How many of the scores of fund organizations born in recent years, they worry, 
are growing faster than the house cops can handle? How many nickels and dimes 
might that ultimately cost shareholders in front-running, questionable trades 
or even more serious offenses? 
</P>
<P>
 Says Barbash: "What concerns me is the number of new entrants into the 
business . . . who don't come in with that culture of the (Investment Company) 
Act built in" -- that Brahmin culture of prudence and conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some fund industry critics say the problems go much deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Phillips, publisher of independent fund-tracker Morningstar Inc. in 
Chicago, believes there has been a gradual erosion of fund directors' 
oversight, minimizing their ability to act as proper trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Investment Company Act went out of its way to emphasize that shareholders 
were the owners of a fund and that the directors worked for the shareholders," 
Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he and other critics argue, many directors' loyalties are skewed more 
toward the funds' investment advisers, who generally pick the directors in the 
first place, than toward shareholders' best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 If the directors really were watching the funds, critics ask, would they be 
standing idly by as state securities regulators charge that banks are selling 
fund shares to people who have no clue about the market risk involved? Is that 
the kind of customer a director really wants? 
</P>
<P>
 Where directors' biases are most obvious, critics say, is in the issue of 
management and marketing fees charged by fund investment advisers -- the 
typical 1% to 3% of fund assets taken from shareholders each year as the major 
cost of running and promoting the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Bogle, head of the Vanguard Group of funds and an outspoken critic of 
fund fee levels, contends that "directors are a big part of the problem . . . 
They don't seem to realize that they have to stand up and take a more active 
role" in negotiating lower fees so that shareholders keep more of their own 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Why more fund shareholders don't vote with their feet also mystifies the 
experts. Say two bond funds earn the same annual return of 7% -- an optimistic 
expectation this year. One racks up expenses of 0.5% of assets; the other's 
expenses total 1.8% of assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the math: The owner of the low-cost fund takes home 6.5%; the high-fee fund 
shareholder earns just 5.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate, of course, isn't one-sided. Many shareholders whose fund managers 
deliver excellent performance year after year may feel that they're getting a 
bargain no matter what the management fee. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, directors aren't charged with getting the lowest possible fee, 
but rather a fair fee, legal experts note. And what is "fair" can be 
subjective. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips says his point in questioning the directors' role isn't to suggest 
that shareholders would be better off in some other investment vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 But as with many of the questions being raised about the funds' self-policing 
abilities today, he says the best advice for investors is to know all you can 
about your fund -- how it operates, what it owns, what it costs and what its 
performance is relative to other funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Investment Company Act still makes it extremely difficult for a fund's 
assets to be filched. But in the end, having your investment slowly chiseled 
away by incompetence, arrogance or borderline fraud may be only slightly less 
painful.

HAPPY IN THE TRENCHES; RECOGNIZING THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO BE BOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bob Liebeck would rather make airplanes than assignments. Joyce Koch would 
rather spend her day writing radio spots than performance reviews. Randy Papke 
would rather hold a drawing board than a board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in upper management would take me away from the hands-on work," said 
Papke, an art director at Bozell/Salvati Montgomery Sakoda, a Costa Mesa 
advertising firm where Koch writes ad copy. 
</P>
<P>
 From software manufacturers to aerospace firms, many companies run on the 
creative juices of people who are either unsuited for or uninterested in 
management positions -- employees who thrive in the trenches and have no desire 
to command the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebeck, who designs futuristic passenger jets for McDonnell Douglas Aerospace 
in Huntington Beach, says he has never felt the urge to become a boss, even 
though the opportunity periodically presents itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the technical work," he said. "Sometimes I have to do paperwork -- 
program budgets and that sort of thing. I find that if I've spent the day on 
administrative stuff, I feel I haven't done anything worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it's done by mutual agreement, however, keeping a proven quantity in 
the same spot presents challenges for both the employee and the employer. How 
does an employee stay motivated when there's no fast track to travel? And how 
does a company reward its most valuable players without bouncing them up to 
management and away from what they do best? 
</P>
<P>
 "Society, particularly in the United States, tells people that if they are not 
moving ahead, they are somehow failures," said Jone Pearce, a UC Irvine 
professor of management who studies organizational behavior. But in an era of 
corporate downsizing, there are fewer opportunities to move up. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebeck, 56, has witnessed the pressures during his 33 years with McDonnell 
Douglas: "I see young engineers in our business going for an MBA in lieu of a 
Ph.D. in engineering because of their desire to be a manager." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas came up with its own way to reward Liebeck and others like 
him. Twelve years ago, the company initiated what it calls a "dual ladder" to 
acknowledge high achievers not necessarily treading a management path. 
</P>
<P>
 At an annual awards ceremony, McDonnell graduates a handful of distinguished 
scientists into its brain pool of "fellows." The position gives the company's 
best and brightest a consulting role at the corporate level. And it's the only 
promotion that many of the fellows, including Liebeck, would ever want. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have scientists working in labs who never find their way to management," 
said Roger Roberts, chief technology officer for McDonnell Douglas. "Our dual 
ladder gives us the opportunity to foster creativity and innovation through 
promotions based on skills other than just managerial." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's Pearce said that when an employee considers his or her job fun and 
challenging, that in itself offers immeasurable satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people would be very content in their work if they could just get 
rid of this negative idea Americans have that they've 'plateaued' if they are 
not on the management track," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent nationwide survey of 1,000 large companies by OfficeTeam, a 
temporary staffing service, half the top managers interviewed rated "praise and 
recognition" as the most effective method of motivating employees. Only a 
fourth put promotion first. 
</P>
<P>
 "All other things being equal -- that is, if the company is decent to its 
employees and doesn't underpay them -- people most want positive feedback," 
said Steve Pehanich, spokesman for the Menlo Park-based firm. "A simple, 'Hey, 
thanks for the good job,' goes a long way with employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Keller, a computer and video game designer for Electronic Arts in San 
Mateo, can attest to that. A year ago, after seven years of reliable service 
without any recognition, he changed departments -- and quickly learned the 
advantages of having a pro-active supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I received two in-house awards in a six-month period," said Keller, 32. "It's 
not out of malice that supervisors forget to remind people at the top about 
non-management employees. But it certainly gave me a lift when someone took an 
interest in my emotional well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also recently endowed Keller with the title "game director," which 
holds greater prestige without -- in his view -- the headaches of management. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real reward for his work, he said, is knowing that people enjoy the 
fruits of his efforts. "I get a kick out of going to the mall and seeing kids 
(in a video game arcade) playing with one of my products. There's no greater 
compliment than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Guiney, director of human resources for Electronic Arts, said the company 
continually seeks ways to applaud employees like Keller. "There is a lot of 
concern here that when you promote creative people into management, you lose 
their most valuable contribution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gestures that can mean the most to an employee cost Electronic Arts little or 
nothing: crediting a game's creators on the box, encouraging a casual work 
environment, handing out monthly awards. "These things are very significant to 
employees, even though there's no money attached," Guiney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But companies should not just presume that a person is not interested in 
management because he or she has never asked about it, said Bryce Nelson, a 
former Los Angeles Times and New York Times correspondent who now teaches 
journalism at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, Nelson said, a newspaper should not presume that a good 
reporter will make a good editor. "Being a manager and being a reporter require 
quite different skills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman agreed. "If a reporter who becomes an 
editor has decent management skills, it's purely by accident," she said. 
"Newspapers need to do a better job of training people as they move from one 
world to the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson recommends heaps of praise, time off for good behavior and awards to 
boost the morale of non-management employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In-house awards can backfire, however, by alienating those passed over, said 
Scott Montgomery, a partner at Bozell/Salvati. "Creative people have huge egos 
coupled with thin skin," he said. "Everybody here does incredible work, and 
everybody here comes up with ideas that are stinkers. It would be 
counterproductive for us to single people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the company aggressively enters its ad campaigns in outside contests. 
"That way, we eliminate politics as much as possible," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time, the firm quietly grants monetary bonuses for exceptional 
work. "But the best thing we can do for these folks is provide a good working 
environment -- no set hours, no dress code," Montgomery said. "We gave everyone 
$200 to decorate their offices however they wanted to, and we got some pretty 
interesting stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Papke, the art director, spent part of his $200 on a stockpile of colorful 
spray paint, then coated his walls with pseudo graffiti. One employee turned 
her cubicle into a tropical paradise, while another painted a shark on his 
wall. The result is an eclectic, eccentric, informal setting where jazz or rock 
music wafts from office doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have incredible freedom and latitude here," said copywriter Koch, 37. "I 
can wear jeans and tennis shoes every day and no one raises an eyebrow. I can 
come in whenever I want. They're not strict about quantifiable things like 
hours, so long as you deliver. They treat us like professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means more to me than a management title ever could."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: DON'T GET BURNED BY 'FIRE SALE' TERM 
INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buyers of term life insurance have had one common complaint: Their premiums 
rise each year. One of the newest innovations in life insurance solves the 
problem by allowing term life policyholders to pay a fixed premium for their 
policies for as long as 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the availability of these "guaranteed premium" term life policies may 
evaporate -- or at least their premiums may rise -- if a complicated proposed 
regulation goes into effect later this year, as expected. The threat of the new 
rule has some agents pushing these policies with a vengeance, claiming that 
1994 is a "fire sale" year for this type of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, industry experts say you should be wary of the sale. Some of the 
companies that are offering the lowest prices and longest guarantees may be 
flirting with financial disaster -- and could take your money with them. 
Moreover, while guaranteed premium policies may prove attractive if you need a 
lot of life insurance for a sustained period, they're a waste of money if you 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the debate, you need to know a bit about term and whole life 
policies, because guaranteed premium term policies are a hybrid of both. 
</P>
<P>
 Term life insurance covers you for a set period, usually a year. If you die 
within that year, the policy pays off. If you don't, the policy expires. This 
type of policy does not build up any cash value. But most insurers allow term 
policyholders to renew at the end of the term -- without regard to the insured 
person's health -- by simply paying another premium. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, premiums for term insurance start out small and rise as 
you grow older. But if you stay healthy, you can reduce the premiums in later 
years by taking another physical examination. If the exam shows you're in good 
health, the premiums will drop substantially in the year following the 
physical, says Kenneth L. Ingram, president and chief executive of TermQuote, a 
Dayton, Ohio, insurance service. 
</P>
<P>
 Whole life policies usually offer level premiums over the life of the policy 
and build up cash value over time. If you die while the policy is in force, the 
policy pays a death benefit. If you live and continue paying premiums, you can 
eventually withdraw or borrow against the policy's cash buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with whole life policies is that they are comparatively expensive 
and their cash value builds slowly. Where a 45-year-old male non-smoker would 
pay a $418 annual premium for a $250,000 term life policy with Transamerica 
Occidental Life, he'd pay $2,100 for a similar whole life policy from that 
company, says Bernie Weinberg, an insurance agent with Shadur, Weinberg & 
Associates in Encino. After four years and $8,400 in premiums, this whole life 
policy would have a cash value between $1,570 and $2,045, depending on what 
happens with interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most consumer advocates maintain that term insurance is a better buy. But some 
consumers are wary of it because of the steadily rising premiums. A policy that 
costs $300 when you are 45, for example, may cost more than $1,000 when you're 
55. As a result, some fear that the premiums will prove too costly to handle 
down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter guaranteed premium term life, a hybrid policy that emerged in the past 
few years to combine the low premiums of term life policies with the 
fixed-price elements of whole life. 
</P>
<P>
 These policies work just like other term policies, but their rates are 
guaranteed to stay the same for up to 15 to 20 years. How they do that is 
simple: The insurer averages out the premiums. You pay more in the early years 
and less later. 
</P>
<P>
 And, just like the fixed-versus-adjustable mortgage question, consumers need 
to consider how long they'll need the insurance before buying a guaranteed 
premium policy. If you buy such a policy and find you don't need the insurance 
for the entire term, you'll have wasted a significant amount of money, says 
Ingram. Indeed, according to rate quotes provided by several insurance 
quotation services, guaranteed premium policies pay off only if you keep them 
until the very end of the so-called guarantee period. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to note that most insurance experts maintain that your need for 
insurance actually diminishes over time. Usually you need more insurance when 
you're starting out and have young children and few assets. That's to sustain 
your family over a long period should you die. But as you accumulate other 
assets and your children become financially independent, your insurance needs 
fall. At some point, the insurance proceeds become a windfall for your spouse, 
rather than a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 When you buy guaranteed premium policies, you must also be concerned with the 
insurer's long-term financial health. You are paying extra money up-front for a 
long-term commitment from the insurer. If the company isn't around to follow 
through, you've wasted your money. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed insurance rule that's causing the fire-sale fuss is designed to 
keep insurers healthy. Some of these companies are playing financial roulette, 
says Joseph Belth, an Indiana-based insurance analyst and editor of Insurance 
Forum. The new rule, proposed by the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners, 
would force these companies to put more money aside for possible losses on 
guaranteed premium policies. 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping reserves artificially low, companies can offer low-premium 
policies. (Reserves are a fixed cost of offering insurance.) That generates 
business for the insurer but presents serious risks for consumers, says Belth. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because policyholders suffer when insurance companies topple. Consider 
what happened to policyholders of Executive Life Insurance Co., which failed in 
1991. Policyholders who had been promised double-digit returns had their 
policies frozen for three years while insurance regulators worked out a sale. 
Then they were given the choice of staying with Executive Life's successor 
company or opting out. If they opted out, they would face a serious loss on the 
policy. If they stuck with the successor company, they had to accept radical 
changes in the terms of the deal, including lower rates of return and higher 
fees. Comparing Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a comparison of what a 35-year-old male non-smoker would pay for a 
$250,000 traditional term policy versus a guaranteed premium term policy for 
the same policy value. The cost of the policy is shown in five-year increments. 
In this instance, the annually renewable policy is less expensive for the first 
15 years but more costly in the final few. 05,07,08,13,09,13 *2*Annual 
renewable *2*Guaranteed premium 5-year Accumulated 5-year Accumulated Years

</P>
<P>
 Where can you check life insurance prices to see if you're getting a good 
deal? 
</P>
<P>
 Several firms research the rates of many term insurers to find the lowest 
prices. Two firms that offer particularly thorough searches are Quotesmith at 
(800) 556-9393 and TermQuote at (800) 444-8376. Quotesmith charges $15 for the 
service; TermQuote doesn't charge consumers. They get paid by the insurance 
companies they recommend.

IBM'S CORPORATE DIET INCLUDES REDUCING ITS EXCESS REAL ESTATE; DOWNSIZING: IN 
THE PAST THREE YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS VACATED NEARLY HALF ITS U.S. OFFICE SPACE 
TO HELP STANCH THE FLOW OF RED INK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BETH SHERIDAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lee Dayton was anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 It was early 1993, and IBM was bleeding red ink. Dayton, IBM's manager of real 
estate, ordered his staff to slash expenses for office space. They quickly 
responded, moving four employees into one wastefully big office. 
</P>
<P>
 His. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my team that we'd better make an example of ourselves," the manager 
recalled, grinning. "They came up with a plan which required me to evict 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton's transfer to a smaller office in Stamford, Conn., was symptomatic of a 
change that is reshaping IBM and parts of corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, International Business Machines Corp. has vacated 
nearly half its U.S. office space -- 21 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 How much is that? Picture all the office space in downtown Pittsburgh, Seattle 
or Phoenix -- empty. It's like casting off nine Empire State Buildings, or 
three Pentagons. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrinkage, of course, reflects IBM's particularly sharp decline in the 
highly competitive, DOS-eat-DOS era of personal computers. IBM has shed 
one-third of its U.S. employees in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But IBM is not alone. Now that companies have "downsized" their staffs, many 
are looking to do the same to their office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Dayton's group, in addition to pruning IBM's space, has done 
consulting work for American Express Co. and KPMG Peat Marwick on cutting their 
office space. Corporate giants from AT&T to Aetna have embarked on 
space-reduction programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent Arthur Andersen & Co. survey, nearly two-thirds of 700 corporate 
executives said they had recently shrunk their office space, or planned to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last three years, they (companies) have been shedding workers like 
crazy. That has caused them to reassess how much space they need," said William 
Wheaton, director of the center for real estate studies at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Some firms, he noted, have gone so far as to "re-engineer the work space -- so 
they need less space per worker." 
</P>
<P>
 With corporate behemoths shedding offices like old skins, you might expect a 
further decline for the depressed U.S. commercial real estate industry. 
Analysts say that's unlikely, since smaller, growing businesses are moving into 
the empty space. 
</P>
<P>
 But some cities have been hit badly. Take White Plains, 25 miles north of New 
York City, where IBM has vacated five buildings. A thriving corporate center in 
the mid-'80s, it's now dotted with silent glass-and-concrete shells. More than 
one-fourth of its office space is empty, one of the highest rates in the 
nation, says ONCOR International, a real-estate services firm. 
</P>
<P>
 That has hurt both the city's tax base and the electricians, plumbers and 
other workers who catered to the gleaming office complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't even give away space," lamented Mayor Sy Schulman. "They don't need 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's case is striking because of the amount of space it's shedding and its 
attempt to go beyond merely disposing of offices occupied by departing workers. 
It's trying to squeeze every penny out of its real estate, in what Dayton calls 
"a fundamental change in thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to very matter-of-factly explain that having a private office or a 
given office size is not an entitlement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At IBM, rank used to have its privileges. Ask Linda Bodden. In the old days, 
the 34-year-old branch manager would have had a personal "branch manager's 
secretary." There was a "branch manager's desk" -- "bigger than a marketing 
manager's desk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a branch manager in the old days was to get the big corner office," she 
said. "That was a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Bodden works out of clients' offices, assisted by a car phone, 
beeper and a laptop computer. When she checks into the Cranford, N.J., IBM 
office every two weeks, she shares a small cubicle in an open space. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, she said, a "cultural change." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a more important change affected desk-bound employees. These days, 
many IBM workers are doubling up in offices. They're sacrificing classrooms and 
meeting rooms. Some conference rooms, once idle, now see more traffic than a 
New York tanning salon in January. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM motivated managers to give up space by allowing them to "transfer" it -- 
on paper -- to IBM's real-estate department. The managers could then subtract 
the rental cost from their tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a giant jigsaw puzzle, the vacated offices were put together in some 
buildings. Employees were consolidated in others. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Bause, a 42-year-old public relations executive, was one of 400 employees 
moved from four locations into IBM's sprawling gray-and-blue building in White 
Plains. He went from a private office to sharing a slightly bigger one. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's not a big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees. But one IBMer, speaking privately, said there were few 
complaints from employees: "They're happy to have jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem now is disposing of the emptied office space, most of which is 
leased. IBM has gotten rid of about 5 million of the 21 million emptied square 
feet, and subleased another 3 million, Dayton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local real-estate professionals believe IBM may eventually go so far as 
to sell its hilltop headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. For now, though, the company 
says it has no plans to do so. In fact, it's moving more employees into the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Some real estate analysts note that companies typically cut office space 
during a recession, and expand when the economy grows. What is new, Dayton 
said, is the intense global competition that has forced companies to scrutinize 
every expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago I would have been somewhat skeptical whether this would 
last," Dayton said. Now, he said, "In IBM and other companies I talk to, it's 
permanent."

ALLIANCE IMAGING OF ORANGE REPORTS $14.7-MILLION '93 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alliance Imaging Inc., hurt by industrywide problems of slack demand and too 
many imaging machines, said Thursday that it lost $14.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, equal to $2.07 a share, was caused mostly by write-downs it took in 
the third quarter on its older magnetic resonance imaging machines.The loss was 
a substantial drop from 1992 earnings of $1.1 million, or 15 cents a share. 
Alliance's revenue fell 5% to $60.7 million last year from $63.7 million the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrence White, the company's chief financial officer, said the prospect of 
health care reform has caused doctors to rely less on MRI machines. In 
addition, an oversupply of machines has lowered the cost of the equipment and 
the pictures they produce. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the company remains strong enough to weather the industry slump, 
though he wouldn't rule out further losses. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, Alliance lost $1.2 million, or 18 cents a share, 
nearly double its $661,000 loss, or 9 cents a share, in the previous year's 
final quarter. Alliance Imaging Reports Year-End Loss 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 1993, Alliance Imaging reported a net loss 
of $14.7 million, or $2.07 per share, contrasted with net income of $1.2 
million, or 15 cents per share, in 1992. The company attributed the loss to a 
third-quarter pretax restructuring charge of $17.5 million ($12.9 million after 
related tax credits). Figures in thousands of dollars, except per-share data:

AND THE OSCARS COME TO -- FASHION ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Party guests were given the star treatment on Monday when the Assistance 
League of Newport-Mesa staged its own Oscar night bash. 
</P>
<P>
 Atrium Court in Fashion Island Newport Beach was transformed into a 
small-scale Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, complete with larger-than-life Oscar 
statues and a red carpet for receiving more than 450 party-goers for the 
league's first-ever "Night of the Stars" Academy Awards celebration. The 
$100-per-person gala was expected to raise about $75,000 for the league. 
Everybody's a Star 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved the Academy Awards. I knew about the party they had at 
Wolfgang Puck's, and I thought it would be fun to do that in Orange County," 
said Charlene Wardrup, chairwoman of the league's Virginia Castle Auxiliary, 
which helped stage the event. 
</P>
<P>
 In true Oscar tradition, guests were greeted by a bleacher filled with "fans" 
who screamed, applauded and snapped pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 As they made their way up the red carpet, party-goers were interviewed on 
camera. Those already inside watched the interviews on two wide-screen 
televisions. While most were a little tongue-tied before the camera, guest 
Eileen Passo had the right idea. Not missing a beat, she told interviewer 
William Yingling: "I'm just ecstatic about my nomination, and even if I don't 
get (an Oscar), I'm ecstatic to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many dressed like Hollywood stars, the men in tuxedos and the women in flowing 
chiffon gowns, little black dresses and beaded sheaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lynn Bergman-Rallis was covered head to toe in gold and black stars that 
matched the decor. Her blazer, strapless top, skirt and even shoes were all 
covered with stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to make this a star-studded evening," she joked. "It's all Escada. 
I actually had this in my closet, and it matches the decor perfectly." Special 
Effects 
</P>
<P>
 Atrium Court was filled to capacity with tables draped in black cloth and 
sprinkled with gold confetti. Huge gold stars hung on the walls, and tall gold 
vases filled with white flowers adorned each table. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do something new and different," said Mary Jean Simpkins, event 
chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were served smoked salmon with pecans and a honey mustard sauce, mixed 
greens with a roasted beet and shallot vinaigrette, grilled chicken with 
sun-dried tomato butter sauce, pureed garlic potatoes, Tuscan beans with 
prosciutto, and a fresh fruit tart for dessert, all the work of Specialty 
Catering. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meal, they watched the awards ceremony on the wide-screen TVs, 
applauding when their favorite actors and actresses picked up a gold statue. 
During commercials and after the broadcast, Barry Cole and his Sounds of Music 
Orchestra played the best songs from movies dating back to 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner the league saluted two "philanthropic stars," Virginia Knott 
Bender and Byron Allumbaugh, for their community service on behalf of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event will go to assistance league programs, including the 
Children's Dental Health Center, Grace Hoag Child Day Care Center and Operation 
School Bell, which provides clothes to needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending were Patti Rose, league president, and her husband, 
Chris; Jim Roberts, auctioneer; Ronnie Allumbaugh, Ted Simpkins, Mary 
Roosevelt, George and Judie Argyros, Jim and Patty Edwards, Gerald and Marge 
Elmer, Robert and Elaine Bassmajian, Roger and Jocelyn Gilbert, Dale and Joann 
Johnston, Jerry and Janie Kingsley, Sam and Linda Mayeda, Mary Dell Barkouras, 
Rich and Lissa Callaghan, Chan and Marie-France Lefebvre, Jim and Sue Mears, 
Dennis and Marion Pickens and Chris and Lorie Veitch. KATHRYN BOLD
