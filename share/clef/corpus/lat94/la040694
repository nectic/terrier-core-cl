ROBIN ABCARIAN: FOCUSING ONLY ON RACISM BLINDS AUTHOR TO SEXISM

 She looked so sad that I started to feel sorry for her. Something in me wanted 
to reach out and do what I knew was right -- and do what we all knew 
instinctively was right: Lean down, grab Vanessa's hand and lead her from that 
room and out of that house. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But I couldn't do that. It was too late. This was our first train together as 
a group. . . . If I jumped on Vanessa's behalf, they would accuse me of falling 
in love. They would send word out on the block that when it came to girls, I 
was a wimp. . . . There was no way I was gonna put that pressure on myself. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 After that first train, we perfected the art of luring babes into those kinds 
of traps.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's unfair to judge a book by a single chapter, but after reading "Trains" in 
Nathan McCall's "Makes Me Wanna Holler," I felt too sick and disgusted to read 
the rest of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall, the 40-year-old Washington Post reporter whose memoir has been called 
his generation's "Manchild in the Promised Land," has plunked a chord that 
reverberates as deep as the racism he sees or imagines in every facet of his 
life. Incarcerated for three years for armed robbery and seemingly headed for 
an early grave, McCall reclaimed himself in prison, went to college, and has 
created a career he remains deeply ambivalent about -- working in the 
"Establishment" he so despises. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, had he been caught and convicted for even a fraction of the crimes he 
admits, he'd be writing from behind bars to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the book has made McCall into a lightning rod for discussions about the 
roles of racism in personal responsibility in crime. People respond to his name 
as if they are gazing at a particularly disturbing inkblot. Everyone has a 
strong opinion, whether or not they have read the book. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't think I could stomach spending 404 pages with a man who recounts his 
participation in the gang rapes of neighborhood girls as if merely an 
unfortunate part of a sacred male-bonding ritual. But last weekend, I changed 
my mind and read the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I can say with certainty whenever his name comes up that McCall deserves 
plenty of the praise -- and the scorn -- that come his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that he too often confuses human nature with racism, McCall 
is worth the time. He is complicated, challenging, annoying, hypocritical, 
inspiring and compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 And -- unfortunately -- he constantly undercuts his complaints about racism 
with a blind acceptance of that other, pervasive evil: sexism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCall is a puzzle, even to himself, and for that, there are no truly 
satisfying answers in this book. He grew up in a pleasant, working-class suburb 
of Portsmouth, Va. He describes his early childhood years as a Southern idyll, 
lazy days filled with "innocent mischief." (Not to burst his Huck Finn bubble, 
but I see an innate -- and prophetic -- streak of cruelty in a child who puts a 
frog in a jar, "poured in gasoline and torched it.") 
</P>
<P>
 McCall's stepfather worked hard and tried to instill a work ethic in his 
stepson, but seeing the older man toiling in the gardens of affluent white 
families was humiliating to McCall. Beating up white people would prove far 
more rewarding than working for them. 
</P>
<P>
 With his homeboys -- because it was easy, because they were there -- he 
slipped into the life of a petty hood and street hustler. The why of it is 
never fully answered, because McCall himself doesn't seem to know. Racism is 
his catch-all explanation, and there is disturbingly little analysis or 
appreciation of the part his family life played in his bad choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Belonging to the streets eventually required the ritual degradation of women. 
And even though he knew instinctively that what he did was wrong, doing it 
doesn't make him a bad person, you see, because racism makes good people do bad 
things: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until I became an adult that I figured out . . . that we thought we 
loved sisters but that we actually hated them. We hated them because they were 
black and we were black and, on some level much deeper than we realized, we 
hated the hell out of ourselves.  
</P>
<P>
 You can almost see the light bulb appear belatedly over his head, then, when 
McCall beholds his own newborn daughter years later and thinks: 
</P>
<P>
 A girl? . . . The fellas and I ran trains on girls! How will I help get her 
through that?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly surprising that none of McCall's relationships with women work. 
His outrage when his wife, Debbie, becomes pregnant with their second child is 
almost comical. He sees his life going down the drain. The reader sees a man 
who has impregnated at least four women and still doesn't get the concept of 
bearing responsibility for birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 When that marriage hits the skids, the disingenuousness of a man who viciously 
beat people for fun and gang-raped who-knows-how-many young women is truly 
shocking: One day we were arguing in the bedroom and (Debbie) pushed a stereo 
speaker on me and hurt my hand. Another time, she got mad and hit me -- hard -- 
with a lamp. I learned through those and other experiences with Debbie that 
some women are as abusive in relationships as some men.  
</P>
<P>
 Who's zoomin' who? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it important to call someone like Nathan McCall on sexism? 
</P>
<P>
 As a black American who finds racism at the root of all personal and 
professional grief -- his descent from working-class kid into hardened 
criminal, his problems maintaining relationship with his children, conflicts 
with in-laws, divorce, difficulties in the workplace, discomfort in social 
settings -- he should know better. He should own up to the damage he has 
inflicted on women instead of rationalizing it away. 
</P>
<P>
 He owes it to Vanessa, at the very least.

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: A HEALTHY MIX OF BARKING, BURGERS AND 
BIRKENSTOCKS; THE SCREENING OF 'THREESOME' BROUGHT TOGETHER A CROWD OF YOUNG 
AND, UM, OLDER FOR A COLLEGE FILM TERMED 'AN EROTIC BUDDY MOVIE.'

 The Scene: Monday's premiere of TriStar's "Threesome" at the Motion Picture 
Academy's theater. A reception was held afterward in the lobby. The story of a 
romantically involved, college-student trio of mixed sexual orientation was 
described by guests as "an erotic buddy movie," " 'Reality Bites' mixed with 
'Jules and Jim,' " and "provocative, erotic, neurotic and sensual." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars -- Lara Flynn Boyle, Josh Charles and Stephen 
Baldwin -- writer-director Andrew Fleming, and producers Brad Krevoy and Steve 
Stabler. Among the 1,000 guests were Luke Perry, Jennifer and Meg Tilly, Blair 
Underwood, Lauren Holly, Chynna Phillips, Quentin Tarantino, and studio execs 
Stacey Lassally, Marc Platt and Buffy Shutt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most Truly Weird Trend: The fan who greets arriving stars with a piercing, 
dead-on imitation of a German shepherd barking to the tune of "Jingle Bells." 
Even the Beverly Hills cops came over to investigate. Said one observer: "I 
think he's trying to break into show business." On this night, the barker 
couldn't even get arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Audience Review: Much impressed. Like this was a reason to go to film school. 
"It was intelligent ," James Johnston said. "It was amazing they'd give us 
anything like that. They didn't talk down to the audience. You were so along 
for the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: Extreme demographic mix. Half the crowd was over 40, the other 
half under 25. The older went for suits, the younger a mix of Generation X 
casual and slacker after-work -- plaid shirts, nose rings, Birkenstocks, 
goatees and faux grunge. Looking at the crowd, one casting director said: 
"Hollywood's always getting younger. I used to be one of the young ones, but 
now. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: In keeping with the film's college setting, there was "dorm food" from 
Ambrosia that included pizza, burgers and, uh, sushi. But the lobby was so 
crowded it was like holding a food tasting in a sauna. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vocabulary: Taggers -- guests along just for the ride. No ambition to break 
into Hollywood, they're there just because they can be. As in the sentence: 
"They looked like screenwriters, but they turned out to be taggers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pastimes: While the film screened, agents and execs watched the NCAA 
championship game with the kind of frenzied interest only gambling, or having a 
child on the team, inspires. The film's budget was probably less than the money 
that changed hands when Arkansas won.

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIR; DAHMER'S FATHER ALSO ASKS, 'WHY?'; A FATHER'S STORY BY 
LIONEL DAHMER ; MORROW, $20, 255 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of Jeffrey Dahmer is strange enough: a tale of stalking, torture, 
mutilation, murder and cannibalism. But there's something truly startling and 
deeply unsettling about "A Father's Story" by Lionel Dahmer -- it's a 
post-mortem of Jeffrey Dahmer's life and crimes as told by his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Dahmer seems to anticipate the likely reaction of his readers, and he 
announces at the very outset of "A Father's Story" that "a portion of the 
proceeds" from his book will be donated to the families of his son's victims, 
although he is quick to concede that "no donation can atone for such tremendous 
loss." 
</P>
<P>
 The very same tone of awkwardness, embarrassment and clumsy self-justification 
prevails throughout the book, as if Dahmer knows what we are asking ourselves: 
Do we really need to know the Dahmer family's side of the story? 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact is, "A Father's Story" is really more about Lionel Dahmer than 
his son, a heartfelt effort at self-analysis and self-revelation by a 
bewildered father forced to accept that his son is a mass murderer: Where did I 
go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Dahmer is rather circumspect in describing the details of his son's crimes. 
Still, Jeffrey Dahmer is very much the focus of "A Father's Story." And, as 
Dahmer describes Jeffrey's birth, his early childhood, and the long, agonizing 
but irreversible descent into a particularly gruesome kind of madness, "A 
Father's Story" begins to read like a sequel to "Rosemary's Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls that 4-year-old Jeffrey was fascinated by the animal bones he found 
under the porch of the family home. He describes how young Jeffrey demanded 
that a Halloween jack-o-lantern be carved with a mean face instead of a happy 
one. And he describes the heartbreaking experience of watching a "happy, 
ebullient" child drift into an unreachable nether world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boy who sat across from me at the dinner table," Dahmer writes, "his face 
now adorned with glasses, his eyes dull, his mouth set in a motionless 
rigidity, was drifting into a nightmare world of unimaginable fantasies." 
</P>
<P>
 So "A Father's Story" is Dahmer's almost desperate attempt to explain to 
himself why his son turned out to be such a monster. Was it the medication that 
his wife took during pregnancy? Was it the result of Lionel's passivity and 
aloofness during Jeffrey's childhood? Or was it a grotesque manifestation of 
the emotional and psychological frailties that Lionel Dahmer knew as a child? 
</P>
<P>
 "A Father's Story" bears all the tool marks of a man who has submitted himself 
to an intensive course of psychotherapy, although the author never says so. 
Lionel Dahmer confesses to "a strange numbness at (his) core," and allows that 
his failure to notice his son's weirder aspects was "an exercise in denial and 
avoidance." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahmer insists on convicting himself of parental negligence. When he describes 
the letters that his son routinely receives -- an outpouring of mail from the 
sick, the scary and the needy -- Dahmer again flagellates himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, some of these people believe that in some bizarre way, my son could 
rescue them from lives in which they felt entrapped," Dahmer writes. "It 
demonstrated a level of sympathy and pity that I simply could not reach. . . . 
I often wondered why, in a world of so much feeling, I could express so 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahmer works himself up to an almost frantic confession of some vague genetic 
offense against nature. He once tried to hypnotize a childhood playmate, and he 
taught himself how to make bombs as an adolescent, and he links these 
peculiarities to his son's awful crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a scientist, (I) wonder if (the) potential for great evil . . . resides 
deep in the blood that some of us . . . may pass on to our children at birth," 
writes Dahmer, a chemist.  
</P>
<P>
 So we begin to realize that Dahmer is merely one more of his son's victims, 
and "A Father's Son" is a kind of crude self-exorcism intended to draw out the 
demon that afflicts him. And his agony is so deep that we can hardly begrudge 
him the right to try.

MUSIC REVIEW; TRIO CLOSES MUSIC GUILD SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Athleticism has its place in chamber-music performance, a place more often 
under- than overvalued by musicians. Not so with the Starr-Kim-Boeckheler Trio 
-- here to close the Music Guild's 49th season this week -- which brought a 
no-holds-barred approach to its program in Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall at Cal 
State Long Beach Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 This made for consistently exciting, active and generous music-making, and for 
mixed results. Stylistic niceties went by the wayside in the trio's varied 
offerings and in their place stood a one-size-fits-all aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beethoven's Trio in C minor, Opus 1, No. 3, this led to some appropriately 
virile playing. It also meant muscularity where Classical finesse and grace 
would have done better. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- violinist Chin Kim, cellist Ulrich Boeckheler and pianist Susan 
Starr -- seems inspired to its vigor by Starr, an impressively gifted 
technician with a massive tone that she uses a great deal. In the Daniel Hall 
acoustics her pounding accents became wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble's traversal of Ravel's Trio avoided prissy Gallicisms altogether, 
replacing them with a full-blown Romanticism. This worked, for the most part, 
in the resplendent outer movements, but in the more impressionistic and 
delicate inner ones it seemed oversized, bullish. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio hit its stride after intermission not by changing its style but by 
changing its tune in grappling with meaty music -- Tchaikovsky's big, grand, 
sumptuous, excessive A-minor Trio, played to the hilt and then some by the 
untiring musicians. TIMOTHY MANGAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; PASSION, POWER FROM KATEY SAGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Katey Sagal isn't some TV star who suddenly decided on a singing career and 
used her fame to launch her career. The woman who plays the acid-tongued Peg 
Bundy on "Married . . . With Children" was a background singer first, having 
toured with the likes of Bette Midler and Bob Dylan before going into acting. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday at the Troubadour, she played the first of a series of dates to 
promote her new album, "Well . . . ," due out April 19. She proved to be a 
torchy pop singer, with power, decent range and a skill for wringing passion 
out of a love song. But she needs to downsize her eight-piece band -- nobody 
could effectively sing an intimate song backed by that small mob. 
</P>
<P>
 By far her most touching tune was her finale, "Dignity," which she performed 
with just two musicians. That song had an intimacy sorely missing from all the 
others. It also pointed out a need for variety and imagination in the 
arrangements. Scattering a few standards through the show -- all unfamiliar 
originals -- would have helped too. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's low energy level was apparently a result of Sagal's being five 
months pregnant. She noted several times that she'd be doing a wilder, more 
boisterous show if she were physically able. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the germ of an excellent cabaret show in Sagal's hourlong set. With 
performances on the next two Mondays, she'll have a chance to work out some of 
the bugs.DENNIS HUNT

TV REVIEW; 'AMERICA AND THE HOLOCAUST' SHATTERS MYTH; THE 90-MINUTE 'AMERICAN 
EXPERIENCE' DOCUMENTS THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION'S DECEIT AND INDIFFERENCE 
TOWARD WARTIME PLIGHT OF EUROPEAN JEWS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American self-image of ethical uprightness in the face of Nazi terror 
during World War II has remained an unexamined myth of the national life. But 
the myth is broken, if not shattered, by Martin Ostrow's devastating 90-minute 
film for PBS' "The American Experience," "America and the Holocaust: Deceit and 
Indifference." With a mass of paperwork and eyewitness testimony to back it up, 
Ostrow's work explains how the U.S. government deliberately prevented the 
immigration of millions of Jews trying to flee Nazi-occupied Europe. And the 
blame falls right into the lap of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ostrow's superbly constructed history, lucidly narrated by Hal Linden and 
based largely on scholar David S. Wyman's decades-long research, is not merely 
a critique of U.S. war-era policy. It reveals an America shot through with deep 
anti-Semitic sentiments, and recounts the tragic tale of Jewish refugee Kurt 
Klein's family. As Klein's running narrative is intercut with the political 
scandal in the halls of Washington, "America and the Holocaust" sharply 
demonstrates how bureaucratic decisions carry personal and moral consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the racist virulence of the Nazis, a quieter racism dominated such 
agencies as the State Department, according to Wyman, who points a particular 
finger at Assistant Secretary of State Breckinridge Long. Roosevelt appointee 
Long enacted a secret policy to, in Long's words, "postpone and postpone and 
postpone" visas for Jews seeking refuge in the United States. The motives of 
Long and his cronies could do with more examination by both Ostrow and Wyman; 
alongside anti-Semitism were the political pressures of hundreds of 
anti-foreign, anti-immigrant "patriotic societies," isolationism, the security 
concern that German spies would enter the United States and the State 
Department's concern not to upset relations with oil-rich Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Klein recalls the unendurable wait as he and his brothers and sisters, freshly 
arrived in the new country, anticipated word from their parents that their 
visas were in order for emigration. To his growing horror, he realized that 
German extermination plans were being aided and abetted by both British and 
American policymakers unwilling to ease visa requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Klein was David against the U.S. governmental Goliath, but, as news 
arrived in 1942 that German trains were carrying thousands of Jews to death 
camps, a campaign for American rescue of Jews gained real clout. Its stars 
included such unlikely allies as Rep. Will Rogers Jr., writer Ben Hecht and Dr. 
Stephen S. Wise, but it was Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau and his aides 
who finally uncovered Long's secret policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The horrors didn't end there. Ostrow's film describes how the War Department 
declined to consider bombing the Auschwitz death camp because it was too far a 
flight, even though several photos show U.S. bombers flying directly over the 
camp to bomb nearby oil factories. Klein's story finally ends with a mixture of 
bittersweetness and tragedy that ranks with the most moving chapters in 
Holocaust history.

THEATER REVIEW; A 'POLITICALLY INCORRECT' JACKIE MASON GETS EVEN; THE ANGRY 
'EQUAL OPPORTUNITY OFFENDER' RETURNS ON A SOAPBOX TO SETTLE SOME SCORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WINER-BERNHEIMER, NEWSDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are supposed to have feelings about Jackie Mason. Big-time feelings. We're 
meant to be offended by his bigotry, or to squeal "can-he-get-away-with-that?" 
guilty laughs at his stereotypes, or -- more noble at Broadway prices -- to 
embrace his honesty as a tonic to purge our hypocritical times with ruthless 
candor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the title of his newest Broadway show, "Jackie Mason: Politically 
Incorrect," is chosen to dunk our pigtails in the inkwells of 
self-righteousness. Dare to take issue with the truth of some observations, or 
find them generally more angry and less fresh than in his previous two shows 
and you risk sounding like a member of the thought police, an enemy of free 
speech, one of those "yentas" or "Nazi bastards" to whom he makes us feel 
superior for a couple of hours at the Golden Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolder still, we will admit not feeling much about Mason at all. He does what 
he does again, much as he did to enormous surprise and giddy delight with "The 
World According to Me" in 1986, and again to less surprise and a bit more 
uneasy delight with "Jackie Mason: Brand New" three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has those great antennae for absurdities, for the foolishness in 
phone-machine messages that, at this late date, instruct callers to leave their 
numbers after the beep ("What, they're going to leave a plate of soup?"), or 
the environmental sham of separating tuna-fish cans while ignoring emission 
standards. And he still has his double-breasted bantam strut and his rabbinical 
jazz-riff rhythms, judiciously revved, that pile funny-sounding yiddishisms on 
top of one another with the infectious incongruity of a davening rapper with 
adenoids. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mason is angry this time. More than just deflating some genuine excesses 
suggested by his title, he uses the "politically incorrect" bravado to settle 
personal scores and support a soapbox. His pumpkin face turns dangerously red 
about the "phony bastard" in the White House. "Nobody lies as good as Clinton," 
says the comedian, who devotes most of the second act to rage against the 
President, screaming "fraud" about broken campaign promises on taxes, Haitians 
and Bosnia. "Since when have human beings dying," he asks, red turning to 
purple, not been in "our vital interest?" 
</P>
<P>
 We celebrate the humanitarian generosity, but then he knocks Janet Reno for 
not trying to look sexy, and moments earlier, he had solved the entire sticky 
issue of affirmative action with this question and answer: "How come they don't 
blame black people because there are no Chinese tap dancers? Chinese don't want 
to be tap dancers. They want to press shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mason prides himself on being an "equal opportunity offender," but, more than 
ever, his indignation is extremely selective. There's a difference between 
saying Jews always feel guilty for everything they didn't do and saying Indian 
taxi drivers smell bad. It's one thing to say Jews don't like violence ("Jews 
become dentists because Gentiles play hockey"), another to neglect entirely the 
bloody little business on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mason still knows how to work an audience and weave outlandish bits 
brilliantly into the benign ones. In the four years since his last show here, 
however, he has been bounced from Rudolph Giuliani's first mayoral campaign for 
the "fancy schvartzer with a mustache" remark about David Dinkins and, last 
month, was condemned by the Anti-Defamation League for being a racist. 
</P>
<P>
 So there's a chip on his shoulder these days that, when he digs deeper than 
Bobbitt-Harding-Menendez for material, puts an unpleasant defensive spin on the 
observations. We laugh, sure, and marvel at a mind that asks why, when there is 
more violence in literature than on TV, we're not scared of people leaving the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 But we can't ignore the crack already reprinted in interviews with Mason as a 
proud example of his fearless wit against the tyranny of hyper-sensitivity. 
Jumping off a routine about the judge who let HIV-positive Haitians leave 
Guantanamo for the U.S., he jokes "If you have AIDS, you can come into this 
country. If you have fruit, you can't. If you want to bring fruit into this 
country, give it to someone with AIDS." Cute. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, this country bans HIV-positive foreigners, except for the 10-day 
waiver for the Gay Games in June and except for Haitians held for 20 months 
without representation and adequate medical care. There's a big difference 
between being politically incorrect and legally incorrect. Call me a "yenta 
Nazi bastard," but I noticed.

 A cure for couch potatoes: One of the cruel facts of life is the tendency of

 Hey! No campaigning within 50 yards of the baseball field: Given an afternoon

we spotted a picketer singing the praises of a gubernatorial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York gubernatorial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The picketer was none other than Melrose Larry Green, the political gadfly, 
whose sign said: "Howard Stern for governor." Yes, the author/talk show host 
says he's really running for New York's top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 We couldn't determine how many New York voters were at the Dodger game but, as 
the saying goes, it's the thought (or lack of thought) that counts. After all, 
Stern endorsed Green in the L.A. mayoral race last year and no doubt deserves 
some of the credit for Melrose Larry's 16th-place finish.

 OK, so it isn't Architectural Digest: But one of Southern California's

has since had a bit part in "The Loved One" (1965). And it's certainly 
picturesque. But we can't figure out what it's doing in the 1994-1995 edition

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
DISTRICT TO STUDY SCHOOL'S BIG SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intrigued by news that the San Fernando Valley's first charter school will end 
the year with a projected $1.2-million surplus, Los Angeles Unified School 
District officials said Monday they will send two auditors to the Pacoima 
school to see how the feat was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the district's budget office are reviewing the Vaughn Next 
Century Learning Center's budget to determine whether the cash-strapped 
district can benefit from any of the cost-saving measures used by the 
1,150-student school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that can be replicated, hallelujah," said district Supt. Sidney A. 
Thompson. "We need to see how she got there and what she did to get there -- 
$1.2 million is a lot of money."  
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1992 state Charter Schools Act, up to 10 schools in any district and 
100 in the state can achieve charter status. The schools continue to receive 
public funds, but are free from state laws and regulations on how to use the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn -- considered the most financially daring of 33 operating charter 
schools in the state -- took charge of its budget matters when it opened as a 
charter school last July, including hiring and paying its own teachers and 
buying its own liability insurance.

SPORTS WATCH; SEASON OF POTENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The baseball season has opened, with all its wonderful possibilities and 
potential for human frailty. 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-amazing Bo Jackson is playing in Anaheim, and long-shot teams like 
the Angels are looking for reasons to believe under major league baseball's 
divisional realignment.Chan Ho Park, a fine 20-year-old South Korean pitcher, 
is quickening hearts at Dodger Stadium, as manager Tom Lasorda pulls yet 
another young rabbit out of the hat. It's become an annual debut of talent that 
fits nicely with spring's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 But baseball is like life in other ways, too -- full of trouble as well as 
promise. The Dodgers have gracefully given veteran Darryl Strawberry a reprieve 
from release to get treatment after he acknowledged a problem with drugs and 
alcohol. There's a lesson here for starry-eyed youngsters and parents: No 
wealth of talent, money and celebrity offers exemption from the need to deal 
head-on with challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Two teams, the Cleveland Indians and the Texas Rangers, have new ballparks and 
are stirring fresh hopes. Purists, meanwhile, understandably cringe at the 
breakup of the American League and National League into three divisions each, 
plus the introduction of the "wild card" factor to postseason play.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet we know that there is something magnetic for the soul in a game that lures 
basketball star Michael Jordan to ride its minor league buses, at least for 
now, after a spring tryout with the Chicago White Sox. Even if baseball 
sometimes disappoints, we know we cannot resist its return.

RESIDENCE OF LAPD OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was chagrined to read the ACLU's report announcing that it has found 
something new that is terribly wrong in the Los Angeles Police Department, 
since so many of us live outside the city (March 29). We don't need to be beat 
up and criticized any more. Can the ACLU find nothing about us that it likes? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, I was relieved and pleased to read your editorial (March 30). You got it 
exactly right: Residence is not an issue, especially not in Southern 
California. The issue in all of public service -- not just law enforcement -- 
is attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently assigned as the commanding officer in the North Hollywood area, I 
have been only pleased at the relationship that has developed here between the 
police and the community. Many officers live long distances away, yet spend 
extra hours here serving their community because they have a stake here. My 
senior lead officers say they have difficulty saying "no" to anything "their 
people" ask of them. The level of caring and concern here is genuine, and it 
flows both ways. The outpouring of support and encouragement from our community 
is continuous. 
</P>
<P>
 The people in the North Hollywood area are doing much to improve their 
community and the service their police officers are able to provide. Your 
editorial has also helped, since it has taken some of the "sting" away from the 
ACLU report. I can't think of anything the ACLU has ever done to help the 
police, even a little. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD D. WAHLER, Captain 
</P>
<P>
 Commanding Officer, North Hollywood Area 
</P>
<P>
 * I believe that your editorial is right on point. I have had the opportunity 
to observe and work with hundreds of officers during my 22 years with the LAPD. 
You will not find a more dedicated collection of officers than those who work 
each and every day to protect the Los Angeles community. Most of our officers 
spend more time providing service to the city's diverse communities than they 
spend with their own families.  
</P>
<P>
 I cannot speak for the members of the ACLU and the neighborhoods in which they 
live, but most of our officers live in very diverse communities. I was 
personally insulted when the ACLU made the statement that many officers live in 
suburban white areas. I do not live in the city but my neighbors come in all 
colors and from around the world. My neighbors are black, Hispanic, Chinese and 
white. My children play with the greatest cross section of cultures that I 
could ask for. I do not think that I find myself in a unique situation. Our 
officers do live in very diverse communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Next October, members of the community I serve will be participating in 
Operation Sparkle. I challenge members of the ACLU to join with me and other 
dedicated officers to make our community a better place. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL S. PESQUEIRA, Captain 
</P>
<P>
 Commanding Officer, 77th Street Station 
</P>
<P>
 * I write this letter with reluctance and with a heavy heart. The reluctance 
comes from a resolve never to write a letter to The Times again. The heavy 
heart comes from sitting on the sidelines watching my LAPD family being torn 
asunder and no one to speak for it. Each day brings a new revelation, a new 
attack, a new slight. They come from every direction, particularly from the 
single-mindedness of special interest groups, the vindictiveness of 
long-prejudiced community activists, the pettiness of shortsighted political 
leadership and from the failure of department leadership to take a stand in 
defense of the most dedicated professional work force ever assembled within one 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is another "inside" b.s. story regarding sexual harassment, or 
criticism of where officers choose to live, and raise their families, or a 
replay of the overplayed Rodney King video on the 6 o'clock news makes little 
difference in the demoralizing impact on our officers.  
</P>
<P>
 Take it from this old chief. Good people, your Police Department is in a state 
of crisis. You have already lost a big chunk and are in peril of losing the 
rest of this city's great treasure -- the LAPD. Pride, morale, spirit, 
enthusiasm and confidence in leadership are at a shockingly low level within 
the ranks. These fine men and women want desperately to serve this city with 
distinction, to prove once again that their excellent performance is 
incomparable. Stand up for the good men and women of LAPD! For starters, you 
can tell our new mayor, whom you elected to make the city safe and prosperous, 
to continue with negotiations and make his contract offer and modest pay raise 
a reality. You can let council members know that you are tired of the petty 
criticism of the LAPD. Certainly you want reform when really necessary and not 
just for appearances and you want people's rights protected, but you also want 
your neighborhoods protected by enthusiastic, spirited cops who want to go to 
work again. You want cops to know they will be supported reasonably, 
judiciously and fairly if, while acting in good faith, they make a mistake of 
judgment as a result of a split-second decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Please join me and shout down those who unnecessarily and unreasonably attack 
the integrity of all officers over the missteps of a very few. The city's 
finances may or may not allow additional police officers to be hired in the 
future, but right now it is imperative that we preserve the dignity and sense 
of self-worth of those officers we now have.

STANDING UP FOR REFORM; POLICE COMMISSION ACTS IN SUPPORT OF THE CHRISTOPHER 
REVISIONS IN LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The members of the Los Angeles Police Commission have taken their most 
important action since Mayor Richard Riordan appointed them last year. 
Specifically, the commission on Tuesday wisely set aside $39,000 of its funds 
to buy a computer system to track public complaints about police officers.But 
more broadly, and more significantly, the commission's action clearly states 
that it supports the reforms recommended more than two years ago by the 
Christopher Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher panel, created in response to the outcry over the 1991 Rodney 
King beating and headed by now-Secretary of State Warren Christopher, set forth 
a blueprint for reform. Of course, change comes slowly to any large 
institution, and can be scary. But given the procedural and attitude problems 
found in the Police Department after the King beating, to not change was an 
even more frightening proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 One key reform recommended by the Christopher Commission has taken place: The 
police chief is now accountable to the Police Commission, the mayor and the 
City Council, thanks to voter passage of Charter Amendment F. But another key 
reform -- the implementation of community-based policing -- remains a vague 
notion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Commission, recognizing that the Christopher reforms need stronger 
support, came through Tuesday with cash from its own budget to purchase the 
computer tracking system. It was not the amount but the political will 
demonstrated that was impressive. The commission was telling the LAPD, city 
officials and residents that it intends to push forward on reform. The Police 
Commission, led by its president, Gary Greenebaum, has its work cut out. It's a 
difficult challenge but the right thing to do.

TWO OLD PROS FACE THE S. AFRICAN GALE; KISSINGER AND CARRINGTON WILL SEEK TO 
MEDIATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that just about everything else has failed to resolve the political 
impasse and stop the mounting body count in South Africa, two internationally 
respected diplomats, Henry A. Kissinger and Britain's Lord Peter Carrington, 
will try their experienced hands. Just another desperate grasp for peace in 
South Africa? Maybe. But it's definitely worth a try, given the way the 
unexpected has come to happen lately in that troubled nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger and Carrington will mediate at the request of the Transitional 
Executive Council, currently the governmental decision-making body, and with 
permission from President Frederik W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, the heir 
apparent to the presidency. They will need more than good luck to entice the 
powerful Zulu minority to put down its weapons and participate in the April 
26-28 balloting, which is certain to elect its hated rival, Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 CREDENTIALS GALORE: Although he had little to show for his role in the 
European Union peace conference on Bosnia, Carrington, a former British foreign 
minister, is knowledgeable about Africa and enjoys credibility in the region. 
In neighboring Zimbabwe, he brokered a similar impasse, ending the Rhodesia war 
and allowing the transition from a white-dominated British colony to a 
black-run country. Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state, has a large and 
deep foreign affairs portfolio.  
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk and Mandela are scheduled to meet on Friday with the power-hungry 
Zulu chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who heads the small but potent Inkatha 
Freedom Party, and the figurehead Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelethini. The Zulu 
leaders want an independent nation that would be heavily subsidized by the 
government. Allowing a Zulu secession would Balkanize South Africa and 
encourage conservative whites in their own campaign for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Zulu leaders talk, their fanatical adherents live under a government 
state of emergency, imposed by De Klerk -- ironically, with Mandela's blessing. 
Mandela's followers, supporters of his powerful African National Congress, once 
fought a similar state of emergency that the white minority government imposed 
in trying to stall the drive toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 WEIRD LANDSCAPE: Currently, state security forces are on patrol in Natal 
province, which includes the quasi-independent Zulu homeland, KwaZulu. Once 
again, the topsy-turvy politics of South Africa are evident. According to the 
independent Goldstone Commission, established by De Klerk, several senior 
security leaders colluded with Zulu forces and provided them with sophisticated 
arms to do battle with the ANC. The police now must walk a fine line, 
containing the Zulus without triggering a monstrous blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have thought that Mandela would support a state of emergency 
declared by the government, or that police forces once secretly allied with the 
Zulus would face them as opponents? The unpredictability of the political winds 
in South Africa may be Kissinger and Carrington's best ally.

ANTI-SMOKING PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I started smoking as a teen-ager and gave it up with great difficulty after 
too many offensive and expensive years. I applaud the strong action sought by 
the Clinton Administration ("White House Seeks Wide Smoking Ban," March 26). 
Tobacco should neither be offered nor condoned by a civilized society. I wonder 
how long it will take to get similar, progressive action on alcohol. I am also 
an ex-drinker. I know how alcohol can destroy families and communities in a far 
more tragic and criminal way.

 * Prohibition didn't work, but it created a huge black market with much crime 
and corruption. The (so-called) "War on Drugs" is a huge failure, with a 
worldwide black market, crime, corruption in government and flouting of the 
Constitution (forfeiture laws, guilty until proven innocent). We could have 
paid off the national debt with what we have spent and will go on spending. Now 
we will have a war on tobacco, ditto, ditto, ditto!

 * I regret very much that your editorial writers did not take the time to 
communicate with me before editorializing (March 27) against my efforts to 
protect the jobs of thousands of restaurant workers without sacrificing their 
health and that of the public. Had The Times given me the courtesy of a phone 
call, or bothered to read my amendments to AB 13, the smoking ban bill, you 
would have written a very different editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a nonsmoker. In the 19 years I have served in the Legislature, I have 
never voted against the health interests of Californians. The memory of 
watching my great-aunt kill herself by smoking will forever be etched in my 
mind. I have always believed that smoking is bad for one's health.  
</P>
<P>
 My voting record on tough anti-smoking legislation is solid. My vote to end 
the "Joe Camel" campaign was an effort to stop the insidious tobacco campaign 
aimed at our young people. I do not accept or solicit campaign contributions 
from the tobacco industry. That is why your editorial characterizing me in bed 
with the tobacco industry was so painful and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 California remains in the grips of a serious recession. The amendment I 
offered to AB 13 was a direct response to concerns raised by the hotel and 
restaurant workers at the hearing that further restrictions on restaurants 
would cost even more jobs. To label me with the tobacco lobby for speaking out 
for workers in this hard-hit industry, is not accurate. I stated clearly that I 
supported AB 13 with or without the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 My amendment said that if technology is available and complies with the AB 13 
standard, a restaurant could choose to set aside up to 25% of its space for 
smokers if and only if the level is insignificantly harmful to the exposed 
persons, including employees, and smoke gases and particulate matter from that 
area do not recalculate or drift to other areas of the restaurant (this is the 
standard of AB 13). The amendment did not, as you assert, delay the effective 
date of the smoking ban, Jan. 1, 1995. Curiously, the standards offered in my 
amendment for restaurants are identical to standards that the author of AB 13 
carved out for the powerful hotel industry.  
</P>
<P>
 I told the representative of the American Heart Assn. after their lawyers had 
reviewed the amendment, that if they still felt that it would damage the impact 
of the bill, I would remove the amendment.  
</P>
<P>
 If your readers would like a copy of the amendment, they may request one from 
my Los Angeles office at (213) 620-2529, or from my Sacramento office at (916) 
445-3456.

BARRY GOLDWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was rather puzzled by George F. Will's tribute, "Goldwater Lost the Race, 
Won the Future" (Column Right, March 27), in which he credits Barry Goldwater's 
conservative reorientation of the GOP in 1964 with leading to victories in five 
of the next six presidential elections. I agree that Goldwater started the 
Republicans on a conservative track, but by the time we got Ronald Reagan, the 
principles of conservatism in the GOP had been hijacked by the so-called Moral 
Majority.This evangelical element, which has been the galvanizing force in the 
GOP for the past decade, bears little resemblance to a principled 
Goldwater-style conservatism. Will parenthetically notes Goldwater's views 
which place him at odds with the GOP party line (pro-choice on abortion, for 
gays in the military), yet he fails to see the fundamental philosophical 
difference. Goldwater believes that government should generally stay out of 
private citizens' lives; the Republican Party, which favors outlawing abortion 
and restoring school prayer, does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Will also credits Goldwater's 1964 loss to Lyndon B. Johnson for inadvertently 
aiding conservatism by giving the Democrats enough rope to discredit 
themselves. That was before my time, but I saw a similar self-destruction in 
the 1992 Republican convention. The unbridled ascendancy of religious 
extremists in the Republican Party drove decent Americans away from the GOP 
like never before, sealing Bill Clinton's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 To link Barry Goldwater to the GOP that brought us Ronald Reagan, George Bush, 
and the 1992 Republican convention does an extreme disservice to a man of great 
conviction and principle.

COLUMN RIGHT/ PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS: CLINTONOMICS IS FAILING THE MARKET TEST; 
CLINTON TOOK INCENTIVE OUT OF THE ECONOMY BY RAISING TAX RATES; HIS RELIANCE ON 
LOW INTEREST RATES RAISES THE INFLATION SPECTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts, a former assistant secretary of the 
Treasury, is chairman of the Institute for Political Economy and a 
Distinguished Fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financial markets are giving us an early test of the Clinton economic 
policy, and the results are not promising. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton brushed off concerns that his program of higher tax rates 
and more regulation would hurt the economy. The tax increase, he said, would 
result in a smaller deficit, which, in turn, would mean lower interest rates. 
And the lower interest rates would provide enough economic stimulation to 
offset the adverse effects of higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few months it seemed to be working, but the recent decline in stock and 
bond prices has left interest rates higher than they were when Clinton was 
inaugurated. Many people are about to dig into their pockets to pay their 
higher taxes on April 15 and many will not get their usual refund. This decline 
in consumer liquidity hits the economy simultaneously with the sharp run-up in 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's economic policy is the reverse of Ronald Reagan's -- and not because 
it taxes the rich. Reagan relied on incentives to push the economy. With 
incentives driving the economic expansion, the Federal Reserve was able to keep 
a tight grip on the money supply. As a consequence, the economy grew while 
inflation fell -- a wonderful result. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Clinton took incentive out of the economy by raising tax rates, 
and he regulates extensively. To drive the economy, he relies on low interest 
rates, or easy money. 
</P>
<P>
 This policy cannot work, because it results in too much money being created. 
The money creation gets the attention of financial markets and the Federal 
Reserve, and both raise interest rates, thus choking off the one factor driving 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 When bondholders see a money-driven expansion, they expect inflation to follow 
in its wake, and they bail out of their bond holdings. A wave of selling drives 
down bond prices, which is the same thing as driving up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve follows in turn. Its board of governors observes the 
sell-off of bonds and decides that it must reassure the financial market by 
raising interest rates. Higher interest rates are the Fed's way of slowing the 
growth of the money supply. However, the Fed is fearful of stopping the economy 
in its tracks and usually raises interest rates in a series of small steps that 
follow behind interest rate increases in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the money that the Fed has already allowed to be pumped out 
is doing its work expanding the demand for goods and services. But the higher 
taxes and regulation make the effort necessary to expand supply less rewarding. 
Consequently, the demand pressure starts pushing up prices instead of real 
output. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1970s proved that high taxes and easy money make a recipe for economic 
disaster. This policy boils down to using inflation to drive the economy. But 
inflation sets in motion contractionary forces of its own -- rising interest 
rates. Remember the 20% prime rate that Ronald Reagan inherited from the 
stagflation of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990s are too soon to be repeating the policy mistake of the 1970s. Bill 
Clinton may be too young and inexperienced to have learned the lesson of a 
money-fueled expansion, but his Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, has lived 
through it before. Why aren't any alarms sounding in the Administration? 
</P>
<P>
 This question cannot be answered without taking ideology into account. The 
Clintons believe that Reagan's policy benefited the successful, who are going 
to do well in any case, and thus gratuitously worsened inequalities in the 
distribution of income. Incentives have been ruled out because they are 
believed to result in excessive disparities in the distribution of income and 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 These disparities are not acceptable to egalitarians who believe that a just 
society is one characterized by equality of result. Therefore, they choose to 
drive the economy with easy money, while taxing away "excessive" rewards earned 
in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 This ideological approach to economic policy is never successful. It can work 
only until the monetary expansion heats up inflation or expectations of 
inflation. Clinton, like others before him, believes he can have a successful 
economy without the incentives that produce successful people. This is a 
delusion that has harmed us before, and it will again.

A LITTLE INCONVENIENCE TO SAVE LIVES; INSTEAD OF WESTSIDERS ARMING THEMSELVES, 
HOW ABOUT RANDOM SEARCHES TO GET THE GUNS THAT TERRORIZE THE POOR, TOO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates writes from Los Angeles about 
modern culture, race relations and politics for several national publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local magazine that touts the glories of life on the Westside (and, 
occasionally, parts of the Valley) has, in this month's issue, an article that 
explains exactly why civilized people would be better off owning and carrying 
guns. The gist of this article and the personal testimonies that accompany it 
boil down to this: You'd better be armed, folks, because it's a nasty world out 
there, and They are out to get you. Every illustration with the piece showed a 
grim white person holding or hovering near a firearm. Draw your own 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 What the magazine doesn't mention (because it usually doesn't mention black 
people, for instance, at all -- unless they're holding basketballs or 
performing on screen or stage) is that there are many other people who do not 
have fancy businesses or lifestyles to protect, who pay their taxes, who have 
never committed a crime -- who could also be categorized as one of the ethnic 
groups that are Them. And these people are scared to death, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime victimizes everyone, and inner-city residents know this better 
than the upper-middle-class folks who are self-righteously announcing that 
enough is enough, and it's time to get a gun. The recent killings of two 
Marymount College students in a San Pedro carjacking only affirms this school 
of thought. But in all likelihood, having a gun would not have helped Takuma 
Ito or Go Matsuura at the critical moment. In such struggles, it's usually the 
person being assaulted who is killed, even when the victim is armed. So arming 
the law-abiding citizenry isn't the answer.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the answer is unannounced sweeps of California, a coordinated effort by 
local police and sheriff departments and the National Guard to rid the state of 
guns. Everybody's guns. It would require arbitrary search and seizure and would 
make life miserable for all of us. Traffic would be snarled (because 
checkpoints would be established throughout cities, much like those at border 
crossings). Non-criminal development execs leaving chic eateries would be 
outraged to find that their Glocks had been collected from their Jeep Grand 
Cherokees left with the valet. Tough. All sorts of suits would be filed by 
lawyers, some of whom would fear having their own briefcases searched.  
</P>
<P>
 Police state! you scream. Fascist administration of law! I'm allowed to carry 
a gun -- the Constitution says so! But the Second Amendment was written when 
the communal standards in this country were higher. Way before Los Angeles 
turned into Dodge City. Most of us no longer need to shoot our food (and if we 
choose to, we can rent a gun to do it.) Our armed forces, adjunct armed forces 
and police departments all have guns, and should. And it should end there. No 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 That Americans have refused to enact laws to stringently limit gun ownership 
indicates we are either stupid or suicidal. If we don't want greater Los 
Angeles to look like Sarajevo (and parts of it that many people seek to avoid 
already do), we'd better start looking beyond the panic of the well-off. If we 
want to get guns out of the hands of criminals, we non-criminals will have to 
sacrifice a little comfort. If it would save lives and improve the quality of 
life, my dignity could stand the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe then, foreign-exchange students could expect to receive a degree from 
their American experience instead of a slug. Maybe then, mothers in poor 
neighborhoods wouldn't have to worry whether going to the corner store for milk 
or diapers after dark is worth possibly orphaning their children. Maybe then, 
the National Rifle Assn. could direct a fraction of the zillions it spends 
trying to defeat politicians who argue against the right to bear arms to the 
root causes that induce people to carry guns in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun deaths have become so common that we tend not be moved by them unless we 
can personalize the tragedy, as the killings of Miami tourists, the two 
Marymount students and Yoshihiro Hattori in Baton Rouge, La., last year, 
illustrate. Maybe what it will take to enact a strict gun-control law is to 
have every anti-control legislator and lobbyist (or one of their loved ones or 
friends) threatened by the guns they seek to keep on the streets. It's a 
gruesome thought, and not one I'm advocating. But the cynic in me suspects 
something would be done, quickly, should that occur. Why wait? Let's stop the 
madness now.

 AmeriQuest To Acquire Valley Software Distributor: As part of the 
consolidation of the personal computer industry, Kenfil Inc. of Van Nuys will 
become a division of AmeriQuest Technologies. The all-stock deal will nearly 
triple the Irvine-based microcomputer parts distributor's annual sales.Some 
layoffs among the 300 employees are likely among warehousing and administrative 
positions. Kenfil, with 150 employees and $191 million in sales last year, is 
one of the nation's largest software distributors. AmeriQuest, formerly called 
CMS Enhancements, has begin an aggressive expansion campaign after shrinking 
from $200 million in sales in 1989 to just $73 million last year. At Tuesday's 
closing price of $4.50 for AmeriQuest common stock, the deal would be worth 
$17.5 million. But the value will depend on the stock prices when shares are 
exchanged in two installments 60 and 105 days from now.

 Wall Street wiped out some of its recent losses Tuesday as the market soared 
to its biggest one-day gain since 1991, led by issues sensitive to economic 
cycles such as autos, heavy machinery and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The market rallied sharply early on and never looked back, as investors 
responded in part to a jump in bond prices and a corresponding decline in 
market interest rates, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow jumped 82.06 to 3,675.41, a 2.28% advance and the largest increase for 
the index since Dec. 23, 1991. On that day the blue-chip average jumped 88.10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 7.24% from 7.40% on 
Monday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 1 21/32 points, 
or $16.56 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The long bond's price had been down nearly 3 1/2 points in the last two 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market rally was viewed by most analysts as just a temporary detour 
from a long-term bearish trend, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts cited the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators, the 
government's chief forecasting tool, which fell 0.1% in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The index, released Tuesday, showed its first decline in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar soared against most major currencies, powered by the 
stock and bond market rallies, which created a huge demand for dollars to buy 
U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising issues outnumbered declining ones about 7 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was a heavy 366.89 million shares, up from 344.39 
million on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, mostly concentrated in the smaller capitalization Nasdaq 
index, also helped to lead the market higher. Lotus Development added 5 5/8 to 
72 and Newbridge Networks gained 4 3/4 to 56 5/8. Hutchinson Technology gained 
4 1/2 to 35 1/4; Cisco Systems added 1 7/8 to finish at 35; Microsoft gained 3 
1/4 to 87 3/4 
</P>
<P>
 * Car makers were big gainers on the NYSE, with General Motors rising 2 3/4 to 
57 3/8 and Chrysler up 2 7/8 to 54 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar surged 4 to 117 1/4 and Deere & Co. rose 2 3/4 to 86 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airline stocks were also strong, with AMR Corp. up one at 57 1/2 and UAL 
Corp. gaining 2 1/2 to 127 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Small investors were buying some stocks, but gingerly, and only shares in well 
known companies that could do well in a rising economy or are expected to 
report stellar earnings for the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess investors have been trained to buy the dip. It's almost mystical," 
said Bob Doll, director of equity investments at Oppenheimer Co. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, some portfolio managers said they were making selective 
purchases or drawing up shopping lists for when the stock market stabilizes 
further. Some experts were not convinced the market had touched bottom Monday, 
however, as the Dow closed at a five-month low of 3,593. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets closed generally higher. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei average 
ended with a gain of 440.99 points, closing at 19,563.21. Share prices on the 
Frankfurt bourse closed with solid gains. The DAX-30 ended 25.18 points higher 
at 2,158.29. In London, the Financial Times 100 average closed with a gain of 
29.8 points, at 3,116.3. Mexico's Bolsa index fell 31.34 points to 2,234.15, 
amid nervousness over the murder of the ruling party's presidential candidate.

ABRAMSON TO DEFEND ERIK MENENDEZ; COURTS: JUDGE ASSIGNS ATTORNEY FOR THE 
RETRIAL IN THE MURDER CASE. HE SETS AN ANNUAL FEE OF $125,000, HALF OF WHAT SHE 
HAD ONCE SOUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring that it is in the public interest to pay defense lawyer Leslie 
Abramson $125,000 a year in taxpayer funds to defend accused murderer Erik 
Menendez, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday reversed a ruling and 
appointed her to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Cecil J. Mills, who last month denied Abramson's request for a $100 
hourly fee to handle the retrial, on Tuesday approved an unusual deal to pay 
her an annual fee. It would cost less to do that, the judge said, than assign 
the case to the public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 An experienced deputy public defender handling a death penalty case would earn 
$125,483 annually. Abramson said she would take a few hundred dollars less -- 
$125,000. She also agreed that she would be paid one-twelfth of that each month 
and that the $10,416.66 monthly checks will stop the month the case concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you want to call it, we're talking dollars and cents," said Mills, 
known statewide for limiting lawyer fees in death penalty cases. Moments later, 
standing at the side of the bench, he and Abramson shook hands on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Abramson seemed ambivalent. "It isn't very much," she said of 
the fee. She also proclaimed herself the "cheapest famous lawyer in the entire 
world at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "I cannot walk away from this client." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez, 23, and Lyle Menendez, 26, are charged with murder in the Aug. 
20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, a wealthy 
entertainment industry executive, and Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 At the brothers' first trial, theytestified that they killed their parents in 
fear and self-defense after years of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. 
Prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty, contend that the brothers 
killed out of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial ended in January when separate juries, one for each brother, 
deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors vowed a retrial. Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. 
Weisberg, who presided over the first trial and still is in charge of the case, 
has scheduled an April 15 hearing to set a new trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 Probate records indicate that the Menendez estate, once valued at $14.5 
million, has essentially been run through. Without money, the brothers have no 
way to pay lawyers for the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 At a March 9 hearing, Mills, who supervises the county's criminal courts, 
appointed two deputy public defenders, Bill Weiss and Terri Towery, to defend 
Lyle Menendez. His chief lawyer at the first trial, Jill Lansing, had announced 
that she wanted to spend more time with a young daughter and Lyle Menendez said 
in court that day that the change was acceptable.  
</P>
<P>
 At that same hearing, Abramson said she wanted to stay on the case. But, 
unlike his brother, Erik Menendez said it would not be OK to change lawyers. He 
told the judge: "I don't feel I could open up to another attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills turned down Abramson's request for $100 per hour, up to a cap of 
$250,000, in taxpayer funds. He said she still had a valid contract to defend 
Erik Menendez and remained bound by it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Abramson has been paid $790,000 on the case. Of 
that, $140,000 was in court costs, meaning she has earned $650,000 in legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after that March 9 hearing, Abramson filed legal papers asking 
Mills to reconsider, again asking for $100 an hour but omitting any mention of 
a $250,000 cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying her papers was a statement from Erik Menendez that said he had 
reconsidered and it was OK for Abramson to be relieved -- if she was not going 
to be paid.  
</P>
<P>
 The younger brother's change of heart turned the hearing Tuesday into a 
two-step process. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Mills formally relieved Abramson from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the judge had to decide whom to officially appoint to be the younger 
brother's lawyer: Abramson at taxpayers' expense or the recently created 
alternate public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the potential for conflict of interest, the public defender's 
office could not represent both brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he was inclined to appoint Abramson because she was familiar 
with the case. But he could not pay her by the hour, he said. In 1992, the 
County Board of Supervisors adopted a cost-saving policy that pays private 
attorneys in death penalty cases a flat fee instead of by the hour.  
</P>
<P>
 For the retrial, Mills said, he was prepared to offer Abramson a flat fee of 
$125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That was unacceptable, she said. But, she said, she was willing to take 
$125,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The new offer, Mills said, was enough to have "calmed the raging lion."  
</P>
<P>
 Just to make sure of the terms, he reminded her: "If it should go away one 
month from now, you'd get one-twelfth of that annual fee." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it should go away one month from now," she replied, "I'd probably be so 
happy that I'd pay the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly payments begin next month, Abramson said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever money she receives in defense fund donations from supporters of the 
Menendez brothers, about $30,000 so far, will pay paralegals, law clerks, 
expert witness fees and other court costs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson also told reporters that it seems likely that the retrial will not 
begin for a year. Lyle Menendez's lawyers will probably need that long to get 
up to speed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the months go by, Abramson was asked, wasn't it possible that she could 
rack up the $250,000 fee she had originally asked for? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Abramson replied. "But the hard way."

EXECUTIVE JOINS SCHOOL DISTRICT IN NO. 3 POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Sid Thompson, seeking to bring new 
vision to his administration, has appointed a retired Arco executive as the 
business and finance czar of the nation's second-largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Magee, 56, was controller and a vice president for the Atlantic 
Richfield Co. for six years and oversaw all financial, legal and public affairs 
for the Arco Chemical Co. He will become the No. 3 man in the district 
hierarchy, after Thompson and Deputy Supt. Ruben Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee is the only outsider that Thompson has brought into his close circle of 
senior staff. He will be paid $109,000 a year in a contract that extends -- 
like Thompson's -- until June, 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 The veteran executive faces massive challenges, including the task of 
streamlining the district's maze of centrally run business and budget 
operations -- considered critical to the district's restructuring efforts. The 
aim is to create a single computerized financial system so that schools can do 
their own budgeting, purchasing and staff hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major appointment and represents a major change in how this system 
will operate," Thompson said. "I want a different vision and I want someone to 
show us a different way of doing things. . . . I need someone with a totally 
different view." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee, who commanded a substantially higher salary at Arco, said he took the 
job because "it came at a time in my life when I was looking for an opportunity 
to contribute to the world in general. . . . I had been retired for four years 
and I was feeling a little guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is not looking to shake up the staff, but instead to turn the 
district's management practices into a state-of-the-art operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall there are a lot of good people here, but in some areas because of 
underfunding we are still catching up," he said. "They had rotary phones up 
until a short period ago -- that's where we are with technology. . . . I want 
to get them closer to today's technology and provide an outside financial view 
of their accounting." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee's appointment is in keeping with a key recommendation from a scathing 
management audit in June, which said the district's budget process is unduly 
complex and its business divisions cannot provide even basic information -- 
such as the number of employees -- in a timely, consistent manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit by Arthur Andersen & Co. called for eliminating excessive management 
layers by combining the district's six major business divisions under one head, 
who would report directly to Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Wycoff, president emeritus of Arco, and Roy Anderson, president 
emeritus of Lockheed, strongly encouraged Thompson to hire an outside business 
expert to undertake the task and arranged a meeting between the superintendent 
and Magee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was (Anderson and Wycoff) who came up with Magee," Thompson said. "We 
talked about who might be best and, lo and behold, I was informed by them there 
was someone available." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee is considered a business planning and control expert and came out of 
early retirement not for the money "but for the challenge," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two school employee union leaders, who are often quick to criticize district 
decisions, called the decision to hire Magee a step in the right direction and 
agreed that an outside business expert was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein said Magee could be the 
district's "last best hope" and that the union will closely monitor his 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are sick and tired of the way things operate around here," 
Bernstein said. "If he can get things done and more efficiently, then we're on 
the right track. If he's just one more 'yes' man to lead the district in its 
status quo, that will be something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Brent, president of the administrators union, Associated Administrators of 
Los Angeles, said the district needs its computer system upgraded and that the 
district must run its business divisions more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proof of the pudding will be what happens, what he gets done," Brent 
said. "I'm waiting to see what he comes up with."

OFFICERS SAY THEY HAVE GOOD REASONS TO LIVE OUTSIDE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officer John Francois does not live in Los Angeles -- the city in which he 
fights crime -- for what he considers two good reasons: his own safety and the 
high cost of housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But those reasons put him at odds with the American Civil Liberties Union, 
which reported last week that 83.1% of Los Angeles Police Department officers 
live outside the city, particularly in the northern Los Angeles County suburbs 
of Santa Clarita, Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 These officers lack strong ties to the ethnically diverse neighborhoods they 
patrol, partly because they live in distant, predominantly white suburbs, the 
ACLU study said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Francois, 26, a patrol officer in the northeast San Fernando Valley, is 
not impressed by the ACLU's findings. He is one of about 1,000 of the LAPD's 
7,658 officers who head home to the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys when 
their work shifts end -- and do not apologize for it. 
</P>
<P>
 By living in Lancaster, Francois said, he avoids potential danger, such as the 
death threat from a gang member who recognized him in his old neighborhood. The 
youth also threatened his mother, who lived nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Francois said he could only rent an apartment in the San Fernando 
Valley for the mortgage payments he makes on a three-bedroom Antelope Valley 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the ACLU report said that the high percentage of officers living 
in the suburbs contributes to the LAPD's image as an "army of occupation in the 
urban communities" and urged the department to offer incentives to officers who 
move into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "'We're not calling for requirements that the police live in the city," said 
Allan Parachini, the ACLU staff member who prepared the report. "We're saying 
the situation that exists is not optimal. It's a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 By living in the neighborhoods they patrol, the officers would offer stability 
and reverse anti-police sentiments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois and other officers bristle at such conclusions. They say that where 
they live has no bearing on how well they do their jobs. And they insist that 
living so far from the neighborhoods they patrol does not mean they lack 
dedication to the areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you abandon something you have to face every day?" Francois asked. 
"Why would I enforce the law differently if I lived within the city limits?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU report said that the long distance between LAPD officers' homes and 
their workplaces may have "played a role in compromising responses to major 
emergency incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Several officers who live in northern Los Angeles County acknowledge that they 
have faced longer commutes since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. But they 
say it has not kept them from doing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 They note that one of the first casualties of the earthquake was LAPD Officer 
Clarence Wayne Dean, a Lancaster resident assigned to the San Fernando Valley 
traffic division.  
</P>
<P>
 Dean hopped on his motorcycle and headed for work minutes after the quake and 
well before the start of his shift. He was killed when his motorbike plunged 
off a severed Antelope Valley Freeway overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the quake, LAPD Sgt. Joe Flores made his way through treacherous 
road conditions to get from his Lancaster home to Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up spending several nights in my van, staying near the station," 
Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the officers dispute the ACLU's finding that the north county suburbs, 
with lower housing costs and crime rates, and easy freeway access to Los 
Angeles, are home to an usually large number of law officers.  
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU found that 687 LAPD officers live in Santa Clarita Valley ZIP code 
areas. Two ZIP codes covering the communities of Canyon Country and Saugus are 
home to nearly 400 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther north, 318 LAPD officers live in the Antelope Valley, the study found. 
One Palmdale ZIP code area had 120 LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the study looked only at the LAPD, northern Los Angeles County -- 
particularly the Santa Clarita Valley -- is also home to many Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies and police officers from cities such as Burbank, 
Glendale and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear a lot of people in this community say that they don't have to walk 
too far outside their door before they see the home of either a policeman, a 
fireman or a deputy sheriff," said Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Warford, who moved to the 
Santa Clarita Valley 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, LAPD Officer Dennis Farnham learned just how popular the area 
is among peace officers when he opened the Cop's Shop, a law enforcement 
uniform and equipment store. Recently, he said, the Canyon Country store rang 
up its 20,000th customer. 
</P>
<P>
 For Francois, the absence of gunshots, whirring police helicopters and other 
urban noise outside his home is a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The silence was so loud when I first moved to Lancaster, that it was a bit 
unnerving," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, 40, a father of three, said he would rather live closer to work but 
cannot afford a house in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU report said the argument about inability to find affordable housing 
is not always valid. In the report, Parachini said that houses in Los Angeles 
neighborhoods such as Atwater Village and Los Feliz are often less expensive 
than similar ones in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officers, particularly those with children, say low crime rates and good 
schools are equally important. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fullerton, an LAPD detective, moved from Sylmar to the Santa Clarita 
Valley in 1981 when he and his wife were planning a family. Gang violence in 
Sylmar was increasing, and Fullerton said he felt unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, a Los Angeles Police Protective League board member, said that many 
officers move outside the city to distance themselves and their families from 
the people they have arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton denied that LAPD officers who move to distant, mostly white suburbs 
are motivated by racism. According to the ACLU report, the LAPD is 57% Anglo, 
but 83% of the officers live outside the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "That means there are a lot of minority officers who have gotten out of the 
city, too," Fullerton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing this flight was one goal of the study. ACLU officials said a 
solution is for the city to offer mortgage assistance and pay incentives to 
officers who choose to live in Los Angeles, particularly in high-crime areas. 
Parachini said that other cities, including Portland, Ore., have launched such 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many police officers remain skeptical. Some ask how the financially 
strapped city could pay for such programs at a time when LAPD officers have 
gone almost three years without a raise.

VALUE OF STREISAND LAND GIFT UNCLEAR; MALIBU: A PARCEL THAT WENT UNSOLD FOR 
$11.9 MILLION IS SAID TO BE WORTH $15 MILLION. THE DISCREPANCY MAY HAVE TAX 
IMPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The asking price for Barbra Streisand's Malibu estate went up by millions of 
dollars just before she gave it to a conservation agency, raising questions 
about an appraisal of the property and the size of the tax break she may get. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gift to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy was announced in 
November, Streisand's agents said the property had been valued at $15 million. 
If the IRS accepts that as the fair market value, Streisand will be able to 
avoid being taxed on as much as $15 million in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the appraisal of the property commissioned by the conservancy failed 
to mention that the property had gone unsold at a price of $11.9 million -- 
which would normally set the top limit of its value. 
</P>
<P>
 The discrepancy may involve an unusual instruction the appraiser said he 
received. Admonished to keep his assignment confidential, the appraiser said he 
did not consult local real estate agents or officials -- although experts say 
such contacts are a key element of appraisal research. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the $11.9 million, the report cited only a listing of $19.5 million 
-- a price that took effect last August, just days before the appraiser was 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraiser, Edward P. Reilly, declined an interview request, saying, "I was 
aware of the $19.5-million listing -- that's as far as I'm going to go. . . . I 
just don't want to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Keenberg, Streisand's business manager, called Streisand's conduct 
impeccable and said she was not trying to gain an unfair tax advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her whole reason for doing what she did was to make a beautiful and generous 
gift to the state of California," Keenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 While declining to discuss specifics of Streisand's tax situation, Keenberg 
said, "The IRS will be the final arbiter of what is right, and (Streisand) will 
abide by whatever decision is made." 
</P>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service is not required to accept a taxpayer's view of 
the value of her gift, even if supported by appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The measure of the deduction is the fair market value, and the fair market 
value is what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller," said Rob 
Giannangeli, public affairs officer for the Los Angeles district office of the 
IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand's 22.5-acre retreat in Ramirez Canyon features four houses and a 
caretaker's residence. Conservancy officials said the complex, to be called the 
Streisand Center for Conservancy Studies, will serve as an environmental 
research and conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 When the donation was announced, conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. 
Edmiston described it as one of the three most important gifts of land in the 
Santa Monica Mountains in the past 50 years, along with the 186-acre Will 
Rogers estate and the oceanfront holdings of Leo Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a "splendid piece of property for the use of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, whether its value is $15 million or $10 million," Edmiston said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The property had been on the market since the late 1980s. In August, Streisand 
authorized the conservancy to conduct an appraisal, as it had to do before 
accepting the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one stipulation we wish to put on this is that all information must be 
kept strictly confidential," Streisand's business manager said in an Aug. 27 
letter to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials avoided the normal bidding process and hired Reilly over 
the phone for $11,000. Streisand's agents were in a hurry and Reilly alone 
"responded affirmatively that he could do it within the time required," said 
conservancy Deputy Director Belinda Faustinos. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Reilly on Sept. 2, Faustinos reminded him that "this appraisal 
must be kept strictly confidential." 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly was provided a copy of a real estate advertisement offering the 
property for $19.5 million. However, the Multiple Listing Service -- whose 
comprehensive listings are used by realty agents throughout the Los Angeles 
area -- shows the $19.5-million price took effect in August within days of 
Reilly being hired. From February, 1993, until last August, the asking price, 
according to MLS listings, was $11.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenberg, Streisand's business manager, and David R. Perry, co-listing broker 
on the property, told The Times the $11.9 million was for only a portion of the 
property -- not the entire estate as the listing showed. "Somebody screwed up 
with the damn copy," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was a mistake, however, it was not corrected. The phone book-size 
volumes of MLS listings are updated every two weeks. A check of several volumes 
from March through August consistently showed an $11.9-million price for the 
whole property. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Rose, the co-listing broker, when first interviewed stated that the 
entire estate was offered for $11.9 million. Told that Perry said otherwise, 
Rose replied, "Maybe I haven't remembered it properly." The brokers declined to 
provide documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly's appraisal report, dated Oct. 1, is sprinkled with disclaimers on the 
scope of his research. The "market data investigation was limited in that no 
owners or brokers were contacted to verify sales or building information," 
Reilly wrote on Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "No contact was made with the broker or any other parties due to the fact that 
all information was to be kept strictly confidential," he said on Page 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reilly mentioned the $19.5-million listing at least five times, the 
report did not state that the listing was new. The amount "seems excessive," he 
wrote, but the "broker must have a 'feel' for a value or the property would not 
have been listed." 
</P>
<P>
 Appraisals are based, in part, on data from "comparable sales" of similar land 
in the same area. In the case of such an expensive parcel of land, there are 
rarely many comparisons available. Due perhaps to the limitations of his 
research, Reilly overstated the price of a one comparable sale -- which would 
tend to affect his estimate of the Streisand property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Reilly's report, an oceanfront estate sold by celebrities Julie 
Andrews and Blake Edwards brought a price of $11.5 million to $11.9 million in 
December, 1991. However, the Los Angeles County assessor's office and sources 
familiar with the sale said the actual price was $9 million -- or about 25% 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob West, director of the state Office of Real Estate Appraisers, a licensing 
body, said an order not to contact local brokers should be "a red flag to any 
appraiser (that) the analysis is going to be limited because the scope of 
research and data is going to be limited." 
</P>
<P>
 An appraiser with experience in the Santa Monica Mountains who did not wish to 
be identified said he "would resist an appraisal assignment where they didn't 
want me to talk to any brokers. . . . To be told not to do that certainly 
cripples your investigation."  
</P>
<P>
 The Streisand appraisal was reviewed within the state Department of General 
Services. Robert D. Meier, a senior real estate officer with the department, 
said he reviewed the report for form and content, but did not independently 
investigate market data. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said the tax treatment of the gift is between Streisand 
and the IRS. Faustinos said the reason Reilly was told to keep the assignment 
confidential was because "if word got out about it, basically Ms. Streisand 
would pull out of the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Faustinos said, Reilly was not explicitly told to avoid speaking 
to brokers. The assignment "had to be kept strictly confidential, and he used 
his own independent judgment about what that meant." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate appraisals customarily are publicly available once land transfers 
to a public agency. When The Times sought a copy of the Streisand appraisal, 
conservancy officials agreed -- but then reversed themselves under pressure 
from Streisand's agents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Dec. 28 note to Edmiston, Keenberg said the report could not be released 
because Streisand intended to attach it to her tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must, therefore, vociferously deny your request to release this document 
to anyone," Keenberg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy then obtained a legal opinion from the state attorney 
general's office supporting the decision to withhold the appraisal. But the 
conservancy changed its mind and surrendered a copy after discussions between 
lawyers for the state and for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenberg said she tried to keep the appraisal under wraps only because "Ms. 
Streisand is a very private person." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, confusion has surfaced in recent weeks about the actual size of the 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials and a Streisand spokesman last November said the gift 
involved the whole acreage and all five of the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, however, the actual deed transferred 20.5 acres and the four 
main houses -- omitting two acres and the caretaker's residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said "sensitive negotiations" are under way to resolve a 
"misunderstanding" about the caretaker's parcel. He said the conservancy may 
yet obtain it by purchase or donation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LYNWOOD; LATINO GROUPS 
URGE PROBE BY D.A. IN GROCERY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives were deciding whether criminal 
charges should be filed against a Korean American grocer who wounded a teen-age 
shoplifting suspect, several Latino groups pressed Tuesday for a full 
investigation of the incident by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe should begin immediately to prevent Saturday's incident in Lynwood 
from becoming "another Latasha Harlins situation," said Armando Soto Mayor, a 
spokesman for a coalition of groups called Chicanos Unidos. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocer Michael Kim told investigators he chased and shot the unidentified 
14-year-old after the boy fled the market with a bag of cookies and then 
reached for what Kim thought was a weapon. The boy was in stable condition with 
a chest wound at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident has been compared by some to the fatal 1991 shooting of 
15-year-old Latasha Harlins by Korean-born grocer Soon Ja Du after the girl 
appeared to be stealing orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't shoot a 14-year-old boy over a 49-cent bag of cookies," Mayor, a 
paralegal from South-Central Los Angeles, said at a news conference outside the 
Criminal Courts building in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Others protesting Tuesday included Art Pulida, who leads a northeast Los 
Angeles ethnic equality group and demanded that Korean American merchants treat 
customers with "more respect."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CATALINA; WOMAN KILLED 
AS PLANE CRASHES, SETS OFF BRUSH FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A light plane crashed Tuesday night in a patch of rugged chaparral on Santa 
Catalina Island, killing at least one occupant and igniting a quarter-acre 
brush fire that was visible for miles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Burt Lyon said the crash was reported at 
7:11 p.m. in the Big Springs area of the island about 3 1/2 miles west of the 
Catalina-Avalon Airport. A woman's body was found in the Cessna's wreckage two 
hours later as paramedics searched for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Springs area is in the center of land owned by the Santa Catalina 
Island Conservancy. The cause of the crash was not immediately determined.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY CALLS 
WITNESSES TO REBUT KING'S TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city opened its defense in Rodney G. King's multimillion-dollar civil 
lawsuit by calling witnesses to rebut King's testimony about his troubled past 
and his version of events surrounding his beating by police three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tai Suck Baik, who spoke through a Korean interpreter, testified that King 
threatened him with a tire iron during a Nov. 3, 1989, robbery at his Monterey 
Park market.King, who spent two years in prison after pleading guilty to the 
robbery, testified earlier that he had only thrown pies at the grocer and 
pleaded guilty because he could not afford a lawyer to fight the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Robert Troy disputed earlier testimony by King's mother, 
Odessa King, who said her son told her that racial epithets were hurled at him 
during the beating he received from Los Angeles police. And David Denkins, a 
former sheriff's deputy now with the Montebello Police Department, said he 
recalled King telling him that his beating was not racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has conceded liability for the beating and the trial is being held to 
determine compensatory damages owed by the city and punitive damages that could 
be levied against individuals. The city tried to settle for $1.25 million; 
King's lawyers wanted $9.5 million.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNSELOR DIES AFTER 
ATTACK BY 2 IN ESCAPE ATTEMPT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A juvenile detention center counselor who was bludgeoned with a metal table 
leg during an attempted escape died early Tuesday as a result of his injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Garcia, 58, of Los Angeles died at Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center, where he had been on life support since Monday night, sheriff's Deputy 
George Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Garcia was jumped shortly after 1 a.m. Monday, when a 
teen-ager knocked on his door at the Dorothy Kirby Juvenile Detention Center in 
the City of Commerce and asked to use the bathroom. The youth then beat Garcia 
unconscious before fleeing with another teen-ager, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two runaways were captured shortly after the attack in a railroad yard not 
far from the facility. Detectives said they have denied committing the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths are being held at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall for investigation of 
murder, Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys, ages 16 and 17, were being held at the detention center at the time 
of the attack for investigation of burglary and possession of a deadly weapon, 
sheriff's deputies said. One youth was also being held for investigation of 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the boys, whose names were not released because of their 
ages, had been planning to run away to Colorado. Center director Mary Dederick 
said staffers at the facility were unaware of any such plans before the escape 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Dederick said the incident was the first such act of violence in more than 30 
years at the facility. Operated by the county Probation Department, the highly 
regarded center is the county's only locked treatment facility for emotionally 
disturbed teen-agers who have committed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 youths, charged with crimes ranging from burglary to murder, receive 
schooling and daily therapy while they live in dormitories on a campus 
surrounded by a 13 1/2-foot wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The center -- which has narrowly escaped closure several times in recent years 
as county supervisors have sought budget cuts -- has been lauded for its low 
recidivism rates and intensive psychological treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, a 17-year veteran of the Kirby center who was married and had 
children, was one of about 10 night staffers, each of whom was responsible for 
one or more of the 10 cottages on the center's grounds. Dederick said each of 
the cottages can accommodate 10 residents, but would not say how many children 
were under Garcia's watch. During the day, Dederick said, the level of 
supervision is higher, with about 15 staffers overseeing the center. 
</P>
<P>
 A former employee of the center said the facility is equipped with security 
monitors in case of emergency, but Dederick would not comment on how the attack 
occurred. She noted that another 16-year-old resident found help for Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Probation Department's handling of juvenile offenders have 
raised questions about staffing levels at the facility and the effect budget 
cuts might have had on the center's security. But Dederick said it is unclear 
how the attack might have been prevented. SHAWN HUBLER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TOSSING AND TURNING; 
BALANCING ACT IS A HIT AT CHILDREN'S MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her job has its ups and downs, Laura Green admits. 
</P>
<P>
 But what else can you expect when you are trying to teach 50 squirmy 
schoolchildren how to twirl plates on sticks and catch flower pots flying 
through the air? 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, you want to make certain each child gets a fling at it. On the 
other hand, you do not want all that flinging to result in poked eyes or 
smashed heads. Especially your own. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone knows how to strike the right balance, though, she does. That's 
because Laura Green is the Juggling Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades the 43-year-old Westside resident has been teaching 
youngsters how to keep bowling pins, baseballs and household items in the air. 
Some years she helps as many as 10,000 schoolchildren try their hand at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Green is at the Los Angeles Children's Museum through Friday, teaching 
juggling at noon and 2 p.m. Everything else may be flying, but she keeps a firm 
grip on the kids' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your right hand throws up and then your left hand throws up," she explained 
Tuesday, tossing two rubber balls skyward. "You throw up, throw up, throw up, 
throw up." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a slight pause, then Green asked: "How many of you can throw up?" 
</P>
<P>
 The kids howled with laughter at the joke. But they turned serious when it 
came time for their own plate-twirling, peacock-feather balancing, flower 
pot-catching and juggling of scarves and balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Green demonstrated each trick, showing the wide-eyed youngsters how to start 
the plates spinning and how to toss balls upward and catch them with a smooth 
downward motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the air was full of excited screams and flying objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Camacho, 10, of Pasadena quickly lost one of her juggling balls when it 
bounced under the museum meeting room's bleachers. The plastic plate wobbling 
on the end of the stick being waved by Brianna Roth, 10, of Alta Loma sailed 
into the seats and landed in the lap of Ryan Parents, 7 of Redlands -- who was 
waiting his turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are we doing?" Green asked amid the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not so good," replied Mark Quillen, 10, of Redlands as his plate fell and 
rolled between another juggler's legs. Mark retrieved the plate and Green 
helped him get it spinning again. Soon he was trying to balance the stick and 
twirling plate on his knee, circus-style. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room, Kristin Gardner tried to toss a plastic flower pot from hand 
to hand, hoping to catch it in two other pots she was clutching. She missed -- 
but her pot dropped miraculously into a pot held a few feet away by Cassie 
Wilson, 9, of Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who serves as championships director of the 4,000-member International 
Jugglers Assn., said juggling is a perfect activity for kids. "It's 
non-competitive and non-sexist. Boys and girls do it equally well." 
</P>
<P>
 More important, it puts smiles on faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember," Green said, tossing one final piece of advice the kids' way. 
"There's much call in this world for people who do silly things." BOB POOL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SCHOOL 
DISTRICT SUED BY TRUMP FOR $100 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entrepreneur Donald Trump, owner of the Ambassador Hotel site, sued the Los 
Angeles Unified School District for $100 million Tuesday, claiming that the 
district unfairly tied up the land while considering it as a site for a high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that the land has been devalued because Trump lost 
opportunities to commercially develop the site after the district began eminent 
domain proceedings in 1990.The district took the action after failing to reach 
agreement with Trump on a sales price. 
</P>
<P>
 School district lawyer Richard Mason said the Trump suit has "no legal merit. 
We are not responsible for the decline in the real estate market." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, comes on the heels of a 
district decision to drop its bid to buy the land, citing its own tight 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump is also seeking to keep a $48-million deposit the district paid him 
while the issue is settled in court, said Bert Fields, attorney for 
Trump-Wilshire Associates.

DEATH THREATS CLOSE COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT OFFICE; REVITALIZATION: AGENCY 
PLANS TO REOPEN NORTH HOLLYWOOD FACILITY AFTER IMPROVING SECURITY. ANGER 
DEVELOPS OVER ADVISORY PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to death threats that culminated in the arrival of a hearse, the Los 
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency has temporarily closed its North 
Hollywood office and relocated frightened staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, whose efforts to revitalize North Hollywood have been 
controversial for more than a decade, plans to reopen the office on Vineland 
Avenue this week after improving security for the four employees based there, a 
spokesman said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating the bizarre case, which unfolded last month after 
pro- and anti-redevelopment forces clashed in their annual battle for control 
of a citizens panel that wields considerable power over the 740-acre project. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began with a series of telephone calls from a man who criticized the 
agency for erecting "tall buildings" and then threatened to kill Lillian 
Burkenheim, the CRA's North Hollywood project manager, Burkenheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkenheim also began receiving mailed brochures offering burial plots and 
services, she said. Then, a taxi driver arrived saying he had been called to 
pick her up and take her to Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuary. A limousine 
company called to confirm a reservation that someone had placed in her name for 
the same destination.  
</P>
<P>
 The final straw, Burkenheim said, was when a black hearse pulled up at the 
agency. She said the driver told her someone impersonating a paramedic had 
called the hearse to the scene of the "crime" to pick up her body, prompting 
the CRA to close the office March 25, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, this is an attack on the office," Burkenheim said. "A redevelopment 
agency is an agent of change and that can be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA closed the office over the objections of police detectives, who urged 
officials not to succumb to the harassment, said Los Angeles Police Capt. Rick 
Wahler.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's some people in the neighborhood who don't like the CRA and this gives 
them a little victory," Wahler said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But CRA Administrator Ed Avila said he decided to take the unprecedented step 
out of concern for his employees. He said he is meeting with Wahler today to 
discuss the case further. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila said that among the security measures the CRA is installing in the North 
Hollywood office are an intercom system and a large bullet-resistant glass 
window in the now-windowless building so employees can see anyone approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents and supporters of the redevelopment project condemned the death 
threats as the act of an irrational person. But both groups agreed that the 
threats probably arose out of last month's bitter election battle for 14 seats 
on a citizens advisory panel, known as the Project Advisory Committee or PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 That election resulted in a tie for two crucial seats on the 25-member board, 
so its final outcome will be decided Tuesday by the other 23 board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens panel has had a long history of confrontations, which has 
resulted in rancorous meetings and on at least one occasion erupted into a 
fistfight at a public meeting. Anti-redevelopment forces on the panel have 
accused the CRA of catering to developers and wasting taxpayer money, while 
supporters say the agency has provided housing and new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're shocked about the threats, but not terribly surprised," said James 
Mahfet, executive director of the North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, who is a 
PAC member and redevelopment supporter. "There has been an emotionally charged 
atmosphere of hostility for years."  
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Weller, a PAC member and longtime opponent of redevelopment, also 
attributed the threats to the project's acrimonious history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying anybody should do this," Weller said, "but people are very 
angry over redevelopment."

PRESSURE ALLEGED ON STATE LOAN; CAL-MORTGAGE: FORMER OFFICIAL TELLS ASSEMBLY 
COMMITTEE OF VOTING MANIPULATION ON LOAN GUARANTEE FOR TRIAD HEALTH CARE 
OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The former head of a state loan guarantee program testified Tuesday that his 
boss manipulated the voting majority on a key advisory committee in order to 
push through a controversial $167-million loan guarantee in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipient of the guarantee was Triad Healthcare of Encino, which has 
defaulted and filed for federal bankruptcy protection. Because the loan was 
guaranteed by the state, taxpayers are potentially liable for Triad's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. McManus, chief of the Cal-Mortgage program from 1986 through 1991, 
told the Assembly Health Committee on Tuesday that he opposed granting a loan 
guarantee to Triad, but he felt pressured by the head of Cal-Mortgage's parent 
agency, Larry G. Meeks, to withdraw his objections. 
</P>
<P>
 McManus said that when Meeks learned that a majority of Cal-Mortgage's 
advisory loan committee was also opposed, he took the unprecedented step of 
ordering McManus and another Cal-Mortgage employee on the committee to abstain 
from voting on Triad's application. 
</P>
<P>
 That eliminated two "no" votes, McManus said, and cleared the way for a 
favorable loan committee decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks, who also testified Tuesday, said he did not remember that conversation 
with McManus, but added that it could have taken place. He disagreed with 
McManus' conclusion that Meeks was trying to eliminate staff opposition to 
Triad's application. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, Meeks said he approved the loan guarantee for Triad on the 
basis of favorable recommendations by McManus and Cal-Mortgage's advisory loan 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 McManus, now retired, contradicted his former boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never recommended that that project be approved," McManus said in response 
to questioning by committee Chairman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 McManus said Meeks had known of his opposition and had reacted angrily, 
chastising McManus for erecting "roadblocks" to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, McManus said he acquiesced to the wishes of his boss, abstaining 
from the loan committee vote, and obeying Meeks' order that he instruct the 
other Cal-Mortgage employee, staff architect Richard Hoisington, to do 
likewise. "I just felt sort of defeated," McManus said. 
</P>
<P>
 McManus' testimony came in the second hearing in two months called by the 
Assembly Health Committee to investigate possible conflicts of interest and 
ethical breaches in the handling of Triad's loan guarantee application. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other issues, the committee is looking into the role of a member of 
Cal-Mortgage's loan committee who also was the broker on Triad's loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in December that the loan committee member, Vincent F. 
Forte, a vice president of the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs & Co., 
helped his firm earn $2.4 million in commissions by negotiating the loan 
guarantee for Triad. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Triad was his client, Forte abstained from the vote. At the time, 
Cal-Mortgage policy did not prohibit loan committee members from representing 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin has since introduced legislation that would bar state employees and 
appointees from representing clients before their agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Margolin, Meeks disclosed that Forte spoke to him 
privately about Triad's loan guarantee application as did Stuart Marylander, 
Triad's president. But Meeks repeatedly rejected Margolin's suggestion that he 
was influenced by the conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Forte and Marylander did not appear Tuesday, but testified at an earlier 
hearing that they believed their conduct in the Triad transaction was proper. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad's loan guarantee was the largest ever granted by Cal-Mortgage, which for 
25 years has helped nonprofit health care companies qualify for low-interest 
construction loans. The default has effectively shut down the program.

GARCETTI GETS EXTENSION ON SAVING SPECIAL UNIT; BUDGET: DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS 
GRANTED A DELAY TO RESOLVE A FUNDING SHORTFALL. HE OBJECTS TO APPOINTMENT OF AN 
OUTSIDE NEGOTIATOR TO TRY TO SAVE ENVIRONMENTAL DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti objected to having a private lawyer explore 
ways to save a special environmental crimes unit, the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors on Thursday delayed action on the plan to give him time to 
resolve the underlying budget issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina introduced a motion to authorize Barry C. Groveman to 
negotiate with state, federal and local agencies to find ways to maintain the 
district attorney's unit that prosecutes felony cases against companies that 
violate environmental and workplace safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti has strongly opposed the arrangement. In a letter to supervisors, he 
said it would raise serious questions of propriety because Groveman has 
"regularly represented defendants charged by this office with criminal 
environmental law violations, including felony violations" in his practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The board delayed a vote on the motion for a week to give Garcetti time to 
work out a budget plan that would be satisfactory to him and the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Groveman, a prominent environmental lawyer, volunteered for the task last 
month during a radio talk show discussion of Garcetti's decision to trim 
several special units. Garcetti said attrition and budget constraints have 
forced him to transfer lawyers from those units to divisions that prosecute 
street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He has contended that the only way to save the units is for supervisors to 
lift a hiring freeze and rescind a requirement that he stay within his 
allocated budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental crime and workplace unit stopped taking new cases March 21. 
Other units that have been trimmed include the major fraud and workers' 
compensation units. Garcetti has said he will close down the units by July 1 if 
he does not get the money and personnel he is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Groveman, appearing before supervisors Tuesday, said that reviewing 
alternatives to closing the unit and reporting to supervisors on his findings 
did not present a conflict of interest. He said Garcetti's objections were "a 
facade over a stalemated budget process" and a "smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
 He said alternatives he would propose, such as trimming the unit's staff and 
deputizing prosecutors from other agencies to handle cases, would not cost 
Garcetti's office or the county any money. 
</P>
<P>
 As the board conducted its hearing, Garcetti met with representatives of the 
state attorney general's office, the city attorney's office and several private 
attorneys to discuss ways to save all the special units. After he finished 
testifying, Groveman joined the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things do no work out with supervisors in a week we'll get this group or 
another group together to see if they can be of any assistance in solving the 
problems," Garcetti said after his meeting. "The question is how we get the 
resources to prosecute violent crime and environmental crime and major fraud 
and all the others. It's a much larger problem than just environmental crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Groveman note that he helped create the environmental crimes 
unit when he was a special assistant district attorney under former Dist. Atty. 
Ira Reiner. He also is the author of Proposition 65, considered one of the 
toughest environmental crimes laws in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the unit from the inside and from the outside," said Dennis Zane, 
executive director of the Clean Air Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich said Groveman had a "confrontational attitude" and 
expressed reservations about how effectively he could work with Garcetti.  
</P>
<P>
 Molina said she was willing to have the other supervisors appoint parties to 
sit on a panel with Groveman and present a report to the board within 30 days.

COUNTY TO LOOK FOR REVENUES TO CLOSE GAP OF $900 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signaling a reluctance to make broad-based deep cuts in county services, the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a plan to explore 
ways of generating new revenues to close a $900-million budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed, hired last year in part on her 
ability to push through deep spending cuts, has prescribed a budget that would 
reduce departmental expenditures by an average of 36%. Senior managers, in 
response, say the cuts would devastate county government, force thousands of 
layoffs and subject the county to possible lawsuits and threats of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Joseph Van Der Meulen, vice president for health affairs at USC, told 
the board that if the county were to close County-USC Medical Center to cut 
costs -- as has been hinted -- the university could be forced to close its 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 But supervisors said there might be another way, by building a broad coalition 
with labor and advocacy groups and other community representatives to reduce 
the impact of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's new strategy includes asking county department heads to come up 
with new revenue-generating ideas -- such as utilizing untapped federal funds, 
establishing a county-community task force to lobby support from Sacramento, 
and putting off some liabilities -- such as deferred overtime and worker's 
compensation -- now included in this year's budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's initiative was brought by Supervisors Ed Edelman and Gloria Molina 
and supported by Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Deane Dana. Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich opposed the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the cuts that are now being proposed were to take place it would leave the 
county in a devastated position," Edelman said. "I was concerned that we give 
some direction right away to the CAO on how we intend to proceed with this 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman suggested that the board may consider raising some of the taxes it has 
under its authority in unincorporated territory, such as business licenses and 
sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The board directed Reed to return in three weeks with new budget options.

COMMISSION CLEARS WAY FOR POLICE COMPLAINT-TRACKING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than two years of debate and delay, the Los Angeles Police 
Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to dip into its own budget to pay for a 
computer system that will track complaints against police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission authorized the expenditure of $39,000 for what is known as 
OBITS -- the Officer Behavioral Indicator Tracking System.Development of the 
system will take months, but William Russell, the commanding officer of the 
LAPD's Support Services Bureau, said he expects it to be complete by the end of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted to see this go forward," said Gary Greenebaum, president of the 
Police Commission. "I wish we could have had it more quickly, but it needs to 
be implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD reform advocates have been urging progress on OBITS ever since the 1991 
report by the Christopher Commission, which examined the use of force by Los 
Angeles police officers. That commission recommended a number of improvements 
in the monitoring of officers, particularly with respect to the use of force 
against suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, City Hall officials have rejected efforts to secure funds for the 
system. Tuesday's vote by the Police Commission finally clears those obstacles 
and allows development of OBITS to begin. In fact, LAPD officials, anticipating 
Tuesday's vote, began the process on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a good personnel system," said Police Chief Willie L. Williams, who 
has supported OBITS despite the reservations of some officers, who worry that 
it will catalogue complaints against them without giving adequate weight to 
commendations or other positive aspects of their job performance. "It's 
important that we move ahead with it , " Williams added.

CITY OFFERS POLICE 2% RAISE; COUNTEROFFER LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-delayed negotiations between Los Angeles police officers and the city 
moved ahead Tuesday, as the City Council made its first formal offer of a pay 
raise in the nearly 2-year-old contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The city lawmakers agreed to increase police pay 2% in the fiscal year 
beginning July 1 and another 2% the year after that, with an additional 2.5% 
bonus to encourage officers to take patrol assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Police Protective League declined to comment on the 
proposal, but it seemed unlikely to settle the bitter dispute. Police have 
previously asked for more money, 3% annually over three years, and have balked 
at the idea of bonuses for just some officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union board will meet today, but a union press release Tuesday 
signaled the union's intention to make a counteroffer Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's 7,500 police officers have become increasingly frustrated with the 
lack of a contract and pay raise -- inspiring officers to march on City Hall, 
then stage a mass sickout and to post billboards suggesting that residents are 
threatened by the lack of support for police. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and the City Council backed away from an informal pay 
offer after the billboards were installed. The council's action Tuesday came 
only after the union last week removed the billboards, which showed a masked 
assailant pointing a gun at a startled woman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city lawmakers Tuesday also attempted to make their proposal more 
palatable by deferring some decisions on another controversial contract issue 
-- their attempt to simplify police rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some changes would still be made immediately, under the council proposal, such 
as making it easier to transfer officers and return officers to patrol duty 
from detective assignments. But other work rule changes that would speed Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams' efforts to reorganize the department, would be 
delayed until a consultant's report is completed and the issues are negotiated 
with the Police Protective League. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very constraining set of rules that prevent the chief from getting 
the maximum out of officers," said one council member, who asked not to be 
named. "The rules have to go, but it's a question of when and how and in 
exchange for what." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers have said the rules should remain in place so that they are 
protected from vindictive supervisors.

BUDDHA WAS NOT ONE TO SIT AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RIP RENSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buddha's birthday, which comes around this time (April 8 for Japanese 
Buddhists, the full moon in May for most others), is not a holiday I have ever 
noticed much. That is, until last May's full moon, when a friend sang into my 
answering machine, "Happy birthday, dear Buddha, happy birthday tooooo youuuu. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And I couldn't get it out of my head. It perched there, repeating like a 
deranged parrot: Happy birthday, dear Buddha. Well, I didn't mind thinking 
about Buddha. I'm quite delighted someone so wondrous once existed. I just 
don't like songs getting stuck in my psyche. McCartney's "Hope of Deliverance" 
had recently driven me mad for three straight days and nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there the jingle stayed. I heard it while writing, while doing laundry, 
while exercising, while watching "The Price Is Right." I cursed it. I tried 
substituting other tunes, even "Hope of Deliverance." Nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while, I just surrendered. Maybe it was there for a reason. Maybe I 
should listen to the message, as some Buddhists say. Maybe this 
scratched-record excuse for "Buddha-consciousness" was prodding me to do 
something -- perhaps to seek enlightenment in this world of inherent suffering, 
just as Buddha did 2,500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So the next day, I did. I certainly had nothing better to do. My first stop 
was the great Masonic monolith known as the Scottish Rite Auditorium, which was 
hosting a rite neither Scottish nor Masonic: "Millennium Madness -- An 
Evolution Update, Cosmic Conspiracy Game and Gala Ball." 
</P>
<P>
 I'd seen it advertised in the paper. Sure sounded potentially enlightening. I 
strolled into the great hall, beneath grave words etched in gold on marble 
walls: Though I march under the light of sun and of star, and have not hope, I 
am become as stagnant water or a desert sand. I wondered if there were any 
Buddhist Freemasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, I was given written instructions for the "Cosmic Conspiracy Game." My 
job, a slip of paper told me, was to take the role of a "CIA computer hacker" 
but to insist upon inquiry that I was actually a chicken farmer.  
</P>
<P>
 I had a peculiar password to be spoken to other attendees -- variously cast as 
space aliens, time travelers, psychics, Third World dictators, satanists, 
Christians, anarchists, drug smugglers -- in hopes of receiving a desired coded 
response. I don't know how to win the Cosmic Conspiracy Game. I didn't play. 
Poker and Scrabble once or twice a year are about all the competitive spirit I 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I headed directly for the "Evolutionary Update" lectures featuring 
the inventor of the Cosmic game, a kind of philosopher named Robert Anton 
Wilson. Well, he looked a little like Buddha, I thought -- that is, if Buddha 
were dressed for a Sunday afternoon of boccie ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson told a crowd of about 300 that Prince Charles and Ross Perot each have 
large ears, and that one wishes to be king and the other doesn't. He suggested 
that conservative radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh has a crush on First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, terming it potentially "the most touching love story 
since King Kong." He spoke of a religion he invented centering on worship of 
the Greek goddess of discord, Eris. Everyone is a pope in this religion, he 
noted, and all popes instantly excommunicate one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of worshiping discord seemed apt for the late 20th Century, kind of a 
theological cousin of the credo of the film "Dr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned 
to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb." I enjoyed Wilson, but I wasn't sure if I 
was enlightened by him. I left. 
</P>
<P>
 The birthday song came back the next morning, while I was singing in the 
shower. This called for a more serious, even drastic approach. I picked up a 
couple of friends and drove to one of Buddha's very homes, the stupendous Hsi 
Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, the largest Buddhist temple complex in the 
entire Western hemisphere. A place where Kuan-Yin, the goddess of great 
compassion, is said to have appeared above the San Gabriel Mountains in the 
form of a cloud while the temple was being built. I glanced toward the San 
Gabriels to see if she might have returned. Maybe she had, but I couldn't see 
anything through the smog. 
</P>
<P>
 A Buddha's birthday festival was under way in the courtyard among the grand 
temple buildings, with their stunning, pumpkin-colored, curved Chinese rooftops 
sheltering icons the size of Cadillacs. There were fried radish cakes, herbal 
soups and an exhibit of pastoral Chinese watercolors sponsored by March Fong 
Eu.  
</P>
<P>
 We proceeded to the main worshiping hall but stopped abruptly at a sign 
forbidding entry to anyone in shorts. My friends wore very trendy khaki 
knee-length pants, fresh from the Gap. After a moment's hesitation, I told them 
that I didn't think Buddha would mind. He always seemed to be wearing little 
more than a big sheet, anyhow. We entered without being struck by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 Three gigantic, serene icons representing the three manifestations of Buddha 
sat high on the far wall: Bhaisajyaguru, or the "medicine Buddha," to whom 
believers pray for healing; Amitabha, the Buddha of eternal light, said to be 
dwelling in the land of bliss, and Sakyamuni, symbolizing the mortal Buddha who 
once strolled this Earth trying to figure things out.  
</P>
<P>
 They stared unflinchingly ahead, seemingly inhabited by secrets everyone wants 
to know. It was intimidatingly peaceful. Worshipers prayed. Recorded monks 
droned. A little girl in a frilly dress ecstatically bowed her head. 
Enlightenment seemed to hang in the air. Unfortunately, I couldn't seem to hang 
on to any of it. I went back outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was starting to feel frustrated in my quest -- and that the endless jingle 
was just a symptom of an overworked mind -- when I suddenly spied a glass case 
marked "Dharma Words." Inside, I found hundreds of tiny paper scrolls 
containing dharmas, cosmic laws and principles of existence, for a buck apiece. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A dollar for a cosmic law struck me as quite a bargain. I eagerly paid, 
reached in and grabbed one. It read: Wearing out one's sitting mat, not 
applying effort, will the empty mind be realized? After great effort is 
applied, life will be like the flying colors of the peach blossoms in March.  
</P>
<P>
 Wow, it was a message straight from Buddha. That is, if you buy into the 
assumption that fate and random events and God are the same thing. What did it 
mean?  
</P>
<P>
 As near as I can tell, Buddha seemed to be telling me to get off my duff. I'd 
been sitting around too much for his liking, apparently. Well, my sitting mat 
-- my couch -- was rather worse for wear. And I really liked the idea of life 
being like peach blossoms; that would be change. And then, as I mulled all this 
over, I suddenly remembered the words on the Scottish Rite wall about "I am 
become as stagnant water. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably the same message! Hmm. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the birthday song was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Greatly relieved, I drove up to a lovely state park given to California by the 
family of another legendary seeker of wisdom named Will Rogers. You know, the 
writer-actor-cowboy-humorist who found Zen in a lariat.  
</P>
<P>
 I walked past Rogers' rustic, meticulously preserved home-museum -- I suppose 
you could say it is a kind of temple to his memory now -- and up into the Santa 
Monica Mountains. Took a vigorous two-mile hike through the chaparral to a 
place called Inspiration Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Not because I was seeking inspiration, but because Buddha had enlightened me 
to get off my duff.

 Thumb sucking is a normal habit, practiced by one in four children at age 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, parents worry about psychological effects, other kids poking fun and, 
later, huge orthodontic bills. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease those fears, two researchers recently summarized 50 years of research 
in the Journal of Dentistry for Children, offering tips on how and when to end 
the habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumb sucking feels good because it brings back pleasant memories of newborn 
feedings and cuddling, say Brent Larson, a Mayo Clinic orthodontist, and Eric 
Johnson, a former Mayo orthodontic resident. 
</P>
<P>
 By 4, some suggest, thumb sucking should be discouraged. But Larson and 
Johnson propose a more individual approach. First, make sure the habit isn't 
sparked by psychological problems. Next: 
</P>
<P>
 * Let your child know about long-term dental risks. Your dentist could 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Identify prime times during the day for thumb sucking and make it a point to 
praise or reinforce your child then. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teach your child to substitute another habit, such as grasping the thumbs.

TUT, TUT; THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE MYSTERIES OF ANCIENT EGYPT. BUT TO RENOWNED 
EGYPTOLOGIST RICHARD FAZZINI, THE OVER-THE-TOP PYRAMID THEME OF THE LUXOR 
CASINO IN LAS VEGAS IS NOTHING LIKE THE MYSTERIES OF ANCIENT EGYPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He has stood before the Great Pyramid at Giza, excavated at Mendes in the 
northern Nile Delta, studied the tomb of Ramses II in Thebes, and led an 
ongoing expedition to the Precinct of the Goddess Mut at Karnak. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular spring morning, however, Egyptologist Richard A. Fazzini is 
gazing at Luxor -- the new Luxor, the one with a 30-story pyramid of bronzed 
glass towering over a gaudy golden sphinx that emits laser beams from its eyes, 
the one with amusement park-style thrill rides that star an archeologist who 
utters New Age platitudes and has "3-D psychic visions" during solar eclipses. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which begs a question: Just what is Fazzini doing here? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, for starters, he's looking slightly bemused. "No matter how hard we 
try," he said with a shrug, "the public sometimes gets a different idea of 
archeology than archeologists have." 
</P>
<P>
 Fazzini -- who heads the Brooklyn Museum's Egyptian, classical and ancient 
Middle Eastern department -- was in Las Vegas as the guest speaker for the 
Orange County society of the Archaeological Institute of America, which 
organized a field trip to the resort. Society president and founder Norma 
Kershaw admitted that some members of the group figured she had to be joking 
when she proposed the excursion. But the trip was a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
 While bringing archeology buffs to Luxor would seem, on the surface, to make 
about as much sense as sending a paleontology convention to those roadside 
dinosaurs near Palm Springs, the archeology buffs were more than willing to put 
up with the faux-Egyptian touches in return for a little gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, Kershaw said, was "to have an educational weekend while having a 
good time" -- a couple of nights on the Strip, coupled with a morning lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor opened in October, a $375-million "entertainment megastore" with 2,526 
hotel rooms honeycombed along its inward-slanting walls. Contained within the 
towering central atrium are a 100,000-square-foot casino, seven themed 
restaurants and an indoor canal carrying guests on a "Nile cruise." 
</P>
<P>
 Historical consultants helped guide the creation of indoor sculptures and wall 
murals, giving the resort a veneer of authenticity. There's also a painstaking 
recreation of King Tutankhamen's tomb as it was found by Howard Carter and Lord 
Carnavon in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 All the much-hyped attention to historical detail, however, exists alongside 
another vision of ancient Egypt that's pure fantasy. The three-part thrill ride 
puts high-tech film effects at the service of a story line that's a virtual 
grab bag of exotic myths about Egypt, some old (ancient connections to 
Atlantis) and some new (flying machines discovered in a pyramid beneath, um, 
Las Vegas). 
</P>
<P>
 Other fanciful touches include a pair of talking animated camels in the casino 
and an elaborate stage show, "Winds of the Gods," about a Pharaoh whose resting 
place is disturbed by thieves. The show has a very un-Egyptian chariot race as 
its climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor is part of a trend toward family entertainment in Las Vegas, the gaming 
Mecca that in recent years has had to face competition from a steady growth of 
gambling in other parts of the country. It sits next door to Excalibur, with 
its fantasy castle motif, and farther along the Strip are such recent additions 
as the MGM Grand, with its "Wizard of Oz" theme, and the dueling pirates of 
Treasure Island. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fazzini pointed out, Luxor is not the first Las Vegas landmark to "use the 
ancient world as a sort of adult theme park": The enduring Caesars Palace 
looked to ancient Rome when it opened in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 The real-life Luxor is an Egyptian market town that has grown up around the 
southern half of the ruins of the ancient city of Thebes. Architecturally, the 
Las Vegas Luxor is modeled loosely on the Great Pyramid and the Great Sphinx at 
Giza. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor, Fazzini said, is the heir to a long line of "Egyptianizing" buildings, 
his term for structures inspired by the monuments of ancient Egypt. In fact, he 
said, the new resort is probably "the most thoroughly Egyptianizing building in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first to experience an Egyptian craze were the Romans, who conquered Egypt 
in 30 BC. European interest in ancient Egypt was revived during the 
Renaissance, but it was a somewhat skewed vision, Fazzini said, filtered 
through Roman interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe got a truer picture of Egypt in the 18th Century, as an increasing 
number of travelers ventured there and returned with accounts of the pyramids. 
Egyptomania blossomed with the Napoleonic expeditions of 1798 to 1801, in which 
the ruler took an army of scholars along on a military campaign that ultimately 
proved disastrous to his reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in North America, a new nation had been created by the Founding 
Fathers with mystical visions of old Egypt, fed by their ties to Freemasonry. 
The evidence is right there on the back of the dollar bill -- the Great Seal, 
with its steep-sided pyramid topped by an all-seeing eye. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, ancient Egypt has come to be a "vector for symbols," 
representing mystery, wisdom, lost knowledge and immortality, Fazzini said. 
Architectural reminders of an American fascination with Egypt are legion. The 
use of Egyptian-style obelisks for memorial markers, a practice transplanted 
from Europe, was first seen in Baltimore in 1792 and culminated in the 
Washington Monument, dedicated in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazzini's talk was on the history of Egyptomania, the fascination with all 
things Egyptian that started with the Romans and finds its ultimate expression 
in the newly opened Luxor. In addition to his excavations, Fazzini helps to 
oversee one of the world's finest collections of Egyptian antiquities at the 
Brooklyn Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lecture at Luxor, he expressed dry amusement at the resort's 
over-the-top blend of carefully reconstructed authenticity and out-and-out 
fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard for people not to associate Egypt with mystery," he told his 
audience of about 50, crowded into a tiny, unfinished meeting room. "It's 
almost silly to walk around a casino and say, 'Is this accurate?' "  
</P>
<P>
 Fazzini showed slides of a vast array of Egyptian-influence buildings in the 
United States: museums, libraries, insurance offices, Masonic halls, even 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nod to ancient funerary practices, Egyptian touches were common in 
cemeteries through the 1920s, from gateways to memorial markers. One odd little 
marble marker from the 19th Century grouped a Nativity scene with a dog-sized 
sphinx looking lovingly at the baby Jesus; Fazzini described it as "Jesus, Mary 
and Joseph, and their pet sphinx." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when asked if he was bothered that the hotel perpetuates exotic visions 
of Egyptian civilization, Fazzini shook his head and said he takes it in the 
spirit of fun in which it is intended. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this place had a sign out front that said, 'If you take our Nile Cruise, 
you'll never have any need to go to Egypt or visit a museum,' then I'd have a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptomania goes on today, even outside Las Vegas. Memphis, Tenn., because of 
the name connection, has always been Egypt-crazy, even in the post-Elvis era. 
The new city zoo is an elaborate adaptation of Egyptian design, and the new 
sports arena is a pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond architecture, there are other reflections of the craze, including a 
Utah company founded in the 1980s that mummifies its customers, going so far as 
to put a mask of the deceased onto the sarcophagus lid and copyrighting the 
term mummification . 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptomania has become a popular sideline for Fazzini. This month he goes to 
Paris to lecture on the subject, in conjunction with an exhibit on Egyptomania 
on view at the Louvre. It all started, he said after his lecture in Las Vegas, 
when patrons at the Brooklyn Museum began asking him questions about popular 
exotic myths of ancient Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 As a scholar, Fazzini said he had been little aware of the common perceptions 
of Egyptian civilization. He started investigating, taking slides of 
Egyptian-influenced buildings, and haunting flea markets and antique shops in 
search of Egyptian-style posters, lamps, clocks and other curios. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to find it an interesting lecture subject," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The invitation from the Orange County archeological group allowed him his 
first look at Luxor, and he took the opportunity to snap slides for future 
lectures. When asked if the size and scope of the resort was more than he 
expected, he shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I had ever seen the real pyramids, many years ago, that was 
more than I had expected."

A MOVING EXPERIENCE; POETRY: NEW YORKERS LOVE A PROGRAM THAT POSTS VERSES IN 
PUBLIC BUSES AND SUBWAYS. NOW OTHER CITIES, INCLUDING SAN DIEGO, MAY FOLLOW 
SUIT. 
</P>

<P>
 In a society where Howard Stern's innermost thoughts top bestseller lists for 
weeks on end and Danielle Steel triumphs over Jane Austen, the success of 
Poetry in Motion in this city's subways and buses is a pleasant surprise for 
the literary minded. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't expect Americans to become so moved and so excited by poetry," says 
Elise Paschen, director of the Poetry Society of America. "But it turns out 
that they're just gulping it down."  
</P>
<P>
 Soon others in St. Louis, San Diego and the Pioneer Valley north of 
Springfield, Mass., will be able to read Emily Dickinson en route to work: 
</P>
<P>
 Hope is the thing with feathers  
</P>
<P>
 That perches in the soul  
</P>
<P>
 And sings the tune without the words  
</P>
<P>
 And never stops at all. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Such stanzas have appealed to an unusual mix of people, says Neil Neches, the 
New York Transit Authority's coordinator for the program. For example, a nun 
received copies of the posters for a home for the elderly. A 16-year-old girl 
called to say one poem had inspired her to write a story her teacher thought 
was good enough for publication. A minister used one in a Sunday sermon. 
</P>
<P>
 Neches says he receives letters and phone calls from commuters every day, 
thanking him for a break from signs offering a solution to drug addiction or 
foot pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning I read Robert Frost's 'The Armful,' " began one letter from 
Brooklyn. "I have been juggling and preparing to juggle a lot of 
responsibilities lately -- my wife is pregnant and I am in a new job -- so the 
poem spoke to me as both a metaphor and as literal truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry in Motion is "finding culture where you usually find misery, trash and 
indifference," says Mary Dietz, who has a doctorate in English. Dietz says she 
will use Poetry in Motion as an example of how businesses can incorporate the 
arts in everyday life in "The Metropolitan Experience," a course she teaches at 
New York University. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, 1992, the transit authority has selected works by Walt Whitman, 
Marianne Moore and other well-known poets with help from the Poetry Society of 
America. The poems are printed on placards and displayed inside the city's 
6,000 subway cars and 3,700 buses. Fresh verses replace the old ones every five 
or six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in offering poetry to the masses is sprouting nationwide, inspired by 
the effort here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poetry could give riders something to think about, something unusual," says 
Emily Blumenfeld, community program coordinator for Arts in Transit, a group 
that serves as both architect and interior decorator for the new MetroLink 
train system in St. Louis. "We don't want people to say 'yuck,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumenfeld plans to solicit help from the International Writers Center at 
Washington University and the Eugene B. Redmond Writers Club in East St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know a lot more about poetry than I do," she concedes. While the poetry 
is likely to be donated, Blumenfeld hopes the Missouri Arts Council will agree 
to pay production costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A city council member is promoting the idea for San Diego's trolleys and 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like a natural to me," says Ron Roberts, who serves on the city's 
Metropolitan Transit Development Board. "We want to recognize famous poets, but 
also give local people a chance to be published." 
</P>
<P>
 The board wants to have local businesses underwrite the costs of the program, 
scheduled to start in March, Roberts adds. 
</P>
<P>
 An English doctoral student returned home after a visit here with the urge to 
bring Poetry in Motion to western Massachusetts, where there is a five-college 
consortium. "It's not an urban center, but it's an intellectual center," says 
Elizabeth Bachrach Tan, who is finishing her dissertation at the University of 
Massachusetts, one of the five schools linked by bus in the Amherst area. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan was on a subway when Galway Kinnell's "Blackberry Eating" caught her eye. 
"I was there at the time of the Long Island Rail Road killings," Tan recalls. 
"And it was wonderful to encounter Poetry in Motion at such a bleak moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people here see that it can be valuable and enriching for the 
community," she says. First, she must find sponsors of a program that would 
give 20,000 daily bus riders an alternative to advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Although reading during travel is nothing new, an excerpt from John Keats or 
Adrienne Rich can offer a different kind of respite from the daily grind. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the problems we're having, I'm not going to say this will change the 
world," Roberts says. "But it can make an otherwise monotonous routine a little 
more positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "To quote Ralph Waldo Emerson, 'Poetry teaches the enormous force of a few 
words.' Even politicians can learn something from poetry."

DANA PARSONS: TOUGH CRIME QUESTIONS HARD TO ANSWER IN A SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Open letter to San Juan Capistrano Mayor Collene Campbell: 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone else who either knew beforehand about your family's tragedies or 
learned about them from your front-page interview in The Times Tuesday, I 
lament what you've been through. To lose three relatives to murder, including a 
brother and a son, is more than anyone should have to bear. The closest I can 
come to sharing your pain and anger was the murder of an elderly uncle a dozen 
years ago or so. He answered the front door and was shot dead by a stranger, 
while my aunt was on the phone with one of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the trouble with crime. It seems to hit just about everyone; if not 
directly, then as a ripple effect from being the relative of a crime victim. 
Because it hits us all, it seems to me that we have to take a society-wide look 
at it and try to figure out a way -- for everyone's sake -- to reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
 You formed a group called Memories of Victims Everywhere (MOVE), described as 
a victims' rights group. One of the stated goals is to pressure legislators who 
you depict as "soft on crime." That, obviously, is a term whose meaning is in 
the eye of the beholder and is much in vogue these days, what with "three 
strikes and you're out" legislation vying with "one strike and you're out" 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, especially when it arrives at our doorstep, makes us all emotional. I 
wonder if the solutions need be. Cynical lawmakers and politicians will tell 
you to your face that they support you, even while knowing behind your back 
that what you want is impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it satisfies some anger or frustration you and others feel to lock 
people up and throw away the key. Perhaps, too, state Sen. Marian Bergeson and 
Gov. Pete Wilson really believe that first-time sex offenders ought to be 
imprisoned with no chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 What does any of that have to do with "victims' rights"? Who are the victims 
you're talking about? Are they the people directly victimized by the criminal, 
or are they the victims' friends and relatives, wanting to exact revenge to 
ease their suffering? 
</P>
<P>
 If it's the former, we already have a system to address victims' rights. The 
system says that criminals will serve time. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, 
it is not a token punishment to serve eight or 10 or 15 years in prison. It is 
not token punishment when murderers serve a life sentence or decades in prison. 
I agree with you that repeat violent offenders have forfeited their right to 
freedom, but do you really want to send a three-time cat burglar to prison for 
life? 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, victims' rights end up being the "rights" of the surviving 
relatives. Yes, they are secondary victims of the crime, but how can justice be 
dispensed fairly to address them? 
</P>
<P>
 Should a robber or drunk driver who traumatizes a large surviving family get a 
harsher punishment than one who harms someone with no family? While one family 
pleads with a judge to show no mercy to a killer, what if a family asked the 
judge for leniency? Should a judge then take into consideration how the 
respective families feel before handing a sentence? The answer for a judicially 
fair society has to be, no. 
</P>
<P>
 No one with a brain or a heart sympathizes more with the criminal than with 
the victim, but whether we like it or not, criminals are people, too, with 
families and relatives. Pretending they aren't is the ultimate cynicism behind 
the "one-strike" legislation, even for crimes as distasteful as sexual assaults 
or child molestation. If the perpetrator were our brother or uncle or best 
friend, can we really say with honesty we want them incarcerated for life? 
</P>
<P>
 What about the parent whose son kills in the heat of the moment? Does that 
mother's son deserve the same fate as the methodical killer? 
</P>
<P>
 You also condemn the catalogue of prisoners' rights. Doing so hits a nerve, 
but does it help protect our society? 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're prepared to keep everyone who commits any crime in jail for 
life, most prisoners someday will return to society. What purpose does it serve 
to dehumanize inmates? We all have to live with the consequences when they get 
out of prison. Wouldn't we be safer if that person was the semblance of a 
thinking, feeling human being? 
</P>
<P>
 In your heart of hearts, how do you think that can best be done? 
</P>
<P>
 If your answer is that we should imprison every felon for life or some "tough 
on crime" variation, you know the next question. It isn't one that can be 
wished away. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do we build the new prisons, and who will pay for them? 
</P>
<P>
 You hate crime and so do your constituents. Yet, if the Board of Supervisors 
announced tomorrow it was building a jail in your community, your constituents 
would demand that you stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 None of us can do the thing we want most: to undo the crime. All we can do is 
hold the guilty responsible, make sure they serve their time and hope that when 
they get out their impulse isn't to go looking for another victim. 
</P>

MAN, 19, CLEARED OF FELONY CHARGES IN BEACH SHOOTING; COURTS: ALEJANDRO GARCIA 
IS INSTEAD CONVICTED OF FOUR MISDEMEANOR COUNTS IN AUGUST INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court jury Tuesday acquitted a 19-year-old Santa 
Paula man of the most serious charges he faced in connection with a shooting on 
a crowded Ventura beach that alarmed the community last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Garcia was found not guilty of assault with a firearm and grossly 
negligent shooting -- both felony charges that could have led to a 12-year 
prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury did find Garcia guilty of four misdemeanor offenses -- one count each 
of carrying a loaded weapon and carrying a concealed weapon and two counts of 
discharging a weapon in city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had been held at the Ventura County Jail since the Aug. 5 shooting, but 
Judge Charles W. Campbell immediately released him following the verdicts late 
Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred shortly after 10 a.m., when Garcia was confronted by 
members of a Santa Paula gang at San Buenaventura State Beach, according to 
court testimony. No one was injured as gunfire rang out from both sides, 
sending about 200 frightened beach-goers scurrying for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury essentially ruled that Garcia fired to ward off an attack when he 
pulled out his .44 magnum, Deputy Public Defender Todd R. Howeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdicts, jurors invited Garcia into the deliberations room for a 
meeting in which several of them hugged the defendant and the others shook his 
hand, Howeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, they all wished him the best of luck, and they had hopes that he 
would finish his GED (high-school equivalency) and go to college and put this 
behind him," Howeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts marked another defeat in the case for the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, seven people were questioned by police after the shooting, 
including the three suspects at whom Garcia was accused of firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those three suspects were eventually charged, but a judge acquitted a 
juvenile and a grand jury refused to indict a 20-year-old man, saying there was 
not enough evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's 19-year-old cousin, John Sosa, was also charged with being an 
accessory for trying to hide Garcia's gun after the shooting. His trial is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. Gibbons expressed disappointment Tuesday in the 
jury's verdicts, but maintained the investigation into the shooting was solid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed in the outcome of the trial," he said. "I don't agree with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that authorities at first believed Garcia was a gang member -- 
which turned out not to be true. He said the jury was apparently influenced by 
testimony that Garcia had been terrorized by a Santa Paula gang and carried a 
gun only for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think there was a lot of emotional testimony in this thing from the 
defense standpoint," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Howeth said it was clear from the beginning that his client was acting in 
self-defense. He contended that his client aimed for the sand and that no 
beach-goers were in imminent danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really reaffirms one's faith in the jury system," Howeth said. "The news 
media reported that this was gang violence, and the truth is he was never a 
gang member. He was put in a situation where he had to protect himself by 
carrying a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell set sentencing for May 6 on the four misdemeanor convictions. Garcia 
could face up to a year and a half, said Howeth, who will suggest that his 
client has already served enough time in the case.

A STORY TO REMEMBER; SURVIVOR RECALLS HIS RESCUE FROM THE HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a voice halting with emotion, George Rishfeld of Moorpark told a hushed 
audience in Ventura Tuesday how he survived the Holocaust: Fifty years ago, his 
desperate parents tossed their infant son over a barbed-wire fence in Poland, 
into the waiting arms of a 19-year-old Gentile woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose father had worked at Rishfeld's father's factory in Warsaw, 
vowed to raise the baby as her own if his parents did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 But they did return to reclaim their son. And on Tuesday, he told the story to 
more than 300 people crowding the Board of Supervisors' hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember being with a family of strangers who reassured me that everything 
would be OK, that I would see my parents again," he said. "I realize today that 
with every hug and kiss they gave me, they were risking their lives to save a 
Jewish child." 
</P>
<P>
 Rishfeld, now president of a marketing firm in Moorpark, said: "I came to 
believe I was saved from the Holocaust to tell this story so that it would not 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that sort of heroic kindness, along with the horror of the Holocaust 
itself, that the Board of Supervisors commemorated Tuesday to celebrate Yom 
HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, honoring the memories of the 6 million Jews 
who were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an episode of darkness to affect all people," Chief Administrative 
Officer Richard Wittenberg said as he opened the 90-minute program. "But at the 
same time, there was a degree of human kindness, mercy and bravery." 
</P>
<P>
 The board and members of the Jewish community, including all nine of the 
county's rabbis, also honored Denmark for its refusal to allow invading Nazis 
to take its Jewish population to concentration camps. The effort to smuggle 
Danish Jews to safety is credited with saving 8,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Reisman, president of the United Jewish Appeal of Ventura County, 
praised the efforts of the late Danish king, Christian X, and his people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a singular and shining exception" to the genocide of the Holocaust, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To thank the Danish people, Ventura County Jewish children participated in a 
nationwide campaign to write 8,000 letters to Danish Queen Margrethe, 
granddaughter of Christian X. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Cardozo of Balboa Middle School in Ventura was one of three students who 
read their letters aloud Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "During my lifetime I was always taught negative things about the Holocaust," 
Danny read. "Now I know that if the Jewish people ever need a place to go, 
Denmark will be open." 
</P>
<P>
 Reisman presented Danish Consul General Leif Reimann with a ram's horn, called 
a shofar , to thank his people. The shofar, used in ancient times to call 
worshipers to prayer, is now used during High Holy Days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first large-scale human rights rescue in the history of man," 
Reimann said of the Danish effort. "Denmark receives this recognition with 
great humility, but also with great pride." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience of more than 300 people, who lined the walls and spilled into the 
lobby, responded with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Rabbi Alan Greenbaum led a candle-lighting ceremony, in which six 
candles were lit in memory of the 6 million who died. As the candles burned, 
Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren sang the mournful song Ani Ma-amin ("I 
Believe"). Several in the audience sang along. 
</P>
<P>
 The commemoration both opened and closed with a plea to remember the past and 
make sure it is not repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee warned that racism is still present in the world and 
in Ventura County. She cited racially motivated disputes and racist literature 
being circulated on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so afraid that the beginnings of the Holocaust are being sown right 
now," she said. "We all have to do better."

NURSES ARE FORCED TO ACCEPT PAY PACKAGE; HEALTH: SUPERVISORS EXPECT TO SAVE $1 
MILLION A YEAR AT COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER. THE UNION SAYS COST IS TAKING PRIORITY 
OVER PATIENT CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County officials, frustrated after nine months of negotiations, took 
the unprecedented step Tuesday of forcing county nurses to accept a new pay and 
benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite warnings that the contract changes could lead to "crisis staffing" and 
possibly a strike, the Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 to impose the 
compensation cuts on the 334 nurses at Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow we all, including you nurses, have to be able to recognize that we 
are in a difficult situation," said Supervisor Maggie Kildee, citing pressures 
on the health-care industry to reduce costs. "Everyone of us is going to have 
to give something. What happens if we don't have a hospital? What happens if we 
can't afford to keep it open?" 
</P>
<P>
 But nurses argued bitterly that the county is putting financial considerations 
above patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county personnel office, plus the majority of the Board of Supervisors, 
has sent a clear message to the residents of Ventura County that money, not 
quality patient care, is their top priority," said Tammy Gamblin of the 
California Nurses Assn., the union representing county nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the local union voted two weeks ago to authorize a strike, but will 
meet with the full membership before deciding whether to proceed with any labor 
action, Gamblin said. A temporary court order requires the union to give at 
least three days notice. 
</P>
<P>
 What they would really like, said county nurse Sheila Raives, is another 
chance at the negotiating table, if the county would be more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This had quickly become a demand table with the county demanding a concession 
on every point," said Raives, who served on the employee team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nurses are on the front lines," she added. "We, as the care givers, must 
be given a voice in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed McLean, the county's assistant director of personnel, said the nurses had 
their chance to negotiate in the 25 meetings and three mediation sessions that 
have occurred since June. 
</P>
<P>
 The county could eventually reopen talks, but he added: "We've got to see 
significant movement from their last position. Otherwise, it's still a 
stalemate." 
</P>
<P>
 McLean said the county has never imposed an entire pay and benefits package on 
an employee group, but has forced single amendments to a contract. Even though 
the county has voted to impose a new pay package, the contract officially 
remains open to negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The new nurse's package should save the county hospital $1 million a year as 
it cuts some employees' pay by 9.3% by restructuring the pay rate, and gives 
administrators greater flexibility in laying off nurses and sending home 
unneeded workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses say they are willing to work with the county, but found little 
willingness to negotiate. For instance, the employee team was willing to accept 
a plan to send home nurses when the wards were empty, but wanted limits, said 
Helen Horn, a union representative. The employee team also offered to accept a 
3% cut in pay, Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody tries to paint this issue that it's money," Horn said. "If these 
nurses wanted to get rich, they wouldn't work for the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the employees who spoke at Tuesday's meeting expressed concerns that 
cuts would leave them short-staffed and unable to care for patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, layoffs and shift changes have left holes in the system, they said. 
One nurse, Ana Bailey, described a night shift where she was left to monitor 
nine heart patients on her own. A nursing assistant was on duty with her, but 
could not read the electronic monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 During her shift, one of the patients began having trouble, forcing Bailey to 
leave her station and the other eight monitors. "It is not uncommon for the 
situation to be such at the county hospital," Bailey added. "We've all been 
pushed to a degree that we feel it is unsafe for the patients." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital Administrator Pierre Durand denied that staffing problems result in 
unsafe practices at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have standards set up by the state that we have to comply with," he said. 
"We have more health-care providers on duty than any other hospital in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 He called the supervisors courageous for voting to impose a pay package on the 
nurses. "All the adjustments we're making are in line with what hospitals have 
to do to sustain a break-even position," Durand said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone vote against the measure came from Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, who 
said: "I just philosophically cannot vote to unilaterally adopt a contract."

 Eager for a new playground but lacking the money, a Ventura elementary school 
is enlisting the help of hundreds of residents and local businesses to build a 
play area from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanche Reynolds School has hired a New York architectural firm nationally 
known for designing community playgrounds to come to the school today to begin 
work on the project, which will be modeled after a playground in Alameda Park 
in Santa Barbara and about 900 similar play areas around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is, organizers said, that children help design the playground and 
then adults from the community build it. 
</P>
<P>
 But their goal will be to build it in only five days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an old-fashioned barn-raising where everyone comes out, the 
community comes out and creates something in five days," said Blanche Reynolds 
teacher Lisa Hall. "Our idea is to bring back the community into the school 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the playground will be on school property, next to Blanche Reynolds' 
existing playground, it will be open to the public after school and on 
weekends. Organizers hope to build it this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Barbara, more than 4,000 volunteers from all over the city worked 
from 7 in the morning to 10 at night for five days last November to build the 
10,000-square-foot playground in Alameda Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A dense wooden maze of bridges, tunnels, slides and swings, the Santa Barbara 
playground was designed by the same architectural firm of Robert S. Leathers 
and Associates from Ithaca, N.Y., that will draw up the plans for Blanche 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leathers firm has also designed about 900 similar, community-built play 
areas in cities across the nation and in Canada, Australia and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the Santa Barbara playground, sponsored by the local chamber 
of commerce, cost about $320,000 in donated lumber, nails and other materials, 
and $180,000 in cash for the architect's fee and additional supplies, which was 
also raised by the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But organizers at Blanche Reynolds School said they expect their project to 
cost about half that -- or $250,000 -- because it will be less elaborate. They 
will get an estimate on the cost after the architectural plans are drawn up 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, architect Dan Bergevin will visit every class at Blanche 
Reynolds to get children's ideas for the project. He will spend this afternoon 
drawing up plans for the playground and will then meet with the community at 
7:30 p.m. tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although every playground designed by the Leathers firm has essentially the 
same features -- wooden slides, swings and walkways -- the architects get ideas 
from children to add unique details and to determine what to put where. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may say, 'We want a rocket ship and then we want a bridge that goes over 
to a castle,' " said Barry Segal, a vice president for the architectural firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Mentally stimulating and physically challenging, playgrounds designed by the 
Leathers group provide an outlet for children that is sorely needed at Blanche 
Reynolds, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's existing playground is a small assortment of rusty, decades-old 
jungle gyms, monkey bars and slides planted in black rubber mats on a gravel 
lot next to the soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the kindergarten-through-sixth-grade students at the school find the 
playground so uninteresting they choose to stay inside at recess, teachers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets really, really boring," fifth-grader Lauren McPhun said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not enough stuff," fifth-grader Chelsea Rasmussen added. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the cash-strapped Ventura Unified School District lacks the funds to 
pay for a new playground, teachers and parents at Blanche Reynolds said they 
decided to build a new play area themselves after they visited the playground 
in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every parent that's ever been up there says, 'Why don't we have this in 
Ventura?' " said Lori Z, whose 5-year-old son Satch Herrmann is in kindergarten 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers estimate they will need about 1,500 volunteers to build the 
playground. And so far they have only about 50 volunteers, who have raised just 
$2,500, enough to cover a small initial fee and travel expenses for the 
architect. 
</P>
<P>
 But Segal said nearly all communities that have launched such playground 
projects have completed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once built, the only maintenance required for the playgrounds is resealing the 
wood once or twice each year to protect against splintering and weather damage. 
Even with this care, however, the playgrounds deteriorate and have to be torn 
down after 20 to 30 years, Segal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanche Reynolds teachers and parents said they believe the process of 
generating community support for the playground will have its own benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 By helping to build the playground, Ventura residents will "become more 
supportive and involved" with their children, Lori Z said. "It means the 
community cares about what happens to their kids." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura residents will have the opportunity to see the design for the 
playground and learn more about the project at a community meeting with the 
architect at 7:30 tonight at the Blanche Reynolds School auditorium, 450 
Valmore Ave. To help build the playground or help with fund raising, call the 
school at 641-5405.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUPERVISORS CUT FIRE DEPARTMENT JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to save the county up to $1 million and eliminate duplication of 
services, supervisors Tuesday cut eight jobs from the Ventura County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The board stripped the department of its duties inspecting hazardous materials 
and transferred them to the Environmental Health Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The board eliminated: one hazardous materials specialist; one fire prevention 
officer III; five fire prevention officer II positions; two office assistants; 
and a data entry operator. Not all of the positions cut were full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Robert Roper argued that fire prevention is a "best buy" and 
that money for it is well-spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we keep going with fire prevention, we should be able to curb our costs of 
fire suppression," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation was opposed by the Ventura County Firefighters Assn., which 
argued that the county would not save money after it hired and trained new 
people in the Environmental Health Division to do what trained employees are 
already doing in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But supervisors said the cuts, which will be achieved by layoffs and 
attrition, are needed to reduce the cost of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazardous-waste inspectors for the Environmental Health Division are paid less 
than firefighters performing similar duties, officials said. JOANNA M. MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; AUTHORS OFFER ENCOURAGING WORDS TO PUPILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Balan wrote "Jeremy Quacks" -- about a duck who barks, moos and tweets 
but is afraid to quack -- for very young readers.  
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Cocquyt's book about a horse named Freddie who wins the Kentucky Derby 
against all odds is geared toward a more sophisticated crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But the message these two authors brought to elementary school children at 
Bedford Open School in Camarillo on Tuesday was the same: Writing may be fun, 
but getting published can be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Seuss received 26 rejection letters on his first book before a publishing 
company finally said yes, Balan told a group of 22 5- and 6-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine if he decided to stop at 26 'no' letters?" Balan said. "We 
wouldn't have "Green Eggs and Ham" or any of those other great books." 
</P>
<P>
 "I get 'no' letters all the time," said Balan, holding up a file folder 
brimming with rejection letters. "But I also got five 'yes' letters, and those 
became the books you see behind me," the author said, gesturing to other 
picture books he has written. 
</P>
<P>
 Balan and Cocquyt were part of a group of 29 authors that descended upon 
Camarillo's public schools Tuesday to explain why they write -- and to remind 
youngsters that it can be fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators hope that the daylong lectures by the authors will increase 
students' interest in books and maybe spark the stirrings that produce a future 
Laura Ingalls Wilder or Dr. Seuss. And with the state's increasing emphasis on 
literature-based curriculum, teachers are looking for any way to boost interest 
in reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "These visits are wonderful," said Jean Scott, a kindergarten teacher at 
Bedford whose charges listened as Balan read "Jeremy Quacks" and two of his 
other books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the children realize there is a human being behind those pages, that 
someone actually created those books," she said. "It excites them to become 
writers." 
</P>
<P>
 Cocquyt told her sixth-grade audience that "Freddie at the Kentucky Derby" is 
really a story about anyone who follows their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freddie's dream was to win the greatest race of all, the Kentucky Derby," 
said Cocquyt, a Simi Valley resident and avid horsewoman. "All you have to do 
is substitute your name for Freddie, and it's your book.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's your dream, whatever that is." 
</P>
<P>
 Cocquyt also gave the 29 11- and 12-year-olds some concrete advice about 
writing. Students should recall one incident in their lives and then embellish 
it with the five w's: who, what, when, where and why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Write down those five little facts and you have a story," she said. KAY 
SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MASKED GUNMAN ROBS CARD CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are investigating a robbery at a Ventura card club early Tuesday in 
which a man held a gun to one patron's head while demanding cash from other 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The holdup occurred just before 1 a.m. at the Ash Street Card Club, which is 
operated out of the Elks Lodge building at 11 S. Ash St. No one was injured, 
and investigators would not disclose how much cash was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and witnesses, a man clad in black clothing and a black 
ski mask accosted a 22-year-old man in the building's rear parking lot, placed 
a gun to his head and ordered him to walk inside the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, six patrons playing poker and three employees were forced to get down 
on the ground and then to empty out their pockets. The suspect told several 
patrons to put the cash inside a backpack and ordered a manager to empty the 
cash drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect then made the man kneel on the floor and hand the backpack over 
his head, and the robber fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects, but believe the holdup was well-planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This suspect is more than likely familiar with that establishment and knew 
what he was doing," Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Anderson said. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CLAYMAN LOSES BID FOR L.A. DEFENDER JOB

<P>
 Ventura County Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman, one of five candidates for 
Los Angeles County public defender, was notified Tuesday that another applicant 
has been selected for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman said he was not disappointed by the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a wonderful job in a wonderful office in a beautiful community," he 
said. "I am happy to be here. That's exactly how I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors selected 49-year-old Michael P. 
Judge as the new public defender effective May 1, a board spokesman said. Judge 
is one of two assistant public defenders in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman, a 52-year-old Camarillo resident, described Judge as an "outstanding 
member of the public defender's office." He said he was happy for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his expressed enjoyment of supervising the 37-lawyer office in Ventura 
County, Clayman said he could not pass up the chance to apply for the job in 
Los Angeles County. It is the largest public defender's office in the nation 
with nearly 600 attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 He earns $99,000 as Ventura County public defender. The Los Angeles County job 
pays up to $149,809. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RIDE-SHARE RULING EXEMPTS 90 SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 90 schools that had been subject to employee trip-reduction requirements 
under the county's Rule 210 were exempted from the regulation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the revision, a school was required to have employee ride-sharing 
incentives if employees at that school, together with employees at any other 
schools within a one-mile radius, totaled 100 or more people. 
</P>
<P>
 School employees found it difficult to coordinate with teachers at nearby 
schools because schedules are staggered to accommodate bus transportation, said 
Air Pollution Control Officer Richard Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 However, schools such as Mound Elementary School and Balboa Middle School in 
Ventura, which share a campus and have more than 100 employees combined, must 
still comply with the regulation requiring employees to share rides to work or 
find other alternate means of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors exempted schools in all of the county's 22 
districts that do not have more than 100 employees at a single location. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Lunter, an attorney for the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port 
Hueneme, called the action discriminatory and contended that the same exception 
should apply to the Navy base. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Navy has separate functions at several locations on the large base 
and each should be considered separately. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baldwin reminded the board that the California Clean Air Act and the 
federal Clean Air Act require a reduction in the amount of times that employees 
drive their cars to work alone. JOANNA M. MILLER

 The preschool that serves faculty, staff and students at Cal Lutheran 
University has gained national accreditation, becoming one of only 10 
preschools in the county with that status. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-year process, the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs 
inspected the school for quality of health, safety, physical environment, 
teaching staff, curriculum and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does take a lot of work and in-depth study of your own program," said Joy 
Brooks, preschool director.  
</P>
<P>
 But she said the effort had paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a feather in our cap and a pat on our backs," said Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The preschool program began in 1974 as a Cal Lutheran student's master's 
degree project. Although first priority is given to faculty, staff and 
students, the center is also open to the public. It serves 80 children from 
ages 2 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a very long waiting list," said Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides full care from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Chapter of the Assn. for the Education of Young Children 
plans to honor the preschool for having earned the accreditation at a banquet 
on April 23. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; PAY RAISE CONSIDERED FOR CITY MANAGER 
</P>

<P>
 The Moorpark City Council will consider giving a raise to City Manager Steve 
Kueny at tonight's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the raise would lift Kueny's annual salary to nearly $93,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The council reviewed Kueny's performance over the past year and determined he 
deserved the merit-based pay increase.  
</P>
<P>
 "It amounts to a roughly 2% raise," Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done a good job," Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery said the council waited to consider Kueny's boost 
in pay until it was sure there was enough money in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, (Kueny) was charged with the responsibility of keeping the 
budget low enough to cover his possible raise," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kueny has worked for the city since 1984. SCOTT HADLY

MOORPARK WEIGHS 3 PROPERTY TAX INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The typical Moorpark homeowner could pay about $35 more in property taxes this 
year to fund everything from park maintenance to pollution cleanup under 
measures being considered tonight by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the proposed property tax hikes will pay for maintaining the city's 13 
parks as well as the costs of landscaping, lighting and other city services. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, homeowners will pay $51.88 for park maintenance and $37 for 
lighting and landscaping each year. The fees amount to a $25 increase over last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The third assessment is a $10 fee levied by the Ventura County Flood Control 
District to reduce the amount of pollution running into rivers and the ocean 
from local storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city also will incur costs from the federally mandated program, 
officials decided not to levy an additional assessment earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These assessments are small, but they do add up," Mayor Paul Lawrason said. 
"I'm particularly concerned about this federally mandated program. It's without 
funding and the cost is a tremendous burden on all cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Public Works Director Kenneth Gilbert estimates that the new program 
could cost the city from $50,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approach taken stresses education, making sure businesses and homeowners 
know that they shouldn't dump oil into the gutter for instance," Gilbert said. 
"There are also provisions for inspection and enforcement of standards, but all 
that takes money." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said he had requested that the city levy its own $5 assessment per 
household, but the council voted against that recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said the city would try to fund the program using surplus general 
fund money. As for the other two assessments, he said the city has tried to 
offset homeowners' costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done what we can each year so that the assessments wouldn't increase, 
but you can do that only so long," he said. In the past, the city has funneled 
surplus general fund money to pay for park upkeep and other city services. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 10 years, Moorpark has levied "benefit assessments" on property 
owners to pay for city services. Benefit assessment districts have been used by 
cities to circumvent Proposition 13, which imposed limits on property taxes 
without two-thirds approval by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said he is uncomfortable with the dependence on the special 
assessments, but knows of no other way to pay for the services demanded by 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt people look at their tax bill and realize where these assessments are 
going," he said. "Maybe we should do a better job of informing residents how 
their money is being spent. We've talked about that in the past and I like that 
idea."

POLICE DROP INVESTIGATION OF EX-VENTURA HIGH COACH; INQUIRY: DETECTIVES FIND NO 
RECENT CRIMINAL EVIDENCE AGAINST DALE HAHN, ACCUSED OF HAVING SEX WITH 
STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura police on Tuesday dropped their investigation of a former Ventura High 
School coach accused of having sex with students, saying detectives have been 
unable to find evidence of recent criminal activity, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura school district is pursuing its case to fire former swim coach 
Dale Hahn based on allegations that he engaged in immoral conduct with 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Police began their investigation in December after the school district put 
Hahn on paid leave. The 45-year-old Hahn, who taught chemistry and coached the 
swim and water polo teams at Ventura High since 1973, was suspended without pay 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Two former Ventura High students have told school officials that they had 
sexual relations with Hahn while they were at the high school in the 1970s and 
1980s. But the incidents they describe fall outside the three-year statute of 
limitations for felony sexual assaults, Detective Sgt. Bob Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts don't substantiate a criminal arrest," Anderson said. "We are not 
anticipating any charges being filed or any arrests." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their investigation of the old allegations, Ventura police were 
trying to verify statements by a male student currently at Ventura High to 
school officials that one of his female friends had sex with Hahn this school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy refused to name the girl and detectives found no proof to support 
the student's allegations, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not substantiated that that girl exists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn could not be reached for comment, but his attorney, Richard Schwab, said 
he hopes the district will now decide against trying to fire Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it speaks to what we have said all along, that what has been alleged 
against him has been basically all rumor, innuendo, gossip, vicious talk," 
Schwab said. "I'm very confident that the district now having this information 
will seriously reconsider its decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwab said the alleged incidents of Hahn having sex with former students not 
only fall outside the three-year criminal statute of limitations, but also the 
limit set by the state in cases against public school educators. 
</P>
<P>
 State law forbids districts from firing teachers for incidents that occurred 
more than four years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 One former Ventura High student has told school officials she had an ongoing 
sexual relationship with Hahn for a nine-month period in the mid-1970s. Another 
student has said that she slept with Hahn in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Joseph Spirito and other district officials said they are continuing to 
prepare a case to fire Hahn. That case will be decided by a state 
administrative panel at a hearing in Ventura in July. 
</P>
<P>
 While police must find evidence of sexual contact to bring charges of sexual 
assault, school officials said, the district needs to prove only that the 
teacher said or did things that fit the state education code's definition of 
immoral conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Immoral conduct can include such activities as a teacher leering at a student 
or asking a student out on a date, school attorney Mary Jo McGrath said. 
Various female students have alleged that Hahn had leered at them or asked them 
out within the past few years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to showing immoral conduct within the past four years, McGrath 
said she also hopes to persuade the administrative panel to consider the older 
allegations about Hahn having sex with students. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing that a person is a criminal is very different from proving that a 
teacher is unfit, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge difference between what the criminal burden of proof is and 
the criminal law and what the school district has a right to expect of 
teachers," said McGrath. "I think parents clearly want to have more than simply 
not to have criminals teaching their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito said it would have bolstered the district's case against Hahn if the 
police had brought charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it would been more of a case for us," Spirito said. "But, on the 
other hand, I've got a responsibility to the boys and girls of this community 
and they're my clients. We have to look at other things that the police perhaps 
don't consider to be criminal."

THOUSAND OAKS OKS PLANS FOR ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARD; INFORMATION: RESIDENTS 
WILL BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH CITY HALL THROUGH THEIR PERSONAL COMPUTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks residents will soon be able to search for book titles, scan 
playbills and lodge complaints through their personal computers, as the City 
Council on Tuesday approved plans for an electronic bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 For about $5,000, the council will purchase a computer, two modems and 
software designed to let residents communicate with City Hall over the 
telephone lines. Maintaining two lines will cost an additional $28 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very well-educated population and people want to be involved in 
public decision-making," Mayor Elois Zeanah said. "Now, they can make a phone 
call and get all the information we can possibly put on our bulletin board." 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved Zeanah's proposal to set up a round-the-clock 
information service that any resident will be able to plug into with a personal 
modem. 
</P>
<P>
 Got an urge to read Planning Commission agendas at 2 a.m.? Just call up the 
meeting file. Want to see if the Thousand Oaks Library has the latest hot 
mystery? Scroll through the card catalogue. Curious about what the neighbors 
think of the park district? Read the most recent Citizen Attitude Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 All that information -- plus programs for Civic Arts Plaza events, city 
statistics, and answers to the most frequently asked questions -- will be 
available within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how great this kind of system can be and how much time it 
can save the city," Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce President Steve 
Rubenstein told the council. The chamber set up a similar system eight months 
ago and now routinely communicates with local businesses through computer 
modems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Zeanah hopes to expand the software to allow residents to apply 
for business and marriage licenses, make appointments for building inspections, 
reserve library books and buy tickets for Civic Arts Plaza shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in its first phase, however, Thousand Oaks' electronic bulletin board 
will be more expansive than the programs now on line in Moorpark and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's CityLink software allows only one resident to plug into the 
bulletin board at a time, and offers only agendas, annotated minutes of City 
Council meetings and some miscellaneous facts about the city. Despite those 
limitations, the computer has logged 1,500 connections since June, 1992, 
Moorpark City Clerk Lillian Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
 One popular feature of Moorpark CityLink is the complaint file, where citizens 
have lodged gripes about everything from inadequate garbage collection to 
speeding cars on Tierra Rejada Road. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, "We do get a few 'Gosh, you guys are doing a great job, 
and this is a good service,' " Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although limited, Moorpark's software -- purchased for less than $5,000 -- 
outpaces the Simi Valley program, which does not allow residents to leave 
messages for city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, since it was installed nine months ago, nearly 250 people have 
used the Simi system, which contains a city directory, council and Planning 
Commission agendas and minutes of past meetings, said John McMillan, Simi 
Valley's director of general services. The computer tallies about 60 
connections a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' council members expressed high hopes for their new bulletin 
board, which Zeanah listed as one of her goals in her inaugural speech last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked city staff to report back on how many people use the system 
each month and what information they retrieve.

* WINNIE PARRY CROOKSTON; CENTENARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winnie Parry Crookston of Camarillo has died at the age of 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Maxine Schmidt of Camarillo, said her mother attributed her 
longevity to no drugs, alcohol or coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "She lived a good clean life," Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, Crookston used a walker to take daily walks around her 
neighborhood at Ripley Street in the west end of Camarillo.  
</P>
<P>
 But eventually she had to give up her walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gradually wore out," Schmidt said. "She died of old age." 
</P>
<P>
 Crookston, who was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, moved to Ventura County in 
1971. She lived in Ventura for three years, then moved to Camarillo to be near 
her daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Crookston was a member of the Mormon Church. Her husband, a salesman, died in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Wayne G. Crookston of 
Boise, Idaho, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 Burial was last week in Salt Lake City.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; THE ART OF GETTING ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The days when schools like Fullerton Union High could restrict themselves to 
reading, writing and arithmetic are long gone. Now they must also try to keep 
the peace among students from different ethnic or racial backgrounds. If they 
can achieve some actual harmony, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, administrators and students at Fullerton Union High School deserve 
credit for instituting special cultural diversity programs. Principal Ed Shaw 
said the goal is to teach students to accept the differences between themselves 
and others and to celebrate similarities. That is a good philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalyst for the group discussions, seminars and retreats was the 
September, 1992, fatal shooting of a Latino student, Angel Gonzalez, by Asian 
youths. The attack took place about a block off campus, hours after a quarrel 
between Gonzalez and a group of young Asians, one of whom police said was a 
Fullerton Union High sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years before the shooting, the ethnic makeup of the school's 
student population had been changing. Once most of the students were Anglo. Now 
Latinos account for nearly half, with Asians at 10%. After the shooting, some 
Asian students said they were worried Latinos would retaliate against them. A 
few reported being the target of ethnic slurs. But some Latinos reached out to 
calm those fears and administrators launched a multicultural task force of a 
dozen students assigned to promote harmony. It was a good idea, but it was not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 So last year administrators formed a larger group, which recently staged an 
assembly on ethnic diversity. Many students have gone to UC Irvine for more 
lessons on the subject. The Orange County Human Relations Commission 
periodically brings groups of students together to describe their lives, 
including instances of discrimination. The school newspaper publishes a page of 
news in Spanish, and lunchtime music features Latino rhythms as well as rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal said more remains to be done. But the school was wise to launch 
the programs and to seek outside resources. In today's diverse society, the art 
of getting along must be learned as soon as possible.

INDUSTRIALS ROCKET AS YIELDS TUMBLE

<P>
 Industrial issues led the stock market's dramatic rebound on Tuesday, as a 
rally in the bond market opened Wall Street's door to eager bargain hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials rocketed 82.06 points, or 2.3%, to 3,675.41, and the broad 
market -- beaten down for the last 10 days -- followed the blue-chip index 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE, winners swamped losers by a 21 to 3 margin, about the same margin 
that losers had topped winners on the market's worst days over the past week. 
Trading was heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most broad stock indexes, which by Monday's close were off 8% to 10% from 
their record highs, gained 2% to 3% Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders noted that the recent heavy selling of stocks had left the market ripe 
for a rally on any good news, which came Tuesday in the form of falling 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which had zoomed to a 15-month high of 
7.40% on Monday, fell to 7.24% on Tuesday after the government's report on 
February leading economic indicators suggested a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term interest rates also slumped, indicating that some investors were 
losing their fear that the Federal Reserve will hike short-term rates again 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is taking heart from the idea that the leading indicators are down 
a little bit," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bonds have been beaten up and bloodied, so they bounce back. (But) I don't 
know whether this is the end of a cheap horror movie, where they bounce back 
just to fall back in the grave," Brusca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, traders said most investors continue to have a wait-and-see attitude 
toward bonds: If yields stabilize here, more buyers may enter the market. But 
if Tuesday's rally invites more selling by bond holders trying to exit the 
market, yields could begin to rise again, traders warned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow was up 50 to 60 points for much of the day, until 
a late burst of buying drove prices even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulls took heart from the rush of money back into industrial, technology 
and transportation issues in particular. Those kinds of companies are expected 
to show the greatest earnings gains as the economy strengthens. Thus, their 
stocks are viewed as the leaders of any new bull market surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial shares in hot demand included Caterpillar, up 3 to 116 1/4; GM, 
up 2 1/4 to 57 1/4; Chrysler, up 2 7/8 to 54 1/2; United Technologies, up 3 1/4 
to 65 1/2; Illinois Tool Works, up 2 1/8 to 41 3/4, and Kennametal, up 2 3/8 to 
54 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among transportation stocks, Conrail surged 3 to 59, Roadway gained 1 1/8 to 
25 1/2 and Airborne Freight was up 1 5/8 to 35 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks were led higher by Compaq, up 2 3/8 to 100 7/8; Microsoft, up 3 
1/4 to 87 3/4; Cabletron Systems, up 5 3/4 to 113 1/4, and Motorola, up 3 5/8 
to 104 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailers also were strong. Sears soared 2 3/8 to 46 5/8, J. C. Penney 
leaped 2 3/4 to 56 1/2, Dayton Hudson gained 3 to 76 1/4 and Nordstrom surged 2 
3/8 to 42 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, healthy gains overnight helped Wall Street's bullish tone. 
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index soared 440.99 points to 19,563.21, while Frankfurt's 
DAX index added 25.18 points to 2,158.29 and London's FTSE-100 index was up 
29.8 points to 3,116.2. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, however, the Bolsa index lost more ground, falling 31.34 
points to 2,234.15. 
</P>
<P>
 In other U.S. markets, the dollar surged, while gold eased $1.90 to $384.40 an 
ounce.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: NEW RULES CHANGE THE DEDUCTION ITINERARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With this year's tax returns still fresh on everyone's minds, it's not too 
soon to start planning for next year, especially for people who travel 
frequently on business. 
</P>
<P>
 Business travel and entertainment deductions have always been one of the 
grayer areas of tax preparation, but the 1993 Tax Act contains some features 
that will make it tougher than ever for travelers to claim expenses as 
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many employers are encouraging Saturday night stays to get better 
air fares, which means more people are combining business and pleasure by 
taking family members along on business trips, a move that complicates travel 
deductions. And with more companies hiring people for temporary assignments, 
the line between business travel and normal employment expenses is blurred even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 For IRS purposes, travel means that your duties require you to be away from 
your main place of business longer than an ordinary day's work and that you 
need to rest or sleep while you are away. If the purpose of your travel is 
related to producing income or maintaining income-producing property, then you 
are allowed to deduct certain costs, including transportation, meals, 
entertainment, cleaning and other incidentals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you can actually take the deduction, however, requires that you meet 
certain conditions. You can only deduct costs for which you were not fully 
reimbursed. If, however, your reimbursement was treated as taxable income on 
your W2 form, then you can deduct your costs under miscellaneous employee 
expenses. To claim a deduction, the miscellaneous expenses must exceed 2% of 
your adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the bad news. One of the biggest changes affecting business travelers 
this year is that the deduction for business meals and entertainment is limited 
to 50% of the expense, not the 80% previously allowed, effective Jan. 1, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 For individuals, the best strategy for dealing with this change is to 
negotiate to have your firm pay your travel expenses in full and take the 
deduction rather than have you pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are an employee, make sure it's your employer taking the 50% hit, not 
you," said Nadine Gordon Lee, a partner with the accounting firm Ernst & Young 
who works in the personal tax and financial counseling group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't negotiate a reimbursement plan that compensates you fully for 
your out-of-pocket expenses, your only other recourse is to keep your costs as 
low as possible and keep good records so you can support claims for all your 
potential deductions. And remember that any amount you spend in excess of your 
reimbursement would be subject to the same 50% rule when you deduct it as a 
miscellaneous employee expense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other major change for business travelers starting this year is that 
expenses for a spouse traveling with you can no longer be written off. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS guidelines are more stringent, Lee said. "You are certainly walking 
alone when you travel on business in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the IRS would allow you to deduct your spouse's expenses if your 
employer required your spouse's presence and if you could document that your 
spouse spent time on business and that his or her presence helped business 
prospects. And when traveling in many parts of the world, including a spouse on 
business was expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, beginning in 1994, an accompanying person's expenses are deductible 
only if he or she is a legitimate employee of the same company, traveling for a 
bona fide business purpose. A good rule is to ask yourself whether your spouse 
would be able to deduct the travel if he or she went alone, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another change effective in 1994 is that dues for clubs, including airline 
clubs, will no longer be a deductible expense. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the newest changes, one change effective in 1993 is worth 
remembering in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Jan. 1, 1993, you can only deduct travel expenses for up to one year if 
you are in a temporary job assignment away from home. If your job lasts more 
than a year, your travel costs are not deductible because your job assignment 
is considered indefinite, not temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that if you accept a temporary two-year assignment away from your 
home base, your travel costs are not deductible. And because you are still 
maintaining your home, you can't deduct your costs as moving expenses, either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The test the IRS uses to determine if a job is temporary is whether there is a 
"realistic expectation that the assignment would not exceed one year," Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if what starts out to be a yearlong assignment actually takes 18 months, 
you can deduct the first year. The reverse is not true, however. If you accept 
an assignment that is expected to take 18 months and you wrap it up in 10 
months, you are not entitled to the deduction. If you took the deduction, and 
were audited, you would have to document that the job was originally expected 
to last less than a year, not the 18 months. Tax Tips for Travelers 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some additional tax strategies gleaned from financial advisers and 
from the Ernst & Young Tax Guide, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seek reimbursement for travel-related expenses from your employer before 
trying to deduct them. You can only deduct your expenses if they exceed your 
reimbursement, but the IRS considers it your responsibility to ask your 
employer for the money first. If you don't ask, you can't deduct. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get a policy statement from your company (or a letter from your supervisor) 
that says you may have to incur non-reimbursed expenses to fulfill your job. 
This helps establish that your expenses are "ordinary and necessary" for doing 
your job while away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep good records. Guesstimates aren't good enough. Make sure you keep a log 
with dates, amounts and purposes of all business travel-related expenses. Using 
a credit card when you travel is a handy way to keep track of expenses, but use 
a diary as well to log items such as cab fares that you can't charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before accepting a new work assignment that requires traveling and staying 
away from home, establish in writing whether the work assignment is considered 
temporary (less than a year) or not. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep track of all your expenses. Some frequently overlooked deductions 
include the cost of laundry and cleaning while on the road, or the cost of 
shipping extra baggage, if it includes sample or display material related to 
the purpose of your trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure you keep all course outlines and educational material from any 
courses or seminars you attend. Business and career education expenses have 
attracted interest from the IRS in recent audits, especially continuing 
education courses held at resort locations, Lee said. As a rule of thumb, "if 
you view it as a boondoggle, so will the IRS."

 For over forty years, I have been traveling all over the globe, both lecturing 
and advising professionals.  
</P>
<P>
 In the early days, there was little attention paid to burnout, fatigue and 
stresses of frequent changes of planes and lodgings.But with time, it became 
obvious that there must be a better way to conserve energy, be more productive 
and arrive fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Premium hotels are a better way and are worth the money. Where possible I 
sought out a Ritz-Carlton. The usual 24-hour room service was a true blessing 
since there was no need to search for, skip or rush a meal. The security system 
alone, as with all fine hotels, warrants the extra cost. And what great 
restaurants for discussions! 
</P>
<P>
 If there are company budget limitations against the top hotels, I either pay 
the extra cost myself or I constrict four days of work and meetings into two 
days.

 * The market ignored Wall Street's rally and closed sharply lower Tuesday, 
depressed about the likelihood of higher interest rates in the near term. The 
Bolsa index slumped 31.34 points to 2,234.15, after Monday's 145-point 
plunge.The index now is at its lowest level since late November. 
</P>

 * Traders fear that the surge in U.S. interest rates over the past week will 
mean sharply higher Mexican rates at the government's weekly note auction 
today. Also, gloom among domestic investors over the recent assassination of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling PRI party's original presidential candidate, 
continues to weigh on stocks, traders say.

 The important tourism industry has been crippled because of violence by 
Islamic fundamentalists, and free-market policies have pushed up prices and 
unemployment. But Egypt, which is pursuing long-term economic reform, has some 
positive indicators, including a slowdown in inflation and a stable currency.

 LOTS OF COMPANY: Left-hander Chuck Finley may be the highest-paid member of 
the California Angels, but he's far from being the highest-paid player in major 
league baseball. His $3,875,000 for this year is 44th on the current money 
list, figures released Tuesday show. Finley is 10th among all pitchers. . . . 
The Angels do stand out in one category: Only three teams -- the Montreal 
Expos, San Diego Padres and Florida Marlins -- have fewer millionaire players 
than the Angels, who have six. 
</P>
<P>
 CHEAP THRILLS? How do the owners pay all those high salaries? By making the 
fans pay. But a night at Anaheim Stadium is still a better bargain than most 
places. . . . Team Marketing Report, which annually assesses the cost of 
baseball attendance, ranks the Angels 22nd out of 28 in average expense. It 
says a family of four will spend an average $90.24 there -- a 6.7% increase 
this year. It's $115.25 at Yankee Stadium. The best bargain: Cincinnati -- the 
only one under $80. 
</P>
<P>
 SAIL TALK: Hank Dekker of San Francisco was driving race cars when he began 
losing his eyesight. By 1978, he was blind. That didn't stop his love of 
outdoor sports. He took up sailing with sighted friends, then alone, and 
started his own charter service. Next fall he plans to become the first blind 
man to sail the Atlantic alone. . . . Dekker talks about his sailing today at 1 
p.m. -- and again Thursday and Friday -- at the Newport Boat Show at the 
Newport Dunes resort. 
</P>

 SAVE A TREE: Financial woes for socialites Danny and Susie Hernandez continue. 
With Danny in federal prison and both he and Susie awaiting sentencing for 
fraud April 22, the bank has foreclosed on their $800,000 Mission Viejo home 
and this week evicted Susie and her children. Struggling for cash, Susie began 
selling the palm trees and bushes on the property to local landscapers just 
before eviction. . . . "She's doing what she can to keep food on the table," 
says Newport Beach attorney Scott Wellman, a family friend. "They bring in a 
few hundred dollars each."

 ANOTHER DELAY: Just last week, NASA gave Canoga Park's Rocketdyne credit for 
making improvements after problems caused several space shuttles last year to 
be delayed. Well, it's happened again.This Thursday's launch had to be switched

 FAST WORK: We were supposed to be without full use of the quake-damaged Santa

 NO BRONSONS: Wanted: Volunteers to help fight crime. But, please, no

 Kuwait's crown prince announced a Cabinet shuffle, warning of critics who have 
been trying to fracture the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The crown prince, Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, who also is prime minister, 
made the announcement on Monday during a 40-minute televised address. 
</P>
<P>
 But he gave no details of the shuffle, saying he first had to inform the emir, 
Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-member Cabinet, formed in October, 1992, following the first 
post-Persian Gulf War elections, includes six members of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament has become a high-profile forum for criticism of the 
government. Some members have called for a greater role for Islam in lawmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Political parties are not permitted, although most members of the assembly 
have aligned themselves into "movements" primarily of Islamists, secularists 
and Bedouins.

LOW EDUCATION, MENIAL JOBS LINKED TO ALZHEIMER'S RISK, STUDY INDICATES 
</P>

From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People with low levels of education and menial jobs may run a higher risk of 
developing Alzheimer's disease, for reasons that are not fully understood, 
researchers reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that poor education makes it easier to detect the disease in tests 
used to find it, the study from Columbia University said, or it may be that 
brighter people have an intellectual "reserve" that somehow hides the 
development of the incurable condition longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our findings suggest that educational and occupational attainment can 
influence the risk of Alzheimer's disease," said the report, which was 
published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these two aspects of life experience were considered simultaneously, the 
risk of dementia was highest for people with both low education and low 
occupation," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding was based on a study of 593 people in New York City's Washington 
Heights and Inwood communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease affects the brain. Forgetfulness and memory loss lead to a 
vegetative state. It strikes from 7% to 8% of those older than 65, with the 
rate reaching 25% for those who live to their mid-80s.

 A 66-year-old man credits his dentures with deflecting a gunshot and saving 
his life, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Daniel was sitting outside his house during the weekend when a young 
man on a bicycle pointed a gun at him and demanded his wallet, police said. 
Daniel pulled a knife from his pocket and began struggling with the robber, who 
shot upward at Daniel's chin. 
</P>
<P>
 The dentures split but stopped the bullet from penetrating farther into 
Daniel's head, police said. He was treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman got away with Daniel's wallet but suffered stab wounds on his chest 
and hand.

 President Clinton pitched his health care plan Tuesday as a cure for doctor 
shortages in rural America and said he would continue to sell it outside 
Washington to keep it from getting "lost in a cloud of hot air." 
</P>
<P>
 Warming up for an evening town hall televised live in nine states, Clinton 
spent the day promoting his health reform ideas to doctors, administrators and 
patients of an understaffed and financially burdened rural hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 His TV forum was the first of three this week. The President and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton are trying to generate public demand for health care 
change as Congress wraps up an Easter recess and prepares to resume work on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to do is get out here and highlight these real world 
experiences of the doctors and nurses and all the health care providers here so 
that we can focus the attention of the American people and the Congress on 
solutions to the real problems and not the rhetorical problems," the President 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged support for his plan has wavered in the polls, and he blamed 
that on well-financed opposition from insurers and partisan attacks from 
Republicans. But he offered this optimistic status report: "The debate is in a 
funny way just beginning. . . . I think we are winning it again and we are 
getting real movement in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Tailoring his latest pitch to his rural audience in Troy, 50 miles east of 
Charlotte, Clinton shook his head as local family practitioner Deborah 
McRoberts told him she often works more than 100 hours a week and has more than 
8,000 patients -- more than four times the recommended doctor-patient ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Little noticed in the intense debate over health reform, Clinton said, are 
provisions in his plan to attract more doctors, nurses and other health 
professionals to rural areas, such as Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said his plan would provide $12,000 annual tax credits to doctors who 
agreed to work in areas certified as short of doctors, and $6,000 in credits 
for nurses and other health providers needed in such areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said it would add 7,000 new doctors to the National Health Service 
Corps, a program that pays medical school debts of doctors who agree to serve 
rural and other areas in need. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton said his plan would alleviate the shortage of general 
practitioners by requiring medical schools that get federal subsidies to shift 
their emphasis away from training specialists and back to turning out more 
family doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 After a tour and roundtable discussion at Montgomery Memorial Hospital, 
Clinton offered a methodical presentation of his health plan to about 200 local 
residents, using half a dozen charts to highlight major details of his plan.

WHITTEN, LONGEST-SERVING CONGRESSMAN, PLANS TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Jamie L. Whitten (D-Miss.), who has served longer in the House than 
anyone else, announced his retirement Tuesday, two years after illness forced 
him from the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitten, who turns 84 in two weeks, was elected to an unexpired term a month 
before Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 and is completing his 27th consecutive 
term representing northern Mississippi.The next senior member, Rep. Sidney R. 
Yates (D-Ill.), came to Congress in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his age and ill health, Whitten's retirement had been widely 
anticipated. Three Democrats had already taken the unusual step of filing as 
candidates for his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has not been an easy decision," Whitten said in a seven-paragraph 
statement. "The people of our state have been mighty good to me through the 
years, and it has always been my desire to use this position to serve them as 
well as I possibly could. However, the timing seems right and there are other 
interests I still want to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitten suffered what appeared to be a stroke in early 1992 and had trouble 
managing his panel's bills when he returned to the House. In June, 1992, House 
Democrats made William H. Natcher (D-Ky.) acting chairman of the committee in a 
move that became permanent until illness last month also forced him from the 
panel's leadership. Natcher died last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.) now chairs the committee, where, under the 
Constitution, all spending bills originate. 
</P>
<P>
 With his positions on the Appropriations Committee, Whitten, a conservative, 
steered federal funds and projects to his district and state, one of the 
nation's poorest.

TEAMSTERS, TRUCKING INDUSTRY BRACE FOR STRIKE; LABOR: THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF 
COMPROMISE ON THE EVE OF A WALKOUT BY 80,000 WORKERS THAT COULD DISRUPT 
LONG-DISTANCE FREIGHT SHIPMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a midnight strike deadline approached with no resolution in sight, the 
Teamsters and major trucking companies Tuesday braced themselves for a walkout 
that could disrupt freight shipments nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking and union officials blamed each other for the impasse during dueling 
press conferences hours before about 80,000 Teamster members were scheduled to 
begin the strike at 12:01 a.m. today EDT. Union members have already voted to 
authorize Teamster leaders to launch a strike if the talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike, while not expected to paralyze transportation, could be widely 
felt across the country by consumers, retailers and factories. The 23 companies 
threatened by the strike handle about half of the nation's mid-size shipments 
over long distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 7,000 to 10,000 Teamsters in the Los Angeles area are expected to walk 
picket lines at the companies' truck terminals, said Gregory Roth, 
secretary-treasurer of Teamster Local 208 in El Monte, where members were 
assembling picket signs late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to walk out," Roth said. "But the employers have taken a 
take-it-or-leave-it attitude on some extremely serious issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Teamster President Ron Carey said Tuesday that the strike could be avoided 
only if the trucking firms address the union's concerns regarding company 
proposals, primarily one that would increase the use of part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was little evidence of a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no chance for last-minute negotiations," said Robert A. Young III, 
chairman of Trucking Management Inc., which represents the 23 large trucking 
firms in negotiations with the Teamsters. "We don't plan to call them, and we 
don't expect them to call us." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers said that a shutdown of the 23 firms would leave many 
companies scrambling for space on other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Young downplayed the potential significance of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of carriers out there that aren't union carriers" that will 
pick up business, Young said. He added that trucking companies have sped up the 
delivery of customer shipments to beat the strike deadline and avoid delays. 
Also, he said, the 23 firms control only about 18% of the nation's total 
freight traffic moved by truck, train and plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking industry officials said cross-country shipments would be most 
vulnerable to disruption since the affected companies dominate long-distance 
transport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your shipment is going from Orange County to the San Fernando Valley, (the 
strike) will not have much effect," said Joseph M. Nievez, vice president of 
non-union Qwikway Trucking in Los Angeles. "If you are going from here to 
Charlotte, you will have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carey said the strike could spread beyond the initial 23 firms to other 
trucking companies that employ an additional 40,000 Teamsters under the same 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between the Teamsters and trucking firms broke off last week after the 
companies submitted what they described as their final offer. The Teamsters 
rejected the offer, which included proposals to hire more part-time workers and 
shift more business to railroads, as one that would lead to lower starting 
wages and lost jobs.

GINNY SIMMS; SINGER, RADIO PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ginny Simms, big band singer who performed in such films as "Broadway Rhythm" 
and "Night and Day" and had a national radio show in the 1940s, died Monday. 
She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Simms died of a heart attack at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, said her 
husband of 32 years, Donald Eastvold Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of San Antonio, Tex., who studied piano at Fresno State Teachers 
College, Miss Simms earned her initial fame as the lead singer for Kay Kyser's 
band in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 She followed Kyser to Hollywood and made her first three films with his 
orchestra -- "That's Right, You're Wrong" in 1939, "You'll Find Out" in 1940 
and "Playmates" in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer went on to do such films as "Here We Go Again" with Fibber McGee 
and Molly and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy in 1942; "Broadway Rhythm" with 
George Murphy and the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in 1944; "Shady Lady" with Charles 
Coburn in 1945, and "Night and Day" with Cary Grant portraying composer Cole 
Porter in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently on the Hit Parade with such songs as "Don't Ever Change," Miss 
Simms got her own network radio show, "The Ginny Simms Show." 
</P>
<P>
 She also segued into a second career away from the limelight as a decorator 
and developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her interest began when she married millionaire hotel magnate Hyatt R. von 
Dehn, who started the Hyatt hotel chain. She decorated some of his first hotels 
as well as their Beverly Hills homes until their divorce in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief marriage to oilman Robert Calhoun in 1953, Miss Simms returned 
to the concert stage for a few years. But touring ended when Washington state 
Atty. Gen. Donald W. Eastvold Sr. insisted on meeting her backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day I received the largest bouquet of roses I have ever seen and an 
urgent message that read, 'I'm sending my yacht for you,' " she said years 
later. "I admitted that was a first. We've been happy ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 Locating in Palm Springs after their marriage in 1962, the couple developed 
properties and she decorated resorts in Palm Springs and Washington, Minnesota 
and Hawaii, and throughout Mexico and in Spain. Their company is now called 
World International Vacation Club. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband, Miss Simms is survived by her two sons by Von 
Dehn, David and Conrad, and Eastvold's five children, Carl, Donald Jr., Diane, 
Shawn and Sharon, and 13 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled for 2 p.m. Friday at Our Savior's Lutheran Church in 
Palm Springs.

PADRE TICKET PROBLEMS DISAPPEAR; BASEBALL: CROWDS MOVE SMOOTHLY TUESDAY AFTER 
HIGH DEMAND AND COMPUTER GLITCH DELAYED SEASON OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things were back to normal at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Tuesday night, but 
memories of Monday's computer glitch at the ticket windows were all too fresh 
in the minds of Padre officials. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour before the Padres were to take the field Monday for the first 
afternoon home opener in the club's 26 seasons, the TicketMaster computer 
system that operates their ticket sales broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the game between the Padres and the Atlanta Braves was delayed 
from 2:05 to 2:20 p.m., and even then, the start was too early for many 
frustrated ticket-holders. It wasn't until the second or third inning that all 
of the 42,251 fans had reached their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Adams, the Padres' senior vice president for business operations, said 
computers for TicketMaster outlets throughout Southern California were 
affected. The outage lasted 40 minutes, by which time some would-be 
ticket-buyers had left the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said there had been "a few complaints" Tuesday and that each caller had 
been offered tickets to a future game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very trying situation," he said. "Having all those fans and not 
being able to service them was totally frustrating, and we had no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the problem was the fact that the gate sale far exceeded 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 After last year's much-publicized "fire sale" of high-salaried players, the 
Padres' off-season demand for tickets was so light that the upper deck was 
covered with a tarp. This trimmed the seating capacity from 59,722 to 46,510, 
and the Padres didn't expect more than 35,000 for opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, 10,300 tickets, about triple the number that had been 
anticipated, were sold on game day. Although the crowd of 42,251 was more than 
4,000 shy of the newly listed capacity, it was announced as a sellout because 
of a large number of complimentary tickets plus some that were for luxury boxes 
and not available for general use. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the ticket problem, the parking lots became clogged to the point 
where many cars had to be parked on nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have space for 18,000 cars," Adams said. "The normal average is three 
people to a car, but this being an afternoon game with many folks coming from 
work, the average was closer to two per car." 
</P>
<P>
 This is TicketMaster's first season of serving the Padres, who had used 
Teleseat in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, we can put any ticket-buyer in any available seat at any 
of our 38 ticket windows," ticket director Dave Gilmore said. "The tickets are 
printed right at the windows, and that's why the computer breakdown was so 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened the windows at 9 a.m. and we were fully staffed," he said. "It's 
just that the timing couldn't have been worse. The amazing thing is that we 
sold more than 10,000 tickets."

AMERIQUEST TO ACQUIRE SOFTWARE MAKER; PURCHASE: IN TAKING OVER KENFIL, THE 
IRVINE-BASED HARDWARE DISTRIBUTOR -- FORMERLY CMS ENHANCEMENTS -- WOULD NEARLY 
TRIPLE ITS REVENUE, BOOSTING IT INTO THE $300-MILLION-PLUS RANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Formation of a new major player in the personal-computer supplies industry was 
proposed Monday as hardware distributor AmeriQuest Technologies Inc. said it 
intends to acquire software distributor Kenfil Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-stock deal would be worth $17.5 million at Tuesday's market price for 
AmeriQuest shares -- although the actual value depends on stock prices several 
months from now. 
</P>
<P>
 If the purchase is completed, Van Nuys-based Kenfil would become an AmeriQuest 
division. Its addition would nearly triple the revenue of Irvine-based 
AmeriQuest, boosting it into the $300-million-plus category that some analysts 
believe is the minimum size needed to survive and grow in an increasingly 
competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are several huge distributors, like Santa Ana-based Ingram 
Micro Inc., with sales in the $1-billion to $3-billion range, there are fewer 
than a dozen in the $300-million-plus category, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would give AmeriQuest a big boost by providing it the software 
to sell to users of the computer equipment it markets, creating a unified 
company that eases retailers' shopping chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal makes sense because it is happening in an industry where you must 
grow to survive," said Ian Gilson, analyst with L.H. Friend, Weinress & Frankso 
investment brokerage in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But before AmeriQuest can expand through the Kenfil acquisition there is 
likely to be some shrinkage: Layoffs among the companies' combined 300 
employees are likely as the two consolidate warehousing and administrative 
positions. Company officials said they did not know how many jobs would be 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the combination is likely to benefit both companies by reducing 
overhead and broadening customer bases, it is unlikely to translate into price 
cuts that would be noticed by retail consumers of the goods AmeriQuest and 
Kenfil now distribute, officials of both companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do expect substantial savings through economies of scale," said Michael 
Rusert, AmeriQuest executive vice president and chief operating officer, "but 
it shouldn't affect the street prices" of the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
 The software sales and marketing operation would be run out of Van Nuys, but 
all other management and administrative functions will be consolidated in 
Irvine, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And most shipping and warehousing would be consolidated at AmeriQuest's 
central shipping and storage facility in Wilmington, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenfil, with 150 employees and $191 million in sales last year, is one of the 
country's largest software distributors. Its clients include corporate users, 
retailers such as Egghead Discount Software stores, and mass merchandisers, 
including the Office Depot chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The company distributes more than 3,500 titles from publishers, including 
WordPerfect Corp., Peachtree Software, Corel, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. But it 
lacks distribution agreements with industry giants Microsoft, Lotus and 
Ashton-Tate. Those companies won't deal with Kenfil because it doesn't have 
enough vendors, said Peter Grubstein, Kenfil's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the combined vendor bases after the acquisition could prove attractive to 
the giant software companies, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 AmeriQuest, which until last week was called CMS Enhancements, begins its 
expansion campaign after shrinking from $200 million in sales in 1989 to $73 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company raised almost $6 million in December with a private stock sale to 
investors led by the Wendover Financial Group in Los Angeles. Company officials 
said at the time they intended to use much of the capital to spur growth 
through acquisitions and by improving sales and service. 
</P>
<P>
 With an additional 3.9 million shares to be issued to Kenfil shareholders and 
lenders in the proposed acquisition, the Wendover and Kenfil groups each would 
own 33% of the company with 11.7 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Kenfil stockholders would get one share of AmeriQuest 
common stock for every three shares of Kenfil common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, holders of approximately $7.3 million of Kenfil notes would 
exchange their debt for additional shares of AmeriQuest common stock. Chrysler 
Capital Corp., the Detroit auto maker's finance unit and Kenfil's largest 
creditor with $5 million of that debt, would own nearly 10% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's closing price of $4.75 a share for AmeriQuest stock, the deal 
values Kenfil shares at $1.58 -- to the surprise of investors who had been 
trading the Van Nuys company's shares at about $2 each in anticipation of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculative trading drove Kenfil shares to $2.50 when the market closed 
Monday, but the stock lost $1 a share to close at $1.50 Tuesday, based on the 
lower price in the AmeriQuest valuation. At the same time, AmeriQuest shares 
rose 63 cents for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of volatility is why the acquisition is based on an exchange of 
shares rather than flat price per share, said Grubstein. "We are both so thinly 
traded that it doesn't take much to move our share prices, and neither of us 
wanted to be disadvantaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Presuming that investors continue to see wisdom in the acquisition, 
AmeriQuest's stock could climb in the weeks before the effective dates of the 
acquisition -- which is to be completed in two stages ending in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the chance people take in deals like this," said Steven C. DeLucca, 
head analyst at Cruttenden & Co., an investment bank in Irvine. "If AmeriQuest 
goes up, Kenfil will go up in lock-step with it and everyone will profit. If 
AmeriQuest stock goes down, it could kill the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar stock-based acquisition in Northern California last year, Intuit 
purchased Chipsoft Corp. in early December after announcing the deal in 
September. In the intervening two months, Intuit's stock price rose by 35% -- 
increasing the value of the shares it paid for Chipsoft by the same margin.

CELEBRITY THEATRE OPERATOR LOSES ANAHEIM LEASE; ENTERTAINMENT: BANKRUPTCY COURT

 The operator of the Celebrity Theatre must surrender control of the Anaheim 
concert venue by Monday, under a court order issued Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 California Celebrity Theatre Inc. had been struggling to continue operating 
the 2,800-seat theater since mid-December, when it filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection from its creditors. Under an agreement reached between 
the operator and its landlord, the Leo Freedman Foundation, California 
Celebrity had until Monday to pay $160,000 in delinquent rent and other costs, 
or else lose its lease. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, bankruptcy Judge John E. Ryan refused the Celebrity's request for 
an extension until the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the 3,000-seat Orange County Performing Arts Center rarely rents space 
to pop attractions, the Celebrity is the only Orange County venue suitable to 
well-known acts too big for the 500-seat Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, 
but not big enough for the 15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre or the 
Anaheim Arena, which can seat from 11,000 to 19,000 patrons for a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard D. Brady, attorney for California Celebrity, said that the judge 
ordered his client to be out of the building by Monday. A concert Saturday 
night by singer Rocio Durcal will go forward as scheduled, according to the 
theater box office. The Celebrity has no other concerts booked. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady was uncertain Tuesday whether Edward J. Haddad, the president and sole 
shareholder in California Celebrity, would appeal to try to keep control of the 
theater. Haddad could not be reached. According to the California Celebrity 
bankruptcy file, Haddad also has petitioned separately for personal bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedman Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports the arts, will 
seek a new operator for the theater and its adjoining restaurant. Before 
financial difficulties struck, drastically curtailing concerts in recent 
months, the Celebrity's rotating stage had featured a wide array of pop talent. 
R&B singers Luther Vandross and Gladys Knight, rapper L.L. Cool J, country 
singers Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Garth Brooks and rock acts Squeeze, 
Guns N' Roses and Ted Nugent are among those who have performed at the 
in-the-round venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis Stern, co-trustee of the Freedman Foundation, said Tuesday that two 
major concert promoters, Avalon Attractions and Nederlander Concerts, have 
expressed interest in running the Celebrity. Avalon is the promoter at Irvine 
Meadows; Nederlander, former operator of the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa 
Mesa, is the concert promoter for all shows at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last December 31, Avalon also had promoted shows at the Celebrity 
Theatre under a management contract with California Celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope to have a new tenant within 30 days," Stern said. "We want to 
make sure we have a reputable entity that will . . . make their payments timely 
and in full. We feel the people we're talking to will do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said that California Celebrity's 10-year lease, which began in 1987 and 
ran through May, 1997, called for monthly rent of $20,000 plus 10% of gross 
revenues. He said the foundation wants to negotiate a new lease with a flat 
rental fee so that the charity will no longer have to monitor theater receipts, 
and will be able to assume a "passive" ownership position in keeping with 
government rules governing tax-exempt foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case still pending in Orange County Superior Court, the Freedman 
Foundation has sued California Celebrity, alleging that it improperly withheld 
about $50,000 in rent owed under the lease's revenue-sharing provision. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, the Celebrity's business had fallen drastically 
in recent years. In 1991, the theater staged 87 concerts, selling 153,000 
tickets and generating $3.7 million in ticket revenue. In 1992, 71 shows drew 
115,000 ticket buyers, bringing in $3 million. Last year, the business dropped 
precipitously, with only 29 shows, 39,000 tickets sold, and $1 million in 
ticket revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Avalon attractions became involved in the Celebrity in 1992, and in March, 
1993, it took over day-to-day operations under a management agreement that 
called for Avalon to share profits or losses with Haddad on a 50-50 basis. The 
last Avalon-promoted show there was a New Year's Eve concert by comic Howie 
Mandel. 
</P>
<P>
 In its bankruptcy filings, Haddad and California Celebrity alleged that 
"Avalon and Freedman have conspired to eliminate Celebrity from this venue. . . 
. Avalon reduced the sales and performances during its management of the venue 
to dry up the cash flow to Celebrity." Stern denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the foundation was not in conspiracy with anyone," Stern said, 
adding that the Freedman Foundation had no dealings with Avalon while it was 
managing the theater.  
</P>
<P>
 Randy Brogna, vice president of operations for Avalon Attractions, labeled 
Celebrity's allegation "totally bogus and erroneous." 
</P>
<P>
 Brogna said that the drastic drop in concerts and revenues at the Celebrity 
during 1993 was due entirely to "a terrible economy" that has affected all 
Southern California concert venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Avalon maintains that California Celebrity owes it $260,000 in promoter's fees 
and other costs of operating the theater during 1992-93. Brady, California 
Celebrity's lawyer, said his client, in turn, believes that Avalon breached its 
management contract and owes the Celebrity an undetermined amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said that Haddad's efforts to raise the $160,000 that would have allowed 
him to pay off his back rent and hold onto the theater were complicated by a 
recent death in the family. "He needed to go back to Chicago to tend to the 
funeral arrangements," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said he offered that as a reason why Haddad should be given a few more 
days to raise the rent money, a request that he said was refused first by the 
Freedman Foundation, and then by Judge Ryan.

POST-QUAKE BOOM SEEMS LIKE A BUST FOR SOME FIRMS; CONSTRUCTION: SMALL COMPANIES 
ARE DOING PLENTY OF BIDDING, BUT CONTRACTS ARE SLOW IN COMING FOR MANY. DELAYS 
IN INSURANCE PAYMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AID ARE BLAMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many small Southern California construction firms, the expected boom in 
work repairing damage from the January earthquake has failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done 50 (estimates), I've got a stack of them this high," Rick Koester, 
an Agua Dulce general contractor, said, jamming his hand against his eyebrow. 
And contracts? "I've gotten five or so since the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Jeff Steele, owner of Reseda-based Artisan Concrete: "It's frustrating 
to me because I'm out there spinning my wheels, running around trying to give 
competitive estimates. I would love to get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences of Steele and Koester seem at odds with scenes of disrepair 
and apparent construction activity in areas hardest hit by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the suburban neighborhoods of the north San Fernando 
Valley. Chimneys swathed in plastic, boarded-up windows and piles of crumbled 
masonry dot every block. Each morning, the Ventura Freeway is jammed with 
cement trucks and mud-caked pickups creeping into the Valley, and by 
mid-morning, the sound of jackhammers echoes through residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, some companies are busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, John Newland, manager of Doug's U-Rent, said the Woodland Hills firm's 
revenue is up 60% over the same period last year from increased demand to 
supply construction equipment to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right off the bat, we sent off all our generators. . . . Then it was 
jackhammers and compressors. It's been steady ever since," Newland said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Peaslee, owner of Complete Concrete of Tarzana said he has been working 
from 4:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. almost every day since the quake, and revenue for the 
5-year-old contracting business is 50% higher than in the same period last 
year. True, a lot of his work is giving estimates, and a smaller percentage of 
those than usual lead to jobs. But he is still landing more contracts than 
before the quake, and he's certain that number will grow in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 But increased activity after a disaster does not necessarily translate into 
instant cash for all construction businesses, said David Craven, marketing and 
sales director for the Florida-based construction company Brookman-Fels. After 
Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, Brookman-Fels barely managed to break 
even, Craven said. Many smaller companies went under. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons? Small companies that boosted payrolls in anticipation of more 
work found it hard to sustain themselves through long waits for federal aid and 
insurance money, he said. Those that gave free estimates quickly found 
themselves overwhelmed doing estimates and not repairs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Builders in the San Francisco area tell a similar story about the aftermath of 
the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who were counting on this big boom for business were sorely 
disappointed," said Gary Hambly, chief executive officer of the Building 
Industry Assn. of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Zinke, executive officer of the Greater Los Angeles/Ventura chapter of the 
Building Industry Assn., agreed that a post-quake boomlet for repair businesses 
is far from a given. In fact, the chapter recently offered a seminar to members 
on how to avoid going broke in the wake of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to lose money," Zinke said. "For a long time we've had an 
estimating boom and not a lot of jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that insurance checks, Federal Emergency Management 
Agency aid and federal Small Business Administration loans are still in the 
pipeline for many homeowners. Thus, while they may order lots of estimates, 
they're in no position to sign contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeowners, even with checks in hand, appear to be in no hurry to get 
repairs done. 
</P>
<P>
 Clem Phillips, for example, seems content to live with his crumbled block wall 
at his Northridge home for a while. He has taken several repair bids, but they 
are all high, he said. Maybe he will hire somebody this summer, he mused, maybe 
not. As for his cracked plaster inside, he'll probably fix that himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Quiroga, owner of Mike's Roofing Service of Van Nuys, said he is taken 
aback by the lack of urgency he senses in some would-be customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say they are not going to do anything until summer," he said. "Even 
with the heavy rains, even with plastic on their roof." Quiroga said his 
revenue did not increase immediately after the quake, but in the last week or 
so, demand has risen. He now estimates revenue is up 20% over the same time 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite current frustrations, local small repair businesses may be well 
positioned to take advantage of any boom that comes. Newcomers are not swarming 
into the repair business. Applications for new contractor licenses are down in 
every category, according the Contractors State License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that the repair business may be headed for an upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 Building permits issued by the city of Los Angeles have surged. More permits 
were issued in March than in January and February combined. The estimated value 
of those building projects is expected to hit $238.6 million, of which about 
$71 million is directly related to earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 March's surge isn't big enough to be called a turnaround, because for the 
first three months of the year there has been only slight increase in the value 
of construction jobs compared to the same time last year, according to Los 
Angeles city building officials.

DRIVING THAT STAGECOACH; REICHARDT STEERS WELLS FARGO TO POST-RECESSION 
EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the staid world of commercial banking, Wells Fargo Bank Chairman Carl 
Reichardt stands out like a longhorn bull on an arid Texas plain. 
</P>
<P>
 A gruff, aggressive native of Houston, Reichardt is known as an innovator 
widely followed by bank leaders and investors and feared by subordinates. He is 
regarded as a ruthless cost cutter, a consumer banking innovator and a skilled 
navigator who successfully guided Wells Fargo through California's bumpy 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 His image today stands in stark contrast to what it was in the early 1990s, 
when Reichardt came under heavy fire because it appeared that the bank might 
topple under a welter of bad real estate and corporate loans. Wells Fargo is 
California's second-largest bank, with more than $52 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 With profits on the rise and problem loans in decline, Wells Fargo is robust 
again and poised for major expansion. Reichardt, 62, has openly lusted after 
Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank, which has so far shown no interest in 
a union with Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes two to tango," Reichardt said in a recent interview at his San 
Francisco office, "and we're alone on the dance floor."  
</P>
<P>
 Wells Fargo President Paul Hazen, Reichardt's heir apparent, says it is more 
likely that Wells will use its surplus resources to buy back large quantities 
of its stock on the open market, though no plan to do so has been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Reichardt has ordered loan officers to start a lending push aimed 
at businesses and consumers. The goal is a 9% increase in loans this year. Well 
Fargo's loan portfolio has shrunk 30% since the recession began three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The "go-forth-and-lend" edict amounts to a wager that California's economy is 
poised for revival. It also represents a formidable challenge to a bank that 
does business only in California while employment growth and business activity 
remain flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Other banks, including archrival Bank of America, are not so optimistic about 
economic prospects. Bank of America Chairman Richard Rosenberg has said he 
expects any expansion of B of A's loan portfolio in 1994 to come from outside 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichardt, interviewed in his office adorned with original Frederic Remington 
drawings, confessed that his upbeat view of the future is based less on what 
economists say than on "anecdotal evidence from the business men and women I 
talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether they may agree with him, bankers invariably take note of 
what Reichardt is saying and doing. A cigar-smoking wine connoisseur, he enjoys 
an elevated status among his colleagues because of his 38-year track record in 
California banking. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a man's man . . . who thinks like a shareholder," said billionaire 
Warren Buffett, whose investment company has made hundreds of millions of 
dollars from its 12.2% stake in Wells Fargo. "I'm very happy he's running the 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have not always been so kind to Reichardt. Four years ago, when it 
appeared that the bank's commercial real estate loans and risky commercial 
loans could be its undoing, Reichardt was the target of brickbats from Wall 
Street and unwanted scrutiny from banking regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wells Fargo halved its dividend in late 1991 and added heavily to its 
reserves for loan losses, some braced for the worst, said Larry Vitale, a bank 
analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. Applying the experience of Eastern banks, bears 
feared that Wells would lose 25% of its $13-billion commercial real estate loan 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the bank back on track, the dividend restored and just 7% of the bad 
loans written off, Reichardt apparently has been vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wells' experience turned out to be better than other banks," said David S. 
Berry, director of research at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. "Why? Not because 
Southern California real estate held its value any better than New England. It 
didn't. It was because, at the end of the day, Wells was underwriting its loans 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reichardt learned how to make loans at Union Bank, which he joined in 1960 
after serving in the Navy during the Korean War and earning an economics degree 
from USC. He quickly rose through the ranks, and headed Union's commercial real 
estate loan operation in Orange County before joining Wells Fargo in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Though conservative, Reichardt has been an innovative manager. His bank was an 
early pioneer in offering mutual funds to keep depositors. He also resisted the 
common wisdom that bad loans should be sold in bulk at big discounts. He chose 
instead to nurse them back to health, and avoided the huge write-offs that such 
bulk sales invariably required. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl's like the head of a small-town bank in Nebraska who knows the 
borrowers, controls his expenses and knows the nuts and bolts of the bank," 
Buffett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Reichardt raised eyebrows by fighting public battles in the early 1990s 
with bank regulators, whom most executives avoid antagonizing. He fought a 
losing, highly visible skirmish in 1991 with regulators who insisted Wells 
Fargo write off a $100-million corporate loan while the borrowers were still 
making the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichardt's obsession with cost control has made Wells Fargo the most 
efficient major retail bank in the nation, but the changes have been painful 
internally. About 1,000 branch jobs have been eliminated in the last year 
alone. Executives either meet sales goals and adhere to budgets or they are 
shown the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichardt can be abrasive. He is known for yelling at subordinates who don't 
measure up. "When he believes in you, he gives you a lot of rope," said Jack F. 
Grundhofer, a former Wells Fargo executive who is now chairman of First Bank 
System in Minneapolis. "But he's tough, and he expects results. You have to 
earn what you get, you're not entitled to it because you have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Reichardt sees himself as an entrepreneur whose main goal is to improve 
profits for shareholders, including himself. Including options, he owns nearly 
548,000 shares of the bank's stock, currently worth more than $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought of myself not as a banker, but as a businessman who 
happens to be running a bank," Reichardt said. "The average banker who has been 
around a long time has the mind set of a civil servant, in terms of cost 
control and having a guaranteed income for life." 
</P>
<P>
 The approach seems to be working. The bank earned $612 million in 1993, and 
Wall Street is predicting profits of up to $850 million for 1994. That's quite 
a rebound from 1991, when Wells Fargo posted a meager $21-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells' burden of problem assets has been reduced sharply, to $1.5 billion last 
December from $3 billion in September, 1992. Most encouraging to analysts, 
Wells Fargo was able to reduce bad loans dramatically in 1993 without having to 
take enormous additional loss provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investors have bid up Wells Fargo stock to more than $140 a share, double its 
price just 15 months ago. In addition to Buffett's profits, the jump has also 
meant a huge windfall for investor Walter Annenberg, who owns 7.2% of Wells 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Wells Fargo employees have also gotten rich, due to a wide-ranging 
stock option program and an employee stock ownership plan begun in 1984, when 
Wells stock sold for $9 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people here have a million bucks in stock," Reichardt said. "I think 
it's good to have senior managers of a company be substantial shareholders. 
That way, they think like owners, not hired guns." 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of avoiding interviews while the bank grappled with its 
massive pile of bad loans, Reichardt said he now feels freer to talk. The 
discussion in his office was centered on his favorite themes: cutting costs, 
shareholder value and spreading ownership of the bank among employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If shareholders do well," he said, "then employees are happy, because they 
are big stockholders around here. Happy employees treat customers better. . . . 
So, if those three constituencies are served, the company as a whole is going 
to do well." Wells Fargo's Road to Recovery 
</P>
<P>
 PROBLEM ASSETS 
</P>
<P>
 Problem assets have been falling from a high of nearly $3 billion at the end 
of September, 1992 (quarterly, in billions of dollars): 
</P>
<P>
 1990: 1Q: $1.159 2Q: $1.269 3Q: $1.209 4Q: $1.429 1991: 1Q: $1.592 2Q: $2.011

1Q: $2.510 2Q: $2.319 3Q: $2.074 4Q: $1.563 
</P>
<P>
 ANNUAL PROFIT 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 10 years, profits have fluctuated wildly, particularly since 
1990 (in millions of dollars): 
</P>
<P>
 1984: $169 1985: $190 1986: $274 1987: $51 1988: $513 1989: $601 1990: $712

BELL AND COX HANG UP ON JOINT CABLE VENTURE; COMMUNICATIONS: THE $4.9-BILLION 
AGREEMENT TO FORM A PARTNERSHIP COLLAPSES AFTER THE FCC VOTES TO CUT CABLE TV 
RATES ANOTHER 7%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwestern Bell Corp. and Cox Cable Communications on Tuesday scrapped an 
agreement to form a $4.9-billion partnership to exploit cable TV, telephone and 
interactive opportunities, after failing to renegotiate the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies said the agreement collapsed after the Federal 
Communications Commission voted to cut cable rates 7% on top of a 10% rollback 
that went into effect last year. The decision, which will reduce cable company 
revenues, also threatens to unravel a flurry of other deals made between 
telephone companies and cable operators last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp. 
scuttled a merger plan. Furthermore, a stock offering by Los Angeles-based 
Falcon Cable TV was suspended and an investment by Bell Canada in Jones 
Intercable is in renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rate regulations also appear to have complicated other cable TV deals 
in the works, including the possible sale of Cablevision Systems Corp., which 
has been in conversations with Time Warner Inc., US West and GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the cancellation of the Southwestern Bell-Cox Cable deal is 
another blow to the vaunted information superhighway, which the companies 
touted as the reason for entering joint ventures at such a breakneck pace. In a 
related development on Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co.'s proposed acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. 
violates the landmark consent decree that broke up AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint ventures and mergers between cable and telephone companies were 
designed to help facilitate the 500-channel future that would allow TV viewers 
to watch movies on demand, shop and bank from home as well as provide 
traditional telephone and data services. Now it could be several years before 
those services are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have maintained that the canceled mergers are in fact a hardball 
tactic by the powerful telephone and cable industries to strong-arm and 
embarrass the Clinton Administration into providing more support on 
telecommunications issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration wants to foster the growth of new 
telecommunications by allowing the telephone companies into the cable TV 
business and vice versa, the FCC has acted to implement new cable TV 
legislation aimed at curbing rising cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC Chairman Reed Hundt rejected the claim that the regulatory agency was to 
blame for the failed joint venture. The recent FCC decision, he said, "in no 
way put an end to new ventures in the telecommunications area." He noted that 
the failure to agree on a price in a "growing, developing industry" is "not 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the Southwestern Bell-Cox Cable deal, the two companies 
would have pooled their cable TV assets to become the country's third-largest 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately owned Cox would have contributed its 21 cable systems valued at $3.3 
billion, while Southwestern Bell would have supplied $1.6 billion in cash. The 
joint venture would have then been poised to go public or acquire additional 
cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kahan, Southwestern Bell's senior vice president for strategic planning, 
said the FCC's rate rollback "significantly hinders the ability of the 
partnership as initially structured to meet its growth and financial 
objectives. . . . We concluded that it's unlikely the cable industry can 
generate the cash flow we expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Cable TV companies complain that the rate rollback will substantially cut into 
their cash flows, which they need to cover debt repayments. Many cable TV 
companies are highly leveraged because they were sold in recent years or have 
borrowed money to upgrade their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, both companies said they will continue to push forward 
independently despite the failed plan to merge their cable TV assets. Cox said 
it still plans to test-launch a "full service network" in Omaha, Neb., next 
July combining cable TV, telephone and other interactive services.

ECONOMIC INDEX DECLINES, EASING INFLATION FEARS; RECOVERY: THE 0.1% DIP IN THE 
INDEX OF LEADING INDICATORS FOR FEBRUARY SHOWS THAT THE GROWTH RATE IS NOT 
EXCESSIVE, ANALYST SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 In an economic report that helped drive Tuesday's rebound in the stock market, 
the Commerce Department said its latest index of leading indicators showed a 
decline after six straight monthly gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The February dip of 0.1% in an index that is supposed to forecast economic 
trends nine months ahead was interpreted on Wall Street to mean the robust 
recovery is easing some, which may slow the rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But many economists dismissed the report as skewed by severe weather that 
hampered building in February and briefly closed some factories. They also said 
a slowing of the economy's heated fourth-quarter momentum was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The index had risen a strong 0.4% in January, the sixth consecutive increase, 
as total national output of goods and services steadily gained momentum. In the 
October-December quarter, economic growth hit a 7% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an indication that the economy is not on an explosive growth course," 
said economist Lynn Reaser of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. She said 
she expected gross domestic product to slow to a healthier 3.5% rate of growth 
in the first quarter that ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Tuesday's leading-indicator report, long-term interest rates 
declined to 7.29% from 7.4% the previous day. It helped trigger the 82.06-point 
rebound in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
 The reversal in the Dow halted a slide blamed on investor fears that the 
economy was growing too strongly and that the Federal Reserve would be forced 
to push interest rates still higher to dampen inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even people with a lot of faith in that index don't think one month means 
anything," said Adrian Throop, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in 
San Francisco. "You need at least three months." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there are initial economic reports from March that show continued 
strength in the economy. On Monday, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management 
said its manufacturing index posted a seventh straight rise last month and said 
weather was no longer a drag on industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading index measures a basket of economic indicators ranging from 
unemployment benefit claims to building permits. Six of its 11 components were 
weaker in February, while four showed some improvement from January and one, 
plant and equipment orders, was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The signals of declining activity in February came primarily from a shorter 
average work week and fewer building permits. Both were adversely affected by 
severe winter weather in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 The positive indicators in February were lower commodity prices, slower vendor 
deliveries, fewer initial unemployment pay claims and higher order backlogs. 
</P>
<P>
 If fears of an overheated economy are subsiding, California had no such 
concerns to begin with. Although the state is apparently in the initial stages 
of a modest recovery, it lags well behind the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to talk about the national economy getting overheated, you have 
to realize that a good chunk of the excess (manufacturing) capacity is right 
here in California," said Ted Gibson, principal economist at the state 
Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're fairly optimistic that the little recovery we've got going is not 
being derailed at this point." Index of Leading Indicators

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WHICH WAY WILL WALL STREET GO -- BULL OR BEAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street's spectacular rebound Tuesday will help calm worries about an 
imminent market meltdown. But will it be enough to put the bulls back in the 
driver's seat? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials leaped 82.06 points to 3,675.41, retracing about one-fifth 
of the index's total loss from its '94 peak to Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the horrendous selling over the past week alone, the market was clearly 
ripe for a snapback, traders noted. Once the bond market settled down on 
Tuesday, bargain hunters poured back into stocks across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But will the buyers keep coming in the short run? To bet on that, you have to 
believe that the market massacre of the past week wasn't enough to turn the 
tide of investor sentiment against stocks. If the majority of institutional and 
individual investors have quietly grown cautious or outright bearish about the 
market, new rallies could fade quickly, buyers' willingness to risk capital in 
stocks will ebb, and the bull market born in 1990 will soon be history. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, there are plenty of good arguments that the past week was simply the 
tail end of a classic 10% "correction" in stock prices, the kind bull markets 
are supposed to endure periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalyst for much of the selling has been the surge in bond yields to 
15-month highs, a reaction -- or overreaction -- to expectations of continuing 
strong economic growth. The bullish case is that growth moderates, inflation 
stays low, and long-term interest rates ease or at least stabilize. Investors 
will then focus on improving corporate earnings, and stocks will be off to the 
races again -- or so the bulls hope. 
</P>
<P>
 But that assumes that the frightening volatility in stocks and bonds since 
late January, after two years of record low volatility, hasn't changed 
investors' view of the risk in those markets. It also assumes that investor 
sentiment hasn't been significantly altered by the knowledge that the Federal 
Reserve Board is pursuing a tighter-money policy for the first time in five 
years, which will inevitably mean higher short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gauging investor bullishness or bearishness in the aggregate is impossible, of 
course, so Wall Street has come to rely on a handful of regular surveys of 
small investors, money managers and independent investment newsletter writers. 
And not surprisingly, those surveys show bearishness on the rise as markets 
have been jolted. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest weekly investor survey by the Chicago-based American Assn. of 
Individual Investors showed that the percentage of respondents who are bearish 
on stocks leaped to 44% last week from 34% in mid-March and just 24% in early 
February. In contrast, just 23% of respondents are bullish now, and 33% are 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 When this week's Investors Intelligence survey of investment newsletter 
writers is released today, it's expected to show a sharp rise in bearishness, 
from last week's 39% (versus 42% bullish and 19% expecting a mere correction). 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Wall Street loves to view these surveys as "contrarian" indicators. 
In other words, when the majority of investors or advisers are bearish it may 
actually be a bullish sign, because high bearishness may indicate there are 
plenty of people (and dollars) available to enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, when the bulls dominate it may indicate that most people are 
already in the market, and that there are relatively few idle dollars left to 
push stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are times, experts warn, when bad news is bad. "What you have to ask 
is whether you're seeing (growing) bearish sentiment in a bull market, or in a 
bear market," says Bernard Schaeffer at the Investment Research Institute in 
Cincinnati. Sentiment can waffle a great deal within a bull market, and that's 
when buying on dips -- in prices and in investors' short-term mood swings -- 
can pay off, Schaeffer says. 
</P>
<P>
 When the market trend has turned, however, and the bull cycle has peaked, 
rising bearishness tends to feed on itself, Schaeffer notes. 
</P>
<P>
 For examples of how vicious and long-lasting such sentiment shifts can be, you 
need only look at the steep declines in many drug, food, financial and utility 
stocks over the past year. Once investors decided they no longer wanted to own 
these stocks, and prices began to slide, the attitude toward them grew 
increasingly bearish -- and for the most part has stayed that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, it was easy to argue that utility stocks, for instance, had 
been severely clipped from their 1993 highs, and that they looked like 
bargains. But investors' interest in the stocks continued to wane, and the 
result has been further compression of the stocks' prices, in some cases to 
four- or five-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the bull market as a whole now entered the same phase? It's too early to 
tell. Tuesday's rally was encouraging, not only for its breadth but also for 
the heavy buying of the industrial, technology, transportation and other 
economy-sensitive stocks that have led the market since fall, and which would 
be expected to lead any surge to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's time to be vigilant for signs that investor sentiment toward 
stocks has turned -- that people are thinking much differently than they have 
since 1990 about the market's potential. If bearishness in investor surveys 
increases and stays high, yet stocks fail to get much of a lift over the next 
month or so, it will be a strong clue to stop viewing bad news as good news for 
the market. 
</P>

discontinue its two daily flights between Long Beach and Dallas/Fort Worth, 
effective June 16.American offers no other flights out of Long Beach. Bill 
Morton, American's managing director of field services said, "Despite our best 
efforts, our operations at Long Beach continue to be unprofitable. We've 
enjoyed being part of the community here, but the long-term survival of our 
company has to be foremost among our objectives." American said 12 employees 
are affected by the move and will be offered employment with the carrier at 
other airports.

 American Express Co. Spins Off Brokerage: Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. detailed 
its $3.3-billion spinoff, which will create the nation's third-largest 
brokerage firm.Under the plan, American Express stockholders will receive 
one-fifth of one share of Lehman's common stock for each Amex common share they 
hold. American Express said in January it was spinning off the brokerage house 
in a bid to focus on its core travel and information services businesses. After 
the spinoff is completed, which is expected by the end of the second quarter, 
American Express' sole interest in the firm will be preferred shares. It will 
have no seats on Lehman's board. Lehman is applying for a listing on the New 
York Stock Exchange so its shares may be traded. Lehman will be the No. 3 
brokerage after Merrill Lynch & Co. and Paine Webber. American Express will 
invest $1.25 billion in Lehman before the spinoff.

NATIONAL MEDICAL PLANS REVIEW OF ITS CORPORATE STAFFING; HEALTH CARE: THE 
HOSPITAL OPERATOR HAS HIRED A CONSULTING FIRM TO HELP STREAMLINE THE 
ORGANIZATION AND LAYOFFS ARE EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After selling off 85 of its 135 hospitals and clinics during the past year, 
National Medical Enterprises said Tuesday that it's time to trim costs at its 
overstaffed corporate headquarters in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-shrinking hospital operator said it hired management consultant 
McKinsey & Co. to conduct a "bottom-up" review of the organization. That review 
is expected to result in an undetermined number of layoffs among its 900 
corporate office employees and, possibly, the relocation of its Santa Monica 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many hospital firms, National Medical expanded quickly during the 1980s, 
a decade of rapid growth for the health care industry. More recently, however, 
the industry has been consolidating rapidly in response to the prospect of 
national health care reform and intense pressure from employers and health 
insurers to reduce medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a period of heavy growth, you do develop a lot of overhead and you stop 
analyzing whether what you're doing is necessary," said Christi Sulzbach, 
senior vice president and associate general counsel. "Now we are being asked to 
deliver health care in a method that has never been required before -- in a 
very cost-effective manner." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, NME sold 27 physical rehabilitation hospitals and clinics to 
HealthSouth Rehabilitation Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 And, last month, it reached a final agreement to sell 47 psychiatric 
facilities to Charter Medical Corp. It has sold several other facilities to 
other buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow said the corporate review is part of a previously 
announced strategy to focus resources on its core business: general acute-care 
hospitals. The company operates 35 general hospitals, which provided more than 
70% of its $3.8 billion in revenue -- and most of its operating profit -- last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 NME's rapid divestiture of assets also has been prompted by significant legal 
problems, mostly involving activities at its psychiatric hospitals. Since 
September, the company has paid about $230 million to settle various lawsuits 
brought by insurers and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unresolved is a federal criminal investigation -- disclosed last 
September after FBI agents raided NME facilities nationwide -- into alleged 
insurance fraud and illegal payments to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulzbach said the company's legal problems are a factor in the decision to 
streamline its corporate structure. "In light of some of our past problems, we 
need to be very aggressive and very trend-setting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulzbach said the 300,000-square-foot headquarters has more room than the 
company needs, especially after the expected layoffs. NME is considering 
leasing part of the building or relocating to other sites in the Santa Monica 
area or the San Fernando Valley.

PACE OF MOTOR VEHICLE SALES LOOKS PROMISING FOR SPRING; AUTOS: DETROIT'S BIG 
THREE ARE BOOSTING PRODUCTION TO MEET DEMAND. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS CALLED THE 
KEY TO A BIG NEW-CAR YEAR.

 Auto makers today are expected to report a robust 20% gain in car and truck 
sales for March, but analysts warn that consumers may get cautious and cause a 
slowdown later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, however, the outlook is strong, with estimates of March 
sales running at an annualized rate of 16 million vehicles, including imports. 
</P>
<P>
 "March looks pretty awesome," said analyst Bernard Campbell of DRI-McGraw Hill 
in Boston. "All signs are that March may be one of the best months of the year, 
if not the best month of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in March, 1993, ran at a rate of about 13.3 million units, including 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, sales of U.S.-built vehicles alone are expected to top that level, 
with domestic sales in March estimated at about 13.6 million units, up from 
13.3 million in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. has said March was likely to be an all-time record sales month, 
as it delivered between 12,000 and 13,000 new Neon cars. Chrysler Marketing 
Vice President Thomas Pappert said industry sales for the year could reach 16 
million units. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that Chrysler's estimates may be overly bullish, however, and 
that 15.5 million units is more likely. 
</P>
<P>
 But they agree that sales should remain strong in April and May, the customary 
spring selling season. "We feel confident that we'll have selling rates around 
16 million for the next couple of months," said analyst Michael Luckey of the 
Luckey Consulting Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. Executive Vice President Ed Hagenlocker said he expects truck 
sales to set a new record for March. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry was really running very strong in March, and ran very strong in 
February," Hagenlocker told reporters at Ford's Cleveland Engine Plant No. 2. 
"I would anticipate again the truck industry setting all-time record sales in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car industry has gotten considerably stronger," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the demand, Detroit's Big Three plan to boost second-quarter 
production 11.6% from the equivalent period last year, to 2.71 million units, 
according to Ward's Automotive Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit trade publication said General Motors Corp. plans to increase its 
second-quarter production 13.3%, to 1.28 million units. Ford will raise 
production 6.8%, to 1.0 million units, and Chrysler has scheduled an 18.9% hike 
to 428,000 units, Ward's said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five European auto makers reported Tuesday that their March sales in the 
United States rose a collective 26.4% from March, 1993. Bavarian Motor Works 
(BMW) car sales rose 16.5% to 7,283 units; Volvo's sales rose 39.6% to 8,804 
cars; Saab Automobile sales rose 10.8% to 2,335. 
</P>
<P>
 Porsche's U.S. sales rose 64.4% to 457 units; Land Rover sales fell 8.4% to 
336 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Automotive analysts said the boom may taper off during the second half of the 
year, if interest rates continue to climb and consumer confidence falters. "We 
could see sales slow down a bit," said Lehman Bros.' Joseph Phillippi. "The 
line never goes straight up." 
</P>
<P>
 The stumbling stock market's effect on consumer confidence is particularly 
worrisome, since there are millions of relatively new investors in stocks and 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts generally said they expect sales to hold in the 15-million-unit range 
through 1996. The record year for auto sales in the U.S. market was 1986, when 
auto makers sold 16.3 million vehicles.

PEOPLE: NOVELL HIRES HEWLETT-PACKARD EXEC FOR TOP JOB; COMPUTERS: THE SOFTWARE 
GIANT NAMES ROBERT J. FRANKENBERG PRESIDENT. HE IS NOTED FOR STRATEGIC 
THINKING. 
</P>

<P>
 Novell, the software giant that plans to merge with WordPerfect so that it can 
better challenge industry leader Microsoft, on Tuesday named a veteran 
Hewlett-Packard executive to succeed Chief Executive Raymond J. Noorda. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Frankenberg, who becomes Novell's president and chief executive, 
leaves Hewlett-Packard after 25 years, most recently as vice president and 
general manager of the personal information products group. He is credited with 
engineering a dramatic two-year turnaround of Hewlett-Packard's laggard 
personal computer division. 
</P>
<P>
 Noorda, who will continue as Novell's chairman, last year vowed to relinquish 
the day-to-day running of Novell by his 70th birthday this June. At that time, 
he disclosed that memory lapses were starting to interfere with his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Novell's decision last month to buy WordPerfect and Borland 
International's spreadsheet business in deals valued at more than $1.5 billion, 
concerns about who would assume the reins at this critical juncture have dogged 
the Provo, Utah-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having to integrate the two big acquisitions, Frankenberg also 
faces stepped-up competition from Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, which is 
trying to horn in on the fast-growing market for networking software. Novell 
has dominated that market for products to connect office computers since its 
introduction a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he intended to compete with Microsoft, viewed by many as an industry 
juggernaut intent on squelching all rivals, Frankenberg said in a telephone 
news conference: "A key element will be delivering solutions that Microsoft is 
not delivering. . . . It's always good to go where your competitors aren't or 
where they have difficulty following." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenberg, 46, has won plaudits from high-tech counterparts and investment 
analysts as a strategic thinker adept at stabilizing operations at 
Hewlett-Packard.

 His appointment appeared to put to rest anxiety in the investment community. 
In anticipation of the announcement -- which had been widely rumored but was 
not official until after the close of the stock market -- Novell rose $1.50 per 
share to close at $18.375 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real coup for Novell," said Robert Corpuz, an analyst with 
Dataquest, a San Jose market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 A fan of science fiction, Italian cooking and deep-sea and fly fishing, 
Frankenberg has had a long relationship with Novell, serving for several years 
as a liaison on matters relating to networking products when he headed 
Hewlett-Packard's network group. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Chippewa Falls, Wis., Frankenberg received a bachelor's degree in 
computer engineering from San Jose State University. He joined HP in 1969 as a 
manufacturing technician in the former data systems division. He was promoted 
to various research and development, management and marketing positions in the 
1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Frankenberg has led the multibillion-dollar personal information 
products group. He moved quickly to slash costs and improve marketing, using 
steep price cuts to more than double sales of PC products in 1993 from levels 
the year before. Among other steps, he reduced support staff to nine people 
from 300. In 1993, the division's expenses were less than in 1991, but business 
had more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob has a steady hand for managing growth businesses," Noorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenberg will join Novell's board of directors. With his arrival, Novell 
will dissolve its office of the president, members of which will continue their 
responsibilities and report to Frankenberg.

 VCRs, Remotes to Become Cable-Friendly: Some cable television viewers will 
soon be able to take full advantage of their videocassette recorders, special 
TV set features and universal remote controls, thanks to new Federal 
Communications Commission regulations.The regulations will be phased in between 
May 31 and Oct. 31. But subscribers will still have to buy or rent additional 
equipment, at least in the short term. Cable operators have prevented most 
subscribers from using the remote controls that come with their TV sets by 
turning off that capability in set-top boxes. For technical reasons, cable 
subscribers have not been able to record one program while watching another or 
use the picture-in-picture option on many new TV sets.VIDEO EQUIPMENT

CONTINENTAL AIRLINES TO RESTORE PAY CUTS; TRAVEL: THE CARRIER ALSO ANNOUNCES 
NEW PROFIT-SHARING, EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP AND RETIREMENT PLANS. 
</P>

 Continental Airlines said Tuesday that it will give employees a stake in the 
Houston-based carrier and also restore remaining pay cuts ordered in 1991 when 
the airline was struggling to emerge from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental said it would grant about a million shares, or about 4%, of its 
common stock. After the company emerged from bankruptcy in April, 1993, it 
authorized the issuance of common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, the workers had to take an average 10% pay cut. Since 1991, 
three-quarters of that cutback has been restored and Tuesday the airline it 
said it would restore the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline will also offer new benefits that include profit-sharing, 
restoration of lost raises and a 2% overall raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The total incentive package, aimed to reward employees who remained with 
Continental, will boost the average worker's compensation about 13.5%, 
according to company sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental also will offer employees a new 401(k) retirement plan and the 
ability to buy the airline's stock at discount prices along with a 15% 
distribution of pretax profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came after Continental Chief Executive Robert Ferguson began 
a series of meetings Tuesday with managers to discuss the future of the 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental said in the announcement that it was cutting operations at its 
Denver hub to 86 flights in the summer as part of its plan to relocate nearly 
900 flight attendants and pilots to other flight operations in the carrier's 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline also said it will halt flights to 10 cities, including Reno; 
Portland, Ore.; Islip, N.Y., and New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has embarked on a plan to restructure some of the airline's 
operations after rival Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. came out with its 
new CALite no-frills air fares. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline has still been laboring to turn itself around after escaping from 
bankruptcy in April 1993 and reported a loss in February and predicted a loss 
for the first quarter.

IBM UNVEILS FIRST 2 LOWER-COST MAINFRAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 International Business Machines Corp., in an aggressive bid to revive sunken 
revenues in its core business, Tuesday unveiled the first two models of its 
lower-cost, microprocessor-based mainframes. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional mainframes run on a small number of big, expensive processors. 
The new computers are designed for transaction processing and database queries. 
</P>
<P>
 The new mainframes, with high-powered computing capabilities, are also suited 
for scientific and technical users, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM also said it added five new models to its existing ES/9000 family of 
mainframes, including one model with 10 processors, called the 9X2. This new 
model provides 22% more power than IBM's ES/9000 Model 982, which has eight 
processors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant also said it was changing its software 
pricing structure for mainframe customers to a pay-for-use structure for major 
systems, a move that would cut costs for customers by up to about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is we heard you when you told us the total cost of computing is 
important," said Nicholas Donofrio, an IBM senior vice president and general 
manager of the large-scale computing division. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes two days ahead of an important anniversary for IBM. On 
April 7, 1964, IBM unveiled the IBM 360 mainframe, the first system to 
computerize the Fortune 500. It helped launch the Computer Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The 360 was the first important product in what would eventually become IBM's 
mainframe empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a humbled IBM -- struggling to return to consistent profits and revenue 
growth -- has been forced to deal with a confluence of industry events, such as 
the move by computer users to lower-cost personal computers, called clients, 
linked by hardware boxes called servers that control data and functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, computer hardware margins have plunged and IBM's mainframe sales 
have tumbled 50% to about $6.6 billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite dwindling revenues for IBM's core mainframes, Donofrio said demand 
continues to be strong for the ES/9000 high-end mainframe computers and the 
company could remain sold out of its biggest systems into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Donofrio said the new systems will help solve some of the demand problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to pan out in a very balanced way," he said, adding that 
customers who can move some of their data processing requirements to the new 
parallel server machines will do so. "If they fit, they will go." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's announcement comes a week after Amdahl Corp., a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based 
manufacturer of large-scale computer systems, said it will develop mainframes, 
called database servers. 
</P>
<P>
 Amdahl, which called its earlier announcement a preemptive strike against 
rival IBM, expects to roll out the first database server "within the next 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's new mainframes are based on IBM's S/390 microprocessors, which are 
designed using lower-cost technology and are compatible with IBM's current 
S/390 mainframes.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; IN THE HEART OF MEXICO, HE PLANS TO CLEAN UP; MEDIA: 
NEWSPAPER OWNER ALEJANDRO JUNCO INTENDS TO TAKE ON THE POWERFUL AND THE 
CORRUPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing death threats for El Norte's criticism of the Mexican government, the 
newspaper's owner, Alejandro Junco, fled Monterrey for the safety of a Laredo, 
Tex., ranch 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. media quickly protested the mistreatment of a colleague, and 
President Jose Lopez Portillo intervened. Junco returned just a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 "They almost drove him out of business," said Robert Jeffrey, former 
journalism dean at Junco's alma mater, the University of Texas. "He was under a 
great deal of pressure, but he's very persistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Junco is going to need that persistence for his latest project: a Mexico City 
newspaper designed to clean up Mexico's tainted journalism. Some say the new 
capital city paper could even reshape the country's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first edition's splashy appearance on the anniversary of the Mexican 
Revolution in November, the new paper, Reforma, ran stories that criticized the 
sale of television stations to media giant Grupo Televisa and alleged vote 
rigging in Yucatan elections. And columnists from the left and right offered 
political balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has caught on like wildfire," said Pat Nelson, editor of the 
English-language Mexico City News and a former El Norte columnist. "The other 
papers are very worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Junco invested $50 million of El Norte's money to launch Reforma, Corazon de 
Mexico, and he's betting on a system of home delivery to capture a growing 
middle-class audience. He's forecasting 300,000 circulation from a current 
30,000 and has vowed to keep Reforma diligently independent. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where more than 30 journalists have been killed in the past 
decade, Junco's strength is his willingness to take on the powerful, staffers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have any veneration for politicians," said a Reforma reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Junco insists he has no political ax to grind, but the arrival of the paper 
was trumpeted on shoeshine stands with a green banner that read "Reforma -- For 
a Cleaner City." In the capital, where many say corruption is as pervasive as 
air pollution, that message wasn't subtle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't care less about politics," Junco, 45, said during an interview in 
his corner office of the Reforma newsroom. "We are just out to be a good mirror 
of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, that could be controversial enough. It's also sweet revenge for a 
man the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has consistently tried to 
muzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 When he became publisher of El Norte in 1973, few would have predicted the 
24-year-old Junco could make that newspaper, founded by his grandfather, 
Monterrey's most prominent, with 147,000 readers. Especially because that same 
year El Norte had dwindled to 12 pages after a state-owned company cut off its 
newsprint supply in retaliation for criticism of President Luis Echeverria. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was at UT, he was an average student," said Richard Pennington, who 
is preparing biographies of famous foreign UT graduates. "He showed no promise 
of greatness." 
</P>
<P>
 But Junco's stay at UT left a deep impression. Two weeks after returning to 
Monterrey, he started a journalism school at El Norte aiming to stamp out 
corruption among his peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mexican journalists supplement their small incomes by taking bribes in 
exchange for flattering stories. To avert big-city corruption at Reforma, Junco 
hired 100 local university students with no journalism experience from 2,700 
applicants and taught them the rules of aggressive, hard-hitting journalism, El 
Norte style. 
</P>
<P>
 El Norte succeeds, in part, because its pro-business stance reflects the 
people of Monterrey's frustrations with Mexico City bureaucrats. Junco says 
Reforma will copy some features of El Norte, including a board of readers to 
provide feedback on the paper's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Reforma will also copy El Norte's political opinion polls, unique for a 
Mexican paper, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local reporters were hired to give Reforma a Mexico-City flavor, but all of 
its executives are from Monterrey and the paper reflects the character of 
northern Mexico, which tends to be more direct, businesslike and Americanized. 
</P>
<P>
 That influence extends beyond business practices. Junco jogs and rides a 
mountain bike near his home in the exclusive Desierto de los Leones section of 
Mexico City. In a country where smoking is widespread, "Gracias Por No Fumar" 
signs dot the paper's office. Alcohol isn't served at the annual Christmas 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 While many executives in Mexico ensconce themselves in penthouse suites, Junco 
seems to relish democratic touches, strolling around the newsroom and dropping 
in on editorial meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's no doubt who's in charge. Junco began a contest among employees 
to name the new newspaper, but disregarded the top two entries. Instead, he 
glanced at a street sign on the main boulevard, Paseo de la Reforma, and made a 
spontaneous decision alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything has gone according to plan, though. A Dow Jones & Co. 
investment of 49% in Reforma fell through.  
</P>
<P>
 Technology may be Junco's biggest innovation, especially in a country where 
labor is so cheap. Reforma is Mexico's only fully computerized newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Junco plans to use technology to create a profile of each reader, tailoring 
editorial content to different areas of the city and, eventually, individual 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to turn a profit in a couple of years," said Junco, adding that he 
would sell shares in the company to raise capital for other ventures, such as a 
Latin American electronic publishing project.

 Japan's Trade Surplus Rose in February: The current account surplus rose a 
modest 0.1% in February from a year earlier, the Japanese government said, but 
economists said it's too early to tell whether growth in the surplus has 
peaked.The current account, the broadest measure of trade, includes goods and 
services. The Finance Ministry said the current account surplus -- a bone of 
contention with the United States -- inched up to $11.94 billion in February 
from $11.93 billion a year earlier. The overall surplus in global trade, 
meanwhile, rose to $12.93 billion in February from $12.62 billion a year 
earlier.

 GATT Predicts Growth in World Trade: World trade should expand by 2.5% to 5% 
this year, depending on the extent and timing of economic recovery in Japan and 
Western Europe, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.GATT, 
in a report to be released today, said that in volume terms, global exports 
grew by 2.5% in 1993, slowing their rise after expanding 4.5% a year earlier. 
In value terms, merchandise trade dropped by 2% to $3.58 trillion last year. 
Slack trade growth was due mainly to recession in Western Europe, where exports 
and imports fell for the first time in 40 years.

 Russian Auto Maker Suspends Production: Russia's ZIL car plant said it is 
sending more than 60,000 workers on forced leave for one week, after 
non-payments by clients forced the auto maker to halt its main production line. 
The layoffs were also aimed at fending off possible financial threats to its 
joint venture with Caterpillar Inc., which assembles ZIL trucks with U.S.-made 
engines, a factory spokesman said. ZIL officials said the Russian company needs 
an immediate cash injection of at least $17 million to stay afloat.

US FACILITIES ANNOUNCES BUY-BACK PLAN; MARKET: REPURCHASE INVOLVES UP TO $5 
MILLION WORTH OF SHARES. BROKERS SAY THE COSTA MESA FIRM IS TRYING TO BOLSTER 
VALUE OF STOCK, WHICH CLOSED AT $9.50 A SHARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking advantage of what investors might see as a bad situation, US Facilities 
Corp. said Tuesday that it intends to buy back up to $5 million worth of its 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the stock, which closed at $9.50 a share Tuesday, has fallen 
below what company officials believe it is worth and the repurchase 
announcement is an attempt to bolster its value. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called stock buy-back plans frequently are launched when the stock market 
is falling -- more than 100 were announced in the days after the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average -- the leading market indicator -- lost 508 points on 
October 19, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two weeks -- despite an 82-point recovery Tuesday -- the market 
has lost 187 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers say they have not seen a flood of buy-backs, however, and some don't 
believe the market has fallen enough to cause one. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, only one other large publicly traded company has announced a stock 
repurchase plan. Fidelity National Financial Corp., an Irvine title insurance 
company, said March 31 that it might buy back up to 1 million of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fidelity "could be trying to counter a threatened rise in interest rates 
and continuing soft housing sales," said Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president of 
Newport Securities, a Costa Mesa brokerage. Both things threaten the company's 
revenue, which is dependent on home sales and mortgage refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most-often given reason by companies for a repurchase is that they feel 
their stock is undervalued and that they can buy it back and increase the 
per-share value of what's left in circulation," Kilpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The broker, who specializes in the stock of locally based companies, said he 
also believes there often is an unstated reason for stock repurchases. "The 
management gets personally insulted that the stock has sunk so low and they 
think that by issuing a buy-back notice they are showing the world that their 
stock is underpriced and that they are backing up that belief with the 
company's own money." 
</P>
<P>
 If US Facilities moves ahead with the repurchase -- and several brokers said 
that about half of all so-called buy-back plans are never completed -- it would 
acquire the shares both in private sales and on the Nasdaq over-the-counter 
market, where the stock is traded. 
</P>
<P>
 The repurchase plan, approved by the company's board of directors, 
"underscores the board's current view that the marketplace is not reflective of 
the long-term confidence we hold for the future of our company," said George 
Kadonada, US Facilities' chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities sells and underwrites medical stop-loss insurance, provides 
managed care and medical bill review products and writes policies that help 
property and casualty insurers cover any losses they experience.

BRIEFCASE: HEALTH CARE; IRVINE-BASED CARELINE MAKES NEW BUY IN QUEST TO BE TOP 
AMBULANCE SERVICE

 CareLine Inc. is speeding ahead with its strategy to become the nation's 
largest ambulance operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company said Tuesday that it has signed an agreement to 
purchase Life Line EMS, an ambulance service in Wichita Falls, Texas, for an 
undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal follows by a week an announcement that CareLine is planning to raise 
$60 million by selling corporate IOUs so that it can have a war chest for 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed takeover still needs federal regulatory approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive M. Keith Huzyak said that he wants CareLine to become the 
largest publicly held ambulance operator in the United States. The dream so far 
appears daunting -- CareLine is half the size of rival American Medical 
Response Inc. of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1992, CareLine has bought nine ambulance operators in 
five states: California, Alabama, Colorado, Atlanta and Massachusetts.

 $611,000 Deal: Mortgage banking company Network Financial Services Inc. of 
Costa Mesa said it has signed a letter of intent to purchase Renet Financial 
Corp. in Anaheim in an all-stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Network Financial, the holding company for Westmark Mortgage Corp., said it 
would issue 650,000 preferred shares -- with each share convertible into 10 
common shares -- to purchase privately held Renet. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's closing price of 94 cents a share, the deal would be worth 
$611,000. If completed, the acquisition would more than double Network's 
estimated loan production this year to about $1 billion.

 Fast-Paced Medicine: Integrated Health Services Inc. is expanding its business 
to accommodate patients on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange company said that it is adding an outpatient center at its Orange 
Hills facility. Outpatient care is one of the fastest-growing segments of the 
health care industry because it allows patients to see doctors and be treated 
in settings that are less expensive than hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokesman Phillip Joujon-Roche said that the addition of the 
outpatient center is a natural for Integrated Health Services, which operates 
so-called subacute centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Subacute centers are a hybrid of hospital wards and nursing homes. They 
accommodate patients too sick to send home but not ill enough to require the 
24-hour care that a hospital provides.

 FDA Approves Device: Luther Medical Products Inc., based in Tustin, has the 
inside track on a $50-million market, thanks to a decision by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The maker of medical catheters said on Tuesday that it has received FDA 
approval to begin selling its silicone catheter, Sil-Cath, a device that was 
invented several years ago by Ron Luther, the company's founder and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The catheter is unique because it has a "peel-away" needle system. The needle 
splits to allow catheters to be inserted into patients. Once the catheter is in 
the body, the needle is peeled off and discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA approval comes two years after Luther Medical won a patent battle over 
the peel-away needle, which was designed because of fears over needle 
contamination in the wake of the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's announcement that the company can begin selling the product 
immediately means that Luther Medical is the nation's sole supplier of the 
product.

TV RATINGS; CBS CHALKS UP A WINNER IN 'CHRISTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 CBS may have another "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" on its hands after the 
two-hour premiere Sunday night of the new family series "Christy," which 
finished No. 5 for the week in household ratings and generated hundreds of 
phone calls to CBS on Monday from grateful viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, CBS narrowly lost the weekly prime-time ratings race again to 
ABC, which has banged out four straight wins after CBS dominated the Nielsens 
during the Winter Olympics, according to A. C. Nielsen Co. figures released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Dr. Quinn" found a solid audience on Saturday night, CBS developed 
"Christy"--starring Kellie Martin, Tyne Daly and Tess Harper--based on the 
award-winning novel about a young woman who leaves a privileged city life to 
teach at a missionary school in the Smokey Mountains before World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC scored big Wednesday by sandwiching two new sitcoms--"Thunder Alley" and 
"These Friends of Mine," starring comedian Ellen DeGeneres--with dual episodes 
of the season's No. 1 program, "Home Improvement." All four shows Wednesday 
finished in the Top 10, along with the one-two punch Tuesday of "Roseanne" and 
the debut of "These Friends of Mine." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's Friday debut of "Sister, Sister," a sitcom about two identical twins, 
finished a respectable No. 18 for the week, ABC's best performance in that 8:30 
p.m. time slot since 1987. Southland Ratings 
</P>
<P>
 Here are A. C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area 
during the same week. Each rating point equals 50,064 households.

VIOLENCE IN COFFEEHOUSES GIVING SOME THE JITTERS; CRIME: SPATE OF SHOOTINGS 
PROMPTS THE VIETNAMESE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, CITY OFFICIALS TO PONDER THE LINK 
BETWEEN JAVA, ATTACKS.

<P>
 Ngoc Nguyen's refuge is a corner of the Bolsa Mini Mall, where stale cigarette 
smoke mixes with the fragrant steam of murky coffee and sweet, condensed milk. 
</P>
<P>
 He comes for the atmosphere at Ca Phe Luc Huyen Cam, an 11-year-old 
coffeehouse on Bolsa Avenue named for the six strings on a guitar: the Keno 
game on the television set, the muted click of Chinese Chess pieces and the 
iced black coffee served by a waitress who knows his order without asking. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, he seeks the hazy warmth of one of the nearly 60 Little Saigon 
cafes scattered throughout northern Orange County. But now, mindful of the 
gunfire that has erupted in three Vietnamese coffeehouses and restaurants in 
Garden Grove and Westminster in the last nine days, Nguyen is becoming 
increasingly selective about his retreats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem is with young kids who grew up here," said Nguyen, 34, a 
baker who usually caps off the night shift with iced coffee and a game of pool. 
"This never happens in the coffeehouses in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 The spate of violence, which has left two people dead, has so alarmed the 
Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce that the group's board of directors is scheduled 
to meet tonight to develop a peace strategy for the coffeehouses, a cultural 
institution transplanted from the streets of Saigon to the heart of Southern 
California's Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
 The business leaders will debate proposals to limit the night hours of 
coffeehouses or increase security with brighter lighting. City officials have 
also vowed to consider shortening the night hours of the coffeehouses, which in 
the past have been licensed without much controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about (the violence) bringing down tourism," said the 
chamber's president, Co Pham. "I think it's very important for the business 
leaders to work with the police departments and city officials of Westminster 
and Garden Grove to prevent this from happening again." 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster police said the two shootings in their city came after more than a 
year free of violence in cafes. Police Chief James Cook said he does not 
believe crime in the area is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really aren't experiencing a lot more crime in the area, but when you have 
a homicide like this, the seriousness of the crimes draws attention," Cook 
said. Patrols in the area, however, will be stepped up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Pham moved his own medical offices out of a Bolsa Avenue 
strip mall next door to Pho Tien Cahn, a coffeehouse and restaurant where an 
off-duty security guard shot and killed one man and wounded another after he 
was attacked by a group of people in the crowded cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Tu Anh Tran, 22, of Garden Grove was charged with murder, attempted 
murder and robbery in connection with that attack. Tran's alleged accomplice 
died in that shooting, and state law allows him to be charged with murder when 
a "provocative act" results in deadly force and death. Tran is scheduled to be 
arraigned April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard, in plainclothes, was not charged because "there was no 
evidence of criminal activity," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a group of gang members, saying they wanted the guard's handgun 
and mace canister, attacked him from behind with a tire iron and wooden sticks, 
knocking him to the floor as he tried to pay his bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said the problems of a few coffeehouses are tainting the reputation of 
other restaurants in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the regular habitues of other coffeehouses are quick to defend their 
cafes, and even quicker to blame the violence on customers. They complain about 
young toughs, late hours and owners who have lost control.  
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday afternoon, Peter Hong, 32, staked a window seat at Ca Phe Luc 
Huyen Cam. Hong, a cafe regular for more than 10 years, said he has been 
spending more time there lately after losing his job as a computer programmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything "depends on the attitude of the owner," Hong said. "Here they don't 
provide the atmosphere for youngsters to come in and enjoy themselves. Here the 
customers are more mature, not as risky. At night, there is security here and 
it is very safe." 
</P>
<P>
 But since the shootings, city officials are debating the link between java and 
guns.  
</P>
<P>
 "Until this violence, I never paid much attention to them," mused Westminster 
Councilman Frank Fry Jr. "Someone comes in and says we want to serve coffee and 
no alcohol -- fine, no problem. Who thinks about shoot-'em-ups with coffee?" 
</P>
<P>
 The coffeehouses -- which generally feature menus heavy on caffeine and light 
on food -- have bloomed in Westminster and Garden Grove since the mid-1970s. 
The three shootings have only confirmed fears about the coffeehouses, said Paul 
Tran, a writer and patron of coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 27, two men walked into Cafe Mozart on Westminster Boulevard in 
Westminster and opened fire. One person was killed and three others were 
wounded. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 In Garden Grove, gang investigator Bruce Davis blamed the latest shooting, 
which occurred Monday night at the Cafe Truc Mai in the 10500 block of 
Westminster Avenue, on a spat involving a woman and two suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting left one person critically wounded and two others hospitalized. 
Police said three men with handguns ordered a customer to step outside. When he 
did, the shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case of too many boyfriends and not enough girlfriends," Davis said.

SUPERVISORS TACKLE ILLEGAL LAND GRADING; ENVIRONMENT: FEARS OF LANDSLIDES, 
OTHER LAND-USE PROBLEMS PROMPT BOARD APPROVAL OF FINES AND OTHER CIVIL-COURT 
PENALTIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Frustrated that developers have continued to secretly grade sensitive open 
space in the south Orange County foothills during the past several years, 
county supervisors moved Tuesday to halt the illegal practice with tougher 
court penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was spurred by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who said the incidents 
have left properties vulnerable to "dangerous land movements." 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become a serious problem. It is a destructive action," Vasquez said 
of the illegal clearings that are often performed on weekends, away from public 
view and reported to authorities only by upset neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst cases, county officials said, the property clearings can 
seriously alter hillside drainage routes, threatening properties with possible 
landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you cut into the side of a hill and dump the excess dirt over the other 
side, it might look fine when it's finished," said Patrick J. Stanton, the 
county's manager of development services. "But when it rains, that dirt might 
be moving on top of a neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms approved Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors included a schedule 
of fines and other civil-court penalties to go with existing criminal 
misdemeanor punishments for violators. 
</P>
<P>
 The new penalties allow the county to collect up to $250 in fines for each day 
the property owner violates grading regulations or is clearing sensitive 
hillside property without a grading permit. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials now may also obtain restraining orders to halt ongoing 
grading projects not in compliance with county regulations, and warrants will 
be issued to inspectors to gain access to areas under development. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that warrants are needed because "some landowners have refused 
permission to enter their property to review the grading, effectively stopping 
the enforcement process in some cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the county's Environmental Management Agency assigned two inspectors 
to handle grading violations. It is hoped, officials said, that the increased 
enforcement would either deter the practice or speed compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen grading violations are pending with the agency, including property 
owners Robert Schuller Ministries and the Santa Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said the Schuller violation involves storing 20,000 yards of dirt on 
the ministry's property in San Juan Capistrano. The ministry reportedly allowed 
a local contractor to place the dirt there while the contractor worked on an 
adjacent flood control channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Co. was cited for placing too much fill material in San 
Juan Creek in constructing a bridge over the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, Stanton said, the owners are working toward compliance with 
county regulations, and neither case will be referred for further action by the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 18 pending cases, only one has been referred to the district attorney's 
office. It involves the grading of property owned by Lawrence Properties in 
Modjeska Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said the land, which is just off Santiago Canyon Road, is made 
available for wedding receptions and other events. "Most people don't realize 
they are involved in a grading-code violation until it's done," Stanton said.

NEW SUSPECT IS NOW SOUGHT IN DOUBLE SLAYING; INVESTIGATION: HUNTINGTON BEACH 
POLICE GET NEW INFORMATION FROM PEOPLE WHO SAW THE CRIME. THE MAN THEY 
DESCRIBED EARLIER IS NOW CONSIDERED ONE OF THE WITNESSES.

<P>
 Based on new information from witnesses to the slayings of two young men in 
the downtown district last week, police said Tuesday they are looking for a 
different man in connection with the fatal shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police released a new composite drawing of the gunman, describing him as an 
olive-skinned man of Latino or Middle Eastern ancestry, relatively tall, 
slightly heavy, 25 to 35 years old, who was wearing a dark-colored jacket, 
baseball cap and loose-fitting pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, police described the shooter as a longhaired white man with goatee 
and glasses. Police now say this man is considered a witness and may have 
information that can lead to the capture of the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also said Tuesday that the gunman escaped in a late model Saab 900 
Turbo after shooting Chen Cosmo Maui Blanchard, 23, and Kenny Paul Sommer, 23, 
both of Huntington Beach, on a downtown corner last Thursday night. The car was 
being driven by another man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said last week that witnesses had seen the shooter walk calmly away 
from the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised composite of the gunman is based on "new information coming from 
witnesses" and not the result of any mix-up in the police investigation, Lt. 
Charles Poe said. "There was no mix-up," he said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said that just before the killings, the longhaired man apparently had an 
argument with the victims over their urinating on the sidewalk. That, Poe said, 
initially led investigators to believe the longhaired man may have been the 
shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given (the argument), it seemed logical to assume" that he had carried out 
the slayings, Poe said. Police say the shootings were not gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place in the redeveloping downtown district, filled with 
sidewalk cafes and shops, which has become popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say the area is also attracting gang members and "gang wanna-bes" 
looking for trouble. However, city officials say crime downtown has become less 
of a problem since redevelopment began 10 years ago.

HOME MADE FOR WOMEN; SANTA ANA SHELTER PROMISES HOPE, HELP FOR SINGLE MOTHERS, 
CHILDREN 
</P>

 Calling the ceremony "a celebration of good news," a team of social service 
workers, private contractors and city officials Tuesday kicked off what will be 
one of the county's few shelters that caters to single homeless women and their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Regina House -- two renovated bungalows in the French Court neighborhood that 
date to the early 1900s -- will offer not only shelter but referrals for job 
training and affordable housing, tutoring for children and counseling for up to 
seven women and 11 children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we open the doors of a place where mothers don't have to disgrace 
themselves and little boys can laugh," said Larry Haynes, executive director of 
the Mercy House Transitional Living Center, which will run the shelter and 
already operates another one in Santa Ana for single homeless men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercy House philosophy aims to get employable people back on their feet, 
and encourages participants to be independent in order to prepare them for the 
trials they will soon face on their own, Haynes said. The women will stay at 
the houses on Bush Street with their children for six months, cook for 
themselves and pay "rent," which will be held in savings accounts for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Project backers who waited three years for the Regina House to come to 
fruition praised the collaboration between private donors, public money and 
nonprofit agencies, and lauded the French Court Neighborhood Assn. for 
welcoming the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike what is so common elsewhere in our county, when the idea came up, the 
NIMBY (not-in-my-back-yard) defense shield did not go up immediately," Santa 
Ana Councilman Robert L. Richardson told a group of about 50 supporters 
gathered for the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes, now immaculately redesigned and decorated with art prints, were 
rotting from age and had to be reconstructed. While everything from the 
windowsto the foundation are new, volunteer architects remained true to the 
houses' original design, said Kermit Dorius, who acted as the liaison between 
contractors and Irvine-based HomeAid Orange County, which was credited for 
helping financing the project. 
</P>
<P>
 About $300,000 was donated by more than 100 contractors and designers for the 
Regina House project. The city of Santa Ana provided $128,000 in financing from 
redevelopment funds, and Irvine contributed $47,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding over the opening ceremony was Father Jerome T. Karcher of St. 
Joachim Church of Costa Mesa, who founded the Mercy House Transitional Living 
Center five years ago while living at St. Anne's parish in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 Homeless activists in Orange County say the Regina House should help erode 
stereotypes of the homeless as mentally ill or drug-addicted single men.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nationwide and in the county, the fastest-growing group of homeless are 
families and children, and in that group, single mothers are the fastest 
growing," said Tim Shaw, executive director of the Orange County Homeless 
Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force study released last year said 30% of the county's estimated 
12,000 homeless people are children with an average age of 8. Other surveys 
indicate the percentage could be as high as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a single mother can put women at an increased risk of homelessness, 
particularly since private child care in the county runs about $100 a week and 
government assistance for women with dependent children has been cut 
continuously during the recent fiscal crisis, Shaw said. While family shelters 
in Orange County accept single women, he said, there are few services that 
strive to specifically meet the needs of single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the women who stay here to reroot themselves in society . . . to 
discover their goodness as we are good to them," Karcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kendrick, who was president of the French Court Neighborhood Assn. when 
the project was approved three years ago, said it wasn't an easy sell.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a neighborhood association, we said, 'What do we really want in our 
neighborhood? Do we want another house filled with overcrowding?' " Kendrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighborhood decided we'd rather have something that had controls, and 
with those controls we got a really good project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients are now being screened for the program, and two graduate students who 
will staff the houses are expected to move in next week, Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an incredible need. Every day we get dozens of phone calls from 
people looking for shelter," said Lisa Mastropietro, administrative director of 
Mercy House Transitional Living Center. "People are just in desperation, 
calling everywhere they can think of."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY'S A.M. SURFERS TO GET FREE PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Silva says surfers need a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva persuaded the City Council on Monday night to start legal procedures 
that will allow free early-morning parking at city meters near a popular 
surfing area.He said the move also will help free nearby residential areas from 
parking by surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (change) would relieve parking congestion in the residential 
neighborhood adjacent to Golden West and 22nd streets for the early morning 
surfing crowd, plus it would benefit surfers who don't use the beach all day 
but only surf in the morning before work or school," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva's proposal would allow meter-free parking in the city's Blufftop Park 
area. That park faces the Pacific Ocean and parallels Pacific Coast Highway. 
Surfers flock to the bluffs area because of good wave action. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking meters at Blufftop Park currently are in force between 5 a.m. and 
dusk. Silva proposes that the meter hours in that area be changed to 8 a.m. and 
dusk. Surfers could thus park free in the park area in the early-morning hours, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other members of the City Council agreed with Silva's arguments. By 
unanimous vote, the council instructed the city attorney to draft an amendment 
to the city's parking ordinance so that the meter hours can be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The "free surfing" time change will not go into effect until the amendment is 
drafted and adopted, probably within the next two months. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SHUTTLE MAY SET SAIL FROM CITY TO 
CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Catalina Island soon may be more than just a lovely vision on Huntington 
Beach's horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Coastal Commission has already approved proposed tourist shuttles 
via sailing vessel between Peter's Landing in Huntington Beach to Avalon on 
Catalina. And on Tuesday, the state Public Utilities Commission held a public 
hearing in Huntington Beach City Hall on an application for commission approval 
for such shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
 Orville Wright, the administrative law judge who conducted the hearing, later 
will write a decision either recommending for or against the shuttle 
application, said Kyle Devine, a spokeswoman for the utilities commission. She 
said the five-member commission then would vote on the matter, probably by next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The applicant, Sail Catalina, proposes to use a sailing vessel, rather than a 
ferry, to transport visitors from Huntington Beach to Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory A. Parker, president of Sail Catalina, said that he wants to provide 
motor-sailing to Catalina in the mornings, taking about 75 minutes from Peter's 
Landing. He said the vessel on its return to the mainland would take from 1 1/2 
to 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Huntington Harbour (Peter's Landing) location will be more convenient for 
the residents of Huntington Beach," Parker said in a letter to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, in turn, have been enthusiastic about the proposal. They 
envision the proposed island shuttle service as bringing more tourists to the 
city. The shuttle would be a boon to the Peter's Landing commercial complex at 
Huntington Harbour, said Diane Baker, president of the Huntington Beach 
Conference and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bureau views this project as another asset to add to the list of what to 
see and do while in Huntington Beach," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Barbara Kaiser said a shuttle link to Catalina 
Island would be a new economic stimulant for the city. The new service also 
would be unusual, she noted. "None of the existing Catalina carriers provide an 
opportunity for passengers to enjoy sailing," Kaiser said.BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A city famous for its small, winged denizens will get a visit from the 
decidedly lesser known "land swallow" Saturday during the annual Follow the 
Swallow Run. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, city organizers are encouraging entrants to dress up like 
swallows.The best-dressed swallows will win prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 runners are expected to enter the 10-kilometer event, which 
has separate categories for wheelchair entrants, and a shorter 4-kilometer 
course that encourages people to both walk and run. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled is an untimed, one-mile run for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in participating should register in advance, although entries 
on the day of the event will be permitted. Advance registration is available at 
the city Community Services Department, 31421 La Matanza St. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who register on the day of the race can do so starting at 6 a.m. at Cook 
Park at Calle Arroyo and La Novia Avenue, where all the races will start. The 
entry fee is $20 for the 10K run and $13 for the 4K event. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; LAW FIRM TO HELP ON BASE FINANCIAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A law firm has been hired to help prepare a financial plan to pay for new 
roads, sewers and power lines that must be built at the Tustin Marine Corps Air 
Station to make the base an economic asset to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting as the Redevelopment Agency, the City Council on Monday picked the law 
firm of McDonough, Holland and Allen from among four applicants to provide 
legal services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento-based company, which city officials describe as experts on 
redevelopment law and base closure, will be paid $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to assemble the best possible team to draft a redevelopment 
strategy," said City Manager William A. Huston. He said that the city needs 
about $200 million to build the new infrastructure at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,620-acre helicopter base is scheduled to close in 1997. A 17-member 
panel, made up of business, government and community leaders, is currently 
drafting a reuse plan that will be submitted to the U.S. Department of the 
Navy, which owns the base, for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The reuse plan is not expected to be completed until late summer, officials 
said, and it could take another year before the Navy approves a final reuse 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the city is readying a separate plan to convert the base to a 
redevelopment area once the military leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the City Council hired the planning company Katz Hollisto draft a 
financial plan that would likely include selling bonds to pay for the cost of 
developing the base, Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonough, Holland and Allen will provide legal services to Katz Hollis, such 
as reviewing documents, preparing notices and drafting the ordinance that would 
designate the base as a redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment Program Manager Richard Zimmer said the base will be declared a 
blighted area because of the amount of improvements needed. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 4 HOME-INVASION ROBBERS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are seeking a group of teen-agers who forced their way into a home in 
the 13000 block of Palomar Street early Tuesday, tied up the owners and fled 
with an undisclosed amount of money and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the robbery took place between 5:00 and 5:30 a.m. The two 
victims, whose names were not revealed, described their assailants as four 
Asian teens who had pulled their shirts over their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt, said Officer Marcus Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the county's latest home-invasion robbery. Since 1991, more than 150 
such attacks, conducted mainly by Asian and Latino gangs, have been reported in 
Westminster, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, authorities have said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's Environmental Management Agency will hold a public meeting 
next Wednesday to discuss its plans to build a four-mile connector road in the 
Horno section of South County near Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The connector road -- the last leg of the master-planned Antonio Parkway 
project -- will connect Oso Parkway to Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The road will be built on grazing land owned by the Santa Margarita Co. When 
completed, Antonio Parkway is expected to relieve congestion on Interstate 5, 
according to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The session will be held at 7 p.m. at the Mission Viejo Country Club, 26200 
Country Club Drive in Mission Viejo.  
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, county officials will present preliminary plans as well as 
listen to community concerns about the project. A start date for construction 
has not yet been determined. E.J. GONG JR.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COUNCIL WEIGHS PLAN TO DEVELOP PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are considering an ambitious $15-million plan to build several 
new community recreation centers at local parks, one a year for the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council and staff talked about the tentative plan during a three-hour 
study session on Monday.The proposal calls for recreation centers at Rosita, 
Delhi, and Santa Ana Memorial parks, with the fourth center to be built at 
either Carl Thornton or Santa Anita parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have suffered with a severe shortage of parks and the proposed 
centers will offer greater recreational opportunities. Under the proposal, each 
new center would cost about $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks department personnel are drafting a formal recommendation for the 
council to consider. Ultimately, the city plans to build seven new parks and 
expand seven others by the year 2020, said Allen E. Doby, executive director 
for Recreation and Community Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers would offer sports, arts and crafts and other activities and would 
be paid for with a combination of grants, loans and tax increment, said City 
Manager David N. Ream. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Patricia McGuigan said the centers would offer ideal community 
meeting places and would also be a cost-effective way to help reduce crime and 
deter children from joining gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got an opportunity for education, recreation and prevention of 
problems. Certainly it's less expensive than adding a whole host of police 
officers to deal with crime," she said. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; DIVING TEAM POOLS FUNDS FOR BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marina High School's diving team, which has no high-dive board and a low board 
in disrepair, hopes to raise thousands of dollars for new boards by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the school and Huntington Beach Union High School District don't have 
the money to buy new boards and stands, members of the 22-member diving team 
and their parents are turning to the community to raise about $14,000 for the 
new boards, said Georganne Proulx, diving representative for Marina Aquatics 
Booster Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been told the school or the district isn't doing anything. . . . So 
we're (buying) them and donating them to the school," Proulx said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's diving pool has two low boards, one of which is in good 
condition, said diving coach Greg Price. The other needs replacement. The high 
dive was so worn out it was removed, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Jim Keatingsaid replacing the diving boards has been a top priority. 
But the 30-year-old school is aging and money instead has been spent on 
replacing generators and re-roofing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is (the money) will not come out of the general fund of our 
school or district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proulx said one parent has donated $1,000 and students have raised about $250. 
A silent auction and dinner is planned for May, but the group needs a place to 
hold it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to install the boards this summer and have the new boards 
ready for use by next February when the diving season begins, Proulx said. 
</P>
<P>
 With new boards, Proulx also said Marina High School could host diving meets 
again, which would boost school spirit and enable operation of a snack bar to 
help raise money for the booster club. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the lack of a diving board means students must travel to other 
schools to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Vines, a diver for three years who hopes to land a college scholarship 
in the sport, said that to excel she needs a high dive for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to dive in college and get really good," said Vines, who is among the 
top divers in the district. "But without the board, it's kind of hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be mailed to 4186 Shorebreak Drive, Huntington Beach, Calif. 
92649 and checks made payable to Marina Aquatics Booster Club. More information 
is available by calling Proulx at (714) 893-1018. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COTO DE CAZA; TOLLWAY DRIVER WAS ONE IN A MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't exactly winning the lottery, but Bill Riechers was happy nonetheless 
with the $25 he won Tuesday for being the millionth driver to use the Foothill 
tollway since it opened last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Riechers, 42, had just tossed in two quarters at 9:15 a.m. when his car was 
rushed by Transportation Corridor Agencies officials eager to congratulate him. 
A startled Riechers wondered, "Did I do something wrong?" but relaxed when told 
of the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've liked to have seen a few more zeros at the end of the $25 check, 
but at least it makes up for all the money I've spent so far to use the road," 
Riechers joked. 
</P>
<P>
 TCA officials took back the symbolic check and gave Riechers a FasTrak card 
good for $25, or 50 one-way trips. The card, when used with a transponder, 
enables motorists to drive through toll collection points at highway speed, 
while the toll is electronically debited from the driver's account. 
</P>
<P>
 Riechers uses the 3.5-mile toll road about twice weekly when driving from his 
home in Coto de Caza to a paint manufacturing plant in Irvine. He is a 
part-owner of the plant. He has been using the road since it opened last 
October 16, but had never bothered with a FasTrak card. 
</P>
<P>
 TCA spokesman Mike Stockstill said that some 9,000 vehicles use the Foothill 
tollway daily, up from 5,000 vehicles that used the road each day when it 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 TCA officials hope to eventually build 68 miles of toll roads in southeastern 
Orange County, including the Eastern, San Joaquin Hills and Foothill 
transportation corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's brief ceremony at the toll collection point caused Riechers to be 
late for work at R.E. Hart Labs, which manufactures environmentally safe paints 
and coatings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It threw my schedule off a bit. I'm not used to all this attention, but it 
was fun being the one-millionth customer," he said in a telephone interview 
from his office.H.G. REZA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; IRVINE; UCI TO GET TAPES BY HOLOCAUST 
SURVIVORS 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County scholars soon will be able to hear about the Holocaust in the 
words of its survivors and heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith will donate to UC 
Irvine hundreds of hours of videotaped interviews with county residents who 
lived through the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 90 people who were imprisoned in Nazi death camps during World War II, 
sheltered Jews in basements and homes or served in military units that 
liberated prisoners from internment camps have been interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation is part of the Anti-Defamation League's Oral History Project, 
developed to record the experiences of local survivors, league spokeswoman 
Susan Molk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will present the tapes at 9 a.m. Tuesday to begin a program of 
remembrance held at UCI called "Never Again: From Intolerance to Genocide." The 
symposium will be held April 12 and 13 at the UCI Student Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Keneally, a UCI professor of English and comparative literature who 
wrote the novel "Schindler's List," is scheduled to give an address about "The 
Holocaust from a Gentile's View" at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. Presentations Wednesday 
will include a history of genocide as well as a discussion about hate groups 
and hate crimes in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oral History Project is an ongoing program conducted by the 
Anti-Defamation League in major cities across the country, Molk said. For 
information about the Oral History Project in Orange County, call the 
Anti-Defamation League in Santa Ana at (714) 973-4733. For information about 
the symposium, call UCI at (714) 856-5588. ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DEPUTIES' PAY RAISES TO BE 7% OVER 3 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies will get a 7% pay increase over three years, 
according to a new labor contract approved Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's unanimous decision culminates an eight-month wage dispute during 
which deputies engaged in two "blue-flu" protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county firefighters Monday night reached a tentative agreement of 
their own, which is expected to give them a comparable increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Davis, a county personnel manager, declined to discuss details of the 
firefighters' contract until it is ratified by the Orange County Firefighters 
Assn. membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter union President Dallas Jones could not be reached for comment 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs' pact provides for no 
raise in the first year of the contract -- which runs from last October -- but 
3.5% increases in each of the final two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Salary increases amount to at least $130 per month for the average deputy, who 
makes about $47,500 each year. Terms of the contract call for officers to get 
their first raise on Oct. 28 this year and the second on Oct. 27, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some (deputies) who still have some questions," said Bob MacLeod, 
who is general manager of the association. "But generally, everybody is 
extremely pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,300-member deputies association raise will cost the county $5.2 million 
at a time when financial concerns have forced officials to maintain a freeze on 
employee hiring throughout the county. In the past two years, revenue shortages 
have forced the layoff of about 50 county employees and the elimination of 
hundreds of vacant positions. The county budget is $3.5 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies' contract was approved with no discussion from the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, two units of deputies staged separate sickouts in protest of the 
long contract dispute.  
</P>
<P>
 The 450-member firefighters' union has been working without a contract since 
July. Monday's tentative agreement represents a breakthrough in negotiations, 
which had been stalled since Feb. 17.KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL TO ADDRESS PARK-BIKE PATH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to transform a dusty railroad right-of-way into a park and bike path 
will come before the City Council on May 10, officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A council hearing on the proposal would be the next step in the controversial, 
decade-long process of developing the Northwood village park. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural drawings that depict how the linear park would look were 
unveiled at a public hearing last week. The drawings met with general praise 
from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the park plan unique is that it was designed with an unusual amount 
of public input. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of people took part in a daylong seminar earlier this year in which 
noted San Francisco architect Lawrence Halprin moderated a discussion about how 
the park should be designed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, a walkway and bike path would be built in the center of an 
80-foot-wide, 1.4-mile-long strip of land. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at last week's meeting expressed concern about lighting for the 
park, said Kimel Conway, Irvine principal planner for project entitlements. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing the park would cost about $1.5 million. If the council approves the 
general outline for the park, city officials will prepare more finalized plans.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SANTA ANA; REGISTRAR TO ASK FOR PROBE OF 
CANDIDACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney said Tuesday that he will 
ask the district attorney to investigate whether former sheriff's candidate 
Bonnie Rae Streeter lied about her qualifications to gain a place on the June 7 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes after Streeter's name was removed from the ballot last week 
by an unprecedented court order in which she was found to be lacking basic 
law-enforcement experience as required under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Streeter could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton has raised the possibility of 
Tanney's office taking responsibility for investigating the qualifications of 
local candidates to avoid future court actions on similar election issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we have been very passive on this," Stanton said. "I would like 
to see what we can do to help the registrar be more aggressive on candidates' 
qualifications." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton has asked County Counsel Terry Andrus to review the registrar's duties 
to see if the law allows Tanney to conduct such investigations. He has also 
asked registrar of voters staffers to resolve confusion that has hundreds of 
residents improperly using their business addresses rather than home addresses 
when registering to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The registrar does a marvelous job, but the buck has to stop somewhere," 
Stanton said. "The point of all this is, maybe that we have to redo the job 
description." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanney said that until the Streeter case, his office had never encountered a 
court challenge to a candidate's qualifications to local elective office, nor 
had he conducted investigations of candidate qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system seems to have worked very well up until this episode," Tanney 
said. "I think to get into an evidentiary hearing kind of thing would involve a 
lot of work on the front end that doesn't appear to be a problem in reality." 
</P>
<P>
 In Streeter's case, Tanney said, the candidate was required to sign a 
declaration of candidacy in which she stated having the proper qualifications 
for office. State law requires that sheriff's candidates be certified by the 
state Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training and law enforcement 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The California State Sheriffs Assn. and three local residents challenged 
Streeter's candidacy in court. Last Friday, Superior Court Judge Francisco F. 
Firmat found that Streeter did not possess the proper qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Streeter vowed last week to continue her campaign as a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Tanney said, he will refer Streeter's case for investigation 
by the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "She swore that she met the qualifications when she signed the declaration of 
candidacy," Tanney said. KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; FREEWAY CREW ERROR CAUSES LENGTHY SNARL TRAFFIC 
DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An error in judgment by a crew working on improvements to the Riverside 
Freeway caused an hourlong traffic delay Tuesday morning, with westbound 
traffic backed up for about seven miles, according to Caltrans and the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix-up occurred when a stripping crew for Traffic Safety, one of the 
subcontracting companies working on the Riverside Freeway project, ground up 
more asphalt than they could clean up within the time allotted and had to 
remain on the job nearly five hours past its 5 a.m. daily shutdown time, said 
Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 The grinding is needed to erase old stripping, which is being replaced with 
new stripes that conform to new alignments on the widened road, Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was being done on a section of the freeway between Kraemer Boulevard 
and the Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda said car-pool lanes are being added to the Riverside Freeway and 
improvements are being made to the on- and off-ramps at Tustin Avenue and at 
the Kraemer Boulevard and North Glassell Street exchange, all part of the 
two-year project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project has been going on for almost a year and we've only had a few of 
these (mistakes)," Miranda said. "We try to keep them to a minimum by making 
sure that contractor and subcontractor coordinate their activities around 
normal commuter hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a onetime incident that is not going to happen again," he said.

ROTH PLEDGES NOT TO LOBBY OFFICIALS THROUGH '97; GOVERNMENT: FORMER 
SUPERVISOR'S ACTION COMES AFTER THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THREATENED TO 
BRING NEW CHARGES AGAINST HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Orange County Supervisor Don R. Roth has agreed not to lobby any local 
officials for three years after questions arose over whether he violated a 
lobbying ban imposed by his probation in meeting with transportation officials 
who once served under him, lawyers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office had threatened to bring new charges against 
Roth over the lobbying issue. But they stopped short of that after Roth pledged 
not to do any political lobbying through 1997, effectively closing a potential 
embarrassing loophole in the deal that the former county supervisor struck with 
prosecutors last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth pleaded guilty in March, 1993, to seven misdemeanor counts stemming from 
his failure to report thousands of dollars in trips, loans, home improvements 
and other gifts from local business people and then voting on county matters 
that affected them. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the four-year lobbying ban, he was ordered to serve three years' 
probation, pay a $50,100 fine and perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea agreement prohibited Roth from working as a lobbyist, as defined by 
the Political Reform Act. Roth's lawyers later said that the law applied only 
to lobbying state officials -- not anyone in local government. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, they said, Roth remained free to lobby anyone he wanted at the 
local level, using his well-established political connections to push projects 
for area business people. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter that Roth sent to prosecutors March 25, however, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Guy Ormes said the former supervisor pledged not to do lobbying "at any 
level" through the end of his probation in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm satisfied that the terms of the original plea agreement are now very 
clear and there won't be any more lobbying," Ormes said in an interview Monday. 
"I am convinced it won't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth refused comment on the issue Tuesday at his Anaheim Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Paul S. Meyer, declined to release a copy of the letter, but he 
said: "We're satisfied that there was no probation violation, and the matter 
has now been put to rest. . . . This was all something of a misunderstanding, 
and I think it's been clarified." 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest twist in the Roth case appears to leave some room for 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
 Ormes said the letter outlining Roth's pledge to avoid all lobbying for the 
next three years will not become part of Roth's criminal case file. And Meyer 
made clear that he does not consider the March 25 letter a legally binding 
document, but rather a formal gesture "to simply satisfy them of Don Roth's 
good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had threatened to take Roth back to court to show that the former 
Anaheim mayor's apparent lobbying activities were at odds with the terms of his 
probation. But they ultimately agreed to drop the matter in exchange for the 
written pledge from Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors launched an investigation last December after The Times disclosed 
that Roth had met several times with county transportation officials to help 
retired aerospace engineer Jack Brennan of Fullerton pitch a stalled idea for 
converting buses to battery power. Brennan wanted up to $1 million in 
government research money to develop the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said at the time that Roth -- once among the most powerful politicians 
in the county -- had proved crucial in securing "introductions" for him, and in 
arranging meetings with people who used to work under Roth at the Orange County 
Transportation Authority. Roth served on the OCTA board for two years before he 
was forced to resign last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth had lunch last October with OCTA Chief Executive Officer Stan Oftelie to 
discuss Brennan's battery-powered bus idea. Later, at Oftelie's direction, Roth 
and Brennan met with two OCTA staff members who reviewed the proposal's 
strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan insisted that he never promised Roth any money for his work, but he 
acknowledged that he likely would have offered Roth a financial piece of the 
bus project if it succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth maintains that he was never acting as a lobbyist for Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 When the lobbying issue first surfaced four months ago, Ormes maintained that 
last year's plea agreement banned Roth "absolutely" from lobbying local 
officials on behalf of clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But he backed off that assessment this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we all understood (one year ago) that lobbying was lobbying, and it 
was not to happen. (But) arguably, there could be some difference of opinion as 
to how the Political Reform Act defines some of the terms," he said. While 
Ormes said he did not think there was a loophole for local lobbying, he said: 
"Clearly, it could have been argued that there was."

 A federal investigation into complaints of widespread discrimination in Orange 
County is being delayed by inquiries in Sacramento and Los Angeles, federal 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County investigation is also taking longer than expected, and a 
fact-finding hearing originally scheduled for spring will probably be pushed 
back until the summer, said Philip Montez, head of the Western regional office 
of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which oversees 10 states, including 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking on more than was anticipated," Montez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, an advisory panel of the commission ordered an inquiry into 
allegations that minorities in Orange County routinely face discrimination by 
local and county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Key complaints include the lack of minority representation in politics and on 
the Orange County Grand Jury, which has since taken steps to improve minority 
recruitment. Another subject of complaint was the practice in some police 
departments of photographing young people -- often Latinos or Asian Americans 
-- for gang mug books, even when no criminal wrongdoing is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 Montez said the scope of the investigation is widening to include looking at 
the scarcity of women in politics, as well as practices at several police 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot more work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, head of Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and a 
Latino leader who helped bring the complaints to the federal government's 
attention, said the delay will result in a more thorough investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it means that the commission is taking its task very seriously, 
waiting until it has enough time and resources to look at the complaints 
carefully and completely," Palacio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The date for a fact-finding hearing will probably be set by May 20, Montez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials in Orange County do not believe a hearing is warranted. If the 
advisory panel uncovers discrimination, however, it can forward the complaints 
to the Civil Rights Commission. The commission in turn can refer violations to 
other federal agencies for possible action. Violations can lead to losses in 
federal funding or even legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation in Orange County is continuing, but at a slower pace, Montez 
said. An investigation of hate crime allegations in Sacramento and complaints 
that several Los Angeles television stations discriminate against minorities 
have taken priority, he said.

DEFENSE RAISES PROVOCATION ISSUE IN SLAYING OF SAN CLEMENTE HIGH YOUTH; COURTS: 
HEARING WILL DECIDE WHETHER FOUR YOUTHS ARE TRIED FOR MURDER IN DEATH OF TEEN 
SPEARED THROUGH HEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Provocation was a key issue during a preliminary hearing Tuesday to determine 
whether four youths should stand trial on murder and other felony charges in 
the slaying of teen-ager Steve Woods, whose head was pierced with a paint 
roller rod. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for defendants Hector Penuelas, 18, Julio Perez Bonilla, Hector 
Penuelas and Rogelio Vasquez Solis, all 17, spent much of the six-hour 
preliminary hearing in South Municipal Court questioning sheriff's 
investigators about events surrounding the Oct. 15 confrontation at Calafia 
Beach County Park that led to the boy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a 17-year-old high school senior from San Clemente, was speared through 
the head and died several weeks later. He was a passenger in a vehicle pelted 
by rocks, beer cans, paint rollers and other items as it attempted to leave the 
beach parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 He and about a dozen friends in four vehicles had gone to the beach following 
a San Clemente High School football game. Six suspects, all from San Clemente, 
were arrested and charged in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first day of what is expected to be a two-day preliminary hearing, 
investigators testified that Woods and his friends were trying to drive from 
the beach parking lot and avoid a fight with the group of alleged gang members 
and their friends when the fatal attack occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 However, defense lawyers have argued that Woods' death came as result of a 
"freak accident" and that the defendants threw items because they thought the 
drivers were trying to run them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Much defense questioning Tuesday focused on the statements of two drivers who, 
in interviews with police, said they had indeed passed near some members of the 
opposing group during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 One driver said he had swerved to the right toward the group as he approached 
a dip in the road, investigator Marilyn Maddox testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the driver of the Chevrolet Suburban carrying Woods and three 
others said he had to swerve to avoid hitting somebody who was apparently 
waving at them to pull over, Investigator William Hunt testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just trying to get out," Hunt said. "It was a quick swerve." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer, however, Investigator 
Barth Massey testified that one defendant said those in his group had already 
rummaged around for items to throw before the vehicles passed by. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, the whole confrontation may have been sparked by an 
apparently harmless question asked by a friend of Woods about some parties in 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 As the friend left the gathering early to take two other people home, he 
passed a pickup truck carrying several of the defendants and thought it 
belonged to someone he knew from Oceanside or Carlsbad, Massey testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend made a U-turn and pulled up alongside the pickup, but it did not 
belong to his friend and a question about parties in San Juan Capistrano got 
him a punch in the mouth, Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend immediately went back to the gathering and told everyone they 
should leave. 
</P>
<P>
 A gang expert testified at a previous hearing for another defendant in the 
case that even the mention of San Juan Capistrano to rival San Clemente gang 
members could be seen as a challenge or hostile move. 
</P>
<P>
 The four juvenile defendants, who are being treated as adults, each face one 
count of murder, one count of conspiracy, 10 counts of assault, one count of 
throwing an object at a moving vehicle and a gang involvement enhancement that 
could lengthen their sentences if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 One adult, Juan Enriquez Alcocer, 20, of San Clemente, was ordered in December 
to stand trial, while a second, Arturo Villalobos, pleaded guilty in January to 
voluntary manslaughter and a gang-involvement sentencing enhancement. He still 
awaits sentencing.

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; LEARNING THE ABCS 
OF POLICE LINGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Used to be, everybody who was anybody at the Los Angeles Police Department had 
an acronym. The LAPD elevated the acronym to an art form with a veritable 
epidemic of acronym-itis during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD became riddled with units and divisions with $75 names. For example, 
paroled criminals were tracked by STAR TREC, which stood for the System to 
Account for Releases ThatRequire Extra Caution. 
</P>
<P>
 While the urge to create short, snappy names for the things police officers do 
has eased with time, the acronym continues to leave its indelible mark on LAPD 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, at the Devonshire station, cans of dog food decorate the desks of 
the fingerprint team, or Area Latent Print Officers, commonly known as ALPO. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have an acronym, you have to have a coffee mug and a T-shirt," said 
Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, former commander of the LAPD's Valley Division. 
"If you really emerge, you get a baseball cap with the acronym on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Acronyms provided the perfect marriage between police work's military and 
bureaucratic influences, as officers bandied about words such as interface and 
system to make them work. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, such rampant creativity led to controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 CRASH, for example, remains a popular acronym for a gang unit once known as 
TRASH. 
</P>
<P>
 CRASH -- short for the quaintly named Community Resources Against Street 
Hoodlums -- was the LAPD's substitute when some community leaders objected to 
the politically incorrect TRASH: Total Resources Against Street Hoodlums. 
</P>
<P>
 STORM was born out of the Hollywood Division's desire to dispatch its cars 
more efficiently, and initially stood for System to Overcome Residual 
Mismanagement. But the name was changed to System to Optimize Radio Car 
Management after the earlier version ruffled feathers at central dispatch 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker is an armchair student of the acronym, an admitted acro-phile. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he made sergeant, Kroeker said, he aspired to create the longest, 
most bureaucratic-sounding acronym. He succeeded with CONSTRUCT, the Committee 
on a New Systematized Transfer of Records Under a Centralized Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 It had to do with improving juvenile offender records, Kroeker explained. "I 
laughed with glee. It looked totally official," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in an oral exam for promotion, Kroeker was asked to give the meaning of 
his own acronym. He got that one right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test of a true LAPD acronym is when they ask you about it at your oral 
interview," he said. Candidates for promotion can spend hours studying long 
lists of acronyms. Kroeker can rattle them off at an impressive clip. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who have the political clout to pull duty in the office of Chief of 
Police Willie L. Williams enjoy the prestige of a short, sweet acronym that 
says it all: COP. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who deal with the press, work for CRO -- acronym-ese for the 
Community Relations Office. But they pronounce it "crow," and sometimes they 
wind up eating it. 
</P>
<P>
 PACE is not just a picante sauce. It is also the LAPD'S Police Assisted 
Community Enhancement unit, which helps citizens pick up trash and remove 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best-known acronyms are those that ooze coolness: CRASH and CAPS and 
BAD CATS. 
</P>
<P>
 CRASH, the gang unit that used to be TRASH, is found at most police stations. 
CAPS is the Crimes Against Persons Section, which handles everything from 
robbery to rape. BAD CATS is a double whammy, acronym-wise. BAD is the 
Burglary-Auto theft Division (although you could argue it should be BATD) and 
CATS is the Commercial Auto Theft Section. In case you missed that, they 
investigate car thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the height of the acronym craze, "We used to have sheets of acronyms 
published," Kroeker said. "I've always been delighted with them and I have 
always poked fun at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Count us among the converted. 
</P>
<P>
 Henceforth, STREET stands for Space Totally Reserved to Entertain, Enlighten 
and Teach. We have yet to settle on what BEAT means, though Better Editing At 
The Times comes to mind.

A GRAND OPENING FOR DODGERS; BASEBALL: TREADWAY'S SACRIFICE FLY GIVES THEM A 
4-3 VICTORY OVER MARLINS. RODRIGUEZ REPLACES STRAWBERRY, HAS TWO HITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was no ordinary opening day for the Dodgers, what with the latest turmoil 
of Darryl Strawberry still plaguing them and the media more interested in the 
departed outfielder than in the new one. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dodgers have played without Strawberry for most of the last two 
seasons, so it was nothing new Tuesday when they took the field at Dodger 
Stadium with somebody else in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 What was new was a certain feeling in the air that had nothing to do with the 
birds or the balloons, and everything to do with Jeff Treadway's sacrifice fly, 
which gave the Dodgers a 4-3 victory over the Florida Marlins before 53,761. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have hated to have the team face the postgame interviews after a loss 
today," said starting pitcher Orel Hershiser, who gave up one run and four hits 
in six innings but didn't get the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would have been a momentum to it. Then we would get up and read all the 
quotes from the players, and then we would have to play another game, and it 
could go on. I think this puts a finality to it, not only to the Dodgers' 
solution and Darryl's solution but to the win, saying we have gone over the 
hurdle. Plus, maybe there won't be as many media people here (tonight)."  
</P>
<P>
 The players say they feel badly for Strawberry, who was scheduled to enter a 
drug treatment center Tuesday, but believe this is a chance for the team to 
quit relying on him for their success. If this had to happen, they are glad it 
did before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, the timing of this couldn't be better," said Fred Claire, Dodger 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans in the left-field pavilion regrouped quickly, singing a new chant, 
this one going: "Hen-ry." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rodriguez, taking Strawberry's place in left field, went two for three, 
with a double, and worked pitcher Jeremy Hernandez (0-1) for an eighth-inning 
leadoff walk, which eventually became the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Webster, running for Rodriguez in the eighth, broke for second base just 
before Hernandez pitched out to Jose Offerman. Webster reversed course and 
purposely ran into the path of the throw, which hit him and deflected past 
Orestes Destrade into the dugout. Webster was awarded third base, then scored 
the winning run on Treadway's fly ball. It was one of four errors by the 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the veteran in Mitch," Brett Butler said. "That was big. That won us 
the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros, who has filled in for Strawberry at cleanup for most of the past 
two seasons, was there again, and if he keeps coming through the way he did 
Tuesday, he will stay there. Karros also went two for three, and his line drive 
to left in the seventh scored Delino DeShields to tie the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to start the season; we didn't get the big hits, we just 
moved the ball from station to station," Karros said.  
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish that, Lasorda kept the top of the order the same, with DeShields 
leading off, followed by Butler and Mike Piazza. Piazza has more power than 
Karros, but the No. 3 hitter gets more at-bats, and Piazza is the team's best 
hitter.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was some discussion of putting Delino in the third spot," Lasorda said. 
"Delino can't steal as much with Piazza and Karros behind him, because you 
don't want to take the bat out of their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, who scored two runs, and Butler, who scored one, debuted their 
tandem running game, and they even have their own signs. In the first inning, 
DeShields led off with a single and scored on Butler's triple. But in the 
seventh, after the Dodgers fell behind, 3-2, DeShields knew he had to score. He 
walked, stole second and went to third on Butler's sacrifice bunt. Then he 
scored on Karros' liner to left. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just what I do, that's part of my game," DeShields said. "That's how 
how we won a lot of games in Montreal. We didn't have to get a lot of hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Piazza, who is not known for speed, is trying to run more, but he was 
thrown out trying to take two bases on a passed ball in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt my feet were going but my legs were not moving," Piazza said. "When I 
got to the dugout, the people looked at me kind of stupid. The best they were 
able to say was 'Good hustle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott (1-0) entered the game at the start of the seventh inning and gave up 
a two-run homer to Kurt Abbott as the Marlins took a 3-2 lead. But he regrouped 
to pitch a perfect eighth before giving way to Todd Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell, who had been sidelined and criticized most of last season, said he 
was nervous when he took the mound. But after he set the Marlins down in order 
to earn the save, Worrell made a comment that seemed to apply to the entire 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nerve-racking for me today, but once I get the first one under my belt 
it will settle down a little bit," he said. "And hopefully, I will get in a 
groove and show some people here in L.A. and the Dodgers what I am capable of 
doing on a day-in and day-out basis." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what they all hope to do, without Darryl Strawberry.

HO, HUM, ANGELS BEAT TWINS BEHIND LANGSTON, 15-HIT ATTACK; BASEBALL: THEN 
PLAYERS ACCEPT IT AS THEIR DUE, REFUSING TO CELEBRATE SEASON-OPENING VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was no whooping and hollering. No one was going around back-slapping any 
of the game's heroes, let alone exchanging cursory handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 No one even bothered to turn on the clubhouse stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels were exuberant over their 8-2 opening-night victory Tuesday over 
the Minnesota Twins, they sure had a funny way of showing it. 
</P>
<P>
 There was more laughter on the Chevy Chase Show than in the Angel clubhouse 
Tuesday. These were the same guys who were ready to spray champagne on one 
another after their opening-day victory a year ago, treating each ensuing 
victory as if they should follow it by a parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference now," Angel starter Mark Langston said, "is that we expect to 
win. We had so many young guys last year, they treated each game like it was 
big. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, ever since the last week of spring, everyone started to sense that 
feeling. That's why you don't see guys running around, yelling and going crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to do this now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels certainly did nothing to dilute their confidence in front of 41,012 
quiet fans at the Metrodome, trouncing the Twins in every conceivable way. 
</P>
<P>
 It took nine pitches for the Angels to produce a 2-0 lead, and six minutes 
expired before they made an out. They wound up with 15 hits and 22 baserunners 
and made a mockery of any suspense. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we made that last out," said left fielder Bo Jackson, who drove in 
two runs, "I told everybody, 'Let's concentrate on tomorrow. This one's over 
with.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If you believe you can win this division, you've got to act like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who raved all spring of their offensive prowess, quickly showed 
Minnesota . They owned a 2-0 lead after the first inning, and kicked themselves 
in anger for failing to blow the game open when they got no more after having 
the bases loaded with nobody out. 
</P>
<P>
 They straightened that out in the second inning, producing three consecutive 
two-out, run-scoring hits -- including a two-run single by Chili Davis. Just 
like that, they had a 6-0 lead before Langston had faced his fifth batter. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time it was over, everyone in the Angel lineup but catcher Greg Myers 
had at least one hit. Six players had at least two hits. And five players drove 
in at least one run. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin starter Kevin Tapani was out of the game after 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all enough to make Langston a happy man. He yielded eight hits in 7 2/3 
innings, and became the first Angel since Frank Tanana in 1977-1978 to win 
consecutive opening-day starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even hit a homer tonight," Langston said, "and look what we did. 
That's a great sign. This lineup is going to be something." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Salmon and Davis, the heart of the Angel lineup a year ago, picked up 
where they left off. Salmon, showing no signs of an early sophomore jinx, 
reached base four times with two doubles and two walks. Davis, proving that 
he's not ready for retirement, produced two hits and three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be staying here if I didn't think I could help this ballclub 
anymore," said Davis, who drove in a career-high 112 runs last season. "And if 
I couldn't help this ballclub, I guarantee you they wouldn't keep me here." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the one player whose contributions were obscured in the Angel victory 
was the one who has been overshadowed all spring -- Damion Easley. After 
missing 89 games last season because of inflamed shins, which eventually 
required surgery, Easley is trying to make up for lost time, going three for 
five with hits in each of his first three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like it's been forever since I played in a real game," said Easley, 
who batted .400 this spring. "I was a little pumped up. I don't feel like I'm 
the key to this offense, but I'm definitely one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who tried to tell everyone who would listen this spring that this 
is a rejuvenated team, wake up this morning sitting atop the American League 
West after one game. There's no reason for early celebrations, but there is 
satisfaction that this is where they feel they belong.

<P>
 "We're not going out there this year trying to prove everybody that we're for 
real," Salmon said. "We're just going to go out there and play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good feeling."

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best race left in the NHL is for eight place in the Eastern Conference, 
the cutoff for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Islanders rallied to beat the Washington Capitals in overtime on 
Benoit Hogue's goal with 1:26 to play Tuesday night in Landover, Md., and moved 
past Philadelphia and into ninth place in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida is in eighth, two points ahead with four games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 New York is 2-0-2 in its last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have much of a margin for error," Coach Al Arbour said. "This was a 
big two points. We came very close tonight to playing with fire and getting 
burned pretty bad, but we overcame our shortcomings." 
</P>
<P>
 The Islanders went 0 for 8 on power plays and fell behind, 2-0, early in the 
third period before coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 3, Quebec 3 -- Joe Sakic scored with 48 seconds top play, giving the 
Nordiques a tie at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 5, Chicago 1 -- Brendan Shanahan scored twice and goaltender Curtis 
Joseph set two team iron-man records as the beat the slumping Blackhawks at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph broke Mike Liut's record for victories in a season, set in 1980-81, 
with his 34th in 67 starts. He also broke his own team record for minutes 
played with 3,910, 20 more than he had last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 6, Dallas 4 -- Kent Manderville's goal with 3:43 to play in Dallas 
lifted the Maple Leafs into sole possession of second place in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 8, Vancouver 3 -- Dino Ciccarelli became the fifth player to score 
four times in one game this season, leading the Red Wings at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Bure had his league-leading 56th goal for Vancouver.

NBA ROUNDUP; KNICKS GET A DOSE OF OWN MEDICINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sick, sore and sinking in the standings, the Miami Heat ambushed the NBA's 
hottest team, beating New York, 100-86, the way the Knicks had beaten 15 
opponents in a row -- with defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat held New York to 36% shooting in Miami, playing without injured 
center Rony Seikaly, while starters Glen Rice and Grant Long were weakened by 
flu. The Heat lost seven of their previous eight games, including a 110-87 
blowout at New York on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scars were still fresh from Saturday night," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knick Coach Pat Riley took his team's first loss since Feb. 27 badly. The New 
York locker room remained closed for 20 minutes after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't accept the way we played because we can pick up bad habits quick, 
even after winning 15 in a row," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Patrick Ewing offered a more cryptic assessment: "We all played like 
garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 114, Washington 88 -- Scottie Pippen had 22 points, 10 assists and 
nine rebounds at Chicago, where the Bulls used a 21-8 run at the outset of the 
second half to win their fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 106, San Antonio 101 -- Latrell Sprewell scored 26 points and had 
two key steals in the final two minutes, carrying the Warriors to a victory at 
San Antonio that snapped the Spurs' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was delayed for 12 minutes before the third quarter when a heavy 
rainstorm leaked through the roof at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 104, Milwaukee 97 -- The Magic, playing without ailing center 
Shaquille O'Neal, got 22 points and 10 rebounds from Jeff Turner at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal sat out the game because of a stomach virus, the first time in his 
two-year career that he missed a game because of injury or illness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 105, Charlotte 99 -- John Williams scored 23 points and the 
Cavaliers overcame horrendous early shooting to win at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss kept the Hornets winless in 13 trips to Richfield and further damaged 
the Hornets' hopes of making the playoffs. Charlotte dropped 5 1/2 games behind 
New Jersey in the race for the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 120, Boston 94 -- The Celtics' 14-year playoff run came to the end 
as the Nets' reserves used a 23-6 second-quarter spurt in a victory at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Celtics didn't make the playoffs was in 1978-79, when they 
had a 29-53 record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 105, Detroit 89 -- Antonio Davis, playing in place of ailing Rik 
Smits, scored 15 points in the first half to start the Pacers on the way to a 
victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 86, Utah 79 -- Vincent Askew scored 11 of his 14 points in the fourth 
quarter, including seven in a row at Seattle, and the SuperSonics won their 
ninth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 88, Sacramento 80 -- The Mavericks snapped their 17-game losing streak 
as Doug Smith scored 10 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 135, Phoenix 113 -- Clifford Robinson scored 23 points and Rod 
Strickland had a team-record 20 assists to lift the Trail Blazers at Portland 
and end the Suns' five-game winning streak.

 San Jose Sharks Coach Kevin Constantine, who is six months younger than his 
oldest player, 35-year-old Sergei Makarov, was asked if he had any advice for 
the veteran right wing. "I don't say anything to Sergei," Constantine said. 
"Number one, there's nothing that I can tell him that could do any good, and 
number two, he doesn't listen to anything I say, anyway."

<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the Masters record for the lowest 72-hole score? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Warning: Dennis Rodman of the San Antonio Spurs, on the Seattle SuperSonics, 
who have the best record in the NBA: 
</P>
<P>
 "Seattle is cruising right now, but down the road, they're going to have a 
letdown. They're going to fall at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Is that all? The Quebec Nordiques are in fifth place in the Northeast Division 
of the NHL's Eastern Conference, and Coach Pierre Page summed up the team:  
</P>
<P>
 "No chemistry, no hitting, no board contact, no back-checking, nobody comes to 
play." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Early hype: It's only April, but college spring football media guides already 
are identifying Heisman Trophy candidates on their covers.  
</P>
<P>
 Examples: UCLA's J.J Stokes, USC's Rob Johnson and Stanford's Steve Stenstrom. 
Stokes, who placed seventh in the Heisman balloting last year, is the leading 
returning vote-getter.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Looking back: The Dallas Cowboys aren't the only NFL team to lose their coach 
after a championship season. In 1952, Joe Stydahar was dismissed as Ram coach 
after one league game. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Rams had won their only NFL title in 1951, beating the Cleveland 
Browns, 24-17, at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Biting remark: Boston Red Sox third base coach Gary Allenson, on his 
impressions of Cleveland: 
</P>
<P>
 "On one of our trips to Cleveland last year, I broke one of my teeth biting 
into a hamburger. We got the Indians to hook me with their team dentist, and 
the guy filled the wrong tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else do you need to know?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Augusta anguish: Ian Woosnam of Wales, the 1991 Masters winner, theorizing on 
why foreign players have won the tournament five of the past six years:  
</P>
<P>
 "Every American wants to win the Masters. It's their ambition. When they come 
to the stretch, they're so nervous they tense up." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite disagrees, saying: "I have no clue. Anyone who say they do is blowing 
smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So close: Abe Lemons, former Texas basketball coach, said he came within two 
strokes of winning a car in a golf tournament:  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hole-in-one contest, and I had a three." 
</P>
<P>

 Trivia answer: Jack Nicklaus, in 1965, and Raymond Floyd, in 1976, at 271.

 Quotebook: Bob Knight, on the "Coaching Techniques" class he teaches at 
Indiana: "I have about 80 to 100 kids. I'd say about one-third are girls. I 
think most of the rest are boys. You can never be sure on a college campus."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It happened on opening day at Dodger Stadium: 
</P>
<P>
 10 a.m. -- "Somebody asked me how I compare Darryl Strawberry to Steve Howe," 
Manager Tom Lasorda says. "Well, they both let the owner down. They let their 
teammates down. They let the fans down. They let their families down." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:10 -- Dodger rookie outfielder Billy Ashley, just recalled from 
Albuquerque, hits a ball two-thirds the way up the left-field pavilion during 
batting practice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:15 -- Can this possibly be the 33rd Dodger Stadium opener? The place looks 
as youthful as it did on April 10, 1962. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:33 -- "I've been off alcohol for 28 years," says Don Newcombe, director of 
community relations and former Dodger pitcher. "But if I have one can of beer, 
I go back to where I was before. That's the way it works." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:45 -- Vin Scully and Lasorda shake hands. They need no introductions. Each 
has been in the Dodger organization for 45 years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:50 -- The Florida Marlins do stretching exercises behind home plate. 
Obviously, they don't want to pull any fins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:52 -- The Marlin wearing No. 31, right-handed pitcher Robb Nen, is the son 
of Dick Nen, who hit a home run in St. Louis that helped the Dodgers win the 
1963 pennant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:58 -- "Henry Rodriguez has shown that he has some power," hitting coach 
Reggie Smith says of Strawberry's replacement. "I would like to see him 
continue to work at being a good situational hitter. He'll have plenty of 
opportunities to drive in runs." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 11:05 -- In the biggest waste of time of the morning, Mike Piazza bunts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 11:10 -- Dodger coach Joe Ferguson, who is even older than Charlie Hough, 
imitates the Florida starter by throwing knuckleballs to Jose Offerman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 -- First usable statistic: The L.A. Dodgers are 18-18 in season openers 
and 18-18 in home openers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 12:12 p.m. -- Lasorda sends someone out to the dugout to bring Chan Ho Park 
back into the clubhouse. The rookie pitcher is besieged by reporters. "I want 
him to relax," Lasorda says. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 12:16 -- Roger McDowell shaves Rafael Bournigal's head. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 12:50 -- Park doffs his cap and receives a warm ovation when introduced by new 
public-address announcer Mike Carlucci. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 12:52 -- The difference from last year's introductions is that nary a Dodger 
gets booed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 12:55 -- Red Cross volunteer Scott Underwood throws out the first pitch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 12:56 -- Branford Marsalis delivers a smooth, tasteful rendition of the 
national anthem on his saxophone. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:14 -- Gary Sheffield thwarts Orel Hershiser's no-hit bid with a two-out 
single in the first inning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:19 -- The new speed on the bases pays off when Delino DeShields gets an 
infield single in his first Dodger at-bat. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:25 -- It doesn't take the Marlins long to discover that Sheffield will have 
trouble playing right field. He misplays Brett Butler's fly ball into a 
run-scoring triple. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:26 -- Piazza gets his first run batted in when third baseman Jerry Browne 
boots his ground ball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:33 -- The message board advertises a sunglasses giveaway for April 24. 
Naturally, it's a night game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:34 -- Jeff Conine, the only major leaguer other than Cal Ripken Jr. to play 
in all 162 games last season, makes an early bid to remain in the Marlin lineup 
by hitting the first pitch of the second inning into the left-field pavilion. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 1:51 -- The Marlins are keeping official scorer Larry Kahn busy. It's only the 
second inning, but already they have been charged with two errors and two 
passed balls. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:26 -- Hough singles to left to become the ninth player and fifth pitcher to 
get a hit at age 46. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:50 -- Hershiser, who hit .356 last year, is removed for pinch-hitter Dave 
Hansen with a runner on third base and two out in the sixth inning of a 2-1 
game. Hansen strikes out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:59 -- Reliever Jim Gott serves up a gopher ball to Kurt Abbott, and the 
Marlins lead, 3-2, in the seventh. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 3:16 -- And why did the Marlins pinch-hit for Hough after he pitched five 
consecutive scoreless innings? Eric Karros singles off Jeremy Hernandez to make 
it 3-3 in the seventh. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 3:40 -- Pinch-hitter Jeff Treadway, the steady old Atlanta infielder who 
batted .303 for Cleveland last season, delivers a sacrifice fly to give the 
Dodgers a 4-3 lead in the eighth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 3:48 -- Todd Worrell strikes out Abbott as the Dodgers win and creep within a 
half-game of NL West leader San Francisco.

SAN JOSE GOES ALL THE WAY, 2-1; HOCKEY: SHARKS CLINCH LAST PLAYOFF SPOT IN 
WESTERN CONFERENCE BY DEFEATING KINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The humiliation of an 11-victory season was long forgotten on Tuesday as the 
San Jose Sharks turned the Forum into their personal victory party, securing 
their first playoff spot with a 2-1 victory over the Kings before 14,441. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose clinched the eighth and final playoff berth in the Western Conference 
-- eliminating the expansion Mighty Ducks -- and there was no question the 
Sharks deserved it. Center Jamie Baker scored twice and goaltender Arturs Irbe 
was flawless until Luc Robitaille beat him with a power-play goal with 1:17 
remaining. It was Robitaille's 41st goal of the season and it came on a 
six-on-four advantage after the Kings pulled goaltender Robb Stauber for an 
extra attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did not stave off the inevitable. The Kings pulled Stauber again but 
couldn't tie it despite a late flurry. The Sharks came off the bench at the 
buzzer and hugged Irbe. And there were more hugs in the press box as owner 
George Gund celebrated with director of hockey operations Dean Lombardi and 
assistant coach Drew Remenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not stopping now," Irbe said. "We're going for the Stanley Cup. I know 
it is very hard, but we really want to do that. We are committed to making the 
Stanley Cup as soon as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Said defenseman Jeff Norton: "This is just great. We surprised some people 
early in the season and we built some character. People were counting us out. 
It means that much more when people are doubting you. But we never counted 
ourselves out. This is a great turnaround. Great for us. Great for hockey and 
great for the city of San Jose." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks (32-33-15) lead the 10th-place Kings (26-42-11) by 16 points in the 
Western Conference. Since losing to the Kings on March 19 at the Forum, San 
Jose has not lost in nine games, going 7-0-2. The Sharks have won a franchise 
record seven consecutive games and trail Vancouver and Chicago by two points. 
</P>
<P>
 What also helped the Sharks pull away so decisively was a dramatic trade by 
Lombardi. After the Kings defeated the Sharks on March 19, Lombardi acquired 
forward Ulf Dahlen from the Dallas Stars for defensemen Doug Zmolek and Mike 
Lalor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi's move checkmated the Kings and the Ducks. Dahlen has five goals and 
11 points since joining the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose has shown that a team can succeed with the right changes. Last 
season, it won 11 games and finished with 24 points. They made a handful of 
player moves and hired a fiery young coach, Kevin Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after two losing seasons, the Sharks reached the playoffs. It has been a 
foregone conclusion in the last week, however. And Tuesday, the Kings didn't 
exactly test Irbe until late in the game. He faced 23 shots, including four in 
the first period. His two biggest saves came early in the second period on 
scoring chances by Mike Donnelly and Jari Kurri. King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Marty McSorley said he will need surgery after the season to repair 
a torn abdominal muscle. He suffered the initial injury when playing with the 
Pittsburgh Penguins and aggravated it since returning to the Kings. Performing 
the surgery will be Vancouver specialist Ross Davidson. . . . Wayne Gretzky, 
one of the two winners of this year's Lester Patrick Award, will be honored at 
a luncheon today at the Century Plaza Hotel. The award was first presented by 
the New York Rangers in 1966 to honor the Rangers' longtime coach and general 
manager. Also being honored is Bob Ridder, a member of the U.S. Hockey Hall of 
Fame.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PEREZ CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO THE STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel first baseman Eduardo Perez paced his hotel room Tuesday, anxiously 
stealing glances at the alarm clock, until he could take it no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent plenty of opening days in Cincinnati, watching his father, Tony 
Perez, but this was different. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first opening day of his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally ended up walking to the stadium," Perez said. "I mean, I had to 
release that energy somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who produced two hits and drove in a run in the Angels' opening-day 
victory over the Minnesota Twins, perhaps has more pressure on him than any 
player in the Angel lineup. He is the reason J.T. Snow is spending his opening 
day in Vancouver. The reason the Angels moved Damion Easley to third base. The 
reason Bo Jackson and Dwight Smith are platooning in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't plan on any of this," Perez said, shrugging. "I didn't care where I 
was playing, as long as I was playing. It wasn't like I was the one making the 
decisions to send anyone down." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was Perez's elbow that caused the reshuffling of the roster. The 
Angels moved Perez from third base to left field after he underwent 
arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow in October. He experienced inflammation 
of the elbow in January, and the Angels immediately signed Jackson and Smith. 
In spring training, the elbow flared up again, and the Angels moved him 
permanently to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow became the odd man out.

 "I've shown him by my actions that he's our first baseman, and that's all 
there is to it," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "If Eddie can be just half as 
consistent as Timmy (Salmon) last year, he'll be fine. Really, there shouldn't 
be any pressure, because he's the guy we're going with."

 Twin left fielder Pedro Munoz opened the season in style, slamming a 473-foot 
homer into the center-field seats against Mark Langston. It was the longest 
home run hit to center field in the 12-year history of the Metrodome, and only 
eight feet shy of the longest home run hit to any field. . . . Reliever Bob 
Patterson shed his offensive lineman number, 66, and replaced it with No. 28 
for this season. "I wanted to make sure I made the team before I did anything," 
Patterson said. . . . Salmon became the first Angel to make two consecutive 
opening-day starts in right field since Dan Ford in 1980 and 1981. . . . Twin 
center fielder Shane Mack, who batted .389 against the Angels last season, was 
placed on the disabled list before the game because of a sore right shoulder. . 
. . The Angels will tinker with their lineup tonight, with Chris Turner 
starting at catcher and Rex Hudler at second base. Rodgers also said he will 
start Spike Owen at third base on Thursday, resting Easley. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 For Billy Ashley, these were the important statistics Tuesday: Two cramped 
plane trips, two new apartments, one wild Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It started early Monday morning when he flew as scheduled from Dodger training 
camp in Vero Beach, Fla., to his minor-league assignment at triple-A 
Albuquerque.He quickly found an apartment, prepared to unpack, then got a phone 
call from the Albuquerque general manager telling him to leave for Los Angeles 
as soon as possible -- he was taking Darryl Strawberry's roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7 Ashley arrived in L.A. about 10 p.m. Monday, found another 
apartment and was in the Dodger Stadium clubhouse Tuesday morning, getting 
ready for opening day in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circumstances are unfortunate, but I'm grateful for the opportunity," 
Ashley said. "I feel glad they thought enough about me, had enough confidence 
to choose me to fill the shoes that have been (vacated)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Henry Rodriguez seems to have the inside shot to be the regular left 
fielder, Ashley, 23, has displayed power, hitting 26 home runs at Albuquerque 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 After his minor-league designation, Ashley appeared in some major league 
spring games and had a couple of game-winning or tying hits that impressed the 
Dodger brass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who hit 11 homers in spring training (in major and minor league 
games)," Executive Vice President Fred Claire said. "He can be a very, very 
exciting player here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sit in my office up (on the club level of Dodger Stadium), and when he's 
taking batting practice, balls are knocking around all over me. Not many 
hitters get it up there to the blue seats." TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; DELGADO LIFTS BLUE JAYS OVER WHITE SOX

<TEXT>
<P>
 Somebody needs to show rookie Carlos Delgado the front doors of the 
restaurants inside Toronto's SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
 He keeps trying to get in the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado homered off a window of Windows resturant Tuesday night to help the 
Blue Jays beat the Chicago White Sox, 5-3. The shot, off Alex Fernandez in the 
second inning, was estimated at 445 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 That was seven feet longer than the homer Delgado hit off the Hard Rock Cafe 
in right field on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those swings that, when you make contact, you don't feel 
anything in your hands," Delgado said. "It was the same thing (Monday), but 
this one went, maybe, a bit longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Molitor doubled home the go-ahead run in the sixth inning and Joe Carter 
homered in the eighth in support of Dave Stewart (1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Stottlemyre got his first major league save. He is pitching in relief 
because bullpen stopper Duane Ward is on the disabled list.

 Milwaukee 11, Oakland 7 -- Wearing three sweatshirts under his uniform in the 
31 degrees of Milwaukee's coldest home opener ever, Alex Diaz drove in three 
runs, all with two outs, for the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Spiers drove in two on a day that began with snow, and included rock 
salt on County Stadium ramps to keep fans from slipping and 29-m.p.h. winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record cold for a Milwaukee opener had been 33 degrees. NATIONAL 
LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 New York Mets 6, Chicago Cubs 2 -- Pete Smith (1-0) pitched seven strong 
innings in his Met debut and New York won at Chicago for the second consecutive 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Stinnett, with his first major league hit, and Jeff Kent each had 
two-run doubles during a five-run third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets also won their first two games last season, against Colorado, before 
going 59-103 for the worst record in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, traded from Atlanta in November for outfielder Dave Gallagher, gave up 
two runs on nine hits. He struck out three and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Guzman (0-1) lasted only 2 1/3 innings, giving up six runs on three hits 
and five walks. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 2, Pittsburgh 0 -- Bill Swift limited the Pirates to three hits 
in seven innings in the Giants' second consecutive shutout at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jackson pitched the eighth and Rod Beck closed the ninth for a save. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh left-hander Steve Cooke (0-1) allowed only three hits until the 
sixth inning, when Willie McGee led off with a single, went to third on Barry 
Bonds' single and scored on Todd Benzinger's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen back-to-back shutouts" to open a season, Giants Manager Dusty 
Baker said. "These guys came out of spring training ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Following a six-hit shutout by John Burkett and two relievers, Swift was 
certainly ready. The right-hander, who won 21 games last year, struck out three 
and didn't walk a batter. Fifty of his 75 pitches went for strikes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, Houston 1 -- Larry Walker hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning, 
leading the Expos past Doug Drabek and the Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Hill (1-0) gave up six hits in six innings, and three Montreal pitchers 
finished with shutout relief. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 5, San Diego 1 -- Tom Glavine baffled the Padres, giving up two hits 
in seven inning while striking out nine as the Braves won their second in a row 
at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookies Ryan Klesko and Javier Lopez homered as the Braves pounded five Padres 
pitchers for 14 hits. Lopez went three for five with two RBIs, and Jeff Blauser 
went three for five. 
</P>
<P>
 Glavine (1-0) had seven strikeouts before San Diego got its first hit, a 
single by Derek Bell with one out in the fourth inning. Glavine struck out two 
batters in each of the first four innings and finished with only two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wohlers pitched a hitless eighth inning, but Steve Bedrosian, who came on 
in the ninth, was touched for San Diego's lone run. 
</P>
<P>
 Klesko, who hit a leadoff homer in the sixth inning of Monday's season-opener, 
connected on a 3-and-2 pitch from Wally Whitehurst (0-1) with two outs in the 
first inning.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: CORONADO YELLOWTAIL SPRING INTO ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What San Diego skippers -- and the sportfishing community in general -- have 
been eagerly awaiting the past few weeks has finally happened: The cool green 
water at the Coronado Islands has warmed and turned blue, prompting the first 
significant yellowtail bite of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglers aboard the Sea Watch and the Malihini were among the first to get the 
fickle fish to bite, picking up 21 and 19, respectively, on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 And the bite didn't let up Tuesday. Point Loma Sportfishing's Predator, with 
17 anglers aboard, picked up 26 fish to 20 pounds, and the Malihini got another 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great bite," said Shirley Hewkin, a spokeswoman at Point Loma. Not 
quite, but it is an indication that spring has finally sprung. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barracuda just off the coast, an abundance of bonito off the east end of Santa 
Catalina Island -- what more could local fishermen ask for? 
</P>
<P>
 Anchovies, that's what. The bait boats have had a heck of a time rounding up 
the tiny baitfish, and when they don't succeed, neither do the fishermen. "We 
could really use the anchovies," said Mark Larson, a spokesman for L.A. Harbor 
Sportfishing.  
</P>
<P>
 Larson's fleet, and that of Long Beach Sportfishing, have been targeting 
barracuda at the Horseshoe Kelp area outside the harbor. They combined for 
hundreds of the strong swimming gamefish Saturday and Sunday. But then the 
anchovies disappeared and the fish count slipped accordingly. "It just dropped 
off," Larson said Tuesday. "But I hear they got the anchovies today." 
</P>
<P>
 At Catalina, the bonito have been somewhat more cooperative, hitting the irons 
and small sardines when the anchovy supply runs out. The Newport Harbor-based 
fleet has been putting anglers on top of sizable schools of fish to six pounds. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A month ago, a hooked mackerel wouldn't last a minute in the Golden Gate area 
off Cabo San Lucas. A marlin would grab the small fish and go tail-dancing off 
toward the horizon.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the mackerel's only concern would be the hook in its back or belly. The 
marlin have moved on. "Boats ranged far and wide this week hunting for marlin," 
said a weekly report from the Pisces fleet. And with little success -- the 
fleet caught only six marlin. The good news is that yellowfin tuna are fairly 
abundant offshore, and roosterfish are still being taken along the beaches.

 MISCELLANY -- Contrary to popular opinion, Silverwood Lake will not be drained 
next fall, but drawn down 40 feet so water district employees can tear down the 
outflow tower and build a new one to earthquake standards. It is not known what 
effect the two-year project will have on fishing. . . . The 95-foot Searcher, 
long a fixture at San Diego landings, is moving to Newport Landing on Thursday

FISHING REPORT: HE COMES FOR A TROUT AND LEAVES WITH RECORD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Masek got a clue when the "tree" began to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought I had snagged an underwater tree," Masek said. "But after 
a few seconds, the fish began to fight. I had no idea what was on the end of 
the line. Then, when I finally saw it, I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 What Masek, of Mission Viejo, had on the end of the line was an Irvine 
Lake-record rainbow trout, which tipped the scale at 18 pounds 2 ounces. The 
fish, caught on a chrome Kastmaster lure, eclipsed the previous record by 3 1/2 
pounds.

LOS ALAMITOS; MEETING ENDS WITH MIXED RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the sun set Saturday, at about the same time the meeting's final program 
began at Los Alamitos, it was unclear when a new day would dawn for California 
harness racing. 
</P>
<P>
 The winter-spring meeting ended with mixed handle figures. The average of 
$847,975 was comparable to last year's figure of more than $842,000, but last 
year's meeting was spread over four nights of racing a week, this year's over 
three. Dropped were Wednesdays, one of the weaker nights of the 1993 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, many horsemen began shipping to tracks throughout the nation. Some 
went to Sacramento, hopeful that the Premier Harness Racing Assn., a consortium 
of California harness horsemen, can put together a program of summer racing. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 25, the PHRA approached the California Horse Racing Board to request 
six simulcast races from the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., to be 
presented before a live program each evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The group cited the need for the simulcast races to have any chance of 
recouping their investment. The Sacramento meeting has reportedly lost money in 
20 of the last 22 years that racing has been held there, according to one 
industry official. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHRB approved only simulcast races for the beginning of the Sacramento 
meeting, and it would drop to three after June 15, when an influx of 
2-year-olds would probably alleviate any horse shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarter horse interests, which would be offering live races at Los Alamitos 
simultaneously, opposed the plan. Quarter horse representatives reportedly told 
PHRA members that they wanted an "impact fee" from the New Jersey simulcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissatisfied PHRA members have spent the last few weeks campaigning with CHRB 
members to have six simulcast races approved in time for Sacramento's proposed 
opening day of April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had no conclusive answers," influential trainer Bobby Gordon said. 
"It's not going good. We haven't been able to come to any agreement with the 
quarter horse industry. They would like an impact fee for bringing the signal 
into Los Alamitos, and there's no way we can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horsemen need racing. They're not in a position to lay up for two or 
three months." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Saturday, the PHRA was hoping that horsemen would ship to Sacramento for 
the coming season, and many were planning to do so. A meeting among Gordon, 
CHRB Chairman Ralph Scurfield and Ed Allred, a 50% owner of Los Alamitos and 
the state's leading quarter horse promoter, has been scheduled for this week. 
Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Plano was the Los Alamitos meeting's leading driver and trainer. He had 
42 winners to 40 for runner-up James Lackey in the drivers' standings, and he 
caught Frank Sherren in the final weeks to win the drivers' title, 34-32. 
Sherren had the meeting's top 3-year-old trotters in the filly Lil Eggie and 
the colt Hunter's Key. The filly Fast N Loose and the colt Maxanali were the 
best of the 3-year-old pacers. . . . Saturday's handle of $1,210,606 was the 
highest of Los Alamitos' 39 nights of harness racing.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: MUPPETS TAKE NICKELODEON; THE SYNDICATED SERIES, NOW 
AVAILABLE ON CABLE, IS AS FRESH AND FUNNY NOW AS WHEN IT WAS PRODUCED IN THE 
'70S AND '80S. 
</P>

<P>
 Kermit filled in as host of CNN's "Larry King, Live" Friday night. You know, 
Kermit the Frog. Green felt body? Curved spine? White golf balls for eyes? Red 
mouth? Falsetto voice? Right, that Kermit. 
</P>
<P>
 King took the night off. So, in one of the more exotic chapters of talk show 
history, there was Kermit -- the most famous of all the Muppets created by the 
late Jim Henson and his collaborators -- perched where King usually sits, 
interviewing, of all people, Ted Koppel. And later quizzing Carol Alt and Hulk 
Hogan, stars of the syndicated series "Thunder in Paradise." It was historic, 
the Frogster and the Hulkster sharing a studio. To say nothing of the Tedster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kermit the Frog, Live" was also great entertainment -- not . 
</P>
<P>
 It would be great fun to report that Kermit asked better questions than King, 
that even he would have been tougher on Ross Perot. But fun is not the 
operative word here. Perhaps it was the absence of Henson, who was Kermit. 
Perhaps it was something else. For whatever reason, the attempted whimsy fell 
like a brick, and even a surprise call from the fabulous Miss Piggy could not 
rescue the hour from its doldrums. You could almost hear the Muppets themselves 
calling for the return of King. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, not only King but the Muppets of old have returned this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Muppet Show," Henson's wondrous, enormously successful syndicated series 
that was produced in London from 1976 to 1981, is now available to cable 
viewers at 11:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. weekdays on Nickelodeon. The revival began 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henson's shaggy animals and monsters have been an industry unto themselves, 
achieving superstardom through "Sesame Street" on PBS, headlining a couple of 
theatrical movies and starring in "The Muppet Babies," an imaginative 
Saturday-morning kids program on CBS in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many old series that deserve rerunning and chances to find new 
audiences. "The Muppet Show" -- whose furry and rubbery marionette-puppets 
(hence the name Muppets) each week welcomed guests ranging from George Burns to 
Steve Martin -- is near the top of the list, thanks not only to Henson and his 
puppeteering associates, led by Frank Oz, but also to the writing of Jerry Juhl 
and directing of Peter Harris. Still fresh and funny after all these years, 
these half-hour slabs of exquisite satirical foolishness possess at least as 
many goodies for adults as for kids, something that network programmers never 
comprehended when unsuccessfully pressed for a regular spot in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, this is a show about the making of a show, with the amiable Kermit 
starring as host of a variety program that inevitably disintegrates into 
absolute chaos, largely because of high jinks of his unruly fellow Muppets. 
Each week the ragged Muppet chorus sings: 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to play the music,  
</P>
<P>
 It's time to light the light,  
</P>
<P>
 It's time to meet the Muppets on "The Muppet Show" tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 And they were off on a "celebrational, Muppetational" ride featuring not only 
Kermit, but of course the ever-hamming, ever-lusting-for-the-spotlight, 
ever-tyrannical Miss Piggy (Oz), who throws herself at every male in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 And the resident band, Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, featuring the very 
cool Floyd the guitarist and Animal the drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rowlf, the shaggy canine pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 And hook-snouted Gonzo, who futilely attempts to open each show with a great 
flourish on his trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
 And the berserk, chicken-chasing Swedish Chef, whose dialect is so thick and 
mushy he can't be understood. 
</P>
<P>
 And the two gray geezers, Statler and Waldorf, who critique each show, aiming 
awful one-liners at the participants from box seats overlooking the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sam the Eagle. And Fozzie Bear. And Kermit's assistant, Scooter. On and on 
they go, all of them bizarre, lovable and, beneath the child-targeted fuzzy 
creature exteriors and corny joking, extremely witty and often very subtle. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the show's genius was its ability to integrate people and puppets in 
ways that didn't seem foolish. Liza Minnelli is on the screen, singing her 
heart out with her arms wrapped around Kermit, and somehow, illogically, 
incredibly, it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no matter how big were the human stars that appeared on the show, they 
were inevitably upstaged by the Muppets themselves. Monday's Nickelodeon debut, 
for example, found a young Elton John in his wild costume phase -- bright 
feathers, big sunglasses and jeweled aviator's cap -- singing "Crocodile Rock" 
to a chorus of crocodiles. And later, his hit "Don't Go Breakin' My Heart" with 
Miss Piggy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the running soap opera "Pigs in Space" -- starring Capt. Link 
Heartthrob, Dr. Strangepork and Miss Piggy -- that swiped the show, as the 
starship Swinetrek was invaded by mysterious aliens who turned out to be the 
Swedish Chef and his clucking chicken. "Tune in next week," a voice announced, 
"and be bored again by 'Pigs in Space.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Andrews was Tuesday's guest, "The Sound of Music" getting eclipsed by 
the Sound of Muppets -- if not Rowlf's glorious "Moonlight Sonata," then the 
intrusive Flying Zucchinis, whose amazing, death-defying, unbelievably 
spectacular human cannonball act somehow went awry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Muppet Show" is at its spoofing best in a coming episode, with Kermit and 
Minnelli hooking up in a cliche-rich parody of the detective genre. Minnelli is 
the femme fatale, Kermit -- in trench coat and snap-brim hat -- the gumshoe who 
gets conked on his frog head while investigating a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnelli: "For a minute, I thought you'd croaked." 
</P>
<P>
 Kermit: "I tried to, but I was too weak." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight finds Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem performing the "Minuet in G 
Major" -- "They ought to send it back to the minors," snaps one of the geezers 
-- and neurotic Sam the Eagle nervously worrying that the show won't be 
dignified enough for guest Rudolf Nureyev. Then he learns that the late Nureyev 
is to dance a pas de deux from "Swine Lake" with a full-bodied Miss Piggy. 
"Yes," Sam observes, "dignity at last." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, dignity is the very quality that you will never see on "The 
Muppet Show." Welcome to the real thunder in paradise.

IT'S A WRAP FOR SPANKY'S GANG; MOVIES: DESPITE EARTHQUAKES, RAINS AND THE 
CHALLENGE OF WORKING WITH CHILDREN, PENELOPE SPHEERIS BRINGS 'THE LITTLE 
RASCALS' IN ON-BUDGET AND TWO DAYS EARLY. IT'S DUE OUT IN AUGUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "CUT. . . . AAAAAHHHHH!" director Penelope Spheeris yells into a bullhorn on 
"The Little Rascals" set on Stage One of the Universal lot. It's nearing the 
end of the 58-day shoot -- and working with an American bulldog, a pair of 
Capuchin monkeys and two-dozen children ages 4 to 9 is taking its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene, an emergency meeting of the "He-Man's Womun Haters Club," is a key 
one in the $23-million film -- one that sets up the Rascals' dislike of girls 
as well as their plans for defending the car racing trophy won the year before. 
Spanky (Travis Tedford) is spacing in and out, delivering a performance the 
director charitably terms "weird." Stymie (Kevin Jamal Woods) is having trouble 
sustaining the desired "Bill Clinton" take-charge tone. Someone complains that 
his suspenders have fallen. Attention spans -- and bladders -- fail to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the movie, which wrapped yesterday and is due to be released in August, 
came in two days early and on-budget -- in the face of earthquakes, heavy rains 
and curtailed work schedules mandated by child welfare laws.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of another film except 'Lord of the Flies' -- with a much older 
cast -- that was almost totally devoid of adults," notes Bill Oakes, one of the 
producers. "The downside is that no one hits their marks. The upside is a 
wonderful innocence. If you get it right, it's that much more thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 Spheeris must wait for the "dailies," however, to see if the thrills kick in. 
"In this movie, we get spurts of brilliance, bits and pieces, but there's no 
such thing as a perfect take," admits the director who, four hours after her 
6:30 a.m. call, popped a pill to counteract stomach stress. ("All the female 
executives I know have it," she says.) "Still, the joy you get from these kids 
is unbelievable. I give them each a hug at the start of each day to establish a 
closeness and trust." 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Rascals" is Spheeris' third plunge into the mainstream after years of 
working on the fringe. If depicting the punk scene in "The Decline of Western 
Civilization" (1979), runaways in "Suburbia" (1984), and a high school rampage 
in "The Boys Next Door" (1986) led Hollywood to perceive her as "The Mistress 
of Dark," she says, comedies like the super-successful "Wayne's World," last 
fall's big-screen adaptation of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Little 
Rascals" provided a welcome taste of the light. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you were the hippest/ coolest filmmaker of all, where else is there to 
go?" asks the 48-year-old Spheeris, who, on the set at least, has shed her 
funky garb of yesteryear for a white man-tailored blouse and form-fitting 
jeans. "Now that everyone else is sporting tattoos, freaky hairdos and 
earrings, it's all so boring to me. Some would say I'm becoming more 
conservative -- even 'selling out.' Maybe so. But the Rascals, by definition, 
are 'tough kids' -- not unlike the rejects I've portrayed in the past. My 
'statements' are still there -- just delivered more subtly than before." 
</P>
<P>
 Spheeris and Steven Spielberg, who is an executive producer of the film, are 
lifelong fans of "The Little Rascals," a series of short film classics about a 
group of feisty youngsters that hit the screen in 1922 and won an Oscar in 
1936. Crossing over to television in the mid-1950s, it has been on the air ever 
since. King World, which purchased the property in 1964, used it to jump-start 
an operation that now includes "The Oprah Winfrey Show," "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel 
of Fortune." Ted Turner, whose purchase of MGM's library gave him the rights to 
some of the footage, is partnered with King World on its first feature film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the greatest names in the history of motion pictures, including Frank 
Capra and Laurel and Hardy, worked on the series," says Michael King, another 
producer of the film. "And it broke new ground on a lot of fronts. Black 
children were shown playing with white children. The special effects were 
cutting-edge. Some of the industry's biggest producers, including the original 
creator, Hal Roach, tried unsuccessfully to remake it as a feature film, but it 
took (Spielberg's) Amblin and Spheeris to bring it back to life." 
</P>
<P>
 The two of them came aboard in late 1993 -- seven years after Universal had 
purchased the rights and about six months after the previous director, Amy 
Heckerling, bailed out. Spheeris wrote a new draft of the screenplay with Paul 
Guay and Steven Mazur -- an improvement, the producers believed, over earlier 
scripts that were regarded as the creative stumbling block. At the director's 
suggestion, the role of Buckwheat -- eliminated by the studio for fear of 
perpetuating negative racial stereotypes -- was reinstated in a more palatable 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoopi Goldberg will appear in a cameo as Buckwheat's mom, and Daryl Hannah 
will surface as the Rascals' teacher, Miss Crabtree. The late John Candy had 
been slated to play Spanky's dad. Screamer, the dog cast as Petey, was tied to 
a tree for four years -- condemned to a life of pit-fighting -- before 
Hollywood called. 
</P>
<P>
 Spheeris included a greater number of Asian American, Latino and African 
American faces "to ensure that the movie wasn't just another movie made for 
white kids." All but four of the Rascals -- selected from 5,000 auditions 
nationwide -- are making their feature film debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned not to mess with the props -- or to eat sweets on the set," says 
Bug Hall, a freckle-faced 9-year-old cast as Alfalfa. "It makes you really 
hyper, and everyone gets mad." The Texan's most memorable moment since arriving 
in L.A.? "Hanging in the 'O' of the Hollywood sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Saletta, who plays one of the bullies, was a "day player" in Oliver 
Stone's upcoming "Natural Born Killers" -- an experience, he says, that makes 
him doubly appreciative of Spheeris. "She's cool," he says. "Almost like one of 
us. When we did two takes and got two 'prints' -- the best you can do -- she 
gave me a Superball that bounces real high. Oliver Stone didn't seem too 
friendly. He agreed to pose for a picture with me -- even put his hand on my 
shoulder -- but didn't say a word." 
</P>
<P>
 During a midday birthday party for "rich kid" Blake Ewing, Spheeris joins the 
kids on a makeshift dance floor and cuts loose to the beat of "Mustang Sally." 
Travis Tedford (Spanky) joins in the fun, but later admits he's ready to go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, it's been hard," drawls the 5-year-old Dallas native, who could double 
as the Pillsbury Dough Boy. "Working, partying -- is my face red!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty impressive," a reporter agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed," Travis retorts, rubbing imaginary sweat from his forehead. 
"I'm better than I ever thought I was."

SITCOM HITS CLOSE TO 'HOME'; TAYLOR FAMILY IS A LOT LIKE THEIRS, VIEWERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America has a new favorite family. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s it was the cuddlesome Cosbys. For the past two years it has been 
the caustic Conners. Now the Taylors are the toast of television. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Wednesday night, 20 million homes across the nation tune in ABC's "Home 
Improvement" to witness the antics of Tim Taylor, the how-to host of a cable-TV 
show about tools, and his wife, Jill, as they banter, bicker and buss in an 
ongoing battle to overcome the inherent differences between the sexes and rear 
their three sons. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 1993-94 TV season officially ends April 17, "Home Improvement" is 
expected to rank for the first time as prime-time television's No. 1 program, 
leapfrogging "60 Minutes" and "Roseanne," which placed 1-2 the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Allen, who stars with Patricia Richardson, explains the show's 
steam-rolling popularity this way: "It's just so real. When we hit hard, when 
the writers hit a subject that Pat and I can make real, there's a joke on the 
set: You'll hear the whole crew -- all of them are married -- say: 'Been there. 
Done that.' This isn't a show about nothing. It's a show about little things 
that seem very big at the time they happen." 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the 1,000 or so comments on a bulletin board on Prodigy, where Allen 
recently fielded questions submitted by home-computer users, reveals how much 
some people connect with the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents are fantastic and very similar to you and Jill," wrote D. Thomas. 
"Dad decides to fix something that may or may not have been broken in the first 
place, while Mom flips through the yellow pages for the least expensive 
repairman to fix the damage that Dad will inevitably cause!" 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband reminds me of your character on 'Home Improvement,' " wrote 
Christine Shaw of Stamford, Conn. "He has the accessory gene, he never gets 
lost and he grunts and thinks he can fix it all. There is no such thing in my 
house as an instruction manual." 
</P>
<P>
 Nadine Wallin from Minnesota simply wrote: "I feel as though you are living in 
my family. It's getting to be a little scary." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Home Improvement' is the 1990s version of 'Father Knows Best,' turned on 
its head. It's more like 'Mother Knows Best,' " said Dr. Victor Strasburger, an 
Albuquerque pediatrician who has done research on the effects of television on 
children. "They're both very appealing characters, in their own ways. She's a 
strong woman without being too strong, and he's vulnerable without being a 
wimp." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The writers of "Home Improvement," all of whom have families, say they simply 
draw upon their own experiences when coming up with ideas for the show, now in 
its third season. After the initial script readings on Mondays, Allen and 
Richardson also give their input. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason the show works is because of the relationship between Tim and 
Jill," said Carmen Finestra, one of the show's creators and executive 
producers. "People who don't watch the show dismiss it because they think it's 
just a show about a guy who grunts. But we look at it as a show about a man and 
woman, a husband and wife, a mom and dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "One woman once came up to me and said, 'I love your show because I get to see 
how men think.' I was very happy to hear that. A lot of people often say to me 
these arguments are the same ones they have with their wife or husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen grew up in the Midwest with six brothers and so always had a strong 
sense of "maleness," he said. For instance, in last week's episode about 
keeping the romance alive in marriage -- during which Tim passed gas and burped 
in bed -- Allen believes he may have crossed the line of good taste, but at 
least people could relate.  
</P>
<P>
 "All week long guys were calling in, fathers and friends, saying, 'Oh, God, my 
wife almost killed me when I did that. Jeez, I thought I was going to die,' " 
said Allen, who has won three consecutive People's Choice Awards as favorite 
male performer in a TV series. Then he calmly repeated his comedy mantra: "Been 
there. Done that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roseanne" and "Home Improvement" have both been praised for mirroring the 
family life of middle-class workers, but the shows have done so in drastically 
different styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really would put 'Roseanne' and 'Home Improvement' in the same league: Both 
are outstanding shows and very socially responsible," Strasburger said. "What I 
like most about 'Home Improvement' is the spirit of gentleness and playfulness 
that it has. It's not a show that I worry about children watching, getting 
unhealthy ideas about sex or drugs. 'Roseanne' is a harder-edge show, and that 
tends to hit some raw nerves. 'Roseanne' sometimes offends people socially, 
where 'Home Improvement' never offends. It has perfect manners." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many of the fans' comments on Prodigy hailed "Home Improvement's" 
promotion of family values. "What really impresses me about your show is it 
debunks the commercial TV myth that only sex and violence sell," wrote Diane 
Paull of West Bloomfield, Mich. "We watch it as a family and all laugh 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia Robin, president of the National Council for Families and Television, 
based in Los Angeles, pointed out that many new shows are centered on families 
with broken homes, whereas "Home Improvement" portrays a family that's 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's home there," she said, "and you have a friendly neighbor. I don't 
think we look at families that way nowadays. A lot of shows focus on families 
that are split up. The Taylors are a family and they are together, and you 
wonder if people are looking for that. We're all searching for something to 
hold on to in this world. When something hearkens back to how we all grew up, 
or wished we grew up, we feel comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Home Improvement" will overtake "Roseanne" in the ratings this 
season, it has the older show to thank for its early success. "Home 
Improvement" aired as the lead-in to "Roseanne" on Tuesday nights during its 
first season, before ABC boldly moved it to Wednesday nights at 9 p.m. to build 
an entire evening around it. Allen feels bittersweet about the season's 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bittersweet because I'm a big fan of 'Roseanne,' and I like Roseanne (Arnold) 
personally," he said. "We have to give them kudos, because they put us on the 
map. But 'Roseanne' represents a sharper-edged look at family. 
</P>
<P>
 "You read so much about people who disobey the law or who are very regressive 
in their attitude toward life. This show celebrates and represents the majority 
of us who love their family, do their best, pay their taxes and obey the law. 
There's a huge majority of people who do that. They go to work, and all they 
want is weekends free, a good neighbor and a back-yard barbecue. That seems 
boring, but some of the best times you've ever had come out of that. This show 
sincerely celebrates those times."

JAZZ REVIEW; JOEY SELLERS' RE-CREATIVE PROCESSES; THE INVENTIVE TROMBONIST 
CONSTRUCTS A NEW ROLE FOR HIS INSTRUMENT BY STRIPPING TUNES TO THE BONES, THEN 
REASSEMBLING THEM IN HIS OWN IMAGE.

 Trombonist Joey Sellers is ready to dismantle jazz. The deconstructive 
approach to "If I Only Had a Brain" aired by his quartet Monday at System M 
turned the quaint, little ditty from "The Wizard of Oz" into a declaration of 
freedom, one that went on for nearly 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers, along with fellow trombonist Michael Vlatkovich (who was leading his 
quintet this same night at Santa Monica's Alligator Lounge), is constructing a 
new role for his instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 A past winner of the Gil Evans Fellowship in Jazz Composition, the trombonist 
likes to strip tunes to the bare bones, then reassemble them in his own image. 
As he explained between sets, this means "stretching the rhythm," turning the 
tempo inside out in such a way that soloists are forced to bring something 
different to what might otherwise be the same old song and dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to carrying out this concept is Sellers' drummer, Billy Mintz, a man 
who seemingly does everything in his power to avoid playing on the beat. Mintz, 
a master of shading and color, stirs tunes gently with his brushes, or rattles 
them with off-step snare and tom-tom exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 His delicately struck tempos are spare, airy affairs in which cymbals play 
only a minor role. Like fellow drummer Paul Motian, his rhythmic treatments are 
an acquired taste. But once understood, it's hard to hear the drums played any 
other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a piano, Sellers' combo relies heavily on the bassist for harmonic 
support, and the trombonist has a knack for employing the best. When his 
longtime associate Ken Filiano moved east, Sellers brought in upright master 
Michael Formanek from New York for his group's featured appearance at the 
Alligator Lounge's "New Music Mondays" series in October. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Sellers' current bassist, Trey Henry, was with Vlatkovitch in Santa 
Monica, so the trombonist sought out Orange County resident Art Davis to fill 
the bill. It was a wise choice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who's worked with the likes of Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie and the New 
York Philharmonic, has plenty of "free jazz" experience, having recorded with 
John Coltrane on the tenor titan's landmark, avant-garde experiment 
"Ascension." 
</P>
<P>
 Add tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, who spent time with the Mingus Big Band 
Workshop, the repertory ensemble that has for the last few years played weekly 
at Greenwich Village's Time Cafe, and you have a team as varied in personality 
as the crew of the Starship Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet opened with a skewered version of Cole Porter's "I Love You" that 
found Sellers and Malaby exchanging lines before joining with Davis and Mintz 
to hint at the familiar theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' spare, low-end support was decorated with higher-pitched details placed 
between the horn players' lines, then sped ahead as the trombonist moved into 
his solo. Malaby followed with short, pointed statements that gave way to a 
swinging passage that he handled assertively, while the trombonist added 
ascending phrases in support. 
</P>
<P>
 The bassist's solo balanced melodic passages against bursts of notes in the 
upper register. Then Mintz, stroking his kit deliberately with the brushes, 
painted a backdrop in which time seemed to stand still. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaby's "Cosas" featured strong interplay between the saxophonist and his 
trombone-wielding boss. "Mesopotamian Love God" was a bluesy march that 
featured Davis' bowed, Mingus-minded solo. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was "If I Only Had a Brain" that best revealed the madness behind 
Sellers' method. The trombonist used one line from the familiar lyric as a 
touchstone as he wandered far from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers isn't one to bluster on the slide. Instead his playing is surprisingly 
melodic, though skewered against the rhythm. At times his attack resembled the 
art that hung from the System M walls: cartoonish figures in dangerous 
predicaments superimposed over classical landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaby's playing also carried a confident lyricism, while ranging far and wide 
from a number's melody. He seemed especially adept at moving from confused, 
cacophonous phrases into ones of great beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 The combo took Lee Konitz's bop-meets-free-jazz exercise "Subconscious Lee" 
into the outer realms with Malaby's anxious tenor improvisation leading the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 The tune was proof that Sellers' ensemble is a vital one that deserves to be 
heard more frequently. (Sellers also leads a nine-piece ensemble that has 
recorded two excellent CDs for the adventurous 9 Winds label, but that group 
hasn't played Southern California since an appearance at El Matador in 
Huntington Beach some three years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Booking this kind of music into the current, conservative club scene takes a 
bit of nerve if not artistic commitment. More clubs should follow System M's 
lead.

THE CONFESSIONS OF SINGER MIGUEL BOSE; POP MUSIC: ONCE A SEX SYMBOL AMONG 
SPAIN'S TEEN-AGERS, THE 37-YEAR-OLD SINGER-ACTOR OFFERS MATURE MUSICAL EMOTIONS 
FOR HIS L.A. CONCERT DEBUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In his role as a transvestite prosecutor in director Pedro Almodovar's movie 
"High Heels," Miguel Bose says, "I can be the man you want me to be."  
</P>
<P>
 In real life, the Spanish singer-actor has struggled to establish whom he 
wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 albums and 35 film appearances over a 21-year career, the teen 
sex-symbol image of his early fame lingers, while he works to be taken 
seriously as an artist expressing deeper emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sex-symbol part never bothered me, but believe me, the 17-year-old Miguel 
Bose is long gone," said Bose, now 37, during a recent phone interview from 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Bose will make his Los Angeles concert debut on Thursday at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, then perform at the San Diego Sports Arena on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maturity is clear in his latest album, the ambitious "Bajo el signo de Cain" 
("Under the Sign of Cain"). The collection, produced by Ross Collum (Enya, 
Howard Jones) includes songs with direct lyrics dealing with the environment, 
spirituality, exile and unfulfilled love. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a tongue-in-cheek song commenting on the wild stories about his 
personal life that have circulated in the Spanish press in recent years, 
including three reports that he had died -- one claiming his demise was the 
result of a motorcycle accident, a second saying he'd gone over a cliff in his 
car and a third that he'd succumbed to AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a demented, cheap, gratuitous attack from a small sector" of the 
press, said Bose, the son of renowned actress Lucia Bose and legendary 
bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguin. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors spread quickly in Spain, and ultimately spurred him to address his 
image through his music, with the new album ranking as his most confessional 
and personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most accurate self-portrait I've ever done," said Bose, whose 
first musical influences were the records his father would bring home from 
bullfighting seasons in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dozens of vinyl records of salsa, vallenatos , cumbias and boleros," 
Bose said. "Just the ritual of looking at the suitcase was enough for me to get 
goosebumps." 
</P>
<P>
 After spending two years as a student in England in the mid-1970s, he added 
the Beatles, Roxy Music, Genesis and David Bowie to his favorites. Today Bose's 
music is an uncommercial blend of American pop, Latin rhythms and flamenco 
grooves stressing mood more than melody, with a rich instrumentation that 
includes Indian violin, Irish bagpipe, mandolin and flamenco guitar and 
percussion -- not exactly what you'd expect from a former teen idol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do what I want to do, not what people expect me to do," said Bose, 
who in July will make his debut as a playwright and stage director at a theater 
festival in Merida, Spain, where his "La espera" ("The Wait") -- a dramatic 
play based on discourses by Spanish theater heroines in times of war -- will be 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
 After "High Heels," Bose starred with Isabelle Adjani in "La Nuit Sacree." In 
"Mazeppa" he played a young 19th-Century artist obsessed with horses. Although 
he plans to continue acting in films, his main interests remain music and 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "After each movie I always end up desperate to write and record new material 
right away," he said. "I'm in a perfect age for things to come, and I proved to 
be very good at survival."

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ROBE' IS TESTAMENT TO HOLLYWOOD STORYTELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few actors could do religious ecstasy like Victor Mature. He'd flex that 
2-by-4 jaw, let his eyes fill with rapture and then sigh like only a true 
believer can sigh. When it came to Hollywood biblical Babylon, Mature was one 
of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 He actually was a pretty mediocre actor, known more for his handsome face, 
curly hark and coupe-sized shoulders. But in movies such as "Samson and 
Delilah," "Demetrius and the Gladiators" and "The Robe," he was the faithful's 
poster boy, big-studio style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Robe," directed by Henry Koster for 20th Century Fox in 1953, features 
what is possibly Mature's most earnestly devoted performance, as a slave who 
turns away from all things pagan. The video is being shown today and Friday at 
the Cypress Senior Center in a free screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood had turned to the Bible for epic pictures heavy on sex, sin and 
redemption before, but the '50s proved to be an especially fertile period for 
this stuff. The Old and New Testaments offered familiar tales of drama and 
moral sweep, and top producers such as Darryl F. Zanuck and Frank Ross (who did 
"The Robe") took advantage, usually with little restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And what better way to show off CinemaScope, film's giant-screen process that 
was supposed to keep people in the theaters instead of home watching that new 
gizmo called television? CinemaScope and Technicolor were real modern miracles; 
"The Robe" was one of the first flicks to combine them. 
</P>
<P>
 They certainly made Mature look larger-than-life, but he wasn't the only one. 
He tends to stand out in hindsight because "The Robe" became such a symbol of 
the genre that made him famous. But at the time, much of the attention went to 
the young Richard Burton, who received a best actor Oscar nomination for his 
role as Marcellus, a party-mad Roman soldier who eventually finds Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The movie starts off saucily, mostly because of Marcellus' affair with 
dark-eyed Diana (Jean Simmons, fetching in burlap and sandals). There's a lot 
of heat there, which doesn't get by Caligula (a snarling Jay Robinson), who 
also likes Diana and blocks the romance by banishing Marcellus to Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy in this outback, Marcellus is ordered to supervise what he thinks is a 
routine execution. But Christ's death brings a transformation; Marcellus is 
tortured by the memory of it (and by the fact that he won Christ's robe while 
gambling at the foot of the cross), and he seeks out Mature's Demetrius for 
answers. His salvation, marked by grandiloquent gestures and music, comes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even a zealous fundamentalist could call this art. On the other hand, 
neither should the most sensitive religious scholar be offended by the 
picture's well-meaning excesses. "The Robe" is what it always has been -- an 
icon of Hollywood showiness. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Robe" is being shown today and Friday at 12:45 p.m. at the Cypress 
Senior Citizens Center, 9031 Grindley St., Cypress. Free. (714) 229-6780.

SANTA MONICA FREEWAY TO REOPEN ON TUESDAY; RECOVERY: THE CONTRACTOR WILL GET A 
$14.5-MILLION BONUS FOR FINISHING EARTHQUAKE REPAIRS 74 DAYS EARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than three months after the Northridge earthquake knocked down two 
sections of the world's busiest thoroughfare, Gov. Pete Wilson announced 
Tuesday that the Santa Monica Freeway will reopen next week, ending frustrating 
delays and bottlenecks for thousands of commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials hope the final cleanup of construction work can be completed 
early April 12 in time to let rush-hour traffic inaugurate the two new freeway 
bridges at La Cienega and Washington boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the promise of an extra $200,000 a day for every day work was 
completed ahead of schedule, the contractor, C. C. Myers Inc., will finish the 
project 74 days before a June 24 deadline and rack up a $14.5-million bonus for 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-speed construction was made possible by crews working around the 
clock, seven days a week, and by state officials cutting through red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This freeway, with its broken bridges, broken connectors, became one of the 
most visible signs of the devastation brought upon Los Angeles by the 
Northridge earthquake," Wilson said during a news conference at the freeway. 
"Now its rebuilding and its reopening . . . will serve as one of the . . . 
symbols of the energy of this great community." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels estimated that without 
the accelerated effort the project would probably have taken two years to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 But the acceleration did not come without cost. With the bonuses given to C. 
C. Myers, the price tag on the project rose from the original bid of $14.9 
million to nearly $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton Myers, president of the Rancho Cordova, Calif., construction 
company, had to hire extra crews, pay overtime and rent extra equipment, he 
said he will end up with about an $8-million profit. Asked what he was going to 
do with the money, he said, "I'm gonna buy me a bigger airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 The final price tag is more than offset by the economic losses that Los 
Angeles would have experienced if the freeway had remained closed until the 
June 24 deadline, officials said. A study by the governor's Office of Planning 
and Research concluded that the closure of the Santa Monica Freeway cost the 
economy of Los Angeles and neighboring communities about $1 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Santa Monica project demonstrates what can happen when private sector 
innovation and market incentives replace business as usual," said Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan, who joined Wilson and Caltrans officials at the news 
conference. "This is the way government should be carried out all the time, not 
just in emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's chief economist, Philip J. Romero, said that of all the bridges that 
collapsed in the Jan. 17 quake, those on the Santa Monica Freeway -- the main 
east-west artery in Los Angeles -- were the most costly to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 With an average of 341,000 vehicles a day using the roadway, he said, the 
extra time it took goods to get to their destinations and workers to get to 
their jobs cost millions in lost production and wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway collapse has pushed traffic onto crowded surface streets between 
Santa Monica and Downtown Los Angeles as frustrated commuters sought 
alternative routes. Detours have caused delays of 20 minutes or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridges on the Santa Monica were among six that collapsed in the 
Northridge earthquake and are the first to be rebuilt. Construction at all the 
other bridge sites is expected to be completed ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) suggested that the announcement of the 
reopening may have been timed to give Wilson maximum media exposure to help his 
reelection effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said that when Van Loben Sels was asked at a public hearing Monday when 
the freeway would reopen, the Caltrans director had answered that it would be 
in May or possibly at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously from a commuter standpoint I think (reopening) is great and it 
shows that the private sector has a role to play in making government work," 
Katz said. "But I'm a little surprised that Caltrans Monday didn't have this 
information or kept it secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Brennan, a spokesman for Caltrans, said the agency did not know for 
sure that the freeway would be able to reopen next week until officials did a 
walk-through of the site Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said he expected from the beginning of the project that he would be able 
to beat the Caltrans deadline by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody could build this any faster," Myers said. "I wouldn't say it was piece 
of cake, but we knew we could do it within 100 days." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers' company did similar work after the Loma Prieta quake. Caltrans selected 
Myers to rebuild two damaged bridges on California 1 near Watsonville. The 
agency allotted 100 days for completion of the project, which was the first 
time officials had used the incentive program, offering $30,000 for each day 
that Myers finished early. After working around the clock, the company came in 
45 days ahead of schedule despite winter rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the Northridge earthquake, Caltrans officials predicted that 
it would take 12 to 18 months to rebuild bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway 
and the region's five other damaged freeways. Then officials decided it could 
be done with greater speed, especially since the federal government would cover 
100% of the costs if all work was completed within 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Caltrans announced that the freeways would be restored within six 
months, many Angelenos were skeptical. Five years after the Loma Prieta 
earthquake struck the Bay Area, not a single damaged freeway there has been 
completely rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans' district director, Jerry Baxter, said the Santa Monica Freeway 
bridges were reconstructed with deeper pilings, larger columns and more steel 
reinforcement than the spans they replaced. "They're the ultimate in design for 
safety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, Myers has won more business from Caltrans than any 
other contractor. He was selected for four contracts in 1993 that totaled $108 
million and eight projects worth $131.6 million the previous year, said Jim 
Drago, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who goes in with an attitude of 'I'm going to finish early and 
make a bonus,' " said Jim Roberts, the state's chief bridge engineer, in an 
interview last month. "Most of the contractors (on the quake-damaged freeways) 
are ahead of schedule but he's so far ahead it's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Santa Monica, five companies competed to do the reconstruction work. 
Brutoco Engineering & Construction was the lowest bidder, vowing to do the 
project for $20 million in 100 days. But when an error was found in its bid 
application, the company withdrew. Caltrans selected Myers to do the job in 140 
days for $14.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure speedy work, officials set up incentives and penalties: For every 
day ahead of schedule that work was finished, the company would receive 
$200,000, and it would be penalized at the same rate for lateness. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials based the amount of the incentive bonus on a complicated 
set of estimates of the daily cost to Los Angeles of having interrupted freeway 
service. Of all the contracts awarded, the incentive was largest on the Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early stages, workers on the Santa Monica Freeway hit some unexpected 
problems. First they discovered old foundations that had to be removed. Then 
they found contaminated underground water, which had to be disposed of 
according to state regulations. These snags delayed construction by about eight 
days, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things all add up to a little extra time," he said. "You lose a day 
here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Myers was confident that the freeway would be open to traffic in a 
week. He did, however, have one concern. A truck loaded with supplies left New 
York City at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, headed for the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as that truck doesn't break down," Myers joked. "That would be the 
only problem."

MARINE FOR 11 YEARS TURNS SELF IN AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT; MILITARY: HE SAYS A 
RECRUITER SUPPLIED BOGUS PAPERS. HIS SUPERIOR AND A CONGRESSMAN SUPPORT BID FOR 
LEGAL STATUS. 
</P>

<P>
 Danny Lightfoot is a sergeant in the Marine Corps. He also is an illegal 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 The native of the Bahamas, a Marine for 11 years, turned himself in to 
immigration authorities in Los Angeles on Tuesday, hoping to gain legal status. 
He has the support of his commanding officer and a local congressman, who 
describe him as an outstanding soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should I have to make the ultimate sacrifice one day, I would willingly die 
defending America," Lightfoot said. "My only regret would be that I would not 
die as an American." 
</P>
<P>
 At Marine Corps headquarters in Arlington, Va., a spokesman called Lightfoot's 
case "an unusual situation." But officials did not respond to questions about 
how an illegal immigrant could join the Corps and go undetected for years. The 
case comes at a time when the government is seeking to crack down on private 
employers for hiring undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightfoot, 29, entered the country legally but stayed beyond the expiration 
date of his student visa. 
</P>
<P>
 While living in Miami, he enlisted in the Marines in 1983, using fraudulent 
papers that he contends were supplied by a recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Lightfoot was reassigned to the United States after a tour in 
Okinawa. To obtain U.S. passports for his family, he was told that he needed 
proof of citizenship. Two of his children were born abroad and a third child 
was born in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightfoot said he had no choice but to acknowledge his undocumented status to 
military authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not come forward sooner because I was sure it would jeopardize my 
Marine Corps career, which I felt was the only way to support my family," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Naval Investigative Service conducted an inquiry, but it resulted in no 
charges against the recruiter "as the statute of limitations had run out," said 
a Marine Corps spokesman. Lightfoot was not prosecuted because "he had a clean 
record." 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Corps officials said they notified the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service of Lightfoot's status later in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Lightfoot stood out from other immigrants lined up at the INS office 
as he walked in wearing his uniform with multicolored ribbons above his left 
shirt pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marine Corps is backing me 100%," he said, with letters in hand from his 
superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sgt. Lightfoot is deserving of special consideration because he has 
demonstrated his commitment to America by his willingness to defend it with his 
life," said a letter from Lt. Col. F. L. Kebelman III, executive officer at the 
Marine Corps Logistics Base in Barstow, where Lightfoot is stationed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the INS asking that Lightfoot be given legal status, Rep. Jerry 
Lewis (R-Redlands) said, "Sgt. Lightfoot has received several awards and 
commendations as the result of his dedication and loyalty to the Marine Corps 
and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has not seen combat, Lightfoot has earned a Navy achievement 
medal, three good conduct medals, two certificates of commendation, seven 
letters of appreciation and a meritorious unit commendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightfoot was accompanied at the INS office by his wife, Raquel, a Bahamian 
who is also asking for legal residency, and their attorney, Carl Shusterman. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say illegal aliens take jobs away, take welfare," Shusterman said. 
"This guy, who is an illegal alien, is willing to die for this country." 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with an immigration officer, Lightfoot was permitted to return 
to the Marine Corps base in Barstow until a hearing is set on his request for 
legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Although immigration officials have yet to make a recommendation on 
Lightfoot's request, "the investigator could not have been more friendly," said 
Shusterman. "He turned out to be an ex-Marine." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald B. Looney, deputy director of the INS in Los Angeles, said that over 
the years, the INS has encountered illegal immigrants in the military. "I don't 
think it happens as much as it did when there was a big push to recruit people 
for the military," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightfoot was permitted to return to the base because he is not considered a 
threat to public safety or likely to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, illegal immigrants can apply for "suspension of deportation" 
proceedings if they have lived in the country for seven years and are of good 
moral character and if their deportation would cause a hardship on their 
family. But in the case of illegal immigrants in the military, the residency 
requirement is only two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lightfoot: "I would like my family to be privileged with everything that 
the average American has. . . . I hope the United States will see that I have 
been serving the country."

JUSTICE BLACKMUN EXPECTED TO RETIRE; SUPREME COURT: THE 85-YEAR-OLD AUTHOR OF 
ROE VS. WADE OPINION WILL LIKELY ANNOUNCE HIS RESIGNATION TODAY. CLINTON MAY 
SEEK A 'COALITION BUILDER' TO FILL THE POST.

<P>
 Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the 85-year-old author of the Roe vs. 
Wade opinion that made abortion legal, is expected to announce his retirement 
today, according to Clinton Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth oldest person ever to serve on the court, Blackmun has broadly 
hinted in recent months that this term, ending in late June, would be his last. 
Court officials said he has not hired law clerks for the next term and 
Administration officials said that they expect Blackmun will issue a letter 
today announcing his resignation at the end of the term. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who paid tribute to Blackmun at a January retreat in South 
Carolina, told reporters Tuesday night that he has not discussed the pending 
retirement with the justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let Justice Blackmun speak for himself," Clinton said after a town hall 
meeting in Charlotte, N.C. "I have not spoken with him." 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of Blackmun, the most liberal of the nine justices, is not 
likely to alter the ideological makeup of the court. However, it will give 
Clinton a second chance to put his stamp on the panel -- and possibly, as White 
House aides put it, fill the post with a "coalition builder" who could bring 
together moderate and liberal members of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is expected to move quickly to nominate Blackmun's successor. 
Last year, the President spent 83 days -- making several false starts -- before 
settling on Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg as his first Supreme Court nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the list of potential nominees has been pared. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading candidate is said to be retiring Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell, 60, a Maine Democrat and a former federal judge. Mitchell issued a 
surprise announcement last month that he was quitting politics at the end of 
this year to pursue other, unspecified challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, when word reached the White House that Justice Byron R. White was 
retiring, Clinton reportedly exclaimed: "Do you know who would be perfect for 
that job? George Mitchell!" 
</P>
<P>
 But the President was soon talked out of that notion because the White House 
could not afford to lose the influential Democratic leader of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Clinton has maintained his interest in putting a political leader 
on the court, a jurist who could forge a moderate-liberal coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Even this year, however, a Mitchell nomination could pose problems. With the 
legislative fight over health care looming, the White House still needs his 
leadership in the Senate for the remainder of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The other top candidates are said to be U.S. District Judge Jose Cabranes, 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and U.S. Solicitor General Drew S. Days III. 
Cabranes was considered for the last court opening and would become the first 
Latino justice, if he is chosen. Babbitt was a finalist last time. Days, a 
former Yale Law professor, is one of the Administration's top-ranking African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy White House Counsel Joel Klein was to travel to Charlotte today to 
brief Clinton on the impending resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been some preliminary thinking at the staff level . . . but the 
President has not engaged in any serious conversation on this yet," a senior 
Administration official said late Tuesday. Asked if the White House is likely 
to seek a minority or another woman candidate, the official said that "the 
feeling is he has a free hand to go wherever he wants," largely because he 
chose a woman for the court last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisers to former President George Bush looked long and hard to find a Latino 
judge for the high court and briefly considered Cabranes. Clinton 
Administration officials said that they would dearly love to put the first 
Latino on the court and Cabranes is said to remain the top Latino candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Two long-shot possibilities reportedly are Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and Assistant 
Atty. Gen. Walter Dellinger, head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal 
Counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun's departure after 24 years on the court culminates one of the more 
remarkable transformations in court history. A little known Republican judge 
from St. Paul, Minn., he was nominated in 1970 by President Richard Nixon, 
mostly because of a strong recommendation by his boyhood friend, fellow 
Minnesotan and then-Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun was Nixon's third choice for the vacancy left by the sudden 
resignation of Justice Abe Fortas. Nixon's first two nominees -- Southern 
judges F. Clement Haynsworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell -- met defeat in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, Nixon turned to a safe choice, but promised that the appeals court 
judge from St. Paul would be a "strict constructionist" and "law and order" 
jurist. And at first, Blackmun ran true to that form. As one of the four "Nixon 
justices," he cast crucial votes to strengthen criminal law and to restore the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun voted so often with Burger that they became known as the "Minnesota 
Twins." 
</P>
<P>
 But after writing the landmark abortion rights opinion in 1973, Blackmun began 
a gradual shift to the left. His closest friend on the court became Justice 
William J. Brennan, the panel's leading liberal, and Blackmun became 
increasingly disaffected with Burger. 
</P>
<P>
 In their later years, the two hardly spoke and Blackmun took delight in 
circulating stories that portrayed the white-haired chief justice as a petty 
dunderhead. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1980s, Blackmun stood with the court's reliable liberals as a defender 
of affirmative action, a proponent of strict separation between church and 
state and, of course, a champion of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Blackmun become the leading voice for abortion rights? Friends noted 
his background as a general counsel for the renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
Minn. Over many years, they said, Blackmun associated with more doctors than 
lawyers. It has been often noted that his Roe vs. Wade decision reads more like 
the work of a medical historian than a constitutional lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps even more important was his family. His energetic and engaging 
wife, Dotty, and their three daughters did far more than any law book to 
influence Blackmun toward becoming the court's leading advocate of women's 
rights, his friends have said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Blackmun predicted that the Roe decision would "go down the drain," 
defeated by new justices appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 But to his surprise and delight, the abortion right survived in 1992, thanks 
largely to the votes of three Reagan-Bush appointees: Sandra Day O'Connor, 
Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter. Joining Blackmun and Justice John Paul 
Stevens, they formed a five-member majority to uphold the basic right to choose 
abortion in the case of Casey vs. Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, just as so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown 
bright," Blackmun wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In similar transformation in February, Blackmun broke with his own written 
precedents and denounced capital punishment as unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death," 
he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 At the court, Blackmun is seen as something of a loner. He has never been an 
intellectual leader among the justices. Throughout his career, he often 
agonized for weeks over close cases and on occasion later changed his mind and 
repudiated a previous decision. During oral arguments, he rarely asks a 
question and never engages attorneys in a debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has remained a hard worker well into his ninth decade. On weekdays, 
without fail, he can be seen in the court's cafeteria at 8 a.m. eating 
breakfast with his four law clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerks said that Blackmun still labors for months over a majority opinion and, 
to their dismay, he even personally checks the legal citations they have 
supplied. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers John M. Broder in Charlotte, N.C., and David Lauter in 
Washington contributed to this story.

TRIAL FOCUSES ON VALIDITY OF RECOVERED MEMORIES; PSYCHIATRY: A MAN'S 
MALPRACTICE SUIT AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER'S THERAPISTS SAYS THEY CREATED HER 
VISIONS OF INCEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For years the memories lay buried, hidden beneath layers of pain and shame and 
fear. Then one day, Holly Ramona says, they crept out, convincing her that she 
had been raped repeatedly by her doting father between the ages of 5 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
 For her, the "recovery" of those dormant memories was a wrenching but 
necessary breakthrough, one achieved with the aid of a caring therapist she had 
consulted for help with an eating disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 But for her father it meant the collapse of a marriage, abandonment by his 
children, a shattered reputation and the end of a lucrative career in the Napa 
Valley wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, four years after the allegations tore up his life, Gary Ramona is 
striking back at those he insists led his daughter tragically astray. In a 
malpractice case that could break legal ground, Ramona says his daughter's 
Orange County therapist and a consulting psychiatrist prompted her to 
manufacture memories of events that never took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which is being played out before a Superior Court jury here, is at 
the frontier of the highly charged debate over recovered memory therapy, which 
experts call the most divisive issue to confront the mental health profession 
in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Some psychologists contend that victims of childhood sexual abuse often 
repress recollections of the traumatic events and can retrieve them -- 
sometimes in exquisite detail -- years later. Others, however, assail that 
proposition and accuse overzealous therapists of using questionable techniques 
to plant false memories in the minds of suggestible patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona's goal -- aside from winning more than $8 million in lost wages and 
other damages -- is to convince his daughter that she was wronged and win back 
her love. But his case could have much broader repercussions. If he prevails 
and the judgment is upheld on appeal, attorneys say, it could mark the first 
time a therapist is held accountable for malpractice by a non-patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the recovered memory movement are hoping desperately for just such 
an outcome, arguing that it would give falsely accused molesters an opportunity 
to challenge therapists -- and collect damages in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovered memory phenomenon "is going to go down as the psychiatric 
quackery of the 20th Century," said Richard Ofshe, a social psychologist at UC 
Berkeley and author of an upcoming book on false memories. "If family members 
who are damaged by these irresponsible practitioners win the right to react in 
the legal setting, then maybe we can stop this epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists, however, worry that awarding such legal rights to third parties 
would disrupt their relations with patients, impairing their ability to help 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary Ramona claims he can reach into the otherwise private world of therapy 
and just jerk his daughter back out if she says something he doesn't like," 
said attorney Jeffry Kurtock, who represents Holly Ramona's therapist. "The 
question here is if you go to a therapist, who is that therapy for, for you or 
for somebody else?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its third week, the Ramona trial has been a source of great intrigue in 
the tranquil Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ramona, 50, is well known around the vineyards. He served as a vice 
president for Robert Mondavi Winery, where he supervised worldwide marketing 
and sales, and earned $400,000 a year in salary and benefits before he was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona says his life with his wife, Stephanie, and three daughters was a happy 
one. Home movies shown during the trial reveal family vacations to the Bahamas, 
high school graduations, talent shows -- and numerous scenes of a cheerful 
Holly Ramona with a toothy smile and long, brown hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Her version of events is somewhat different. She has yet to testify, but 
lawyers representing her side said that the Ramonas had marital problems and 
that the family was split by jealousies over Holly Ramona's "favorite child" 
status. As attorney Bruce Miroglio put it, "It wasn't Ward and June Cleaver." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona's suspicions that she may have been molested surfaced in early 
1990, when she was receiving therapy for depression and bulimia while attending 
UC Irvine. The memories appeared in fragments -- black-and-white, freeze-frame 
images of a hand on her abdomen, a flurry of sheets, and, later, of her 
father's head and shoulders between her raised legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurtock, the attorney for Holly Ramona's therapist, Marche Isabella, said such 
memories emerged at college "because Holly was finally away from the influence 
of her father and in a safe place." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gary Ramona -- and a prominent psychiatrist testifying on his behalf -- 
contend that Isabella planted the idea of sexual abuse in Holly's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in her treatment, for instance, Isabella told Holly Ramona that 70% to 
80% of bulimia patients had been sexually abused. She also cited sexual abuse 
as a possible explanation for Holly Ramona's fear of snakes and her long 
history of urinary tract infections. When she told Isabella that her father had 
once glanced at her in a sexual way, the therapist called it "emotional 
incest." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Holly Ramona underwent a painful medical procedure in which an 
instrument was inserted into her urethra, and she told Isabella that a 
baby-sitter had once sat astride her and simulated sex. Both of these episodes 
could have been considered as potential causes for her images of rape, experts 
testifying for the plaintiffs say. 
</P>
<P>
 After several months of therapy, Holly Ramona -- still uncertain about the 
meaning of her visions -- said she wanted to be interviewed under the influence 
of sodium amytal, and Isabella agreed, even though some experts consider the 
barbiturate an unreliable tool for verifying memories. The drug was 
administered at Western Medical Center by Dr. Richard Rose, a psychiatrist who, 
along with Isabella and the center, is a defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, Holly Ramona recounted multiple episodes of abuse, 
although her descriptions were vague and she said she could not see her 
father's face clearly. Afterward, Isabella reportedly called Holly Ramona's 
mother and said, "It's rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Park Elliott Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist hired by Gary Ramona, 
testified that Isabella's conclusion was "an outrageous misrepresentation." 
Throughout their treatment of Holly Ramona, said Dietz, a professor at UCLA 
Medical School, Isabella and Rose failed to follow standards for acceptable 
therapeutic care. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurtock replied that Isabella and Rose were not negligent and instead helped 
Holly Ramona, who is now in graduate school, develop into "a charming woman 
leading a healthy life." Gary Ramona's lawsuit, Kurtock said, "is his way to 
get back at his daughter -- to show her that even if she tries to get help, 
he'll come after her." 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Holly Ramona's sodium amytal interview, she confronted her 
father with her allegations of rape. Despite his vehement denials, his wife 
filed for divorce immediately. He has had no contact with his family since. 
</P>
<P>
 "They destroyed my life -- my career, my family, my friends, that's all gone 
because of what they did," he said in an interview. "With this lawsuit, I just 
hope and pray my daughter will realize the truth about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the details differ, the Ramona case mirrors the experience of 
thousands of other parents accused of abuse by children who recover memories in 
therapy. Founders of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, a sort of national 
support group for accused molesters, say that 12,000 families have sought their 
services since the foundation's inception two years ago.

COALITION SPLIT MUDDIES ITALY'S POLITICAL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The right-wing alliance that billionaire Silvio Berlusconi led to a landmark 
electoral victory splintered in acrimony Tuesday, jeopardizing the stability of 
any new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi angrily broke off negotiations to form a government alliance with 
Umberto Bossi of the federalist Northern League. Bossi has been insulting 
Berlusconi almost without pause in recent days. An autocrat, a potential 
demagogue, "Berlus-kaiser," snapped the obdurate Bossi on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of electoral reforms that made politics more transparent, such 
theatrics are visible for the first time to Italians weaned on back-room deals, 
leaving analysts to wonder whether Tuesday's noisy split was a tactic or a 
symptom of a breach too wide to mend. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a hastily summoned news conference in Milan on Tuesday after new 
Bossi barrages, Berlusconi called it quits. He said he expects to be named 
prime minister and that he will ask Parliament to ratify him and a Cabinet he 
will assemble. Failing that, Italy will immediately return to the polls, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered him the post, Berlusconi said, "the 
next day there would be a government program, a team and, without 
consultations, we would go directly to the Parliament" for a vote of 
confidence. "If that didn't happen, then let's go to new elections to complete 
the cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi said after Berlusconi's remarks, "I think he's lost his nerve." 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, 57, a media and real estate magnate who does not take criticism 
lightly, emerged as an overnight sensation in elections last week that 
overturned nearly half a century of centrist rule in Italy. Running in his 
first election, Berlusconi and his Forza Italia (Go Italy) won control of the 
powerful lower house of Parliament and a near majority in the upper in concert 
with Bossi's northern-based party and neo-fascists led by Gianfranco Fini. 
</P>
<P>
 But trying to translate the electoral returns into a government program has 
short-circuited the nominal three-party alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The main cause is Bossi, whom Berlusconi excoriated for an hour Tuesday 
without naming him directly. The rough-talking, uncompromising senator dislikes 
Berlusconi's command of a large section of the Italian media and his prince's 
role in big business. Bossi also dislikes the neo-fascists, junior partners in 
the electoral alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a betrayal . . . scandalous what's happening," Berlusconi said. "From 
now on, we will not talk with the League or any other party. We will simply 
wait until the president announces his intentions." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the constitution, Italy's figurehead president appoints a party leader 
to form a government -- in this case Berlusconi, as leader of the largest 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi charges that Bossi is "an obstacle to reform," while Bossi terms 
his putative ally a self-aggrandizing autocrat who is a danger to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi insists on federalism as the basis of any government with Northern 
League support. He hates the less developed Italian south, which he sees as 
draining the productive north of money and resources and the chance to be a 
first-row player in the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, whose campaign centered around Ronald Reagan-like promises of more 
jobs and lower taxes, says he is ready to talk about federalism. Bossi, though, 
who in post-election euphoria appeared to have withdrawn objections to 
Berlusconi as prime minister, failed even to turn up at a scheduled summit last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Bossi, whose party claims 122 of the winning alliance's 366 seats 
in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, has railed against Berlusconi to 
every passing camera from his vacation home in the Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 Fini, by contrast, whose extreme-right party was restored to respectability by 
the election for the first time in 50 years, strongly supports Berlusconi as 
prime minister. Fini expects major government participation by his newly named 
National Alliance, although no government post for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Fini said he does not believe Bossi can defect from the right-wing alliance. 
"He must be with us. He has nowhere else to go," Fini said, arguing that the 
backlash from frustrated voters would be disastrous for the league at any new 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berlusconi was right to break off the talks. How could he continue 
negotiations with somebody who takes back the day after everything he said the 
day before," said Fini. "Bossi has broken the eggs without making the omelet."

JUDGE BLOCKS AT&T'S PLAN TO ACQUIRE MCCAW CELLULAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON and MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled Tuesday that American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s 
proposed $12.6-billion acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. 
violates the landmark consent decree that broke up the phone monopoly 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which could scuttle perhaps the most important such deal in 
years, was handed down by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, who issued the 
consent decree in the first place and whose rulings have helped shape 
telecommunications ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, along with a recent decision by the Federal Communications 
Commission to roll back cable rates, were strong signs that the government will 
continue to play an important role in determining the nature and speed of the 
telecommunications revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T moved swiftly to squelch any notion that Greene's ruling would end the 
proposed merger and vowed to win him over to its point of view. "Judge Greene 
didn't foreclose AT&T being granted a waiver," the giant company said in a 
hastily issued statement. "In fact, he left the door wide open to us to 
demonstrate why such a waiver is in the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed AT&T-McCaw merger would be one of the largest in corporate 
history. It would integrate AT&T's long-distance network with McCaw's national 
local cellular networks to create a form of national cellular service. The deal 
was announced in August as part of an ongoing consolidation in 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, Sprint acquired Centel Corp., the 11th-largest cellular 
company, and MCI has since said it would invest $1.3 billion in Nextel, a 
prominent player in wireless communications. 
</P>
<P>
 While much attention has been paid to the concept of high-speed networks of 
fiber-optic and coaxial cables, wireless technology is considered crucial to an 
Information Age in which users can be served anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's merger plans have come under a cloud at the same time some other big 
deals in telecommunications have collapsed. Also on Tuesday, Cox Cable 
Communications and Southwestern Bell Corp. scrapped their tentative agreement 
to form a $4.9-billion cable television partnership, blaming the FCC's recent 
decision to cut cable TV rates 7% on top of a 10% rollback that went into 
effect last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in February, cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc. and Bell Atlantic 
Corp. called off their merger plan, also attributing the cancellation in part 
to the FCC rate rollback. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T said it would revise its petition and is confident that the deal will go 
through. Industry analysts were less optimistic, giving the deal a 50-50 
chance. A number of other obstacles, such as FCC approval, remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene's ruling also raises questions about the applicability of the consent 
decree to a new era of telecommunications. In the interest of breaking up a 
monopoly, the decree separated the long-distance market from local calling, the 
wireless carriers from the wired, and created rules that prevented 
long-distance and local phone companies from entering one another's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with new technology making possible all sorts of services, cable firms 
want to provide telephone service and phone companies want to provide 
movies-on-demand. Local exchange carriers want to compete in the long-distance 
market and long-distance phone companies want into the local markets. They are 
all jockeying for a "level playing field." And Greene, who authored the 
original consent decree in 1982, holds a good many of the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem is that regulators and judges are preventing convergence 
and standing in the way of society's benefits," said Berge Ayvazian, senior 
telecommunications analyst at the Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm. 
"These companies should be unleashed to allow the next era of 
telecommunications to come forth with full participation from all competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T needs Greene's approval because McCaw holds minority interests in 
cellular companies in which two regional Bell companies also have ownership 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 One provision in the decree bars AT&T from acquiring the stock or assets of 
any regional Bell firm. The Justice Department also has been reviewing whether 
the proposed deal violates antitrust laws but has yet to take a position on the 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the prospects for local telephone competition will be 
increased or decreased by the merger. If AT&T can persuade Greene that 
competition would be enhanced, the deal may yet go through. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, local exchange carriers, who have been denied the right to compete in 
video and long-distance markets, argued against granting the AT&T-McCaw waiver 
on the basis that it would give the long-distance carrier an unfair advantage 
in the local market. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bills are pending in Congress to allow for more competition and 
"convergence" between communications firms. Cable, phone and wireless firms 
have made the case that a new communications infrastructure -- which would 
provide consumers with videos-on-demand, home shopping, teleconferencing and 
access to vast databases of information -- will be so expensive that they need 
to pool some of their resources to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his ruling Tuesday, Greene rejected AT&T's petition: "In the court's 
view, there can be no serious doubt that the merger would indeed violate the 
plain and express language of the decree," Greene said in the 23-page ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . It is the obligation of this court to enforce the decree as it is 
written." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Ratliffe, a spokesman for McCaw in Kirkland, Wash., described Greene's 
ruling as "a request for information," saying that the judge for some reason 
had not received some pertinent information that had been filed with the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 BellSouth, a regional Bell company based in Atlanta, was the first to lodge a 
protest against the proposed merger with Greene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased with the ruling," William Barfield, BellSouth's associate 
general counsel, said in a statement. "It means that AT&T has to demonstrate in 
open court that a modification of the decree is in the public interest and is 
justified by changes in law and facts since the decree was entered." 
</P>
<P>
 BellSouth's protest grew out of its opinion that, by acquiring McCaw, AT&T was 
effectively "re-acquiring" pieces of Bell operating companies, something that 
the decree prohibits. BellSouth, with McCaw, owns 60% of one of the two 
cellular companies operating in Los Angeles and about 50% of a cellular company 
in Houston.

STOCKS JUMP 82 IN BEST ONE-DAY GAIN IN 2 1/2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A sharp decline in bond interest rates sent stocks to their biggest one-day 
rally in 2 1/2 years on Tuesday, triggering hopes that the recent selloff may 
finally be subsiding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down nearly 400 points from 
its record Jan. 31 high, soared 82.06 points to close at 3,675.41. The rally 
was sparked by a significant drop in the closely watched yield on 30-year 
Treasury bonds, which fell in response to a government report showing that 
robust economic growth may be easing. Slower growth could reduce pressure on 
the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates further. 
</P>
<P>
 While Tuesday's rally -- only the second "up" day in eight trading sessions -- 
cheered investors, experts cautioned against interpreting it as a definitive 
signal that stocks have finally ended their free fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, many analysts predicted still more market volatility ahead. Tuesday's 
market surge, said several analysts, should be seen as a natural reaction to 
the recent spate of selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This rally doesn't reflect a fundamental shift in the economy or a change in 
investor psychology or some new consumer confidence," said Hugh Johnson, chief 
investment officer at the First Albany brokerage house, based in Albany, N.Y. 
"It was just a buying spree in the wake of an oversold, down market." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said institutional investors, such as big pension funds, had been 
waiting for an opportunity to take advantage of bargains among some stocks. 
"When you have this many edgy, itchy portfolio managers, it doesn't take much 
to get them going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual investors, whose billions of dollars in mutual fund accounts have 
fueled the generally uninterrupted growth in stock prices in recent years, were 
again advised to remain calm and to stick with their existing investment 
strategies rather than attempt to time their moves to the market's expected 
gyrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, although some buying of mutual fund shares was reported on Tuesday, 
individual investors generally were still on the sidelines, preferring to ride 
out the recent market instability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The markets are in their greatest turmoil in five years," said John Wilson, 
chief economist for Bank of America. "We don't know how strong the economy 
really is, when interest rates are going to rise and whether inflation is about 
to resume. It's going to be a bumpy road until the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The big uncertainty is whether the economy's continued growth is too much of a 
good thing that will ultimately lead to a renewed bout of price increases. To 
keep inflation in check, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates twice 
this year -- the first such hikes in five years -- and could do so a third time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates, as reflected in higher yields on savings deposits and 
bonds, tend to attract money away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But bond yields declined on Tuesday following a Commerce Department report 
early in the day that its index of leading economic indicators dipped 0.1% in 
February, the first decline in seven months. Although much of the drop was 
attributed to severe winter weather, the report was widely interpreted as 
showing that economic growth and inflation might not be as strong as some 
investors had feared. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.24%, after soaring 
to 7.40% on Monday following a report last week of a greater-than-expected jump 
in new jobs. Monday's yield was the highest since January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday's trading, 30-year bond yields had risen about 1.5 percentage 
points from their bottom of last October -- a sharp rise that had startled 
economists because it appeared to be greater than the economy warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Schlossberg, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, said 
inflation on consumer goods is likely to remain stable despite higher buying 
demand because of fundamental changes in the international economy, including 
deregulation of key industries, declining strength of labor unions and 
widespread global competition in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates had risen so sharply because "the market was magnifying the 
slim chance that inflation would take over and was pricing itself for that, 
rather than for the reality of the situation," said David Berson, chief 
economist for the Federal National Mortgage Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Berson said he expects the stock market to spend the next several months 
"sorting itself out relative to the economy." When that happens, he predicts 
that stocks will surge because business is generally strong and corporate 
profits are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks in industries sensitive to the economic cycles, such as autos, heavy 
machinery and chemicals, led Tuesday's advance. The 82-point jump in the Dow 
Jones average was its largest increase since Dec. 23, 1991, when it leaped 88 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was the fourth biggest one-day surge ever in the index. On Jan. 17, 
1991, the Dow climbed a record 114.6 points after U.S.-led forces began their 
air assault on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining stocks by about 7 to 1 Tuesday on the 
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 367 million shares.

AS EXILES RETURN, CHANGE EMBROILS OCCUPIED LANDS

 Heavily armed Israeli border guards smiled, chatted and occasionally barked 
orders Tuesday as hundreds of Palestinian activists and family members braved 
the blazing sun on this remote border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip to 
welcome home two dozen men whom Israel once banished as "terrorist leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 These individuals soon will lead an autonomous Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Through chants of "Palestine lives!" and "Death to Israel!" an Israeli colonel 
in charge of the border guard stood for almost an hour among dozens of angry 
Palestinians, talking for the first time with once-sworn enemies, answering the 
toughest questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the colonel said when asked about the hundreds of Palestinians who have 
been killed by Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands, "I do feel sorry about 
the children, the ones who have been killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Just 15 miles to the north, one of the most striking images of the 
extraordinary transition beginning to take shape this week in lands Israel has 
occupied for 27 years unfolded at the Israeli Defense Forces' central command 
headquarters in the heart of Gaza City. 
</P>
<P>
 At the compound Israel is about to turn over to the new Palestinian 
leadership, busloads of soldiers started evacuating the headquarters buildings, 
packing trucks with equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brig. Gen. Doron Almog, commander of all Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip, 
gave a guided tour of the facility to a man who spent 18 years in his prisons 
-- Sufiah abu Zaidah, the spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
Fatah faction in Gaza, who will be among the headquarters' future occupants. On 
Israeli television Tuesday, Almog was shown laughing, sharing cigarettes and 
clasping hands with leaders of a movement he once hunted. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the images Tuesday as Israel and the PLO sought to send powerful, 
concrete signals to Palestinians in the occupied territories that real change 
is at hand. They were some of the new realities taking shape in the 
impoverished Gaza Strip and in the West Bank border town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders on both sides hope the changes will hold armed Jewish and Palestinian 
extremists at bay as negotiators in Cairo continue to hammer out details of a 
long-delayed final agreement on implementing full Palestinian autonomy and 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jericho, future capital of a self-ruled Palestine, 26 more deportees -- 
among them key aides to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat -- crossed the Allenby 
Bridge from Jordan with 15 women and 31 children in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, 50 deportees, most of them architects of the intifada, the 
Palestinian uprising, returned to a land that had forced them into exile years 
ago. They now will help form the nucleus of Arafat's autonomous Palestinian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a great moment for us," Faisal Husseini, Arafat's Jerusalem-based chief 
for the West Bank, declared as he accompanied the last deportee across the 
bridge from Jordan before sunset. "But it is only a small step." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rafah border crossing into Gaza, about 100 miles away across a vast 
territory that will remain Israeli, Fatah spokesman Zaidah put it more 
strongly. "It's great to have them back," he said as 24 Fatah leaders were 
being processed and issued new identity cards by Israeli security forces. "The 
problem is we are bringing back (50) and leaving behind more than 1 million." 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders' comments reflected the strong emotions that greeted long-lost 
brothers, husbands and sons at the border of the future Palestinian enclaves on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have mixed feelings. It is happiness mixed with sorrow," said Salah abu 
Jidiyan, 39, who waited for more than five hours in the broiling desert to 
greet his younger brother, Jamal, at the Rafah crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 True enough, Jidiyan said, he was regaining a brother four years after 
36-year-old Jamal was taken from his home at midnight in a scene that his wife, 
Muna, recalled "was the hardest for a human to see." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Jidiyan added, he is still in mourning for his brother-in-law, Nahed 
Odeh, who was one of the six Fatah activists gunned down in Gaza's Jabaliya 
refugee camp last week by an Israeli undercover unit. The attack, in which none 
of the six activists fired a single shot, plunged the Israeli-PLO peace talks 
into crisis and forced Israeli officials to apologize for what they called a 
case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 What is more, added Jidiyan, who spent 15 of his 39 years in Israeli prisons 
and narrowly escaped deportation himself, the "Gaza-Jericho first" accord is, 
in itself, "an insufficient step." On balance, he concluded, "I am not happy. . 
. . This (day) is good for me as a person, but generally, what will the 
situation of Gaza as a whole be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the positive signs of change, there were continuing bitter symbols of 
occupation -- isolated clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians in Gaza 
and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers shot three Palestinians in Jericho; three more Palestinians were 
wounded in rioting in Gaza's Jabaliya camp, among them an 8-year-old girl. And 
in Hebron, where clashes have become common in the weeks since a Jewish settler 
massacred about 30 Palestinians at prayer in the Ibrahim Mosque, Israeli troops 
sealed off the Islamic University for more than three hours in a siege that 
stranded more than 500 students. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few encouraging signs of an imminent breakthrough in the Cairo 
talks as well, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned that a final 
agreement will take time. "If someone expects some hocus-pocus and in two or 
six days everything can be completed, he is simply mistaken and doesn't know 
the reality," Rabin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, plans to follow Tuesday's deportee return with a vanguard of 
Palestinian police -- who would prepare for an initial deployment of several 
hundred Palestinian officers -- bogged down in disputes over how many would be 
permitted in the early stages and how they would be armed. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO insists that the police enter the occupied territories with guns on 
display, while Israel prefers the officers to enter quietly in buses, with 
their weapons shipped separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators said they hoped an agreement can be worked out in time to dispatch 
an early contingent by Thursday. Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the 
two sides have agreed on an eventual force of about 9,000 Palestinian police in 
Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat was scheduled to arrive in Cairo this morning to help oversee the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of such an accord, local PLO officials and the Israeli 
government sought to project the idea that change was not confined to future 
autonomous Palestinian enclaves. They also targeted Hebron on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustapha Abdul Nabi Natshe, Hebron's newly appointed pro-PLO mayor, helped 
defuse a potential firefight, quelling a confrontation when fundamentalist 
groups opposing the peace process faced off with Israeli troops in a protest 
march that he had led near the site of the Feb. 25 massacre in Hebron's Cave of 
the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, representatives from Norway, Denmark and Italy -- which together 
will contribute 160 armed observers and advisers to an international force 
authorized to improve Hebron's security -- met with Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres in Jerusalem. Today, they plan to visit the embattled West Bank 
town, where 415 armed, extremist Jewish settlers live in small settlements 
surrounded by more than 100,000 Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strongest, clearest images of change Tuesday appeared in Gaza, long 
considered a stronghold of the Palestinian fundamentalist Islamic groups who 
have thrived on the area's despair and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli commanders in Gaza have issued explicit orders in recent days to their 
remaining force that, "during the withdrawal, soldiers should not hurt the 
feelings or the honor of the Palestinians in any way. From now on, they are to 
be treated as equals," Israel Television reported Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Israelis stepped up their withdrawal Tuesday, in advance of a final 
Israeli-PLO autonomy agreement, soldiers smiled, joked and grinned 
uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli army truck drivers who hauled the equipment to a new base inside 
Gush Qatif, one of the Jewish settlements that will remain in Gaza even after 
the troops withdraw, summed up the feeling of most Israelis as they prepared to 
leave behind a land that has became a living nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is great," one army driver said as he waved to an Israel 
Television cameraman while en route from downtown Gaza City. "We're going home. 
Who needs this nuisance?" 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A short walk up Jianshe Road from the train station in this booming frontier 
factory town reveals the timeless face of capitalism, as embraced unabashedly 
in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Dickensian scene, prostitutes and filthy-faced urchins line the sidewalk 
by the Shangri-La, a shiny, marble-crusted, five-star hotel. Outside, a small 
boy hoists a seemingly lifeless infant on his shoulder and begs. Inside, sleek 
men in tailored suits mill about importantly in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The paradoxes of capitalism are nothing new to China, despite four decades of 
egalitarian Maospeak. Chinese civilization has long had its own brand of 
capitalism, some experts say, a force that spread its energy and its ethos 
across the Pacific Rim -- and is now boomeranging back. 
</P>
<P>
 Its essence, aside from the profit motive, is a way of doing business called 
guanxi -- roughly translated as "personal relationships" or "connections" -- 
that guides the ubiquitous networks of Chinese family entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Guanxi (pronounced "gwan-shi") also implies a moral code of sorts, offering an 
informal alternative to the legalistic trappings of Western capitalism -- and 
prompting some observers to worry about its corrosive effects on the rule of 
law in the world's fastest-growing markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The guanxi tradition flickered at home under Communist orthodoxy until it was 
rekindled a dozen years ago by Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. China's 
industrial revolution started in test laboratories like Shenzhen, a special 
free trade zone across the border from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Abroad, the flame was nurtured passionately by the multitudes of the Chinese 
diaspora, the overseas progeny of an old tradition of economic migration and 
political asylum-seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, these wandering sons and daughters of Greater China -- some 55 million 
strong -- are bankrolling the dynamic economic development of their 1.2 billion 
cousins in the ancestral homeland, transcending national borders and political 
ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless small entrepreneurs -- from Taiwan to Chinese enclaves in such 
places as Bangkok and Los Angeles -- are proving that tiny is beautiful, and 
highly profitable. They have formed a spontaneous capillary system of 
investment, pumping tens of billions of dollars into small joint-venture 
factories and real estate projects, all the while penetrating deeper into the 
Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, their stake in China's economy dwarfs that of the celebrated 
Chinese tycoons of Hong Kong or the giant multinationals from Japan and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say these networks of small investors are thriving, despite the high 
risks of doing business in China, because they are nimble on their feet, they 
speak Chinese -- and they have good guanxi . 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like guerrilla troops," said S. Gordon Redding, author of "The Spirit 
of Chinese Capitalism" and a business professor at the University of Hong Kong. 
"These enterprises are designed for the jungle, not for the parade ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Guanxi also can be a euphemism for bribery -- or, to put a positive face on 
it, incentive payments to trusted contacts in local governments, all in the 
name of expediency. 
</P>
<P>
 The line between culturally correct and seemingly corrupt often is impossible 
to draw. But these methods are ideally suited to doing business in developing 
China, where the legal system is primitive and peevish bureaucrats are easily 
bought. Smart business deals aren't cemented by paper contracts that can't be 
enforced, the theory goes, but by informal relationships of trust and mutual 
obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many overseas Chinese entrepreneurs have considerable experience in this gray 
ethical area, having for years conducted business across an unstable jigsaw 
puzzle of Third World legal systems and political regimes. Ethnic Chinese 
families and their enterprises have been repressed in Indonesia and Malaysia, 
for instance, and tightly regulated by authoritarian Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continued vitality of overseas Chinese owes a lot to their dependence on 
personal relationships," said Wong Siu-Lun, a sociologist at the University of 
Hong Kong. "Partly, it's a way to resist interference by the state. If they 
build up big corporations and hierarchies, they can be easy targets." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, entrepreneurs in Nationalist Taiwan were controlled by a military 
police state until 1987. Even today, the bulk of their estimated $10 billion to 
$20 billion cumulative investment in the mainland is underground, typically 
channeled through shell companies in Hong Kong and still technically illegal 
under Taiwan law. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal networking is not unique to Chinese entrepreneurs; it's the bread and 
butter for small-business people in any culture. But to many Chinese, guanxi 
takes on a special intensity in their Confucian ethos, where family values of 
obligation are paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the practices aren't easily understood by a legalistic mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't bribe people in China, but giving them gifts is a matter of 
generating good feelings," said Wong Mau-Hung, a Taiwan native who has lived in 
Japan and Hong Kong for 30 years. Wong is investing heavily in mainland real 
estate development, using personal connections he acquired over the years as a 
tour operator. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is a very poor place. If somebody needs a television or a car, we might 
give it to him. But it's for the development of the nation," Wong explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's a matter of profit-sharing," said Steve Tii-Ren Shaw, 32, a 
native Taiwanese educated at Cal State Long Beach. Shaw worked for a plastics 
firm in Toronto and is involved in opening a machinery plant in Shenzhen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want these things done smoothly, so I give them a consulting fee or a 
service commission," Shaw said. "I'll save money in the long run by getting 
things done on time. It networking. "He'd drop off his first cousin like a 
stone if he thought he was going to hurt his business." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, it's the little guys who are cleaning up in China, investment 
bankers say, not the large, lumbering foreign corporations that are slow in 
making decisions. Although they face high risks, small entrepreneurs are 
reportedly taking home 70% to 90% returns on equity with their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliable information about the profitability of such networkers is extremely 
difficult to obtain, however. These aren't publicly listed companies. The 
bookkeeping is typically spread across borders, split between sub-family units 
and channeled through evanescent ghost corporations. So-called transfer pricing 
-- which hides profits from tax authorities -- is the name of the game, inside 
and outside China. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to pin down who is doing what," said Li-Pei Wu, chairman of 
General Bank, which serves the Chinese community in Los Angeles. "They don't 
want people to know. There are tax considerations. When you have so many 
companies operating, you can manipulate which ones make money." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankie Leung, a Los Angeles lawyer and prolific author of advice on doing 
business in China, sees a collusive mind-set in the Chinese business networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese don't like to talk about networking. It's like they're a sect," 
Leung said. "They don't like to be intellectually analyzed. When you describe 
it, the mystique value is lost. They think their practices can be learned and 
used to attack them." 
</P>
<P>
 Clannishness among the guanxi capitalists might be attributable to the fact 
that many, indeed, do business through their clans. But geographic links are 
considered even more important. 
</P>
<P>
 A preponderance of Taiwanese investment in China, for example, is believed to 
be routed surreptitiously through Hong Kong banks to Fujian province, just 
across the Taiwan Strait, to which the vast majority of Taiwan's 21 million 
people trace their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 With rising labor costs at home, small manufacturers have been in a frenzy to 
relocate their plants on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 But the risks can be high. Joey Peng, a former Los Angeles resident who runs a 
trading company in Taipei, said he and his brother lost $2 million on a 
joint-venture factory making computer disk drives in Hanzhou, China. Peng is 
networking aggressively, hoping to make a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 All networks don't necessarily lead to China. Taiwanese investors have swarmed 
into Southeast Asia in search of cheap labor, using guanxi with ethnic Chinese 
partners from Indonesia to Indochina who often speak a common dialect. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is encouraged by the Taipei government, which hopes to derive 
diplomatic advantage from its $85-billion cache of foreign exchange reserves. 
Taiwan holds the largest foreign investment stake in Vietnam and rivals Japan 
in other key markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the reverse flow, ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia are pumping capital 
toward the Chinese heartland. Mainland entrepreneurs, having secretly stashed 
billions of dollars from trading profits in overseas banks, are bringing home 
hard currency under the guise of foreign investment, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often, the guanxi spreads widely through expanding concentric circles of 
mutual friends and sometimes rather distant acquaintances. So long as there is 
a web of interlocking entanglement, enough trust can be maintained to conduct 
business with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 At its most refined stage, Chinese networking is a speculative game, where 
contacts are made and gifts or favors exchanged without any immediate 
expectations. Someday, the thinking goes, there might be a benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane I-Feng Wang, a real estate developer based in Monterey Park, is one 
entrepreneur who thinks that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, whose father was a high-level official in the Nationalist government 
that retreated to Taiwan in 1949, said he recently entertained the son of 
Chinese Premier Li Peng in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of the Communist and the son of the Nationalist did not discuss 
business or politics, Wang said. But it was a promising guanxi for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Wang invested nearly $5 million in a joint-venture commercial real 
estate development in northeast China's Jilin province, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang reverently displayed drawers and shelves packed with business cards -- 
the most important guanxi in a set of special binders -- and boasted of having 
more than 30,000 contacts in Los Angeles alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spend money to take care of people when they come to L.A., not for any 
purpose. I don't expect anything in return," he said. "But when I go to China, 
they introduce me to people they know. In many cases, this becomes very useful 
for business." Where Guanxi Governs Commerce 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the commercial life of China -- and of the overseas Chinese business 
people who ply their trade across the Pacific -- is lubricated by guanxi , a 
concept best translated as "connections." As capitalism regains its hold in 
coastal China, it is smaller enterprises joined through overseas guanxi 
networks rather than large-scale foreign investors that are the leading engines 
of economic development.

DANA POINT APPROVES HEADLANDS RESORT PLAN; LAND: MORE HURDLES TO $500-MILLION 
BLUFF DEVELOPMENT REMAIN. ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THEY'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial $500-million resort plan that would bring a luxury hotel, two 
commercial centers and 370 homes to one of the last undeveloped coastal sites 
in Orange County was approved Tuesday night by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 With little discussion, the council voted 4 to 1 to end nearly three years of 
negotiations and rancorous debate. The battle has pitted environmentalists who 
regard the 121-acre bluff above Dana Point Harbor as a protected natural 
resource against the private landowner and the project's proponents, who insist 
it will provide important revenue for the young city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Curreri called the plan a compromise in which "no one got 100% of 
what they started out wanting. There will be more refinements. . . . But for 
the first phase, I think we really hammered out a fair plan." 
</P>
<P>
 For environmentalists, the bluff-top parcel known locally as the Dana Point 
Headlands has become a symbol of an ongoing fight against overdevelopment 
throughout south Orange County. The property is known to be the home of the 
California gnatcatcher, the cactus wren and the Pacific pocket mouse, which 
until recently was thought to be extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the last open spots along our coast," said Ken Fortune, a San 
Clemente plumber and a director of the South Coast Audubon Society. "We have 
relatively few spots left any more where you can enjoy Mother Nature and 
recharge your soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Gallagher, a volunteer for a grass-roots group called Save the Headlands, 
said Tuesday that a movement would be launched immediately to overturn the 
council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a foregone conclusion they would slam-dunk this vote, and it's a 
foregone conclusion there will be a referendum," said Gallagher, one of the few 
people who already live on the bluff. "I'm very optimistic the citizens can win 
after all." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the council vote, several more hurdles remain before any construction 
may begin. The California Coastal Commission, the state Department of Fish and 
Game and the U.S. Wildlife Service are among the agencies that also must 
approve the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service placed the Pacific pocket mouse 
temporarily on the emergency endangered species list. If the mouse is later 
listed permanently as endangered, a future developer must convince the agency 
that construction would not further harm the species. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how anyone could do anything in the next three years," Daniels 
said, adding that once the plan is fully approved, it would be sold to a 
developer who would have to bring final tract maps back to the city. The 
current development plan is only the latest of several resorts proposed 
throughout the years for the bluff first noted in 1835 by author Richard Henry 
Dana in his book, "Two Years Before the Mast." Resort developers in the 1920s 
combined the author's surname and the peninsula he admired and named the 
community Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1940s the property had been acquired by Los Angeles developer M.H. 
Sherman -- known for Sherman Oaks -- and what is now called the Chandis 
Securities Co. (The company, which oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels, the president of the M.H. Sherman Co., said his company has 
downscaled the plan to meet the wishes of the city residents. Permanent open 
space has been increased to 64.8 acres or 53% of the entire parcel, the 
residential density has been decreased by 29% and more parks and trails have 
been added to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone can look at this plan and not think the public process 
has worked," said Daniels, a resident of nearby Laguna Beach's Three Arch Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the approval of the plan came down to the argument that it will be 
a financial boon to the city in the long term, said Councilman Mike Eggers, who 
has been an unabashed supporter since it was presented to the council in 
September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers said the city desperately needs the revenue from the planned 400-room 
hotel and 150,000 square feet of commercial space, expected to generate $2.3 
million annually to city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city has the potential for literally hitting the wall financially," 
Eggers said. "If we don't do something to ensure our economic viability, Dana 
Point will be walking hand-in-hand with San Clemente toward bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman William L. Ossenmacher, who cast the only vote against the 
project, said the development won't bring revenue to the city any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any financial benefits that are realized would come from the hotel complex," 
which could be five to 10 years away from construction, Ossenmacher said 
earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the council vote reflects the opinion and majority of the 
public," he told the council. "But I would have liked to see it proven by 
putting the plan on the ballot." Hurdles for Dana Point Headlands 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed development of the Dana Point Headlands includes a 400-room luxury 
hotel, two retail centers and a maximum of 370 homes along the 121-acre 
bluff-top above Dana Point Harbor. It must clear several hurdles before 
construction can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Next 
</P>
<P>
 1. City Council must approve development agreement. First hearing: Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 2. California Coastal Commission must review and approve the plan. Earliest 
date for a vote is late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 3. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Game 
must also give approval before building can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 At Home in the Headlands 
</P>
<P>
 Plants: At least 120 species of plants, 16 of which are not commonly found 
elsewhere in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Birds: Two species of rare birds -- California gnatcatcher and cactus wren. 
</P>
<P>
 History: The Headlands were an important lookout point for early California 
Native Americans. In the early 1800s, the cliffs were used as cattle-grazing 
land by the Spaniards who founded Mission San Juan Capistrano.

LAPD OFFICERS REFUTE ACLU CRITICISM; POLICE: LIVING OUTSIDE PATROL AREA DOES 
NOT SHOW LACK OF LOYALTY, MANY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 LAPD Officer John Francois says he doesn't live in Los Angeles the city in 
which he fights crime -- for two good reasons: his own safety and the high cost 
of housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But those reasons aren't good enough for the American Civil Liberties Union, 
which reported in a study released last week that 83.1% of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's officers live outside the city, particularly in the 
northern Los Angeles County suburbs of Santa Clarita, Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 These officers lack strong ties to the ethnically diverse neighborhoods they 
patrol, partly because they live in distant, predominantly white suburbs, the 
ACLU asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Francois, 26, a patrol officer in the northeast San Fernando Valley, is 
not impressed by the ACLU's findings. He is one of about 1,000 of the LAPD's 
7,658 officers who head home to the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys when 
their work shifts end -- and don't apologize for it. 
</P>
<P>
 By living in Lancaster, Francois says he avoids potential danger, such as the 
death threat he received from a gang member who recognized him in his old 
neighborhood. The youth also threatened Francois' mother, who lived nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Francois says he could only rent an apartment in the San Fernando 
Valley for the mortgage payments that he makes on his three-bedroom Antelope 
Valley house. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the ACLU report said that the high percentage of officers living 
in the suburbs contributes to the LAPD's image as an "army of occupation in the 
urban communities" and urged the LAPD to offer incentives to officers who move 
into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not calling for requirements that the police live in the city," said 
Allan Parachini, the ACLU staff member who prepared the report. "We're saying 
the situation that exists is not optimal. It's a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 By living in the neighborhoods that they patrol the officers would help 
stabilize these neighborhoods and reverse anti-police sentiments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois and other officers bristle at such conclusions. They say that where 
they choose to live has no bearing on how well they do their jobs. And they 
insist that living so far from the neighborhoods they patrol does not mean 
officers lack dedication to these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you abandon something you have to face every day?" asked Francois. 
"No matter where (the officers) live, there's only one thing that matters: 
Where are they going back to duty every day? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would I enforce the law differently if I lived within the city limits?" 
Francois added. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU report asserted that the long distance between LAPD officers' homes 
and their workplaces may have "played a role in compromising responses to major 
emergency incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Several officers who live in northern Los Angeles County acknowledge that they 
have faced longer commutes since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. But they 
still are prepared to respond quickly when an emergency occurs in the 
communities they patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 They point out that one of the first casualties of the earthquake was LAPD 
Officer Clarence Wayne Dean, a Lancaster resident assigned to the San Fernando 
Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean hopped aboard his motorcycle and headed toward the Valley minutes after 
the quake and well before the start of his shift. He was killed when his 
motorcycle plunged off a severed Antelope Valley Freeway overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the quake, LAPD Sgt. Joe Flores made his way through treacherous 
road conditions to get from his Lancaster home to the Foothill Station in 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up spending several nights in my van, staying near the station," 
Flores said. "There were officers who did sustain a lot of earthquake damage 
(at their homes), yet they remained at work." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the officers dispute the ACLU's finding that the north county suburbs, 
with lower housing costs and crime rates and easy freeway access to Los 
Angeles, are home to an usually large number of law officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU determined that 687 LAPD officers live in ZIP codes assigned to the 
Santa Clarita Valley. Two ZIP codes covering the communities of Canyon Country 
and Saugus together house almost 400 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther north, another 318 LAPD officers live in the Antelope Valley, the 
study found. One Palmdale ZIP code was linked to 120 LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the study looked only at the LAPD, northern Los Angeles County -- 
particularly the Santa Clarita Valley -- also is home to many Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies and police officers from cities such as Burbank, 
Glendale and Beverly Hills, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear a lot of people in this community say that they don't have to walk 
too far outside their door before they see the home of either a policeman, a 
fireman or a deputy sheriff," said Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Warford, who moved to the 
Santa Clarita Valley 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, LAPD Officer Dennis Farnham learned just how popular the area 
is among peace officers when he opened The Cop's Shop, a law enforcement 
uniform and equipment store. Recently, he said, the Canyon Country store rang 
up its 20,000th customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best thing I ever did," said Farnham, a Santa Clarita Valley 
resident for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For Francois, the absence of gunshots, whirring police helicopters and other 
urban noise outside his Antelope Valley home is a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The silence was so loud when I first moved to Lancaster," he said, "that it 
was a bit unnerving." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, a 40-year-old father of three, said he would rather live closer to 
work, but cannot afford a house in Los Angeles. "It would probably save me a 
couple of hours a day on the freeway," he said. "But this is where I can find 
an affordable house and give my family a decent lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU report argued that the inability to find affordable housing is not 
always valid. In the report, Parachini said that houses in Los Angeles 
neighborhoods such as Atwater and Los Feliz are now less expensive than similar 
ones in the distant suburbs where many officers live. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officers, particularly those with children, say the low crime rates and 
better schools in the north county suburbs are equally as important as cheaper 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fullerton, an LAPD detective, moved from Sylmar to the Santa Clarita 
Valley in 1981 when he and his wife were planning a family. Gang violence in 
Sylmar was increasing, and Fullerton said he felt unwelcome there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did have a problem when some of my neighbors found out I was a police 
officer," he said. "My home was vandalized. It was clear to me that certain 
neighbors wouldn't associate with me because they were anti-police." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, a Los Angeles Police Protective League board member, said that many 
officers move outside the city to distance themselves and their families from 
the people they've arrested. When off-duty officers visit a park or the grocery 
store, he said, they don't want to run into a lawbreaker who may be carrying a 
grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Fullerton, who grew up in the West Valley, also learned that 
patrolling the neighborhood in which you were raised is not always wise. "You 
go to break up a party, where there are people you know," he said. "But you 
still have to do your job. You lose friends real quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton denied that LAPD officers who move to distant, mostly white suburbs 
are motivated by racism. According to the ACLU report, the LAPD is 57% Anglo, 
yet 83% of the officers live outside the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means there are a lot of minority officers who have gotten out of the 
city too," Fullerton said. "So, it's not white flight. It's police officer 
flight." 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing this flight was one goal of the study, ACLU officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution, the report states, is for the city to offer mortgage assistance 
and pay incentives to officers who choose to live in Los Angeles, particularly 
in high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU's Parachini said that other cities, including Atlantic City and 
Portland, Ore., have launched such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are models out there that were not developed by political radicals, but 
were developed by police departments and city officials," he said. "To say it 
can't be done, without even trying it, is to assume there are no officers or 
housing (owners) that would be interested in this arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many police officers remain skeptical. Some ask how the financially 
strapped city could pay for such programs at a time when LAPD officers have 
gone almost three years without a pay raise. Others say the city should not get 
involved in housing subsidies for some police employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, some say that officers would have little impact on high-crime 
neighborhoods merely by living in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Los Angeles discourages us from getting involved in (law 
enforcement activities) off duty," said LAPD Officer Troy Williams, who lives 
in Santa Clarita. "All that would do is give a false sense of security to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Being a police officer is not the most popular thing to be in some 
areas of the city. The last thing you're going to do is advertise to your 
neighbors that you're a police officer." LAPD at Home 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 of the Los Angeles Police Department's 7,658 officers live in the 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, according to a recent study by the American 
Civil Liberties Union. The report, broken down by ZIP codes, found that 83.1% 
of the department's officers live outside the city of Los Angeles. The

IMPACT OF OCEAN TESTS TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a wave of public criticism, scientists planning to test global 
warming by transmitting high-volume sounds through the ocean said Tuesday they 
will assist in completing an environmental assessment before starting the 
experiment off Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, who insist 
that the ocean sound tests will not harm marine mammals, said they will collect 
data for the environmental study to analyze how the repeated low-frequency 
broadcasts would affect animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the sound tests off California will be delayed at least until 
late June to give an opportunity for public comment on the environmental study, 
said Andrew Forbes, deputy director of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a further chance to demonstrate the responsible nature of the 
program we plan to conduct," Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said the planned assessment would not be sufficiently 
detailed. They called on the scientists to prepare a full-fledged environmental 
impact statement, which would include an analysis of alternatives to ocean 
sound tests for studying global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned experiment off California and Hawaii was delayed after public 
criticism last month prompted the National Marine Fisheries Service to schedule 
public hearings near both test sites. Two hearings have been set for Hawaii 
next week, but no hearing date has been chosen for the Monterey area. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for an additional 60-day delay to allow the assessment was 
formally made Tuesday by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the federal 
agency sponsoring the $35-million study. The agency sent a letter to the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, a separate federal agency that has authority 
to approve the project and will evaluate the environmental assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Big Sur test would be delayed. The test off the island of Kauai in 
Hawaii could begin in May if a permit is granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some marine mammal experts are concerned that the broadcast of the low 
rumbling sound for 20 minutes every four hours could disturb or deafen whales 
and other animals in the vicinity of the loudspeakers.

 With memories still fresh of the devastating magnitude 6.8 Northridge 
earthquake, hundreds of thousands of students dropped under their desks Tuesday 
morning and covered their heads in a statewide earthquake drill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was regarded as a necessary precaution, some said the exercise 
would be too frightening for many children. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the drill, held to kick off the state Earthquake Preparedness 
Month, was scaled back significantly in parts of Southern California, such as 
the San Fernando Valley, where the Jan. 17 quake hit hardest. About 1.5 million 
students, teachers and administrators participated in Tuesday's event. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, where 76 schools suffered severe 
earthquake damage, most principals said they told teachers to talk about the 
drill and remind students that it was practice. Plans for more elaborate drills 
that included having students and staff pretend to be injured, dead and missing 
were dropped at most schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some elementary students were frightened by the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teacher said, 'Drop,' and it scared me," said Jill Slevin, a 9-year-old 
third-grader at Van Gogh Elementary School in Granada Hills. "All of a sudden, 
we had to get under our desks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Gogh students, who attend school at a nearby campus because the Van 
Gogh site remains closed due to earthquake damage, left their portable 
classrooms and sat in groups on the grass. "These kids have been so 
traumatized," said Barbara Ramsey, a school psychologist at Van Gogh. "They're 
out of their school and some are out of their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Andrews, director of the state office of emergency services, said the 
drills are necessary to prepare students and staff in the event an earthquake 
hits during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 quake, it has special meaning," 
Andrews said at a news conference at Danube Avenue Elementary in Granada Hills, 
which suffered $1 million in quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gogh Principal Maureen Diekmann, who said she did not want to put students 
and teachers through an extensive drill, said she also believes the students 
need to be prepared for another quake. "We just felt it was better to go 
through the drill so they know the process but not to elaborate on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles school district plans to re-evaluate its emergency plans, 
including its communications systems between schools and offices. The drill was 
intended to prepare students and staff at local schools but also to help 
officials upgrade districtwide plans. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Camino Real High in Woodland Hills, which closed for about six weeks, 
administrators held a more extensive drill. Students pretended to be missing 
and others pretended to be injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was taken very seriously," said Joyce Washington, the principal at El 
Camino. "I think the youngsters know the consequences because they have lived 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The drop drill -- typically the source of jokes among some teen-agers -- took 
on a serious tone at Audubon Middle School in the Crenshaw district, as most 
youths said the vision of fallen debris and ceiling tiles in their classrooms 
was still fresh on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time I made sure my head was covered and I held onto the leg of my 
desk," said Akillah Dunn, 14. "I got away from glass. I don't want anything to 
fall on my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Audubon was among the hardest hit campuses outside of the San Fernando Valley, 
suffering severe water damage when ceiling pipes burst, flooding two stories of 
classrooms, destroying thousands of text and library books and causing soaked 
ceiling tiles to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Cedric King said that the 1,700-member student body 
evacuated to the playing field in a record eight minutes. "No problems with 
stragglers. No problems with kids running around," he said, as he carried a 
thick file of rosters, evacuation plans and a walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, Principal Fannie Humphery 
said she had to take extra care to explain that the drill was neither a real 
earthquake nor a "code blue" alarm, in which students run for safety because of 
crime activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there are police helicopters overhead we clear the playground," Humphery 
said. "There have been incidents where suspects run through campus. We had to 
keep telling them this was earthquake practice, practice, practice."

WILSON TV ADS ATTACK BROWN ON ISSUE OF RAPIST'S RELEASE; POLITICS: THE GOVERNOR 
SAYS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE DECEIVED THE PUBLIC BY TRYING TO BLAME HIM FOR 
FREEING SEX OFFENDER MELVIN CARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson launched his first advertising push of the 1994 campaign 
Tuesday, unveiling a 30-second television spot that accuses state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown of deliberately deceiving the public about a serial rapist's 
release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, which Wilson's camp is spending $500,000 to broadcast statewide, opens 
with a mug shot of Melvin A. Carter, who confessed to raping more than 100 
women in Northern California. State law required Carter's release last month, 
the ad states, but Brown tried to blame Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press condemned Brown's deception as 'a bum rap,' 'demagoguery,' 
'desperation' and (a) 'cheap shot'. . . ," continues the ad, which paints Brown 
as soft on crime. "Kathleen Brown is opposed to a one-strike law (for rapists). 
And she's even against the death penalty. Kathleen Brown -- Wrong on Wilson, 
Wrong on Crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad focuses on an issue that some might have expected Wilson to try to put 
behind him. Brown alleged that Carter's release could have been avoided but for 
the bumbling of Wilson's Department of Corrections and, faced with a public 
outcry, Wilson changed the location of Carter's release to a rural area. 
</P>
<P>
 But George Gorton, who is managing Wilson's reelection campaign, said the 
decision was made to "set the record straight" because Brown's campaign has 
done its best to keep the issue alive. Gorton said the Wilson campaign will be 
airing ads nearly "nonstop" between now and the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's misleading people," said Gorton. "It's not honest. It's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Michael Reese, the spokesman for Brown's campaign, issued a 
statement accusing Wilson of trying to divert attention from more important 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson's campaign to run away from his failed record on crime in 
California has begun," the statement said. "Wilson can blame and attack all he 
wants, but the bottom line is, he's the one who's wrong. He's wrong for 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll conducted late last month found that Brown's 
allegation that Wilson was derelict in allowing Carter's release from prison 
has had little impact. Most Californians, whether they live in the southern or 
northern part of the state, said Wilson was not to blame for Carter's release. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's hold on the crime issue was not firm. Although 37% of the 1,608 
adults interviewed said Wilson has the best ideas about crime and only 16% said 
that of Brown, the margin narrowed significantly when Wilson and all the 
Democrats were compared. Then, Wilson barely eked out an advantage -- 37% 
compared to 33% for Democrats as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those other Democratic gubernatorial candidates, Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi, stands to benefit greatly from Wilson's advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 As fate would have it, that staff was holding a strategy meeting in the same 
hotel as the Wilson campaign's news conference Tuesday. Wilson officials 
invited Garamendi staffers to join the media in watching a screening of the ad, 
and the result was some uncommonly friendly banter.

DANA POINT BUILDING PROJECT OKD; DEVELOPMENT: CITY COUNCIL APPROVES PLANS FOR 
LUXURY HOTEL AND 370 HOMES DESPITE ENVIRONMENTALISTS' OPPOSITION. IT STILL MUST 
CLEAR STATE, U.S. AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial $500-million development plan that would bring a luxury hotel, 
two commercial centers and 370 homes to one of the last undeveloped coastal 
sites in Orange County was approved Tuesday night by the Dana Point City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 With little discussion, the council approved the plan on a 4-1 vote, ending 
nearly three years of negotiations and rancorous debate. The battle has pitted 
environmentalists, who regard the 121-acre bluff above Dana Point Harbor as a 
protected natural resource, against the private landowner and the project's 
proponents, who insist that it will provide important revenues for the young 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Curreri called the plan a compromise in which "no one got 100% of 
what they started out wanting. There will be more refinements. . . . But for 
the first phase, I think we really hammered out a fair plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the council vote, several more hurdles remain before any construction 
can begin. The California Coastal Commission, the state Department of Fish and 
Game and the U.S. Wildlife Service are among the agencies that must approve the 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 For environmentalists, the bluff-top parcel known as the Dana Point Headlands 
has become a symbol of the fight against overdevelopment throughout southern 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Gallagher, a volunteer for the grass-roots group Save the Headlands, said 
Tuesday that an effort would be launched to overturn the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The development plan is the latest of several resorts proposed throughout the 
years. By the late 1940s, the property had been acquired by Los Angeles 
developer M.H. Sherman -- known for Sherman Oaks -- and what is now called the 
Chandis Securities Co. (the company, which oversees the financial holdings of 
the Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels, president of M.H. Sherman Co., said his company has reduced 
the scale of the plan to meet residents' wishes. Dedicated open space has been 
increased to 64.8 acres, or 53% of the parcel, the residential density has been 
decreased 29% and more parks and trails have been added. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Eggers, a supporter of the development proposal, said the city 
needs the $2.3 million the project is expected to generate for the city each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman William L. Ossenmacher, who cast the only vote against the 
project, said it would not bring revenues to the city anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any financial benefits that are realized would come from the hotel complex," 
which could be five to 10 years away from construction, Ossenmacher said.

ON CALIFORNIA: MARCHING FORWARD AND BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They could have been ghosts. They marched in a long, thin line beside a 
two-lane highway that cut between barley fields and orange groves. They waved 
red banners and kicked up dust and shouted slogans and battle cries that 
sounded like echoes bouncing across the otherwise quiet countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viva la raza! " they shouted, though the vitality of the cause is far from 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viva Cesar!" they shouted, though Cesar Chavez has been dead now for almost a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Monday afternoon, the fifth day of a march staged by the United Farm 
Workers union as a way to reintroduce itself to California politicians and 
field hands alike. The route retraces the path walked by Chavez 28 years ago, a 
march from Delano to Sacramento that was a seminal moment in the farm workers 
movement. This is its sequel -- although nobody in the procession of 200 or so 
people would put it quite that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are new steps," insisted Dolores Huerta, the UFW's co-founder, as she 
marched along in a straw hat. "This is the second wave." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he died last April, Chavez no longer was considered much of a force in 
California agriculture. His detractors pointed to the paucity of remaining UFW 
contracts and painted Chavez as a corrupt failure. His defenders offered 
gentler analyses: Perhaps he had been expected to do too much; perhaps he had 
just lost his way. For his UFW followers, any debate over legacy was eclipsed 
by more pressing questions of where to take the movement next. The answer, this 
new march implies, is to start all over again, at the beginning. The plan is to 
follow, not only the original steps, but also the initial strategy: To return 
to the fields and persuade workers to organize. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a continuation of Cesar's work," said Arturo Rodriguez, the 
son-in-law of Chavez, and also his successor, a man who has spent half his 44 
years working for the union. Rodriguez wore Ray Ban sunglasses, a T-shirt 
promoting the grape boycott, black jeans, running shoes -- and a relentlessly 
upbeat outlook. The march has been derided by UFW adversaries as nothing more 
than a media event. If that is the case, at least the union leaders have come 
well-prepared. They have a story line, and they will not be pushed from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it frustrating, Rodriguez was asked, this need to start almost from 
scratch, so late in the movement, the fight for contracts? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," Rodriguez said, smiling and sipping on ice water as he walked. 
"Not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 No, to hear Rodriguez and the others tell it, everything is unfolding almost 
exactly as Chavez had planned. Any retreat from the fields was strategic, born 
of a need to marshal resources, build urban support and wait out a string of 
hostile governors. Any suggestion of failure overlooked the successes -- the 
pesticide bans, the farm worker housing, the clinics and credit union, the 
radio stations even. And any impatience by supporters revealed a 
misunderstanding of the long-term nature of the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cesar," Rodriguez said, "believed the workers were getting ready for us 
again, and he was right. Unfortunately, he died before he could carry out his 
plans. Now we feel we are ready, and the workers are ready, to continue Cesar's 
legacy and fulfill his dream." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he walked, Rodriguez kept interrupting himself to point out roadside color 
that reinforced his optimistic outlook. Look, he would say, at those 
townspeople who have come to the roadside to cheer: "The support in the farm 
worker towns has been incredible. In Porterville we were welcomed by someone 
from the Chamber of Commerce." 
</P>
<P>
 And look at the old people in line, still faithful: this one was on the first 
march; that one was the first member ever to sign up. And look at this mother 
with her baby in a stroller. And look at those men on their porch. They are 
being handed union applications: "Look at that. Look at that. See they are 
taking them. Oh, this is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 A mile or so outside town, there came an image Rodriguez failed to mention. 
Maybe he missed it. The procession was passing a small farm. A ruddy faced, 
burly man, dressed in sweaty denims and a baseball cap, had climbed off his 
tractor to watch the parade pass by. He stood against his barbed wire fence 
with his arms folded. He, too, looked like an artifact from earlier summers of 
struggle. He said nothing. He did not need to: His glare pretty much summed up 
everything various leaders of agriculture have been saying since the march 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 What that look said was this: We won't give up, or give in, and we can match 
you ghost for ghost, echo for echo. It was a jarring intrusion of reality on 
Rodriguez's rosy rhetoric. Nothing has changed, is what it said. And here we go 
again.

RUSSIA NOW READY TO JOIN NATO PROGRAM; MILITARY: EARLIER THE KREMLIN HAD SAID A 
DECISION WAS HALF A YEAR OFF. CRITICS OBJECT TO THE LACK OF SPECIAL STATUS FOR 
THE EX-SUPERPOWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an announcement meant to end mixed signals from the Kremlin, the Foreign 
Ministry said Tuesday that Russia plans to go ahead and sign on to NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin's spokesman had warned last week that Yeltsin was 
having second thoughts about joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
loose affiliation designed for former Warsaw Pact members. He said it could 
take six or seven months for a Russian consensus to be reached on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin said Tuesday that the 
partnership could help "strengthen overall European security." He said Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev plans to sign an agreement on Russia's membership 
April 21 in Brussels. "That will be the date of our joining the program," 
Churkin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Russian objections to the partnership deal appear to remain, stemming in 
part from Moscow's concern that it will not enjoy special status in the group 
despite its superior military might. Russian nationalists have also complained 
that the partnership is merely a post-Cold War cover for luring all of Moscow's 
former Warsaw Pact allies into NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Some military analysts also worry that membership could hamper Russian 
operations in other former Soviet republics, territory Moscow sees as falling 
within its own sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kremlin appears to have decided to work from inside the NATO program 
rather than keeping its distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very serious possibilities to influence the system from inside," said 
Alexander A. Konovalov, a military analyst at the U.S.A.-Canada Institute in 
Moscow. "Joining the program, we avoid the military-political isolation which 
would have been inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Konovalov said that Russia's Security Council and other top bodies have 
approved the plan to join the Partnership for Peace. But Yeltsin apparently 
balked after hard-line lawmakers at parliamentary hearings warned that Russia 
would have to toe NATO's line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deputies have realized that it is fashionable today to be patriotic," 
Konovalov said, bemoaning lawmakers' refusal to understand the basics of the 
actual partnership program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Partnership for Peace was put together last year to offer a way to foster 
better military cooperation between the former Soviet Bloc countries -- many of 
which were clamoring for entry into NATO -- and the Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Members participate in joint military exercises and share some training and 
peacekeeping work, but no security guarantees are offered. Six former Soviet 
republics -- Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Ukraine -- have 
already joined, along with much of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole program is still highly makeshift and amorphous. Churkin said that 
even after Russia joins in principle, it will take six or seven months to work 
out the conditions of its membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what the basis was for presidential spokesman Vyacheslav V. Kostikov's 
statements last Friday about a different six months -- time he said was needed 
to sell the public on the program -- remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 He indicated that growing opposition to joining the program had led Yeltsin to 
decide he would need a national consensus. "This process may take six to seven 
months," Kostikov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev came out immediately afterward, asserting the agreement will be signed 
at the end of April -- proving if nothing else that the Russian government 
remains confused and somewhat uncoordinated in its positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision must come from Yeltsin himself. But it appears unlikely the 
Foreign Ministry would contradict him on so basic an issue. Kostikov, on the 
other hand, is known to voice his own opinions, although, as spokesman, he is 
supposed to represent the president's views. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Sevodnya (Today) commented that Russian public opinion is 
actually quite indifferent to the Partnership for Peace program. Deputies may 
oppose it, but since the Parliament will not have to ratify it, Yeltsin need 
not change his views to accommodate lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Sevodnya said, the president was probably responding to concern from 
the military Establishment and critics of the West, like Vladimir P. Lukin, 
head of the lower house's Foreign Affairs Committee. They worry that the 
Partnership for Peace program will hinder Russia's arms sales and require it to 
open its military budget to real public scrutiny, the newspaper said.

THOUSANDS OF INDIAN LEFTISTS RIOT AGAINST TRADE ACCORD; PROTEST: VASTLY 
OUTNUMBERED POLICE FIRE TEAR GAS AND WATER CANNONS. CLASHES LAST MORE THAN 
THREE HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of Indian leftists protesting a world trade accord fought pitched 
battles with police Tuesday near the usually placid site where Mohandas K. 
Gandhi, India's apostle of nonviolence, was cremated. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, said by their superiors to number only 1,500, fired tear gas and water 
cannons and charged with metal-tipped sticks to keep the demonstrators, who 
estimated their ranks at 200,000, from reaching the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 200 protesters and police, including senior officers, were reported 
injured in the fracas linked to the largest protest in India's capital to date 
against the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the global trade pact some 
Indians claim will allow outsiders to take over their country's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The clashes lasted for more than three hours near Rajghat, where the body of 
Gandhi -- the spiritual father of Indian independence revered as the Mahatma, 
or "Great Soul" -- was incinerated according to Hindu ritual after his 
assassination in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitnesses estimated that police used more than 1,000 tear gas shells, while 
protesters fought with stones and iron rods. 
</P>
<P>
 The marchers, assembled by India's two Communist parties and affiliated labor, 
youth, farmers and women's groups, demanded that Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha 
Rao's government reject the GATT accord. India and 116 other member countries 
of GATT, including the United States, are scheduled to sign the new world trade 
treaty April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the accord, mindful of India's long history as a British colony, 
fear that local industry will be snapped up or driven out of business by 
predatory foreign companies as the treaty forces the lifting of protectionist 
legislation. The farmers lobby is opposed out of concerns that GATT's 
patent-protection provisions will mean higher prices for hybrid seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 To carry their message to the country's lawmakers, the protesters tried to 
break through steel barriers that police erected to block their route from the 
sprawling Red Fort in Old Delhi, where India's independence was proclaimed in 
1947, to Parliament House. 
</P>
<P>
 When a group of about 10,000 young demonstrators succeeded in piercing one of 
the three police barricades, witnesses said, mounted officers waving short 
staves charged into the crowd. Several times, the protesters succeeded in 
pushing police back. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators accused police of brutality, but officials said they resorted to 
force only when the protesters turned violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have used tear gas canisters and a little bit of caning. There has been no 
firing," Delhi Police Chief Mukund Behari Kaushal told the Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The melee left the Ring Road, a major artery around India's capital, littered 
with shoes, broken eyeglasses, red flags and placards denouncing the government 
for accepting GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 The clashes were yet more evidence that Rao's government has done a poor job 
of making the case for the agreement to India's rank-and-file citizenry. India, 
now in the throes of scrapping much of its socialist economic machinery in 
favor of a freer market, has said it will sign GATT because it opens up more 
foreign countries for Indian exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The scrapping of quotas for textile imports that now prevail in most developed 
countries will mean a bigger market for Indian clothing, pro-government 
economists argue, while the scrapping of their subsidies for agriculture will 
make India's rice, cotton, sugar, wheat and other farm products much more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao's centrist Congress-I Party has prepared a booklet explaining its stand on 
GATT, but meanwhile, opponents have utilized street theater, protests and 
walkouts in Parliament to get their message across.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of Zulu nationalists brandishing spears, clubs and sticks marched in 
this Natal province city Tuesday, defying a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulu tribal chiefs called for the show of force to protest the deaths of Zulus 
in political violence and to commemorate those killed following a Zulu march 
last week in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said 85 people have been killed in political violence in the 
Zulu-dominated province since Thursday, when the state of emergency was 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite vows to disarm marchers, troops did nothing as the Zulus arrived in 
buses Tuesday to support their king's demand for a sovereign Zulu state. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency regulations give troops broad powers.

THE GAMBLE IS $9-BILLION PROGRAM WILL TAKE STING OUT OF CRIME; CONGRESS IS SET 
TO APPROVE CLINTON-BACKED INITIATIVE TO ADD 100,000 POLICE OFFICERS IN U.S. BUT 
EXPERTS WORRY IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB.

 Will more cops mean less crime? 
</P>
<P>
 In a law enforcement experiment of unprecedented cost and ambition, President 
Clinton and Congress are about to gamble almost $9 billion on the proposition 
that thickening the thin blue line will ease the sting of crime in big cities 
and small towns alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulfilling one of Clinton's most specific campaign promises, Congress is 
poised to approve a massive new matching grant program that will help 
communities deploy 100,000 new police officers through the end of the century. 
That would represent a dramatic 16% increase in the roughly 600,000 police on 
America's streets -- and offer a lifeline for mayors scrambling for the funds 
to respond to public demands for tough measures against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the federal government is a gigantic bank, and we want them to 
make their deposits in the right places," says Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan, who has promised to add almost 3,000 new police officers over the next 
four years. "The super right place is for police officers. We need the fiscal 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 When it returns from its Easter recess, Congress still faces many knotty 
questions on exactly how to structure the assistance. At the top of the list is 
how many police officers to fund: While the Senate has backed the 100,000 
figure, the House last fall approved funds for only 50,000 new officers. But 
with Clinton crusading for the higher figure, and public anxiety about crime at 
a piercing pitch, House aides say the chamber is virtually certain to accept 
the higher number. 
</P>
<P>
 But, even as the police program marches toward Clinton's desk, some mayors and 
law enforcement experts worry that it may not take as big a bite out of crime 
as supporters hope. With thousands of jurisdictions likely to seek aid, they 
reason, the new cops may be too widely diffused to help the most beleaguered 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also worry that gains could prove short-lived if cities lack the 
financial resources to assume the costs of the new officers after the federal 
subsidies expire, five to six years after each officer is hired. With the 
legislation demanding substantial local cost-sharing, some cities may be unable 
to afford new officers even with the subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, many experts note, there is no consistent evidence that adding 
police officers, by itself, reduces crime. "To assume additional officers alone 
can make a difference in the crime rate oversimplifies the problem," says St. 
Petersburg, Fla., Police Chief Darrel Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the new program point out that the police officers are only 
one component of a legislative package that includes tougher sentences, new 
funds for prison construction and -- especially in the House bill -- 
significant sums for crime prevention programs. And the police funds are 
intended to leverage local law enforcement departments toward reforming their 
operations to work more closely with local neighborhoods in a strategy known as 
"community policing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to work at the front end to prevent crime, and good police work can 
prevent crime," says Patrick V. Murphy, director of the police policy board at 
the U.S. Conference of Mayors. "With the level of violent crime we have in our 
cities, we can use more police." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid this debate about the value of more cops, hundreds of mayors effectively 
have cast their ballots by seeking their share of a pilot police-funding 
program Congress approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With about half of the $150 million in available funds distributed so far, the 
Justice Department has awarded grants to 108 communities -- ranging in size 
from Los Angeles, which won $4 million to hire 54 new officers, to San Juan 
Bautista, Calif., which was awarded $75,000 to rehire its solitary sheriff's 
deputy. But those receiving funds have been a fraction of the more than 2,700 
communities submitting applications. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that, in the aggregate, the crime legislation likely to 
emerge from Congress will substantially increase the nation's total deployment 
of police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 100,000 additional officers funded in the Senate bill, the 
legislation would create a national police corps similar to Clinton's national 
service plan. Under the program, young people would receive grants for college 
in return for agreeing to serve four years as police officers; communities 
would receive $10,000 annual subsidies to help pay their salaries over that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Judiciary Committee dropped that provision in the crime bill it 
approved last month, but supporters are optimistic about their prospects of 
restoring the funds when the bill reaches the House floor, probably sometime 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress fully funds the police corps -- which would require about $1 
billion in yearly expenditures -- the program could funnel another 50,000 
officers annually to local departments within four years of operation, the 
Congressional Budget Office has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts warn that these apparently impressive increases in police 
deployments wilt when brought down to the precinct level. Vacation time, sick 
time and other considerations mean that police departments must hire between 
five and six new officers to keep a single additional body on the street 24 
hours a day year-round, Chief Stephens says. Adding 100,000 new cops nationally 
"turns out to be 20,000 patrolmen or less on the street," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that reality, law enforcement experts like James Q. Wilson, a professor 
of management at UCLA, say the new officers could do the most good if they were 
concentrated in the few cities confronting the most violent crime. But the 
political current runs toward fragmentation: Both houses of Congress have 
designed allocation formulas that guarantee cities under 150,000 a majority of 
the new police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding ways to "target the resources where they are needed," promises to be 
the most difficult challenge in the final negotiations over the bill, one 
Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson and other experts, the question of how the new officers will be 
used is even more important than how they are distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Congress want to use the new funds to leverage cities toward 
community policing: Only cities committed to that strategy will be eligible for 
the aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But, although almost every major city claims to be embracing community 
policing, they have advanced a diverse assortment of strategies that range from 
fundamental reform to what many consider cosmetic change. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the public image of community policing centers on officers walking a 
beat rather than patrolling in squad cars, most experts say the approach's core 
is a commitment by police departments to work more closely with neighborhood 
groups to prevent crime, rather than simply responding to emergencies through 
the "911" system. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementing that vision requires "a fairly rigorous devolution of authority" 
from central commanders to local precincts -- and as such is frequently 
resisted even in communities that have rhetorically committed to the community 
policing concept, says George L. Kelling, a professor of criminal justice at 
Northeastern University. In varying ways, cities such as New York and Houston 
have stumbled in the transition to the new system, and Houston has actually 
backed away. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Administration is to maximize the impact of the new officers, Kelling 
argues, it will have to rigorously target its resources toward those 
communities that display the most commitment to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends how discerning they are," Kelling says. "It seems to me the 
federal government has to identify not only cities in need, but cities that are 
moving in creative ways toward responding to that need." More Police, Less 
Crime? 
</P>
<P>
 Federal figures indicate no direct relationship between a city's level of 
policing and its crime rate. With nearly four officers per 1,000 residents, 
Philadelphia has a relatively low crime rate; Atlanta, with almost as many 
police per capita, has a crime rate almost three times greater. And San Jose, 
with 50% fewer police officers per capita than New York or Philadelphia, has a 
lower crime rate than either of those. 03,15,37,22 City Police officers per

TURKISH PREMIER ANNOUNCES SWEEPING ECONOMIC REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tansu Ciller ordered massive repairs to Turkey's debt-damaged 
economy on Tuesday in the boldest reform and economic stabilization package the 
country has seen since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey's leader turned in the best television performance of her troubled 
nine-month premiership in announcing the sale or closure of dozens of 
public-sector companies, a huge wave of price increases and a freeze on wages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have hyper-inflation and stagnation if no measures are taken. . . . 
Some Latin American states represent perfect examples of what may happen," 
Ciller told a news conference transmitted live to Turkey's 60 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 The wealthy, 47-year-old former professor of economics gambled that a warning 
of financial meltdown would persuade the Turks to swallow what she admitted was 
a bitter prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 Some worker protests broke out in Istanbul and provincial towns at the news 
that loss-making, overstaffed state steelworks, shipyards and breweries will be 
closed. But the protests were more somber than angry, and Ciller's package 
contains some provision for social safety nets. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of debate, many Turks seem to understand the need to sort out the 
state sector. Some fear that economic failure will only aid the pro-Islamist 
Welfare Party, which won the mayors' seats in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, 
and 19% of the national vote in municipal elections March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy clearly needs shock therapy as well. Inflation is at 73% and looks 
set to soar. Economic growth, which reached 7.4% in 1993, has collapsed since 
January, when the government ratcheted up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 To start reducing the deficit, Ciller announced price increases of 50% to 100% 
for a wide range of goods and services, including fuel, air tickets and the 
Turkish national drink, raki. 
</P>
<P>
 More convincing for worried observers like the International Monetary Fund was 
a range of long-delayed structural reforms.

CHINESE DISSIDENT IS BACK IN CUSTODY AFTER 'NEW CRIMES'; RIGHTS: WEI 
JINGSHENG'S MOST GRIEVOUS AFFRONT MAY HAVE BEEN HIS FEB. 27 MEETING WITH A 
CLINTON ENVOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Only six months after he was released from prison to sweeten China's 
unsuccessful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, leading dissident Wei 
Jingsheng is back in custody facing another term in prison for what authorities 
described Tuesday as "new crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The official New China News Agency reported that "the Beijing Public Security 
Bureau has decided to investigate suspected new criminal offenses by Wei 
Jingsheng." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the crimes were unspecified, they appear to involve allegations that 
Wei violated conditions of his parole last September banning him from engaging 
in political activities for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 During his brief taste of freedom after serving 14 1/2 years of a 15-year 
sentence stemming from his leadership in the 1978 Democracy Wall movement, Wei 
immediately picked up where he left off -- writing articles critical of China's 
human rights policy for foreign newspapers, urging Chinese citizens to voice 
their grievances against the government and meeting regularly with foreign 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the eyes of the Chinese government, Wei's most grievous affront may 
have been his Feb. 27 meeting in a Beijing hotel with John Shattuck, an 
assistant secretary of state and President Clinton's special envoy on human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 90-minute meeting, Wei, 43, reportedly advised Shattuck that the United 
States should insist on human rights improvements before granting China 
most-favored-nation trading status when it comes up for renewal in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials claimed the meeting was a violation of Wei's parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese also seized on the Wei-Shattuck encounter in the China World Hotel 
as an example of bad faith on the part of the U.S. government on the eve of the 
March 10-14 visit to China by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference following the frosty Christopher visit, the Chinese 
minister of foreign affairs charged that by meeting with Wei, Shattuck violated 
Chinese laws and "interfered in the internal affairs of China." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Christopher trip, Wei was ordered out of town by Chinese officials 
to prevent another such rendezvous with U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wei tried to return to Beijing over the Easter weekend, he was stopped by 
a caravan of what witnesses said were seven security vehicles. At first, the 
Beijing Public Security Bureau claimed Wei was released after questioning. But 
after family and friends reported no sight of Wei, the security bureau said 
Tuesday that he was still in custody at an unnamed location. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Wei Ling, Wei's sister, said she did not know where 
he was being kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the report is true," a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said, "we regret that the 
Chinese have taken this step. To the best of our knowledge, Mr. Wei had only 
made use of the universal right of freedom of opinion and expression." 
</P>
<P>
 The detention announcement was made on Ching Ming, the day normally set aside 
for sweeping graves and honoring the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Ching Ming has also been a day for political acts of defiance. On 
Tuesday, Tian An Men Square, site of the 1989 democracy movement, and grave 
sites of some of the victims of the army crackdown on the democracy protesters 
were under heavier than usual security. The Associated Press reported that 
police hustled away a young man who tried to lay a wreath in the central 
square.

FAR-FLUNG FAMILY IS ALL BUSINESS AS FAR AS TIES GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of Tan Wing-Mun, a Singapore native who went to college in the 
United States, illustrates how family business ties span the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan, 30, was working for a New York insurance company four years ago when his 
father -- a textile manufacturer in Singapore -- bought controlling interest in 
a Hong Kong shoe company and called his son back to Asia to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Golden Lotus Shoes Factory, makes baby shoes for export under the 
Angel brand name. Tan closed the factory in Kowloon last year and concentrated 
his labor-intensive production in Shenzhen, China, where his 80 workers earn 
about one-eighth the going wage in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, the family was considering the problems of expanding in 
Shenzhen's increasingly labor-scarce, inhospitable environment when they got a 
hot tip on a distressed real estate sale deeper inside Guangdong province. The 
news came from one of Tan's uncles, who had stayed in China when Tan's mother 
fled in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal involved a huge half-completed factory for sale in Dongguan, 3 1/2 
hours by bus from Hong Kong near Guangzhou (Canton). Tan's father seized the 
opportunity to invest $2 million in the land and building, a lucky bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan's brother moved from Singapore to Dongguan to work with their two cousins, 
who handled the local guanxi. They hope to begin production at the new 
80,000-square-foot plant soon, paying their 200 workers -- ages 16 to 20 -- 
wages starting at about $40 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother is quite proud of this," Tan said. "The dream in China is to leave 
home and return successful, and my mother sees this as a great honor for the 
family." KARL SCHOENBERGER

JAPAN STARTS UP CONTROVERSIAL PLUTONIUM-PRODUCING REACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's widely criticized plan to use plutonium to produce energy took an 
important step forward Tuesday when engineers shifted an experimental 
"fast-breeder" reactor into continuous operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters denounced the reactor, which produces more plutonium than it uses, 
as unsafe and unwise.Police said about 100 people rallied peacefully outside 
the plant in Tsuruga, 200 miles from Tokyo on the Sea of Japan coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say plutonium is too lethal for safe use, and they also worry that it 
could become the target for terrorists who want to build a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The 280,000-kilowatt nuclear power station, which cost $5.9 billion, is named 
Monju after the Buddhist deity of wisdom. It will not begin transmitting 
electricity until April, 1995, and will not be at full power until late next 
year. Its start-up was delayed 1 1/2 years by a series of technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the reactor's safety systems have not been adequately tested and 
fear that an accident could scatter highly lethal plutonium, possibly tainting 
water and food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Monju's cooling system is at issue because it uses liquid sodium, which can 
ignite when exposed to air. A similar reactor in France was shut down in 1990 
after several leaks in its sodium-based cooling system and is still idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other nations have dropped plans for plutonium-producing reactors 
because of the hazards and costs of producing the material and because 
less-toxic uranium became much cheaper.

IN ASSAULT ON BOSNIAN 'HAVEN,' U.S. POLICY IS UNDER FIRE; BALKANS: SERBIAN 
REBELS CLOSE IN ON GORAZDE. BUT OFFICIAL SAYS NO AMERICAN TROOPS WILL BE SENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A major assault by Bosnian Serbs against the Muslim enclave of Gorazde broke 
through the outer defenses of the purported U.N. "safe haven" Tuesday, sending 
hundreds of terrified civilians fleeing and undermining the credibility of 
American policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation of Gorazde as one of six U.N.-protected zones last May was the 
Clinton Administration's first significant diplomatic initiative in the 
conflict in the former Yugoslav federation; the city's fall to the advancing 
Serbian gunmen would expose the American approach as an empty gesture to avoid 
intervention, some analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government officials described the situation as critical after Serbian 
gunmen were said to have broken through defense lines in at least three places 
around Gorazde and taken more territory along the Drina River that divides it. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees and Bosnian military officials appealed for serious Western efforts 
to save the city of 65,000, one of only three areas in eastern Bosnia not yet 
subjected to "ethnic cleansing" by nationalist Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, reiterated in Washington that no American troops will be 
deployed to Bosnia while fighting continues, and he rejected Bosnian calls for 
air strikes against the attackers, saying such strikes would be inappropriate 
in what he described as small-arms fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a briefing for reporters, Shalikashvili said that while the main threat to 
Sarajevo -- artillery and other heavy weapons, manned by the Serbs -- was 
vulnerable to air power, the major threat in Gorazde is from small-unit action, 
which is harder to stop from the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sensing was (that air power) would not be nearly as effective" in Gorazde 
as it was around Sarajevo, he said. He also said the allies do not have enough 
troops in Gorazde to patrol any exclusion zone the United Nations might set up. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks essentially repeated the decision by the allies that Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry voiced on Sunday: The United States does not plan to 
send ground troops or aircraft to the area to help rescue the beleaguered city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shalikashvili also said conditions around Gorazde could change at any 
time, and he pledged that the United States would reconsider its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said Monday that the United States would provide air support 
for U.N. troops if they elected to go into Gorazde. "But it really depends, in 
part, on what the U.N. mission wants to do there," he said, adding, "We are 
committed to providing air support to troops if they go in." 
</P>
<P>
 At the State Department on Tuesday, spokesman Mike McCurry disputed 
suggestions that the U.S. refusal to come to the defense of Gorazde might be 
interpreted as a go-ahead to the Serbs to capture that city as part of a 
last-ditch land-grab. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry also announced that Charles Redman, the U.S. special envoy to the 
former Yugoslav republics, is returning to the area for more peace talks with 
representatives of the three warring factions in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The move followed a telephone conversation between Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. Redman had been called 
back to Washington to show U.S. displeasure with Bosnia's maneuvering in the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, is to 
try to visit Gorazde today to make his own assessment of Bosnian government 
claims that the enclave is at risk of being conquered. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose commented shortly after the Serbian offensive picked up force over the 
weekend that he doubted the rebels could overrun Gorazde, which has withstood 
an artillery siege since the Serbian insurrection began two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.N. Protection Force has only four military observers posted near 
Gorazde because of the mission's shortage of troops to carry out the multitude 
of tasks assigned it by the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose appealed to Shalikashvili during the American's visit to Sarajevo last 
week to send U.S. troops now to bolster the peacekeeping force. The mission 
already has more than 13,000 troops in Bosnia. But they have been overwhelmed 
by the demands of monitoring a 2-month-old cease-fire in Sarajevo and aiding in 
reconciliation between Muslims and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 No further U.N. deployments to Gorazde are expected unless the United States 
agrees to provide ground forces despite the absence of a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Western relief agencies with field workers in Gorazde reported heavy shelling 
in the town center and mass expulsions of Muslims from surrounding villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Janowski, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees in Sarajevo, said as many as 2,000 Muslims had fled from perimeter 
settlements to the center but that the center was also under heavy artillery 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many villages on the left bank of the River Drina have been overrun and 
burned as part of the offensive. As a result, hundreds of refugees are 
fleeing," said a statement from Doctors Without Borders, the international 
humanitarian aid group. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 people have been killed and hundreds injured since the Serbian 
assault on the holdout Muslim pocket escalated a week ago, according to U.N. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The four U.N. military observers deployed to Gorazde said they were told by 
Bosnian military commanders that Serbs had penetrated their lines to the south 
and southeast and were close to the town itself, said the U.N. spokesman in 
Sarajevo, Maj. Rob Annink. But he conceded that the four soldiers were unable 
to travel around and make their own assessments because of the fierce battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-line Serbian military leaders boasted publicly of their advance on 
Gorazde. "Our units have defeated the government forces inside Gorazde pocket 
and have reached the right bank of the Drina River," Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic, 
the rebel army's chief of staff, was quoted as saying by the Bosnian Serb news 
agency SRNA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Drina River runs through Gorazde's east side, and Milovanovic's claim to 
have moved troops over the right, or west, bank would suggest the rebels have 
cut deeply into government-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But claims by both Serbian gunmen and the aggrieved Muslim-led government army 
are often exaggerated for the benefit of the international community.

U.S. SAFETY GROUP RECALLS CRAYONS MADE IN CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Consumer Product Safety Commission on Tuesday recalled 11 brands of 
lead-containing crayons imported from China and urged parents who bought them 
either to throw them away or return them for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of the crayons have been sold at a variety of outlets 
across the country, the commission said. Three of the brands contain enough 
lead to pose a poisoning hazard to young children who might eat or chew them. 
The other eight brands have less lead content but enough to add to the overall 
"lead load" of children who might eat them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throw these crayons in the trash or take them back to the store for a 
refund," said Commission Chairman Ann Brown. She said that parents can be 
assured crayons are safe if the package contains the label: "Conforms to ASTM 
D-4236" or a similar number. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Hazardous Substances Act bans children's products containing 
hazardous amounts of lead, which can cause irreversible brain damage and impair 
mental function. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials said that crayons made by the nation's leading crayon 
manufacturer, Crayola, also were tested and were found to be safe. A spokesman 
from Binney & Smith Inc., the manufacturer of Crayola products, said that the 
imported crayons represent only 3% to 5% of the nation's $130-million crayon 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The only known case of lead poisoning from the harmful crayons occurred in 
Phoenix, where high levels of lead were found in an infant who consumed a 
Chinese-manufactured crayon that was distributed by Concord Enterprises in Los 
Angeles. Concord, which distributed "12 Jumbo Crayons," already has recalled 
them in cooperation with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two brands deemed most hazardous were distributed by Toys R Us, 
through its nearly 250 retail outlets, and Glory Stationery Manufacturing Ltd., 
which -- like Concord Enterprises -- distributed crayons to various retailers 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toys R Us crayons were sold as a house brand and labeled as "Safe 48 
Non-Toxic I'm A Toys R Us Kid! Crayons." The company said that it would pull 
the brand from its shelves and issue refunds to buyers who return the crayons. 
But company officials disputed the commission's conclusions and cited 
independent tests showing that the crayons do not contain dangerous levels of 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are complying with the request of the CPSC and have been taking them (the 
crayons) off the shelves and issuing refunds to persons who return them," said 
Carol Fuller of Toys R Us. 
</P>
<P>
 Glory Stationery Manufacturing said that those tested by the commission were a 
sample batch that was never sold to the public and that it has none of the 
tainted crayons in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The other eight brands and distributors of crayons found to have lower levels 
of lead: 
</P>
<P>
 * "64 Crayons, School Quality, No. 8064," A. J. Cohen Distributors, Huappauge, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 * "64 Crayons, No. CR 64-64 CT," Baum Imports, New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * "12 Super Jumbo Crayons," Dynamic Division of Agora International, St. 
Albans, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 * "8 Crayons, No. 5 CL 850," Dynamic Division of Agora International, St. 
Albans, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Fun Time 72 Crayons, No. B541," Overseas United, New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * "64 Crayons, Kidz Biz," Bargain Wholesale, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * "64 Crayons, SKU No. 51-02600," Universal International, Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Feido, 12 Crayons, No. CC8812," Kipp Brothers Inc., Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials said that they would closely monitor any crayons imported 
from China and would conduct studies on crayons manufactured in other countries 
as well as the United States.

TEAMSTERS STRIKE 22 TRUCKING COMPANIES; LABOR: WALKOUT INVOLVING NEARLY 80,000 
WORKERS COULD AFFECT FREIGHT SHIPMENTS NATIONWIDE. PICKET LINES GO UP IN LOS 
ANGELES COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that could disrupt freight shipments nationwide, the Teamsters 
launched a strike Tuesday night against 22 major trucking companies after both 
sides failed to agree on a labor contract covering nearly 80,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike, while not expected to paralyze transportation, could be widely 
felt across the country by consumers, retailers and factories. The companies 
hit by the walkout, which began at 9 p.m. PDT, handle about half of the 
nation's mid-size shipments over long distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 7,000 and 10,000 Teamsters in the Los Angeles area are expected to be 
involved in the strike, said Gregory Roth, secretary-treasurer of Teamster 
Local 208 in El Monte, whose members began walking picket lines outside several 
company truck terminals Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to walk out," Roth said. "But the employers have taken a 
take-it-or-leave-it attitude on some extremely serious issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters late Tuesday called off the strike against Carolina Freight 
Carriers Corp. after the Cherryville, N.C.-based firm broke ranks with the 
other trucking companies and negotiated a separate agreement with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers said that a shutdown of the remaining 22 firms in the 
strike would leave many companies scrambling for space on other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the potential significance of the strike was downplayed Tuesday by Robert 
A. Young III, chairman of Trucking Management, which represents the trucking 
firms in labor negotiations with the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of carriers out there that aren't union carriers" that will 
pick up business, Young said. He added that trucking companies have sped up the 
delivery of customer shipments to beat the strike deadline and avoid delays. 
Also, he said, the Trucking Management companies control only about 18% of the 
nation's total freight traffic moved by truck, train and plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking industry officials said cross-country shipments could be most 
vulnerable to disruption since the affected companies dominate long-distance 
transport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your shipment is going from Orange County to the San Fernando Valley, (the 
strike) will not have much effect," said Joseph M. Nievez, vice president of 
non-union Qwikway Trucking in Los Angeles. "If you are going from here to 
Charlotte, you will have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Teamster President Ron Carey on Tuesday said the strike could spread 
beyond the initial 22 firms to other trucking companies that employ an 
additional 40,000 Teamsters under the same contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur H. Bunte Jr., chief negotiator for the companies, called the strike 
decision "an act of irresponsible leadership that will destroy jobs, not 
protect them." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that union leaders showed "they would rather risk the livelihoods of 
their members than negotiate a settlement that would have provided increased 
wages . . . and the job security that can only come from working for 
competitive companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between the Teamsters and trucking firms broke off last week after the 
companies submitted what they described as their final offer. The Teamsters 
rejected the offer, which included proposals to hire more part-time workers and 
shift more business to railroads, as one that would lead to lower starting 
wages and lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members had already voted to authorize Teamster leaders to launch a 
strike if the talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies described the measures as necessary to compete successfully 
against fast-growing non-union carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do whatever it takes to finish this," said Carey, who pointed out 
that the Teamster strike fund has been boosted to about $80 million to handle a 
lengthy walkout. "We have no other choice but to strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said Tuesday that the strike could be avoided only if the trucking firms 
addressed the union's concerns regarding company proposals, primarily the one 
that would increase the use of part-time workers. But no compromise was 
reached.

QUESTIONERS PUT HEAT TO CLINTON ON WHITEWATER; TOWN MEETING: IN A FORUM WHERE 
HE USUALLY EXCELS, PRESIDENT IS TAKEN ABACK BY CHALLENGES TO HIS 
TRUSTWORTHINESS. HE TESTILY DEFENDS HIMSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, responding in a televised town meeting to a woman who said 
that the Whitewater controversy has sapped the nation's trust in him, insisted 
that he and the First Lady had done nothing wrong and asked that he be allowed 
to do his job without distracting questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was clearly taken aback by the challenge from a woman in the 
live audience here, who not only asked him how he could win back the nation's 
trust but wondered aloud whether he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are 
middle-class Americans or just another pair of "villainous, money-grubbing 
Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he is from a middle-class background and had never skirted the 
law in his investments or taxes. He heatedly declared that no one has credibly 
accused him of abuse of power in office "and never will." 
</P>
<P>
 The town hall meeting, a format that Clinton usually dominates, was unusually 
tough for the President. Participants from Charlotte; Austin, Tex.; Bristol, 
Tenn., and Roanoke, Va., challenged Clinton with their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 A man from Austin asked whether Clinton could be trusted after numerous 
flip-flops on policy and the continuing stream of revelations about the 
Clintons' role in Whitewater Development Corp., a failed Ozark real estate 
firm. The Clintons' partner in Whitewater owned a savings and loan that failed, 
costing taxpayers at least $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, angrily jabbing his finger at the man's image on a television 
monitor, said that he had been falsely accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been the subject, sir, of false charges," the President said testily, 
without specifying who had made the allegations. The charges "make their 
credibility an issue, not mine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then said: "You all are free to disagree with me but disagreement is 
different from trust. Let's not mix apples and oranges." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the question about Mrs. Clinton's investments, Clinton said that 
his wife did not receive preferential treatment in trading in cattle futures in 
the late 1970s that made her nearly $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that she "got cold feet" and withdrew from the cattle futures market 
just weeks before a major crash that wiped out scores of investors. Clinton 
said that his wife got out of the risky commodities market after receiving a 
margin call on her trading account shortly before their daughter, Chelsea, was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents released by the White House show that Mrs. Clinton cashed out her 
commodities account seven months before Chelsea was born and did not resume 
substantial trading thereafter. The documents do not indicate that she was ever 
subject to a margin call, in which a brokerage house demands that an investor 
put up more money to cover potential trading losses.

BENTSEN MADE MADISON S&L INQUIRIES AS SENATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, while a senator from Texas, made inquiries 
with federal regulators at the Resolution Trust Corp. about the agency's 
handling of a real estate venture owned in part by Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan, the failed Arkansas thrift linked to the Whitewater controversy, newly 
released documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents, released by the RTC, show that Bentsen contacted the agency in 
1991 on behalf of an Austin, Tex., real estate agent angered by the way the 
agency was disposing of real estate held by Madison at the time it was seized 
by federal regulators. Bentsen sought and won high-level attention within the 
RTC for the complaint, although it is unclear what action ultimately was taken 
by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters connected to Bentsen's inquiry in the case were among 8,000 papers 
released by the RTC in response to Whitewater-based requests from the media 
under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence that Bentsen's contact with the agency went beyond the 
normal actions of a member of Congress on behalf of a constituent. However, 
members of his senior staff at the Treasury Department, including his chief of 
staff, have come under fire for their actions in overseeing the RTC since late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those aides, including Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and Chief of 
Staff Joshua Steiner, are now under scrutiny by Whitewater special counsel 
Robert B. Fiske Jr. for their contacts with White House political aides about 
the RTC's investigation of Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen is chairman of the RTC's Oversight Board, which helps set broad policy 
direction for the agency. Treasury spokesman Howard Schloss said Tuesday that 
Bentsen has never considered recusing himself from his involvement with the RTC 
because of his earlier contact with the agency on the Madison case. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were normal constituency referrals" to an agency from a member of 
Congress, Schloss noted. "The issue of recusal was never considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Schloss added that Bentsen has not been involved with the Madison case since 
he joined the Clinton Administration, either in his role as Treasury secretary 
or as chairman of the RTC board. The oversight board does not get involved in 
the agency's handling of individual institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In past public statements, Bentsen has been supportive of his aides while 
making it clear that he was not involved in any of the meetings or discussions 
between Treasury and the White House on Madison. In addition to Fiske's 
investigation, Bentsen has asked the Office of Government Ethics to review the 
Treasury-White House meetings.

<P>
 Former Rep. Carroll Hubbard Jr. (D-Ky.) and his wife pleaded guilty Tuesday to 
misusing campaign contributions they received for their unsuccessful 
congressional races in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard, 56, and Carol Brown Hubbard, 53, were arraigned separately in U.S. 
District Court. They are free on their own recognizance pending sentencing June 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom S. Eicher said Hubbard engaged in a variety of 
abuses, including using campaign money to pay his daughter's school tuition and 
other personal expenses, falsifying campaign finance reports, having House 
staff perform campaign duties during working hours and paying people to 
contribute money to Carol Hubbard's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard was also accused of staging a phony burglary of his office in Paducah, 
Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Hubbard, who ran for Congress in a separate district, was charged with a 
single misdemeanor count of aiding and abetting theft. She could be fined up to 
$100,000 and sentenced to up to one year in prison and one year of probation.

STATE OF U.S. UPSETS AMERICANS, POLL FINDS; SURVEY: RESPONDENTS ARE ALSO 
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR OWN FINANCIAL FUTURES, DESPITE SIGNS OF ECONOMIC RENEWAL. 
SOME ANALYSTS SAY PESSIMISM COULD SLOW DOWN THE RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite signs of accelerating economic growth, Americans remain "highly 
dissatisfied" with the state of the nation and fearful about their own 
financial prospects, according to a national poll released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press, showed 
that many Americans consider themselves financially overburdened, a concern 
that some analysts said could restrain future buying decisions and slow down 
the economic recovery. Many respondents also expressed concerns about violent 
crime, their jobs, and public and private morality. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Americans were more worried about their futures than they were in the 
1980s, and they generally viewed problems at the national level as more serious 
than those in their communities. Only 24% of respondents said they were 
satisfied with the country's course, while 68% expressed satisfaction with 
trends in their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an improving economic picture, only 44% of those employed said their 
wages were sufficient for the life to which they aspired, and 51% expressed 
concerns about job opportunities for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about national problems that are growing worse, 77% identified crime, 
63% chose morality and ethics and 62% cited illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of those surveyed said they were "very concerned" about becoming the 
victim of a crime, up from 36% in a 1988 Times Mirror survey. One in four 
persons said they or a member of their family had been a victim of crime in the 
previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Large percentages of those polled said they saw the country losing ground in 
other areas related to morality. Sixty-nine percent saw the breakup of families 
as a growing problem, while 59% cited lack of respect for religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivaling the fear of crime and concern about jobs was personal concern over 
health care, the survey found. Forty-five percent reported they had such 
problems as difficulty affording the cost of care, being dropped by an 
insurance company or refusal of coverage for pre-existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the poll showed public support fading for a central feature of 
Clinton's health care reform program -- universal coverage. While 60% of all 
Americans supported the notion of universal coverage a year ago, only 51% 
favored it in the latest poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, in which the Washington-based Center for National Policy cooperated, 
surveyed 2,001 adults between March 16-21. The margin of error was plus or 
minus 2 to 3 percentage points.

 Scientists identified on Tuesday the remains inside 17th-Century lead coffins 
that were unearthed in Maryland in 1992 as members of the state's founding 
family: Colonial Gov. Philip Calvert and his wife, Anne Wolsley. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists had suspected as much ever since opening the coffins two years ago. 
They proved the identifications through intricate research that paints a vivid 
picture, down to the food they ate and the illnesses they suffered.

 He was a sedentary, corpulent fellow with flowing auburn hair, which was 
preserved even after 300 years. She had a fondness for sweets that decayed all 
but five teeth, leaving her malnourished despite her wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how his hair was trimmed, how his beard was shaved . . . information 
you simply cannot find in any historical record," said Dr. Douglas Owsley, a 
forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, where scientists 
displayed parts of the skeletons Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists have discovered fewer than 100 skeletons from the 17th Century. 
Owsley said that, thanks to the lead coffins, none was as well preserved as the 
Calverts and that of a baby girl buried in a third coffin next to them. 
Scientists suspect she was Calvert's 6-month-old daughter from a second 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffins were unearthed in historic St. Mary's City, site of Maryland's 
17th-Century capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists determined the couple's height, muscular build and whether they 
were left- or right-handed. Pollen in the coffins told the season of death. 
Using nuclear isotopes, scientists discovered traces of European and American 
diets, a sign that the pair had immigrated about 20 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calverts are the only people who fit all the clues, project director Henry 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert was governor from 1660 to 1661, and chancellor, second in command, for 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 About his wife, all historians know is that her family suffered religious 
persecution in England. They don't know her birth date. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was obviously cherished, St. Mary's historian Lois Carr said: Someone 
tied a silk ribbon in a bow around her hands, wrapped her in fine linens and 
sprinkled rosemary, the herb of remembrance, over her before sealing her 
coffin.

LATINO LEADER INDICTED IN DOCUMENT FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Velez, president of a leading national Latino civil rights organization, 
and three Taiwanese nationals were indicted Tuesday on federal charges that 
they conspired to create and supply false documents so thousands of illegal 
immigrants could remain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Las Vegas, said the 
immigrants were charged fees as high as $45,000 each for fraudulent documents 
provided by the alleged Taiwanese conspirators -- Bill Tzeng, Simon Chang and 
Al Feng. Velez carried out his part of the conspiracy through his Las Vegas 
immigration consulting firm, Velez & Sons, Inc., according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization Velez heads, the League of United Latin American Citizens, 
the nation's oldest Latino civil rights organization, was not accused of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment is part of a continuing investigation in Las Vegas by a 
Legalization Fraud Task Force made up of 10 Immigration and Naturalization 
Service agents, assisted by Internal Revenue Service agents. The indictment was 
released by the Justice Department here and in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the investigation related to Velez, six defendants, including Velez's son, 
Peter Velez, have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators, the 
Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Marshall, an attorney for Jose Velez, was quoted by the Las Vegas 
Review-Journal on Sunday defending Velez's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was clearly operating an agency with staff but he gave clear and implicit 
instructions that nobody was to be involved in any illegalities," Marshall 
said. "If some of the mice were playing when the cat was away, that's one 
thing, but he insists that whatever happened did not involve him." 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged conspiracy, which ran from March, 1988, to about January, 1991, 
sought to misuse the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the department 
said. The act authorized immigrants who had been living in the United States 
illegally before Jan. 1, 1982, to apply for amnesty as a step toward becoming 
legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants who did seasonal agricultural work for specified periods also could 
file another type of legalization application. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury charged that Velez, Feng, Tzeng and Chang conspired to provide 
false documents and oral statements to the INS for immigrants fraudulently 
seeking amnesty. At the height of the alleged conspiracy, Velez reportedly 
received receipts, paid primarily in cash, totaling as much as $50,000 a day 
for his work. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment described how unnamed co-conspirators, called "group leaders" 
in the indictment, recruited busloads of unqualified immigrants to file false 
amnesty applications in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most group leaders charged applicants fees ranging from $250 to $3,500, 
although Feng, Tzeng and Chang allegedly charged some applicants as much as 
$45,000 apiece. The group leaders shared their fees with Velez, according to 
the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 It said that Velez and his fellow plotters obtained blank envelopes bearing 
Mexican postage and backdated Mexican postmarks, which when addressed to 
unqualified immigrants served as fictitious evidence of longtime U.S. 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Arnoldo Torres, who served as the organization's national 
political adviser during the 1989-1990 election that brought Velez to the helm 
of the group, said he warned the members that Velez was under investigation and 
could embarrass the organization.

JUDGE ALTERS FLOWER RANCHER'S TERM IN SLAVERY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County flower rancher originally charged with enslaving Mexican 
laborers will spend no time in prison after a change in sentencing by a federal 
judge who found that incarceration would cost dozens more farm workers their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall in Los Angeles changed the three-year 
prison sentence of Edwin M. Ives, 57, to one year in a halfway house and two 
years of house arrest under electronic surveillance.Ives has remained free 
pending a requested change of sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ives, who employs up to 100 workers at his 50-acre Somis compound, has paid 
most of the $1.5 million in restitution ordered by the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Ives pleaded guilty to seven criminal violations of labor and immigration law, 
including transporting and harboring illegal immigrants and payment of 
substandard wages. However, Marshall said she had seen no evidence of slavery, 
extortion or racketeering by Ives -- charges that brought the case notoriety as 
the largest slavery prosecution in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, in the Monday decision, apparently embraced defense arguments that 
without Ives his ranch would founder under a deepening depression in the 
ornamental flower business.

NAVY PLANE CRASHES INTO S.F. BAY; 2 FLIERS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Navy attack plane crashed into San Francisco Bay within sight of the Bay 
Bridge on Tuesday, killing the two Navy reserve fliers aboard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The A-6 Intruder was practicing touch-and-go landings at Alameda Naval Air 
Station shortly before noon when it plunged into the water about a mile west of 
the air station. 
</P>
<P>
 It crashed about a mile from the bridge, which links San Francisco and 
Oakland, Coast Guard Petty Officer Gene Maestas said. 
</P>
<P>
 A small craft pulled the two aviators from the water and a Coast Guard cutter 
picked them up and took them to Yerba Buena Island, where they were pronounced 
dead by paramedics. The island, in the middle of the bay, links the two 
sections of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified as Lt. Randall E. McNally II, 33, of San Antonio, 
Tex., and Lt. Cmdr. Brian R. McMahon, 34, of Portland, Ore.

SUSPECT WAS VIEWED AS PSYCHOTIC AFTER GIRL'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a hospital the afternoon of his arrest on suspicion of killing an 
8-year-old girl, Hooman Panah was "acutely psychotic" and claimed he saw two 
"black-hooded strangers" who told him to kill himself, according to medical 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Records also show that Panah was given a heavy dose of the powerful 
antipsychotic medication Haldol in a hospital emergency room before his arrest 
-- medication which Panah's lawyer said may invalidate his alleged confession 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, 22, was indicted in February on charges of murder, rape and sodomy in 
the death of Nicole Parker, whose body was found in a suitcase in a closet of 
Panah's Woodland Hills apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 His mental state, reflected in records of his emergency room treatment, is 
expected to be the centerpiece of his defense. Prosecutors have not decided 
whether to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah has not entered an insanity plea. Defense attorney Robert Sheahen said 
Tuesday that he is awaiting the findings of court-appointed mental health 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 When Panah was hospitalized on Nov. 21, the day after Nicole's death, he had 
slashed his wrists and overdosed on over-the-counter sleeping pills. Records 
show he was given 5 milligrams of Haldol, a medication often used to control 
schizophrenics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This did produce a slight sedating effect on the patient so he was more 
cooperative," John Palmer, an emergency room physician at West Valley Hospital, 
wrote in the records. 
</P>
<P>
 The medication may have impaired Panah's ability to judge whether he should 
exercise his right to remain silent, Sheahen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Larry Diamond declined to comment, other than to say, "I 
don't think this case turns on any particular statement made by the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 Other records indicate that Panah, a German citizen who was born in Iran, had 
been hospitalized in 1988, six months after arriving in the United States, 
following a suicide attempt, according to Sheahen. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently released transcripts of testimony before the Los Angeles County grand 
jury that indicted Panah also indicate suicide was on his mind in the hours 
after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 12 hours after Nicole is believed to have died during a sex act, 
Panah sat in his black BMW overlooking the San Fernando Valley at Mulholland 
Drive and Beverly Glen Boulevard and made what was meant to be the final entry 
in his journal, the transcripts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rambling diary entry, made at about 11:45 p.m. on Nov. 20, Panah 
apologized for the death of Nicole -- then the subject of an intensive police 
search -- but blamed the killing on other "psychotic, evil and powerful" 
people, according to the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so sorry this had to happen. I feel so sorry for you, the parents," 
Panah wrote. "Believe me, that's why I am letting myself go. After all, this is 
how they brought me down. . . . They had a very strong weapon. I was so scared, 
ashamed, upset, destroyed inside and powerless. The kid was already dead and 
they were pushing me into it and looked like I'm normal and made it look like 
my fault." 
</P>
<P>
 The long-haired Mervyn's clerk then said goodby to his pet bird and his 
friends, writing about "the real me" and his love of nature and plans to become 
a police detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of his rambling writing, which prosecutors characterized as self-serving, 
focused on unidentified people he believed were persecuting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, this is how they brought me down," Panah explained in the diary, 
which became stained with his blood when he slashed his wrists in an apparent 
suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were forcing me to do it. They wanted to kill my mom and me. I had no 
choice, so they pushed me into it and set me up at the same time. It was like a 
nightmare I'm still trying to wake up from." 
</P>
<P>
 Panah's fear of "them" apparently led him into a confrontation with his 
supervisor at Mervyn's the night before Nicole was slain. The dispute involved 
Panah's refusal to park his car where other employees parked. Calling the 
supervisor a "dictator," he protested that "they" would vandalize his BMW, 
according to the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcript also described the events surrounding Nicole's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Ed Parker, said Nicole had been "play-acting" in the courtyard of 
the apartment complex where he lived, while her older brother, Casey, played 
with a remote-controlled car. Later, she played with a ball and baseball mitt 
while Parker did laundry and emptied the trash. He began a door-to-door search 
when she disappeared shortly before noon on Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah denied he had seen Nicole when Parker knocked on his door about 1 p.m. 
Prosecutor Peter Berman told the grand jury he believes that at that point, 
Nicole had been dead a short time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Panah the next morning as he wandered the streets near a 
friend's West Hills apartment, dazed by an overdose of over-the-counter 
sleeping pills he'd shoplifted in an apparent suicide attempt -- his second 
after Nicole's death. He'd slashed his wrists, but those cuts were superficial, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the friend, Rauni Campbell, a co-worker, that he'd done something 
terrible. She asked him if it had to do with the missing child, and he said 
yes. Panah also told her the child was dead, said Campbell, who immediately 
called police, according to the transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 10:30 p.m., police found Nicole's body, wrapped in a sheet and curled 
in a suitcase buried under other suitcases and a pile of dirty laundry in 
Panah's closet.

CRA CLOSES OFFICES AFTER DEATH THREATS; NORTH HOLLYWOOD: WORKERS ARE 
TEMPORARILY RELOCATED AS SECURITY MEASURES ARE IMPROVED. BIZARRE CASE INVOLVES 
A HEARSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to death threats that culminated in the arrival of a hearse, the Los 
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency has temporarily closed its North 
Hollywood office and relocated frightened staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, whose efforts to revitalize North Hollywood have been 
controversial for more than a decade, plans to reopen the office on Vineland 
Avenue this week after improving security for the four employees based there, a 
spokesman said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating the bizarre case, which unfolded last month after 
pro- and anti-redevelopment forces clashed in their annual battle for control 
of a citizens panel that wields considerable power over the 740-acre project. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began with a series of telephone calls from a man who criticized the 
agency for erecting "tall buildings" and then threatened to kill Lillian 
Burkenheim, the CRA's North Hollywood project manager, Burkenheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkenheim also began receiving mailed brochures offering burial plots and 
services, she said. Then, a taxi driver arrived saying he had been called to 
pick her up and take her to Forest Lawn Memorial-Park and Mortuary. A limousine 
company called to confirm a reservation that someone had placed in her name for 
the same destination.  
</P>
<P>
 The final straw, Burkenheim said, was when a black hearse pulled up at the 
agency to pick up her body. She said the driver told her someone impersonating 
a paramedic had called the hearse to the scene of the "crime," prompting the 
CRA to close the office March 25, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, this is an attack on the office," Burkenheim said. "A redevelopment 
agency is an agent of change and that can be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA closed down the office over the objections of police detectives, who 
urged officials not to cave in to the harassment, Los Angeles Police Capt. Rick 
Wahler said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's some people in the neighborhood who don't like the CRA and this gives 
them a little victory," Wahler said.  
</P>
<P>
 But CRA Administrator Ed Avila said he decided to take the unprecedented step 
out of concern for his employees. He said he is meeting with Wahler today to 
further discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila said among the security measures the CRA is installing in the North 
Hollywood office are an intercom system and a large glass window in the 
now-windowless building so employees can see anyone approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents and supporters of the redevelopment project condemned the death 
threats as the act of an irrational person. But both groups agreed that the 
threats probably arose out of last month's bitter election battle for 14 seats 
on a citizens advisory panel, known as the Project Advisory Committee or PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 That election resulted in a tie for two crucial seats on the 25-member board, 
so its final outcome will be decided Tuesday by the other 23 board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens panel has had a long history of confrontations, which have 
resulted in rancorous meetings and on at least one occasion erupted into a 
fistfight at a public meeting. Anti-redevelopment forces on the panel have 
accused the CRA of catering to developers and wasting taxpayer money, while 
supporters say the agency has provided housing and new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're shocked about the threats, but not terribly surprised," said James 
Mahfet, executive director of the North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, who is a 
PAC member and redevelopment supporter. "There has been an emotionally charged 
atmosphere of hostility for years."  
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Weller, a PAC member and longtime opponent of redevelopment, also 
attributed the threats to the project's acrimonious history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying anybody should do this," Weller said, "but people are very 
angry over redevelopment."

A SHAKY DRILL; ' WE HAD TO KEEP TELLING THEM THIS WAS EARTHQUAKE PRACTICE, 
PRACTICE, PRACTICE. ' FANNIE HUMPHERY, PRINCIPAL AT MARTIN LUTHER KING 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL; SAFETY: VALLEY SCHOOLS PARTICIPATE BUT SCALE BACK ON A 
STATEWIDE EARTHQUAKE EXERCISE. SOME STUDENTS ARE STILL FRIGHTENED. 
</P>

<P>
 With many memories still fresh of the devastating 6.8-magnitude Northridge 
earthquake, hundreds of thousands of students dropped under their desks Tuesday 
morning and covered their heads in a statewide earthquake drill. 
</P>
<P>
 Though regarded as a necessary precaution, the exercise was seen by some as 
too frightening for many children. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the drill, held to kick off the state Earthquake Preparedness 
Month, was scaled back significantly in parts of Southern California, such as 
the San Fernando Valley where the Jan. 17 quake hit hardest. About 1.5 million 
students, teachers and administrators participated in Tuesday's event. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, where 76 schools suffered severe 
earthquake damage, most principals said they told teachers to talk about the 
drill and to remind students that it was a practice. Plans for elaborate drills 
that included having students and staff pretend to be injured, dead and missing 
were scrapped at most schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some elementary students still were frightened by the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teacher said, 'Drop,' and it scared me," said Jill Slevin, a 9-year-old 
third-grader who attends Van Gogh Street Elementary School in Granada Hills. 
"All of a sudden, we had to get under our desks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Gogh students, who are attending school at a nearby campus because the 
Van Gogh site remains closed due to earthquake damage, left their portable 
classrooms and sat in groups on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids have been so traumatized," said Barbara Ramsey, a school 
psychologist at Van Gogh. "They're out of their school and some are out of 
their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Andrews, director of the state office of emergency services, said the 
drills are necessary to prepare students and staff in the event an earthquake 
hits during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 quake, it has special meaning," 
Andrews said at a press conference at Danube Avenue Elementary in Granada 
Hills, which suffered $1 million in quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gogh Principal Maureen Diekmann, who said she did not want to put students 
and teachers through an extensive drill, said she also believes the students 
need to be prepared for another quake. "We just felt it was better to go 
through the drill so they know the process but not to elaborate on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles school district plans to re-evaluate its emergency plans, 
including its communications systems between schools and offices. The drill was 
intended to prepare students and staff at local schools but also to help 
officials upgrade districtwide plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At El Camino Real High in Woodland Hills, which was closed for about six weeks 
and where classroom walls shook loose, administrators chose to hold a more 
extensive drill. Students pretended to be missing and others pretended to be 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was taken very seriously," said Joyce Washington, the principal at El 
Camino. "I think the youngsters know the consequences because they have lived 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The drop drill -- typically the brunt of jokes among some teen-agers -- took 
on a serious tone at Audubon Middle School in the Crenshaw District as most 
youths said the vision of fallen debris and ceiling tiles in their classrooms 
was still fresh on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time I made sure my head was covered and I held onto the leg of my 
desk," said Akillah Dunn, 14. "I got away from glass. I don't want anything to 
fall on my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Audubon was among the hardest-hit campuses outside of the San Fernando Valley, 
suffering severe water damage when ceiling pipes burst, flooding two stories of 
classrooms, destroying thousands of textbooks and library books and causing 
soaked ceiling tiles to fall to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Cedric King boasted that the entire 1,700-member student 
body evacuated to the playing field in a record eight minutes. "No problems 
with stragglers. No problems with kids running around," he said as he carried a 
thick file of rosters, evacuation plans and a walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby Martin Luther King Elementary School, Principal Fannie Humphery said 
she had to take extra care to explain that the drill was neither a real 
earthquake nor a "code blue" alarm, in which students run for safety because of 
crime activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there are police helicopters overhead we clear the playground," Humphery 
said. "There have been incidents where suspects run through campus. We had to 
keep telling them this was earthquake practice, practice, practice." 
</P>
<P>
 At Sulphur Springs Elementary School in Canyon Country, which has been 
emphasizing earthquake preparedness for more than a decade, students had 
intended to present Mayor George Pederson with a book of their experiences 
during the January quake and to sing a song about earthquake preparation. The 
mayor was a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson said later he "forgot" about the drill, but went to the school later 
and the students re-enacted the drill for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Low, who showed up to watch her daughter Tracey, 6, practice the drill, 
said her daughter's enthusiasm for being prepared prompted her to put together 
a quake preparedness kit for her own home.

 "She made me feel pretty guilty," Low said. "She came home and told me we 
needed to be prepared and asked me whether I had an earthquake kit." 
</P>
<P>
 Low said her daughter has displayed little fear of earthquakes and attributed 
her confidence to the skills she has learned at school. "She's not scared 
anymore," Low said. "She told me she feels safer here (at school) than at 
home."

<P>
 An Amtrak passenger train clipped a truck parked too close to the tracks at a 
railroad crossing on Balboa Boulevard in Van Nuys on Tuesday morning, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck was hit about 10:40 a.m. by the Coast Starlight, which runs between 
Los Angeles and Seattle, said an unidentified company spokesman in 
Philadelphia. No one was injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was delayed 22 minutes at the scene, he said. Before the accident, 
it had left Los Angeles' Union Station at 9:55 a.m., with one stop in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens between 15 and 20 times a year all around the nation," he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; TWO HOUSING PROJECTS GET ZONING OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Bel-Air developer is one step closer to getting two housing projects off the 
ground in Sylmar, after months of contention with residents who want to 
maintain the rustic flavor of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Commission recently approved requests by Mark 
Armbruster to change the zoning for Dronfield Avenue from Bledsoe to Tyler 
streets, and Foothill Boulevard east of Glenoaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes allow Armbruster to seek approval to build 91 single-family houses 
and duplexes in the areas, and open the door for future developers to put up 
condominium-style buildings. The commission's approval of the zoning change, 
however, is not official until the Los Angeles City Council gives its OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he can begin construction, Armbruster must submit building plans to the 
Los Angeles Building and Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer won the support of many residents living near the five-acre 
Foothill Boulevard project site -- the former location of Cacho's Nursery -- 
after agreeing in February to reduce the number of single-family houses and 
duplexes from 84 to 67. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Armbruster and people living near the Dronfield Avenue site never 
completely saw eye to eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the area were unwilling to accept any zoning changes, while Armbruster 
was reluctant to reduce the number of single-family houses he hoped to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm satisfied with the way the Foothill Boulevard property turned out," 
Armbruster said. "I'm not totally satisfied with Dronfield. I wish we could 
have reached an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 To the dissatisfaction of almost everyone involved, the Planning Commission on 
March 24 cleared the way for Armbruster to build 24 houses -- instead of the 36 
he expected -- in one of the last remaining equestrian enclaves in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not compatible with the neighborhood," said Gwen Allen, the owner 
of a one-acre property next to Armbruster's who expects to appeal the 
commission's decision. "We're totally opposed to the zone change." VIVIEN LOU

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; ALCOHOL PERMIT FOR MINI-MALL PATIO OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals granted a popular mini-mall permission 
to serve alcohol in an open-air patio Tuesday, over objections by area 
homeowners that the mall lacks sufficient parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The board granted the permit to the Laurel Promenade, at the corner of Ventura 
and Laurel Canyon boulevards, after its developer submitted a new parking plan 
that improves circulation in the parking lot and encourages people to use an 
underground lot on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit is good for one year, after which it will have to undergo a review. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't consider the facts in making this decision," said Tony Lucente, 
president of the Studio City Residents Assn., who opposed the permit. "An 
intensification of the use is going to exacerbate an already impossible 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents want to patronize the shopping center -- which includes the 
Daily Grill, Louise's Trattoria and the Gaucho Grill -- but are fed up with the 
parking problems, Lucente said. He predicted that the association would appeal 
the board's decision to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy, although we were hoping for a grant longer than a year," said Tom 
O'Brien, planning consultant for the developer, the Laurel Center Group. 
O'Brien said representatives from the Laurel Center Group will meet with 
homeowners and staff from City Councilman Joel Wachs' office to see if they 
further adjust the parking plan to resolve residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer filed for the conditional use permit to serve alcohol on the 
patio in October. The board's decision is a reversal of a Feb. 9, 1994, 
decision by a city zoning administrator to deny the Laurel Group's application 
based on concerns about insufficient parking. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; FINAL CANDIDATES' FORUM SET TONIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents will have a final chance to listen to San Fernando City Council 
candidates state their platforms during a forum on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum, which will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Santa Rosa Church Hall, 667 
Workman St., in San Fernando, is part of an effort to introduce the candidates 
to more people, said Virginia Barragan, chairwoman of the San Fernando 
Residents Council, the local branch of Valley Organized In Community Efforts, 
or VOICE, which is sponsoring the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Two earlier events, sponsored on March 9 by the San Fernando Chamber of 
Commerce, were not attended by enough residents, Barragan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum, intended for local business leaders, was held in the 
afternoon at the Odyssey Restaurant in Granada Hills. The second, intended for 
the public, was held in the San Fernando City Council Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (other meetings) were not well publicized," Barragan said. "There weren't 
enough people, and they didn't ask enough questions. We want more people to 
learn about the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Three at-large seats are open in the election, to be held April 12. The 
candidates are Dan Acuna, John Becker, Joanne Baltierrez, Raul Godinez, Ed 
Guzman, Jose Hernandez, Arthur Kay and Doude Wysbeek. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR WATCH GROUP

<P>
 A new anti-crime surveillance group in Van Nuys is recruiting volunteers to be 
the eyes and ears of the Los Angeles Police Department and help catch taggers, 
drug dealers and other street criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Called W.A.T.C.H. (We Are The Community Helpers), the group is a 
non-confrontational coalition of concerned residents who spy on criminal 
activity from rooftops, cars and other unseen locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are trained by officers in the department's Van Nuys Division, who 
teach them how to report suspicious activity. Recruits are screened by the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the group conducted its first surveillance along Sherman Way. 
According to Larry Hanna, president of the 40-member group, 30 members slipped 
into the shadows and tipped police off to two drunk drivers and two suspected 
graffiti taggers carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Future surveillance operations will target crime along Sepulveda Boulevard.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY PLANS TO STASH EMERGENCY SUPPLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas plans to stash emergency supplies in key locations in 
case the town is ever cut off from metropolitan areas during a calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although disaster preparations for the 3-year-old city were discussed before 
the Northridge earthquake, the collapse of several freeways Jan. 17 brought 
into focus how vulnerable Calabasas would be if its lifeline to Los Angeles and 
Thousand Oaks -- the Ventura Freeway -- were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calabasas has only a few exits, which is good in case there is a crime here," 
said Arnold Bresky, designer of the city's innovative safety idea. "But if 
there is a major emergency, we suddenly become an isolated little place." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council gave Bresky preliminary approval March 30 for plans to place 
first aid supplies and other emergency items in six locked, waterproof boxes 
throughout the city. Up to $20,000 for the project will be considered before 
June 30 as part of next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes, said Bresky, would include bandages, antiseptic, splints, 
stretchers and suture equipment, as well as food, water, flashlights, shovels, 
crowbars, generators and hand-held radios. The supplies would be designed to 
carry the city through the first 72 hours of a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Each box also would include names and phone numbers of more than 40 medics in 
Calabasas who already have agreed to be on call during an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bresky, the so-called MASH program (he named it for the Army medical unit) 
is a result of the fend-for-yourself attitude by which this country was made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calabasas is a frontier city, in a way," said the obstetrician/gynecologist 
and community activist. "We have to live up to Ralph Waldo Emerson's idea of 
self-reliance. We have to take care of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Few other cities have undertaken such disaster preparedness. One that has is 
Santa Fe Springs, which recently won an award from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency for its system of stashed emergency supplies put in place 
after the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had to use them yet, thankfully," said Santa Fe Springs City 
Manager Donald Powell. "But having the equipment there gives a sense of 
security. You never know when somebody's going to get trapped in a house in 
some disaster, and regular people are going to have to do some digging." KURT 
PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; BANK HEEDS CITY ORDER TO TAKE DOWN POLE SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bank's pole-mounted sign was plucked like a weed from alongside the Ventura 
Freeway in Agoura Hills on Tuesday, leaving the city with one fewer of the 
towering advertisements overwhelmingly banned by voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Federal Bank removed its 35-foot pole sign on the southeast corner of 
Kanan Road and Roadside Drive after the city last month ordered it taken down 
within 30 days. The bank was told to remove the sign because the building has 
been unused since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen business owners have razed their pole signs during the past year or 
so, city planners said, but 30 of the unwanted advertisements still stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this will start other businesses complying with our ordinance," 
said Agoura Hills Councilwoman Fran Pavley. "I know the residents are eagerly 
looking forward to the signs coming down." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Union Federal closed its branch in Agoura Hills in 1993, the sign was 
left on the leased property as a plug to freeway motorists as well as a display 
of the time and temperature, said Steve Ramsay, spokesman for the Brea-based 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that the city has dictated to us to remove the sign," Ramsey 
said. "We felt it was providing a community service with the time and 
temperature visible from the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctance to remove the offending signs, some of which are nearly 100 feet 
tall, is nearly universal among merchants, who are required to do so at their 
own cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The city in February denied requests from 13 business owners who wanted to 
keep their signs despite a ban on them upheld by 75% of voters in November. The 
13 raised an unprecedented $100,000 to fight the city's ban over the past two 
years. They and other sign owners will be sent notices next month ordering them 
to remove their pole signs, said City Atty. Greg Stepanicich. 
</P>
<P>
 No deadline for their removal has been set, Stepanicich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills outlawed the lollipop-style signs in 1985 on grounds that they 
wreck the view of the Santa Monica Mountains on the south side of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The law took effect two years ago, touching off a political brawl between some 
of the sign owners and the city. KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DEBATE CANCELED ON SCHOOL BOND ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A debate matching two vocal opponents of the $100-million school bond measure 
on the April 12 ballot against two equally vocal supporters that had been 
scheduled tonight has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," said Burbank Board of Education member Denise Lioy 
Wilcox, who would have been one of the debaters for the televised forum. "It 
was going to be our opportunity to prove to the public that our numbers are 
sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted McConkey, a leader of a homeowners group who would have substituted for 
one of the original debaters, was equally disappointed, but for other reasons. 
"Nobody knows what the school bond will cost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox and Burbank Councilman Dave Golonski had agreed last week to debate Dr. 
S. Michael Stavropolous, a former school board candidate, and Joel Schlossman, 
a former Burbank City Council candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stavropolous was called out of the country on a family emergency, and McConkey 
had been prepared to step in to replace him, McConkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a weekend meeting, plans for the debate, which would have been 
televised on a local cable television station, began to fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it important to have a presentation -- prior to the debate -- a 
factual presentation about the bond issue," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But McConkey objected to what he saw as a one-sided, 20-minute presentation, 
which he would not have been given equal time to rebut. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was absolutely silly," McConkey said. "I'd never heard of a debate like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 With planning for the debate at an impasse, McConkey said he thought the idea 
was dead. But on Monday, Golonski and Wilcox made a counteroffer, eliminating 
the need for a pre-debate presentation and giving each speaker more time for 
opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 However, McConkey said that because he believed that the debate had already 
been canceled, he lost two days he would have used to prepare for the forum. 
Without that preparation time, he said he could not accept his opponents' 
compromise offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not acting in good faith," Schlossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he will continue to oppose the bond measure by speaking out at 
meetings and talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable that the bond will not pass," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond money will be used to rebuild Burbank public schools, if the measure 
is approved. It needs two-thirds voter approval to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said it would be difficult for her to predict the election's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we have a good solid base of support out there," she said. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; CLASSES TO RESUME AT RECREATION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WILLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mobile restaurant that supplied food for American Red Cross volunteers who 
worked at the Winnetka Recreation Center helping Northridge earthquake victims 
made its final stop last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The last portable toilet was hauled away earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, guitar strumming, piano playing and tap dancing will return to the 
center, 8401 Winnetka Ave., which had served as a Disaster Assistance Center 
since the Jan. 17 temblor rocked Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, area residents received in the mail a spring class schedule and 
registration guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're letting people know that we're here and we're trying to get back to 
full swing," said Ed Laakso, center manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winnetka center was the last in the San Fernando Valley to offer Red Cross 
assistance. It opened in February after the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
left the center and the Red Cross contracted with the city of Los Angeles to 
move its headquarters there from a tent near Northridge Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 For a month after the quake, a tent city took up more than half of the 
center's 15-acre athletic field. Fax machines, a separate phone system and even 
a rooftop satellite dish transformed much of the center into a high-technology 
relief site.  
</P>
<P>
 Laakso canceled all classes, sports clinics and, for a time, the senior 
citizens program to accommodate the various relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were more or less here to assist (the agencies) in any way we could," 
Laakso said. 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball league, under way before the quake hit, was moved to Lanark 
Recreation Center in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The one program that continued at the center was the three-day-a-week 
preschool. Laakso thought it was important not to disrupt the routine for the 
children, who range in age from 3 1/2 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Laakso posted signs in English and Spanish stating that the Red 
Cross had moved out, he is still fielding questions from people coming to the 
center in search of help. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everybody coming in is checking on their FEMA loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Three to four hundred residents participate in the center's programs each 
week, and a few are beginning to stop by and register for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that the people will come back," Laakso said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just going to take a little time." TERESA WILLIS

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY WORKERS REPORT LOW MORALE IN STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Morale is low among Glendale city employees who face heavy workloads and 
unrealistic expectations in the wake of a hiring freeze, according to a recent 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 city employees from planners to firefighters to librarians 
were asked a variety of questions centering around how well division managers 
operate their departments and relate to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees' answers were used as the basis for suggestions to improve city 
functions given in a "Citywide Organizational Assessment" released this week by 
Woodland Hills-based consultants The Warner Group. 
</P>
<P>
 City expenditures have exceeded revenues for four years, forcing the city to 
institute a hiring freeze and requiring employees to work weekends, holidays 
and overtime to keep up with the workload, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, more than 63% of city employees surveyed said their division 
does not have enough workers to keep up with daily workloads. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Eileen Givens said the city's ratio of employees to residents is 
the lowest in 15 years, requiring city employees to provide the same level of 
service with less staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want more and more services with less and less money. Residents expect 
the same service levels they had five years ago, whether it's trimming palm 
trees or resurfacing streets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that they are concerned by survey results that show 45% of city 
employees don't feel they are an important part of the organization and that 
47% of the employees said city divisions do not work together to solve 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Larry Zarian said problems with morale and heavy workloads can be 
addressed in part by opening up communication among division managers and 
employees. Zarian said he and city administrators have been meeting with 
employees to hear their concerns for the past several months. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; BUSINESS GROUP WAITS FOR BOOST FROM CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Downtown Burbank Stakeholders Assn. has been able to stretch its budget -- 
which would have run out in April -- until the City Council votes next month on 
whether to set up a business improvement district, Executive Director Gwen 
Pentecost said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, made up of local business leaders and property owners, hopes the 
district will help revitalize downtown Burbank by using a special tax 
assessment to fund special services and promotions to boost business. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding was to have run out next Tuesday, Pentecost said. About $6,700 was 
saved because Pentecost's health insurance was not as expensive as expected and 
she also took an unpaid week of vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to account for every nickel," said Pentecost, who has worked with the 
city redevelopment agency to stretch the budget. The City Council was scheduled 
to vote on the district April 19 after a special hearing, but that was pushed 
back to May 3. 
</P>
<P>
 A more important task for Pentecost is gathering support behind the 
improvement district. If there are objections from a majority of those who 
would be required to pay fees to run the district, it could not legally be 
formed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary figures, the district may cost each business 60 cents 
per square foot of space plus one-quarter of 1% of annual gross sales, 
Pentecost said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district would include about 100 downtown businesses that are on the 
street level and rely on walk-in business. Downtown firms that do not rely on 
street-level business would be excluded. ED BOND

BRADY BACKS ROBERTI AS 'REFERENDUM ON GUN VIOLENCE' NEARS; POLITICS: EX-REAGAN 
AIDE SAYS A VOTE FOR THE SENATOR WILL 'SAVE LIVES.' RECALL ELECTION IS BEING 
WATCHED NATIONWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. David Roberti, heading into the final week of his battle against a 
recall election heavily influenced by gun enthusiasts, received a testimonial 
from ex-presidential press secretary James Brady, who was crippled in an 
assassination attempt against President Reagan in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Roberti's foes at a competing press conference charged that 
Roberti's liberalism, not guns, is to blame for violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beating this recall should be the most effective way to send a message to the 
evil empire" of the public's desire for stronger gun control measures, Brady 
said later as he sat in his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, scriptwriter Allan Pell, who lives near the Van Nuys residence that 
Roberti calls home for legal reasons, urged the senator to come live in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear shots at night, and see drugs deals go down in the parking lot over 
there," Pell said, pointing out the sights along tawdry Victory Boulevard. 
"It's a war zone and Roberti has done nothing about crime, except talk about 
gun control." 
</P>
<P>
 Next Tuesday, voters will go to the polls to decide Roberti's fate in a recall 
election that's being closely watched nationwide as a referendum on gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder reported Tuesday that 
Roberti has received a total of $34,750 in contributions from 26 donors who 
each gave $1,000 or more since March 27. All contributions of $1,000 or more 
received after March 27 must be reported within 24 hours. No large 
contributions were reported received by the anti-Roberti forces. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's news conference at Reseda High School, Roberti was flanked by 
Brady and by nearly a dozen victims rights advocates and relatives of shooting 
victims who urged voters to defeat the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those present was Margaret Ensley, the mother of Michael Ensley, who was 
shot and killed at Reseda High in February, 1993, with a .22-caliber derringer; 
and Ken Brondell Jr., the brother of LAPD Officer Christy Hamilton, who was 
killed last month in a shootout in Northridge by a teen-ager wielding an AR-15 
military-style semiautomatic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The AR-15 is one of the guns covered by Roberti's 1989 weapons ban. The state 
senator has claimed the recall is the work of "assault weapons extremists" 
seeking revenge because of his authorship of the 1989 ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, who is confined to a wheelchair and speaks slowly because of the 
massive head injuries he suffered in the 1981 attack on Reagan, said he is 
particularly concerned about assault weapons. "If John Hinckley (the man who 
shot Brady and Reagan) had had an Uzi or a Tech-9 (two assault weapons) I know 
I wouldn't be here today," Brady said. Hinckley used a .22-caliber pistol.  
</P>
<P>
 "Your vote Tuesday for the senator will reduce the senseless gun violence and 
save lives," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 During questioning, Roberti said he voted Monday evening, as chairman of the 
state Senate Judiciary Committee, for a measure to require people to be 
licensed before they could own a handgun or buy ammunition. "We license people 
to drive and for almost everything else," Roberti said. "One should know how to 
use these things (guns) before they buy them." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, authored by state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), would 
require people to complete a firearms safety program before they could own a 
handgun. The license would be valid for only four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti predicted tough sailing on the Senate floor for the Hart measure. 
Legislators are intimidated by the gun lobby, and that intimidation includes 
the threat of having to face a recall, Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's scared to death of the gun lobby," Roberti said. "But if we beat 
the recall and beat it bad, then maybe (lawmakers who support the gun lobby) 
will have the fear in their hearts that maybe they could lose an election if 
they keep voting for the gun lobby." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady's wife, Sarah, the head of Handgun Control Inc., was in California last 
month to do a fund-raiser for Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, James Brady was the guest speaker at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser at 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for the embattled senator that was hosted by 
former Sen. Mike Roos. About two dozen people attended the event. Roos 
co-authored the 1989 assault weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, the anti-Roberti forces tried to steer the debate away from 
guns and back to crime, their favorite issue, at a news conference of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Featured there were Pell and Mary Lou Holte, a Van Nuys community activist. 
The pair blasted Roberti as a remote and ineffectual legislator who has 
preferred to attack guns, rather than criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get the debate back onto crime control and what Roberti hasn't 
done in this area," said Holte, who says the only weapon she owns is a green 
spray paint can which she says she will spray on criminals to help identify 
them for police. "Like me, not everybody who wants to get rid of Roberti is a 
gun-toter." 
</P>
<P>
 Pell speculated that Roberti might take a tougher stand on crime if he had to 
live in his own district. In fact, Roberti lives outside the district, in the 
Los Feliz area, although he rents a home in the district to maintain his 
residency there for voting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Roberti comes out here, he comes in a bullet-proof limousine with 
bodyguards," Pell complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Howard, a spokesman for the recall, also charged that Roberti was out of 
touch, both with his district and with the roots of criminal violence. "The No. 
1 problem in Roberti's district is not assault weapons," Howard said. "His 
assault weapons ban was a fraud. It has done nothing to stop violent crime. The 
problem is not guns, but criminals who get out of prison (before serving their 
full sentences)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Howard continued, a frustrated electorate had to "go around Roberti" 
and resort to an initiative drive to get some action on the "three strikes and 
you're out" issue. Roberti now backs the "three strikes" measure, but critics 
say he arrived at that position only after hundreds of thousands of voters 
signed petitions supporting the tough-minded sentencing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Washburn, another recall leader, said numerous studies confirm the 
weakness of gun control as a way to curb crime. For example, Washburn cited a 
1991 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms survey of imprisoned armed career 
criminals that found that 37% got their guns from off-the-street sales and 34% 
got them through theft or from criminal associates -- none of which was 
regulated by gun control measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn also pointed to California crime statistics that show violent crime 
has steadily increased over the years, including the period 1987 to 1992 which 
straddled the advent of Roberti's gun ban.

ARREST MADE IN SERIES OF STORE ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHAU LAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A series of coincidences helped police arrest a man who they say was 
responsible for about two dozen armed robberies of San Fernando Valley 
businesses, most of them on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas McMann, 37, who police called a transient, was being held at the Van 
Nuys jail and was charged Tuesday with three counts of robbery and one count of 
assault with a deadly weapon for robbing three merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims said the robber would brandish a gun and, after taking the cash, would 
force them to lie on the floor. He has never been seen leaving the shops and no 
one has been injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities first learned of his identity Friday when a woman visiting the Los 
Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division on other business happened to 
see a composite drawing of the robber and identified him as McMann to the desk 
officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The desk officer, Ken Knox, did a computer check and found that police had 
briefly held McMann for several days at the beginning of March for an unrelated 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after McMann was identified, police said, Knox spotted him walking 
along Roscoe Boulevard near Louise Avenue in Van Nuys. Knox arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 McMann is being held in lieu of $300,000 bail. If convicted, he faces a 
maximum sentence of 14 years in jail, according to the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office. At the time of the arrest, McMann said he lived 
with his parents in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional charges may be filed against McMann if more victims identify him as 
the armed robber. So far eight victims could not positively identify McMann as 
the armed robber, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMann also is being investigated by authorities in San Diego County, where 
more than a dozen armed robberies committed in early March resemble the Ventura 
Boulevard holdups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested (in this case) because there appears to be some 
similarities in the method of commission of the crimes," said Sgt. Rick Sing of 
Oceanside Police Department, where the bulk of the robberies occurred. "Whether 
or not this is the same person, it remains to be seen."

VALLEY BRIEFING: CATHOLIC PROFILE; RELIGIOUS GROUP NEARS 200TH ANNIVERSARY IN 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Roman Catholic Archdiocese is the nation's most populous. 
Because of its size, it was divided into five pastoral regions in 1987 with 
Auxiliary Bishop Armando X. Ochoa named to head the San Fernando region. Ochoa 
is the only bishop of the original five auxiliaries who still heads a regional 
post. From his office at the region's historic mission complex in Mission 
Hills, Ochoa has oversight over 48 parishes -- mostly in the San Fernando 
Valley, but stretching north to the Kern County line, west to the Ventura 
County line and as far south as Echo Park and Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable Valley parishes included the 1,200-seat St. John Baptist de la Salle 
in Granada Hills, the parish with the largest seating capacity in the region. 
The church serving the most parishioners (10,000 every weekend) is Santa Rosa 
in San Fernando. The newest parish, which opened in 1987, is Blessed Junipero 
Serra in Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Population 
</P>
<P>
 The total Catholic population in the archdiocese, which includes Los Angeles, 
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, is put officially at 3.5 million, although 
some estimates run as high as 4.5 million due to the influx of undocumented 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando region has 48 parishes, or 17% of the archdiocesan parish 
total. But the 22,953 students at 58 parochial and private schools in the San 
Fernando region represent 23% of the students at Catholic-run elementary and 
secondary schools in the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic School Ethnicity 
</P>
<P>
 White: 49%  
</P>
<P>
 Latino: 30% 
</P>
<P>
 Asian: 19%  
</P>
<P>
 African Americans: 1%  
</P>
<P>
 American Indian: 1%  
</P>
<P>
 What Catholics Say 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of adults in the San Fernando Valley surveyed by the Times poll 
in December, 1991, said they were raised Catholic. But only 28% said they are 
now Catholic. Nevertheless, Catholics represent the largest single denomination 
in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 They are more frequent churchgoers than Protestants -- 48% of Catholics 
surveyed said they attended a religious service in the previous week; 42% of 
Protestant residents said they had.  
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Upbringing % of Valley adults raised as Catholic: 40% 
</P>
<P>
 % who consider themselves Catholic now: 28% Mission History 
</P>
<P>
 For 200 years the historical focal point for San Fernando Valley-area 
Catholics has been the San Fernando Mission. Established in 1797, it was the 
17th of the 21 founded by Franciscan priests in what would become the state of 
California. Its founder, Father Fermin Lasuen, dedicated the mission to San 
Fernando, king of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 The first permanent church at the mission was completed in 1806, but it had to 
be completely rebuilt after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A more familiar sight to motorists traveling by the mission complex at 15151 
San Fernando Mission Blvd., however, is the long convento building with its 
series of 20 arches close to the street. The building was completed in 1822. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission grounds also house the archdiocese's high school seminary, where 
young men consider further study for the priesthood; the offices of Bishop 
Ochoa and, for an extended period, the temporary home of Alemany High School, 
whose buildings were seriously damaged in the recent Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake Damage Parishes 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake has forced nine of the region's 48 parishes out of 
their regular worship halls and into parish halls or temporary structures for 
Masses. "There has been a silver lining to all this, " the bishop said. "It 
really builds up a sense of community when people have the experience of 
attending Mass in makeshift quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 At least four church towers in the Valley have had to be reduced during 
repairs to prevent damaged sections from falling, Ochoa said. Ochoa said that 
Cardinal Mahony's half-humorous admonition on future church construction plans 
is "Don't even think in terms of towers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Armando X. Ochoa Born in Oxnard in 1943, Ochoa attended Ventura 
Community College for a year before entering St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. 
He was ordained to the priesthood in 1970. He was serving as pastor of Sacred 
Heart Parish in Los Angeles when he was named auxiliary bishop in 1987.

DAMAGE FROM FIRE PUT AT $150,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire that may have started in an upstairs bedroom Tuesday destroyed three 
rooms in a three-story home and caused at least $150,000 damage to the 
structure and its contents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 firefighters fought the blaze in the 39900 block of Golfers Drive for 
about 20 minutes before bringing it under control, said Inspector Robert 
Brandelli of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which began about 11:20 a.m., destroyed two upstairs bedrooms and 
the attic above them, he said. The cause was under investigation, Brandelli 
added.

 9-YEAR-OLD, PARENTS WILL NOT BE CHARGED IN SHOOTING OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The district attorney's office won't file charges against a 9-year-old boy who 
shot a 14-year-old in the face with his parents' rifle Saturday or against the 
youth's parents for allowing the weapon to be accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty.Dan Damon said the shooting is believed to have been 
accidental, but the father of the 9-year-old may face a charge of possessing a 
firearm in violation of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of the shooting victim, Matthew Escarcega, was upgraded to good 
on Tuesday at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital. The bullet from the 
.22-caliber semiautomatic rifle struck him in the jaw and stuck in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Escarcega was visiting the 9-year-old's home on Walnut Springs Avenue in 
Canyon Country when the incident occurred Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies were told two versions of what happened in the shooting, said 
Detective Jerry Johnson of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old initially said he heard a noise and fired the weapon at 
Escarcega, thinking the teen-ager was an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
 He later said he had ejected a cartridge from the gun and thought it was 
unloaded when he pointed it at Escarcega and pulled the trigger. The youngster 
said he asked Escarcega to leave the residence because his mother was due to 
arrive and he believed she might be upset if too many friends were in the 
house, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are not releasing the name of the younger boy because of his age.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEIGHBORS OPPOSE PLANS FOR COMPOSTING FACILITY 
NEAR HOMES; ENVIRONMENT: REMAINS OF HUMAN AND INDUSTRIAL WASTE WOULD BE USED. 
CONCERN IS VOICED OVER WATER QUALITY AND WHAT MIGHT BE DISPERSED DURING 
WINDSTORMS.

 "It stinks like hell." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the bottom line for Antelope Acres resident Domenico Arcuri, who, along 
with many of his neighbors, opposes a plan by a Maryland company to turn the 
treated remains of human and industrial waste into compost at an outdoor 
facility near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for 27 years and it's just terrible. It's sickening," Arcuri 
said. "It's just something we can't take." 
</P>
<P>
 The smell isn't the only -- or primary -- concern of residents, who also fear 
the effects the sludge could have on the area's ground water and what might 
blow off the compost piles during the high desert's notorious windstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many unanswered questions," said Virginia Stout, a resident of 
rural Antelope Acres, the community closest to the proposed composting 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Antelope Valley residents, most of whom live in the remote community of 
Antelope Acres, are planning to appear before the county Board of Supervisors 
on Thursday to fight the composting proposal by Bio Gro Systems Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 The Regional Planning Commission in December granted the conditional use 
permit that Bio Gro needs to build the composting facility. That approval, 
however, was appealed by the Antelope Acres Town Council, an elected body that 
has no legal authority. The supervisors will decide whether to uphold the 
Planning Commission's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't something that's very compatible and in the best interest of our 
people," said Judy Fuentes, town council secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Bio Gro wants to use 67 acres of its 640-acre ranch in the western Antelope 
Valley for the composting facility. As much as 500 tons per day of sludge from 
waste treatment plants in the city of Los Angeles would be trucked to the 
ranch, located near the Kern County border off Avenue A and 140th Street West. 
</P>
<P>
 The sludge, which Bio Gro refers to as "biosolids," would be mixed with green 
waste such as sawdust, yard clippings and almond hulls to begin the process 
that will result in soil-enriching compost for home gardens and farms, said Bio 
Gro representative Linda Novick. 
</P>
<P>
 Sludge is not a new import to the Antelope Valley. Since late 1990, Bio Gro 
has been hauling Los Angeles sludge to its ranch, where it injects the pungent 
material into the ground, or spreads it on the surface then churns it into the 
earth, on land that is later planted with alfalfa and barley.  
</P>
<P>
 The permit approved in 1990 by the state Regional Water Quality Control Board 
for the sludge operation already under way allows up to 100 tons a day of the 
waste to be dumped at the ranch several miles west of Lancaster.

 Novick said the sludge is brought to Bio Gro's ranch only a few months a year, 
before the planting season. 
</P>
<P>
 The composting facility, however, will be a year-round operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families living right across from the facility are already suffering from the 
odors," said local environmentalist Stormy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The composting facility was approved by the state water board in March, 1993. 
In addition to the conditional use permit from the county, the facility also 
needs approval from the state Integrated Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents fear the area's high winds, which exceed 60 m.p.h. at times, will 
blow material off the ranch and into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "To start a big sludge facility above the ground in this area is just awful," 
Williams said. "I don't care how damp it is. It's going to move when we have 
winds." 
</P>
<P>
 Novick said Bio Gro is aware of the area's winds and has designed its 
composting facility around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents cited the $50-million, fully enclosed composting plant recently 
opened by the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District as an example of what 
should be done in the windy Antelope Valley. But that indoor plant, Novick 
said, has far less capacity than Bio Gro's proposed outdoor facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Any pathogens in the sludge and green waste, she said, will be killed during 
the composting process, when the materials reach temperatures of 130 to 160 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are also concerned about possible contamination of ground water from 
the composting. In Antelope Acres, the 1,000 or so residents rely exclusively 
on ground water for their drinking, cooking and landscaping needs, said Richard 
McLemore, town council president. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers in the area said 100-pound bags of onions have floated across the Bio 
Gro property in past winters when heavy rains caused severe flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think our facility is not going to have any effect on water quality at 
all," Novick said. The composting will be done on a 30-acre paved area that 
will be next to a seven-acre, lined pond that will collect any runoff water. In 
addition, ground water monitoring wells will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 The reassurances from Bio Gro have done little, if anything, to relieve the 
concerns of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's other ways to deal with sludge other than in this way in this place," 
Stout said.

WILL IRVINE BE JAZZED ABOUT 3-DAY OUTDOOR FESTIVAL?; CONCERTS: ORGANIZERS OF 
THE FIRST-TIME EVENT, SCHEDULED FOR MAY 6-8, SAY THE MAIN GOAL IS TO OFFER 
NATIONAL ACTS WHILE KEEPING TICKET PRICES DOWN.

 Richard Elliot, Keiko Matsui and Everette Harp will headline a three-day jazz 
festival to be held Mother's Day weekend, May 6 to 8, on two outdoor stages at 
the Koll Center North office complex, festival organizers announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Jazz Festival, a first-time event, will feature a mix 
of national and local acts on two stages, including performances by 1 + One 
(with Patrice Rushen and Ndugu Chancler), John Patitucci, Kilauea, Birds of a 
Feather (with Dan Siegel and Boney James), A.J. Croce, Brian Bromberg, Rob 
Mullins, Richard Smith, Nino Tempo, Pocket Change, Sonya Jason, Tony Guerrero 
and the Nedra Wheeler Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizer Rich Sherman acknowledged that the three-day festival is ambitious 
for a first-time event, but said he expects the event to make money and help 
build an audience for future editions of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The main goal was to offer national acts while keeping ticket prices down, 
Sherman said. Advance tickets for all three days are $20, with single-day 
tickets priced at $10 (at the gate, prices are $25 and $12, respectively). 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that we couldn't jump into the $25-a-day festival market," Sherman 
said. "We're looking pretty good if we can draw 15,000 to 20,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the next Playboy Jazz Festival, June 18 and 19 at the Hollywood 
Bowl, range from $10 to $27.50 per day. On the other hand, tickets are $10 per 
day for the upcoming 25th annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage festival. That 
11-day event, which draws in excess of 300,000 visitors, boasts dozens of the 
biggest names in jazz, blues, rock, country, gospel, folk and ethnic music. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers Sherman and Eric Jensen of Ritz Entertainment were among the 
promoters of last year's Orange County Blues Festival in Dana Point, which was 
initially termed a success after drawing some 30,000 spectators with no arrests 
or other major incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, however, homeowners near the Heritage Park location organized to 
protest the noise and crowds, and promoters revealed that the event was a 
financial bust. Dozens of creditors complained they had not been paid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman said that he and Jensen had been hired as marketers for last year's 
blues event, but are part-owners this year and will be taking a larger role in 
organizing the festival. Most of the creditors have accepted partial payments 
on their debts, he said, with the balance to be paid from the proceeds of this 
year's event, planned for Sept. 30 and Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are still negotiating for a new location for this year's festival, 
still in Dana Point but farther from residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing that we learned is that you can't force an event into a 
location, as we did there," Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman and Jensen also are organizing a country music festival, to be held in 
conjunction with August's Rancho Days rodeo in San Juan Capistrano. Festival 
information: (714) 645-1999. Tickets: (714) 740-2000 (Ticketmaster).

MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; A GRADE NOTION; PIANIST ROBERT THIES FOLLOWS AN ACADEMIC 
PATH TOWARD HIS CAREER GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-three-year-old pianist Robert Thies is taking a cautious approach to 
building a career. He is staying in school, trying to make local contacts and 
venturing out only occasionally for concerts. One such occasion comes Sunday, 
when he'll be the soloist in Beethoven's Second Concerto with Ami Porat and the 
Mozart Camerata in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the college decision -- which university or conservatory to attend 
-- was a big issue," Thies said in a recent phone interview from his Los 
Angeles apartment. "I chose L.A. and USC because I had already started making 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secondly, while I was in school, I could try to look for work, studio work. 
There definitely was a practical side to it, as opposed to going to Eastman 
(School of Music in Rochester, N.Y.), where I was also accepted. My chances out 
here are a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Thies was born in Neptune, N.J., but moved periodically as his father, a 
planning consultant for Atlantic Richfield, was transferred to different job 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legend has it," he said with a self-deprecating laugh, "that when I was 3 or 
4 I was figuring out songs by ear on the piano. I don't remember it. My mom 
decided to throw me into piano lessons when I was about 5." 
</P>
<P>
 He started taking lessons when the family lived in Thousand Oaks, but he found 
it hard to stick with any one teacher as the family moved about. However, when 
the family moved back to California about 12 years ago, he began studying 
regularly with Robert Turner in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "He laid a good foundation for me," Thies said. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional career wasn't always his intention. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I went through my giving-Mom-hell stage during my early teen 
years," Thies said. "I had always loved music, but right about when I was 16, 
when it became something of a personal nature, I decided it was more than just 
a hobby or something I did while my friends were out playing soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was studying two works -- the Rachmaninoff Second Concerto and the Schumann 
Fantasia in C -- that turned him around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something about them grabbed me," he said. "There was self-discovery there. 
They are big pieces and also make a big Romantic statement. I was taken by 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Things began falling into place during that time. "I made a trip to China in 
1987 for a Chinese American organization," he said. "It was listed as a 10-day 
musical tour of three cities: Shanghai, Beijing and Nanjing. Everybody but 
myself was of Chinese American heritage. How I got to make it, I don't know 
how. I was 16." 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of music and travel was "quite a combination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That same year, I played with a smaller youth symphony orchestra. Even so, it 
was my first solo experience." He played the First Movement of the Tchaikovsky 
First Concerto with the South East Youth Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Larry 
Granger, who also led the Orange County-based South Coast Symphony until its 
demise in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was especially an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, he also began an association with Mehli Mehta, conductor 
of the American Youth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was about 16," Thies said, "he needed a pianist for the Saint-Saens 
'Organ' Symphony, which was a great experience, too, playing inside an 
orchestra, getting piano-orchestra experience. It was great inspiration as 
well. I wanted to keep that up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six years later, he was in a bind and needed a pianist immediately to put 
together a concerto very quickly -- not in performance, in rehearsal. It was 
the Saint-Saens Second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through that, he's now recognized me as the official pianist with the 
American Youth Symphony, whenever they need a pianist to rehearse or even in 
performance when there's a piano part in the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 Thies has not yet played as a soloist with that orchestra, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his piano studies with Daniel Pollack at USC, Thies is taking 
classes in 20th-Century music and orchestration, for which he is writing a 
composition. "This is exciting because the USC Symphony will perform it. It's 
yet another pressure I have on me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is short, he hasn't named the work. "It's more a sort of collage of 
various things, because I wanted to try different things. One part is almost 
minimalistic. Another part is inspired probably by Prokofiev or Shostakovich. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're only giving us about three or four minutes, so it isn't a big work by 
any means. The orchestra is going to read through it maybe twice. So it doesn't 
have a formal structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Thies played Beethoven's Third Concerto with Porat and the Camerata last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, Beethoven's Second Concerto is more difficult," Thies said. 
"It's certainly not the tragic Beethoven that I saw in the Third Concerto that 
I played with Ami last year. At the same time, it shows many faces of 
Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not tragic, but the Second Movement is certainly one of his most tender 
compositions. It's quite beautiful, and it offers a big contrast to just what 
preceded it and what is going to succeed it as well. There are completely 
different moods." 
</P>
<P>
 The Concerto "almost looks back to Mozart," he added. "But you have to make it 
not sound like Mozart, but like Beethoven." 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Thies will be soloist in Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2 with Ami 
Porat and the Mozart Camerata on Sunday at 4 p.m. at St. Andrew's Presbyterian 
Church, 600 St. Andrews Road, Newport Beach. $14-$29 (student rush: $7). (714) 
631-2233.

MASTERS' BOGEY?; UNTRADITIONAL WAYS, CUSTOMS BELIE TOURNAMENT'S VERY SPECIAL 
IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The dominant color of the Augusta National golf course is green. Lush green 
fairways. Green pine trees. Green buildings with green carpet. And every year, 
one green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 But the green that really symbolizes what Augusta National is all about is on 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Augusta National is the nation's shrine to golf, a Valhalla that is actually a 
monument to perfection, rather than longevity. Most sports shrines -- Boston 
Garden, Fenway Park, Chicago Stadium, the Coliseum -- are far from being in 
perfect shape, but not Augusta National. It's nearly flawless. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't built for the people, only by the people. 
</P>
<P>
 To become a member, you have to be asked. And most of those who have been 
asked are from out of town and very rich. And, with one exception, very white. 
And never a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're asked, it only costs a $25,000 entrance fee and $1,200 a year in 
dues. There are about 300 members, with only about 100 from the area. Two years 
ago, Golf Digest estimated the net worth of the members to be $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Jenkins, a sportswriter turned author, once asked then club chairman Hord 
Hardin, how the process worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say I want to join the club," Jenkins asked. "I can afford it. I'm a 
swell guy. I know where Bobby Jones won all of his majors. I would get along 
with the other members. I wouldn't abuse the privileges. So, who decides 
whether I get in?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin said, "I do," and quickly changed the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The course is closed from June through September and only about 20 people play 
the course each day. There are 90 caddies, all black. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are encouraged not to talk about the course and doing so can be 
grounds for dismissal. Members also are discouraged from heavy wagering and 
having too many cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Masters champions are honorary members but still need a member to 
sponsor them should they want to play a round. 
</P>
<P>
 One more tip for past and future Masters winners -- don't wear your green 
jacket outside the grounds of Augusta National. In 1990, Nick Faldo took his 
jacket back to England and, during a television interview, let a sportscaster 
try it on. Faldo was reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great ironies of sport is how a place and a tournament that are 
untraditional in so many ways can be known as the backbone of golf tradition. 
And are some of Augusta National's traditions the kind that are worthy of 
emulation in perpetuity? 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament week is also very untraditional. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the early week practice rounds easily outdraw the four days of 
the tournament. An estimated 40,000 show up each day. The reason is that only 
tickets to the practice rounds can be bought by the public. Tickets for 
tournament days haven't been available since 1967. The four-day badges are 
among the toughest tickets in sports. In 1978, they stopped taking names for a 
waiting list. The number of four-day badges is believed to be about 30,000, but 
that's a secret the club won't disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the heavy demand for tickets, the cost of a four-day badge is also 
untraditional -- just $100. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're lucky enough to get a ticket, the cost of food and drink is 
another surprise. Soft drinks are 75 cents, sandwiches (which come in green 
plastic wrap) are $1 and beer is $1.50. They don't sell hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinks come in green cups without advertising. No advertising is allowed on 
the course, a shocking contrast with other tournaments such as the L.A. Open, 
which is dropping Los Angeles from its name next year to appease its sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercialism is allowed to exist outside the imposing gates of Augusta 
National. What remains is a contrast between the city itself and its most 
famous piece of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, about 200,000 visitors descend on this town of 40,000 for Masters 
week. The city has rural Georgia written all over it. There are 13 Waffle House 
restaurants (about one for every 3,000 residents), barbecue joints aplenty and 
hotel rooms without room service. But Augusta acts like any other price-gouging 
small town come Masters week. Hotel rooms that normally go for $40 a night are 
$150 and higher. An estimated $100 million is brought into the economy this 
week. There are street-corner vendors selling their unlicensed products. The 
restaurants -- especially male-dominated yuppie places such as Hooters -- are 
packed beyond fire code regulations.  
</P>
<P>
 Augusta National is an anomaly of sport. And things are still pretty much the 
way Bobby Jones wanted them to be when the course opened in 1932. Along with 
Clifford Roberts, Jones guided the course and tournament to its present status. 
Jones died in 1971 and Roberts committed suicide in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' ashes were buried somewhere on the course. One week later, the person 
who is said to have done the digging, died before he could tell anyone where 
they were. 
</P>
<P>
 For Augusta National, it may be the only secret it didn't plan.

MIKE DOWNEY: A PLEASANT THOUGHT PREVAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening day began with Tom Lasorda spilling his guts. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry's drug abuse? "First of all," the fed-up Dodger manager said 
Tuesday, voice rising steadily in volume, "it's against the law. No. 2, it's 
harmful to your body. No. 3, all it will do is lead you down the path of 
destruction. How anybody could be dumb enough or weak enough to take (drugs) is 
something I cannot comprehend. I mean, it's crazy. There's a guy that is making 
a lot of money, he's got a lot of fame, he's got a family, and yet he puts 
something inside him knowingly, knowing that this thing can ruin his career, 
that it could ruin his entire life. To have the weakness to put it into his 
body is something I just don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a disease, like leukemia or cancer. It's a weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 Opening day continued with the Dodgers demonstrating that they can win with 
the guys they have. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rodriguez will do just fine in left field. Raul Mondesi is ready to turn 
right field into Raul World. Jeff Treadway already is helping out. Todd Worrell 
bears a striking resemblance to an old St. Louis Cardinals pitcher you might 
remember named Todd Worrell. Jim Gott will have much better days than opening 
day, don't worry. The Dodgers don't have Strawberry? OK. The Dodgers don't have 
lemons, either. 
</P>
<P>
 They looked sharp in defeating the Florida Marlins, 4-3, despite getting only 
six hits off the old man of the sea, 2,000-year-old Charlie Hough. Sorry, 
Charlie. You outhit half of the guys who played behind you. Maybe what the 
Marlins need are some 46-year-old outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
 Best news all day for the Dodgers was a 1-2-3 ninth inning from Worrell, 
including a swinging strike three on Kurt Abbott that the reliever called 
"maybe the best pitch I've thrown in three or four years." 
</P>
<P>
 If Worrell, Gott, Roger McDowell and rookie Darren Dreifort can close games, 
it could be a lovely summer. Never mind who plays left field. The Dodgers need 
the people who come into the game from behind left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell felt confident, particularly after humming fastballs from 87 to 93 
m.p.h. and sliders around 96. He wants to be Lasorda's stopper. He wants to 
return Uncle Tommy to his old jolly self and let him forget all about those 
wayward players who have gotten off the road to Cooperstown and onto a path to 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell said: "One of the favorite Tommyisms is that we've all got to get on 
the same side of the road. I'm sure you've heard that before. Anyway, what it 
means is that no one can let down, Darryl or no Darryl. We've got to give this 
team a sense of unity. We've got to all do our parts so the Dodgers can win 
games without always waiting for Mike Piazza to come to the plate every time up 
and hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good. I feel durable. I feel like I can be useful again on an 
every-other-day basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said in spring camp there might be two keys to a successful season -- 
Strawberry and Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good," Worrell said. "I take that as a compliment from Tommy that he's 
depending on me. I want him to depend on me. But forget what two players can 
do. We got to the seventh game of the World Series one year with the Cardinals 
without Jack Clark and Terry Pendleton, at a point when we couldn't afford to 
lose either one. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to Darryl, I'm sorry. Life sometimes isn't fair. Sometimes you 
get caught up doing the wrong things. We hope and pray Darryl can get his life 
back in some kind of order. Whatever else we feel about it, we're not going to 
divulge. It's in-house business. But I will tell you this: It doesn't need to 
be a distraction. In fact, I don't believe it will distract this team one bit. 
This team can win with Darryl Strawberry and it can win without Darryl 
Strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
 Opening day ended with a pleasant thought.

CLAIRE HAD QUESTIONED STRAWBERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers said they saw signs of Darryl Strawberry's drug and alcohol abuse 
and questioned him about it, but their hands were tied until Strawberry 
admitted Monday that he had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said he questioned Strawberry 
several times last season, but Strawberry's answer was always denial. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the standpoint of do you have a problem, did I ask him that? Yes," 
Claire said. "Not saying that you do, or that I know you do, but is there a 
problem here, Why are you late? That line of inquiry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "'You have your doctors, your coaches, your team therapist, but how do you 
break through? If you are going to acuse somebody, you better have evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda said he also saw signs of substance abuse. "When people 
are late for meetings and you don't show up for games, what kind of signs do 
you get from that?" Lasorda said. "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to 
know that something else is controlling the mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was in New York Tuesday to be evaluated by two doctors -- one 
representing the players association and the other from the owner's side -- 
before entering a drug-treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire, who still would not disclose the reason Strawberry initially gave for 
missing Sunday's game, said the reason in itself was not a violation of 
Strawberry's good-behavior clause. The Dodgers still owe Strawberry $8 million 
for two years, but if he has violated the standard clause or another clause 
believed to be written in an addendum, the Dodgers might be able to void the 
contract.

CLIPPERS' WILLIAMS INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers won a game, but lost forward John Williams for the rest of the 
season because of a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers helped the Lakers by beating the Denver Nuggets, 92-91, Tuesday 
night at McNicholls Arena to cut the Nuggets' lead over the Lakers to three 
games in the race for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who suffered a chip fracture of his left ankle in the first half, 
will return to Los Angeles today to be examined by Dr. Tony Daly. The Clippers 
placed him on the injured list and activated forward Tom Tolbert, who had 
missed the Clippers' last 20 games with a strained back. Tolbert is expected to 
join the team for tonight's game at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Elmore Spencer's three-point play with 42 seconds left gave the 
Clippers the lead over the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper's layup gave the Clippers a three-point edge before Reggie 
Williams' two free throws with 10 seconds to go completed the scoring for the 
Nuggets, who battled back from a 20-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out flat but we didn't give up," said Clipper Coach Bob Weiss 
after watching his club delay playoff elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Rogers' 20-footer put the Nuggets ahead 89-87 with 1:21 left. After 
Williams' free throws, a last-second shot by Denver's Robert Pack fell short, 
and two Nuggets tip-in attempts missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Gary Grant scored a season-high 26 points and guard Randy Woods had a 
season-high 20 points as the Clippers, playing without Dominique Wilkins (flu), 
ended a five-game skid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't stop (Grant and Woods). In the first half we just couldn't 
keep the intensity we had early," said guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, who had 21 
points. "Dan warned us before the game that when a team loses their leading 
scorer, the rest of the team feeds on that."

RODRIGUEZ IS MORE THAN CAPABLE FILL-IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After all the controversy, confusion and public announcements, Henry Rodriguez 
brought a welcome bit of subtlety to the Dodgers' left-field position in the 
season opener Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't slam 30 home runs high and deep into the Dodger Stadium right-field 
bleachers, won't hold court in front of the cameras, won't command clubhouse 
attention with his very presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other guy who used to play left field for the Dodgers did all that. 
</P>
<P>
 But without the loud fanfare -- for one quietly productive day, at least -- 
Rodriguez slipped into the lineup and looked as if he might stay there for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, the Dodgers' only left-handed hitter with decent power, was put 
into the sixth spot in the batting order. He singled to center field in the 
fourth inning and hit a high Charlie Hough knuckler into the left-center alley 
for a double in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 And most important, Rodriguez battled Florida reliever Jeremy Hernandez 
through an eight-pitch at-bat to draw a key walk leading off the eighth. That 
triggered the game-winning rally in the Dodgers' 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't exactly a Darryl Strawberry performance, but on a day the Dodgers 
sought to minimize the effect of his absence, it was quite sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only one game, but we're going to need that from Henry," said catcher 
Mike Piazza, one of the Dodgers' brigade of right-handed power hitters. "He's 
got a chance to play, and we're really hoping for a breakthrough year from 
Henry, to come through with some big numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 26, has merely waited his whole seven-year professional career for 
the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Manager Tom Lasorda has avoided making a long-term commitment to 
anybody in left field -- a platoon is probable -- Rodriguez has the first 
chance to seize the job because he's left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the perfect opportunity for him to do something," batting coach Reggie 
Smith said. "It's certainly not his fault he has this chance somewhat by 
default. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a window of opportunity for him. I'm not saying it's absolutely 
critical that he produce right now. But it's a window that may not always be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who was expected to be the Dodgers' fourth or fifth outfielder this 
season, before Strawberry's drug-abuse problem was revealed Monday, said he is 
ready for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, playing as a utility outfielder and pinch-hitter, Rodriguez hit 
eight home runs in 176 at-bats, but batted only .222. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I can do the job," Rodriguez said. "I know I can play against anybody. 
Now it's just try to produce and help the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised because I was so relaxed out there. I got out to the field 
and the fans were saying 'Hi' to me, and I was saying 'Hello' to them. I wasn't 
feeling pressure at all today. Reggie and Manny (Mota), they took me aside 
before the game today and said this is my chance maybe to make a spot for 
myself. But I just went out there and had fun." 
</P>
<P>
 After Mitch Webster, who scored the winning run, ran for him in the eighth, 
Rodriguez received a reception in the dugout usually reserved for somebody who 
had just hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was pulling for me today, and I appreciated it," Rodriguez said. 
"High-fives, that was pretty exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Straw's not here now, and he hasn't played much in two years. I've got the 
opportunity to play every day now, the opportunity to win a job." 
</P>
<P>
 With Raul Mondesi jumping into the starting right-field position this spring 
and Billy Ashley hitting homers in the minors, it looked as though Rodriguez 
might be squeezed out of a chance to start with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-handed Ashley took Strawberry's roster spot and could end up 
platooning with Rodriguez. Mitch Webster and Cory Snyder, when he gets off the 
disabled list, might play left field, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that as long as Rodriguez doesn't try to overpower the ball, as he 
did during one bad year in the minors, he can be an integral part of the Dodger 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe with time, he can develop 15- to 20-homer power," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for him to do it in the power slots in our lineup. (Having a 
left-handed hitter) kind of breaks things up, where the other team can't just 
go in there with their top right-handed reliever to go against the meat of our 
lineup."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PEREZ CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO THE STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel first baseman Eduardo Perez paced his hotel room Tuesday afternoon, 
anxiously stealing glances at the alarm clock, until he could take it no 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent plenty of opening days in Cincinnati, watching his father, Tony 
Perez. But this was different. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first opening day of his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally ended up walking to the stadium," Perez said. "I mean, I had to 
release that energy somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who produced two hits and drove in a run in the Angels' opening-day 
victory over the Minnesota Twins, perhaps has more pressure on him than any 
player in the Angel lineup. He is the reason J.T. Snow is in Vancouver. The 
reason the Angels moved Damion Easley to third base. The reason Bo Jackson and 
Dwight Smith are platooning in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't plan on any of this," Perez said, shrugging. "I didn't care where I 
was playing, as long as I was playing. It wasn't like I was the one making the 
decisions to send anyone down." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was Perez's elbow that caused the reshuffling of the roster. The 
Angels moved Perez from third to left field after he underwent arthroscopic 
surgery on his right elbow in October. He experienced inflammation of the elbow 
in January, and the Angels immediately signed Jackson and Smith. In spring 
training, the elbow flared up again, and the Angels moved him permanently to 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow became the odd man out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've shown him by my actions that he's our first baseman, and that's all 
there is to it," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "If Eddie can be just half as 
consistent as Timmy (Salmon) last year, he'll be fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, there shouldn't be any pressure, because he's the guy we're going 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina should be getting used to this by now, but 
there it was again Tuesday, another new face at second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Reynolds became the Angels' fifth different opening-day second baseman 
in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been so many over there," DiSarcina said, "it's like it's not even 
a person. I've never had that luxury of knowing my second baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twin left fielder Pedro Munoz opened his season in style, slamming a 473-foot 
homer into the center field seats off Mark Langston. It was the longest home 
run hit to center field in the 12-year history of the Metrodome, and only eigth 
feet shy of the longest one hit to any field. . . . Reliever Bob Patterson shed 
his offensive lineman number, 66, and replaced it with No. 28 for this season. 
"I wanted to make sure I made the team before I did anything," Patterson said. 
. . . Salmon became the first Angel to make two consecutive opening-day starts 
in right field since Dan Ford in 1980 and 1981. . . . The Angels will tinker 
with their lineup tonight, with Chris Turner starting at catcher and Rex Hudler 
at second. Rodgers also said he will start Spike Owen at third on Thursday, 
resting Easley. BOB NIGHTENGALE

AVERAGE BASEBALL SALARY RISES TO $1,188,679; MONEY: YANKEES ARE TOP-PAID CLUB 
AT $1,760,974. DODGERS ARE AT $1,457,552, ANGELS AT $750,268.

<P>
 The average baseball salary rose 6.1% this year, to $1,188,679 on opening day, 
according to a survey by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Yankees are the top-paid team for the first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Met third baseman Bobby Bonilla is the highest-paid player at $6.3 
million, according to an examination of the contract terms for 746 players on 
opening day rosters and disabled lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Cub second baseman Ryne Sandberg, the salary leader last season, was 
second at $6,299,966. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees' average was $1,760,974, up slightly from their $1,759,429 average 
on Aug. 31, 1993, the last day before rosters expanded. Toronto, first last 
year at $1,765,582, dropped to fifth this opening day at $1,498,667. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Tigers, with a major league-leading 15 million-dollar players, 
rose to second at $1,594,700 from 10th at $1,265,317. Atlanta remained third 
but dropped to $1,500,080 from $1,676,211. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' average salary declined from $1,457,552 on opening day last 
season to $1,426,346 this year, ninth in baseball. It was led by Tom 
Candiotti's $3,650,000, with Brett Butler, Tim Wallach, Orel Hershiser and 
Darryl Strawberry earning more than $3 million. There were 12 Dodger 
millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' average increased from $718,686 last year to $750,268 in 1994, but 
it is still ahead of only the San Diego Padres. Chuck Finley is the 
highest-paid Angel at $3,875,000. There were six Angel millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 While the number of million-dollar players on opening day rose only slightly, 
to 265 from 262, the total of $2 million players rose to 192 from 182 and $3 
million players increased to 119 from 99. There are 43 $4 million players, an 
increase of six, and 14 $5 million players, an increase of two. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.1% rise from last year's opening day average of $1,120,254 was less than 
the 8.9% increase in average ticket prices, to $10.45 from $9.60, the 
Chicago-based Team Marketing Report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee Stadium in New York has the highest average ticket price at $14.44, up 
from $13.48 last season.  
</P>
<P>
 Mile High Stadium in Denver has the lowest average at $7.90.  
</P>
<P>
 The cost for a family of four to attend a game -- including two beers, four 
hot dogs, four soft drinks, two caps, two programs and parking -- rose 5.5%, to 
$95.80 from $90.84. The Yankees had the highest cost at $115.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati was the low at $79.31. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels hiked their average ticket price from $8.02 to $8.06, with a family 
average going from $84.60 to $90.24. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' average ticket price rose from $9.15 to $9.68, with a family 
average going from $88.60 to $90.73. ANGEL SALARIES Chuck Finley: $3,875,000

TICKETS GO SMOOTHLY, BUT PREGAME IS A PROBLEM; BASEBALL: PARACHUTIST INJURED AT 
SAN DIEGO, WHERE A COMPUTER GLITCH SEEMS TO BE REMEDIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things were nearly back to normal at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium on Tuesday 
night. Ticket problems appeared to be solved, but an accident involving a 
parachutist resulted in one injury and the delay of the second Atlanta-Padre 
game in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the man's injuries was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified chutist came down in a formation with two other jumpers, hit 
hard and slid along the ground near Braves players Fred McGriff, Deion Sanders, 
Ryan Klesko and Mike Kelly, who were warming up in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 When the players realized he was hurt, they motioned for medical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The parachutist lay motionless for several minutes, but was seen moving his 
arms and legs after he was put on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the second day in a row of problems, and memories of Monday's 
computer glitch at the ticket windows were all too fresh in the minds of Padre 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour before the Padres were to play in the first afternoon home opener in 
the club's 26 seasons, the TicketMaster computer system that operates the 
ticket sales broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres-Braves game was delayed from 2:05 to 2:20 p.m., and even then, the 
start was too early for many frustrated ticket-holders. It wasn't until the 
second or third inning that all of the 42,251 fans had reached their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Adams, the Padres' senior vice president for business operations, said 
computers for TicketMaster outlets throughout Southern California were 
affected. The outage lasted 40 minutes, by which time some would-be 
ticket-buyers had left the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said there had been "a few complaints" Tuesday and that each caller had 
been offered tickets to a future game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very trying situation," he said. "Having all those fans and not 
being able to service them was totally frustrating, and we had no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the problem was the gate sale far exceeding expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 After last year's much-publicized "fire sale" of high-salaried players, the 
Padres' off-season demand for tickets was so light that the upper deck was 
covered with a tarp. This trimmed the seating capacity from 59,722 to 46,510, 
and the Padres didn't expect more than 35,000 for opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, 10,300 tickets, about triple the number that had been 
anticipated, were sold on game day. Although the crowd of 42,251 was more than 
4,000 shy of the newly listed capacity, it was announced as a sellout because 
of a large number of complimentary tickets plus some that were for luxury boxes 
and not available for general use. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the ticket problem, the parking lots became clogged to the point 
where many cars had to be parked on nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have space for 18,000 cars," Adams said. "The normal average is three 
people to a car, but this being an afternoon game with many folks coming from 
work, the average was closer to two per car." 
</P>
<P>
 This is TicketMaster's first season of serving the Padres, who had used 
Teleseat in the past.

COMMENTARY; FAST-STARTING ANGELS QUIET DOUBTERS -- AT LEAST FOR A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Snow was on the ground, not on the roster. Fluffy white Teflon clouds floated 
overhead, with the heaters blowing in. Stadium vendors roamed the aisles, 
hawking their wares -- "Ice . . . . cold . . . . Zima!! Get your chilled fruit 
and cheese plates here!"  
</P>
<P>
 For the Angels, this was Opening Night, 1994, and if the sights and sounds 
around them seemed a notch out of sync, you should have seen what the Angel 
hitters did to Kevin Tapani, ace pitcher of the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Angels batted in the first inning. Two scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Angels batted in the second inning. Four scored. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 6-0 before the home fans could stop shaking their heads over the 
removal of the fabled plexiglass left field fence, for 10 years as much a part 
of the Metrodome as the air ducts in the upper deck and the giant Hefty bag in 
right. And isn't that the trouble with baseball today? The game has no regard 
for tradition any more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels rattled a few more longstanding perceptions -- e.g., they're lousy 
-- by rapping out 15 hits Tuesday, outscoring the Twins, 8-2, and refraining 
from popping any champagne corks afterward in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna have some games like this," Manager Buck Rodgers said 
nonchalantly as he stabbed a plastic fork into a postgame slab of roasted 
chicken breast. "Tonight may not be typical, but we're going to score a lot 
more runs than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet outside Rodgers' office, designated hitter Chili Davis was keeping 
pace shrug for shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're capable of hitting the ball like this," Davis said. "We've got guys who 
can swing the bat, do a lot of different things on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis glanced around the room and began to tick off names. 
</P>
<P>
 Damion Easley. Two singles, a double and three runs in his first 
regular-season game back from the worst case of shin splints in recorded 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my pick to click this year," Davis said. "If he stays healthy, he's 
going to make a big difference for us this year. The man can play. He can pick 
it, he can run. And we're going to need that, especially with the loss of Luis 
Polonia at the top of the order. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we see what Damion Easley can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson. Two RBIs and an infield single plus a powerful outfield relay from 
the warning track that helped shortstop Gary DiSarcina nail Twin Rich Becker at 
home plate -- another change from the Polonia era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo adds a lot to this team," Davis said. "You get Bo Jackson hot and he's 
going to make our 1-2-3 hitters a whole lot better. He's the strongest man I've 
ever played with. I've never seen the kind of home runs he hits. I saw him hit 
seven in spring training and all of them were no doubters." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Reynolds. The old second baseman, who is the Angels' new second 
baseman, debuted with two singles, a run and a potential double that wound up 
in the glove of a sliding Pedro Munoz, the Twins' left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he likes Reynolds because "he's older than me." Actually, Chili is 
wrong; the media guide lists Davis' age at 34, Reynolds' at 33. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm older than him?" Chili asked, incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
 Sad, but true. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're the oldest position player on the Angels," a Twin Cities writer 
informed Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't play a position," Davis said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, Davis thought about Chili Davis. Three more RBIs on Opening 
Night from the man who had 112 RBIs in 1993 and isn't supposed to come anywhere 
near in 1994 according to every preseason baseball magazine and manual on the 
stands. You know Chili: hot one year, cold the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "The off-years I've had," Davis said, "were usually years when I had 
injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he doesn't care about the critics because "the critics have never 
played the game. If they bring it up to me, I say to them, 'You've been a 
journalist 23 years and you're still no good at your job.' If you're gonna 
critic me, I'm gonna critic you." 
</P>
<P>
 The critics have also said these Angels have little chance in the American 
League West, despite its realigned and weakened state, but again Davis scoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was the youth movement," he said. "We've got a little more 
seasoning this year. Harold Reynolds, Bo, Dwight Smith. We've got what you'd 
call a good blend of youth and age." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis grinned again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got . . . . euthanasia!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, they had it, putting the Twins out of their misery early. Now 
it's on to Game 2 and the next act. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying alive.

O'GRADY SAYS PLAYERS USE BETA-BLOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mac O'Grady, golf's abstract philosopher, grabbed some attention this week 
when he suggested that many of the top players were using beta-blockers to help 
with their putting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 30 top players worldwide, I would be surprised if less than seven (are 
using beta-blockers)," O'Grady told the Augusta Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Beta-blockers, available only through prescription, are given to people with 
high-blood pressure or anxiety. It also is used to treat some heart problems by 
slowing the heart rate. 
</P>
<P>
 It has long been suspected that shooters and archers use the drug to help 
steady their nerves during competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it would not be against PGA Tour policy to use the drug, players 
called O'Grady's statement ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took them for several years for high blood pressure," Nick Price said. "But 
there is no problem with people taking them." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady, in conjunction with UCLA and UC Irvine, has completed a 10-year 
research project on the golf swing. He is at the Masters hoping to help Seve 
Ballesteros with his swing. JOHN CHERWA

LEITER'S 9-MONTH-OLD SON DIES OF CHILDREN'S LOU GEHRIG DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark and Allison Leiter tried their best to prepare for this day, but no 
matter how they braced themselves for the inevitable, it could not diminish 
their pain and anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Today they will bury their 9-month-old son, Ryan Alexander Leiter, during a 
private memorial service in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who had Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, a children's form of Lou Gehrig's 
disease, died Monday night in Anaheim. Leiter, who requested that the Angels 
not make an announcement until he could notify his relatives, immediately left 
the team to be with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt Ryan was brought into our life for a reason," Allison Leiter said the 
other day. "He was an angel on this earth. I'll believe that until the day I 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, who joined the Angels on March 19 after being released by the Detroit 
Tigers, told Manager Buck Rodgers that he still wants to make his scheduled 
start Saturday against the Brewers. He plans to rejoin the team before Friday's 
game in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever time he needs, he'll get," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations, in lieu of flowers, can be made to the Ryan Leiter Fund, c/o 
Families of Spinal Muscular Atrophy, P.O. Box 1465, Highland Park, Ill. 60035.

THAT'S (NOT) THE TICKET; BIRMINGHAM BARONS SUDDENLY RENEGE ON YOUNGSTERS' 
PASSES FOR JORDAN'S FIRST GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weeks before anyone knew Michael Jordan would be in right field, the 
Birmingham Barons gave youngsters 25,000 tickets for Sunday's game against 
Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, kids, your tickets are no good now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons say none of the free passes given to area schools for the game will 
be honored because of the anticipated crush of people wanting to see the former 
NBA star. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, only about 2,000 children and their families have used the free 
tickets. But that clearly would be different this year with Jordan in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rethought the situation because it would be a total nightmare even if 20% 
of those people showed up," said Bill Hardekopf, president of the Barons, the 
double-A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the change, the tickets will good for any one of 26 selected 
home games between April 11 and June 25. Baron spokesman Chris Pika said there 
is no guarantee Jordan will be with the team for all those dates, "but we 
certainly hope that he will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover Metropolitan Stadium seats only about 10,000. Nearly 15,000 can crowd 
in once grassy hills down the foul lines are opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons traditionally give away 5,000 passes -- each good for five fans -- 
for the game, even though that's more than the stadium can hold. Before now, 
there was never any reason to expect that all the tickets would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 But one high school principal said money, not logistics, is the real reason 
for the team's move.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's all about bucks," said Dick Atchison of Oak Grove High School. 
"Michael Jordan is coming and they can now sell these tickets. It shouldn't 
make any difference who is on the roster. The Barons do some good things for 
kids, but I just think this is awful. These kids have to feel slighted." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons' ticket office, in conjunction with Birmingham Coca-Cola, sent out 
the free tickets to the Jefferson County school system, said school system 
spokeswoman Nez Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun said the change would be disappointing for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (the Barons) it would be a public relations nightmare," she said. "We 
looked at some other alternatives, but nothing seemed suitable at the time."

TALKING SQUAWFISH; COLLECTION OF STORYTELLERS REVEALS COLORFUL PAST OF MONSTER 
SPECIES THAT THRIVED IN THE OLD WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing against Cary Barber, but there are probably better ways to impress a 
young woman than to present her with a dull-green fish shaped like a torpedo 
and with a gaping mouth that looks as though it has lips. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Barber's courting days were decades ago in rural Colorado, where such 
a gift might not have been offensive. And it was the biggest fish he had ever 
caught or even seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was spring, and . . . I was just 17 and there was a young lady living at 
the Barnes' place," said Barber, of Maybell, Colo. "I figured me catching the 
fish would maybe make a good impression on an attractive young lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Barber was a cowboy then, and after clubbing the fish on the head with a tree 
branch, he hung it from the pommel of his saddle and galloped off to the 
Barnes'. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Barnes had just hung her washing on the clothesline," Barber said. "She 
saw the monster fish and went in to get a camera. About then, I felt the horse 
flinch a bit and I looked down in time to see that darn fish come to life and 
give a mighty slap with its tail, catching my horse in the belly. I tried to 
get off with dignity, but my horse helped me off in a hurry, then ran off. The 
strap holding the fish broke, and the horse took off right through the 
clothesline, which caught on the saddle horn and strung out for a quarter of a 
mile along the Greasewood Flats." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known whether Barber's courting was successful. His story, pulled 
from the clips of an old issue of Colorado Outdoors magazine, is only one of 
many compiled recently by Fred Quartarone of the Colorado Division of Wildlife 
in a joint effort with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartarone's assignment was to gather first-hand information regarding four 
species of fish native to the upper Colorado basin that once thrived before 
falling victim to progress and landing on the endangered species list in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartarone interviewed more than 100 people with an average age of 77. They 
recalled encounters with razorback suckers, humpback chubs, bonytail chubs and 
a member of the minnow family called the Colorado squawfish, which grew to 6 
feet and gobbled up practically anything cast its way. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the report, for the Information and Education Committee of the 
Recovery Program for the Endangered Fish of the Upper Colorado River Basin, was 
to learn how people interacted with the fish, both as a means of recreation and 
of sustenance. If nothing else, the report provides a colorful look at the way 
things were before pollution, dams and the introduction of hatchery-raised 
trout and catfish forever changed the fisheries of the upper Colorado River 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts of squawfish, which used to migrate up and down the rivers in such 
numbers that early settlers referred to them as "white salmon," dominate the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gene Bittler, of Maybell, Colo.: "I pitched a green frog out there and 
this whitefish (as squawfish were commonly called) hit it just about straight 
across, and he ran down the fast water, riffles, and took out about 200 feet of 
line before I turned him around. It was one of the most thrilling fish I ever 
caught if you want to know the truth. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 To such old-time anglers, there was no such thing as Power Bait. But the 
squawfish wasn't finicky, so there was no need for such glop.  
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather would get chicken parts, just great big old chunks of chicken 
parts and stuff like that, put a hook in it and throw it out into the river 
into those big holes down there with clothesline," said Tim Merchant, of Green 
River, Wyo. "He just tied the clothesline onto the bumper of the truck. And 
when that went tight they'd just back the truck up and drag those fish out on 
the bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Barber's monster squawfish was the second to take him to the cleaners on that 
eventful day at the Barnes' spread. The first, he said, was 4 feet and was 
caught on a baby blackbird he scooped up from the river bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber said the fish gave him rope burns when he used a hand-line to pull it 
to shore. His older companions were impressed by the size of the fish, though, 
and told him to catch another. Barber had no bait, but that wasn't going to 
stop a resourceful young cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hunted a nest of mice, baited up and went fishing," Barber said. "But, 
remembering the rope burns from the fish line, I decided to fish on horseback 
with a dally around the saddle horn. Right off, a whopper latched onto the mice 
and was hooked. I didn't fool around, but doubled the dally on the saddle horn 
and hauled that fish off like I was dragging a calf to the branding fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Mice were said to be favored over other bait for catching squawfish. Swallows 
were a close second. The birds would build their nests on canyon walls, and 
when -- or before -- it was time to fly, they would often plop into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one time when we were fishing, the baby swallows were just leaving their 
nests," said Chuck Mack of Craig, Colo. "A lot of them fell into the river and 
drowned. Every big squawfish in the Green River must have migrated to the 
canyon to feast on the swallows because we sure caught a lot of them. Or, let's 
say, we sure had a lot of them hooked. The tackle we were using was a little 
light for 50-pound fish. Every one we gutted out had a stomach plumb full of 
baby swallows." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hastings of Green River, Utah, said he used to spear squawfish simply for 
the fun of it. "My brother and I, we waded in there, the water hit me about 
(chest-high)," Hastings said. "One of them (Colorado squawfish) damn near 
drowned me. I hooked into him, he took me down out of there . . . I was small 
and wasn't about to turn him loose. I was about 7 or 8. My brother, he was 
older; he got down there and got me, and I still had my fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado squawfish were apparently so highly prized that fishermen often 
hauled in 60- to 80-pounders -- using whole cottontail rabbits for bait. The 
flesh of the squawfish was full of bones, but as one Depression-era fishermen 
noted: "We were so cotton-picking poor that we didn't know good from bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days of community fish fries. Farmers in Loma, Colo., held one 
every fall, until politics got in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farmers went to the river on a Saturday and with either four or six boats 
they hung nets between each pair of boats, catching hundreds of large fish," 
read an old account in the Journal of the Western Slope. "They kept the fish 
alive in vats of water overnight, then early Sunday they were dressed by the 
members of the women of the Loma Community Club, and the men fried them. It was 
hard work, but we had a day of fun until the office seekers from all over the 
state started to swarm over the place. Republicans swore, Democrats cussed, and 
the Loma community decided it was not worthwhile. No more fish fries!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the Depression, dams began to spring up in various rivers of 
the region, essentially dooming the Colorado squawfish and other native fish, 
which preferred the fast-flowing water of untamed rivers.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was the growing appeal of hatchery-raised trout and catfish that led to 
the downfall of squawfish, chubs and suckers. Trout were more colorful, not so 
full of bones and flavorful. Catfish were meaty and somewhat of a challenge on 
hook and line. 
</P>
<P>
 Communities began to realize that they could achieve greater economic benefits 
by stocking the more popular gamefish, attracting the fishermen from other 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Catfish had a direct impact on squawfish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the (squawfish) disappeared was because they introduced the 
channel cat," recalled Wanda Staley of Vernal, Utah. "The whitefish or, as you 
call them, squawfish would swallow the channel cat and those barbs (on the 
catfish's back) would get stuck in their throat and it would kill them. We 
found a number of them that died that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The squawfish had no such trouble with the trout, gobbling them up so fast 
that newly converted trout fishermen began to pressure government officials 
into taking some sort of action. Some didn't wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, we (would) take them (squawfish), seine them out of the river and dump 
them on the lawn, let them die on the banks, (and) we'd get a gunny sack full 
and use them for fertilizer, or whatever," recalled Don Hatch of Vernal, Utah. 
"If you couldn't eat them, what good were they, anyway? Of course, we didn't 
think they were pretty, either, like rainbow trout." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, fisheries officials embarked on several rotenone poisoning projects, 
beginning in the early 1960s, to control the growth of the Colorado squawfish. 
The programs were limited in nature, but in one instance, the rotenone spread 
farther than anticipated, and the ensuing fish kill was said to have left the 
banks littered with native fish.  
</P>
<P>
 The recovery to date has been slow. The bonytail chub is close to extinction; 
the humpback chub has a fairly stable population in the Little Colorado River; 
the razorback sucker has small populations in various upper Colorado 
tributaries.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the Colorado squawfish, it exists primarily in parts of the Colorado 
River and nearby Green and Yampa rivers, but few fish exceed 30 inches, a far 
cry from the monsters that were part of the lives of young cowboys in love and 
settlers looking to put food on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "They was as big as a junior high school kid, that's a big fish," Merchant 
said. "They were bigger than me, I guarantee you. Oh, a hell of a lot bigger. I 
was only 5 or 6 years old."

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; MATER DEI ERRORS PAVE THE WAY FOR ETHERTON, DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standout pitcher Seth Etherton needs few breaks to win baseball games, 
especially when the Dana Hills High senior right-hander is on his game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei, however, did its best to accommodate Etherton in the Dolphins' 4-1 
South Coast League victory Tuesday at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (9-5-1, 4-1 in league play) had as many hits as errors (three) in 
falling into a three-way tie for first with Dana Hills (9-6-1, 4-1) and San 
Clemente.  
</P>
<P>
 Relying on his changeup more than usual, Etherton (5-0) pitched a complete 
game, striking out nine. He retired 15 in a row after giving up a single and a 
walk to the first two batters in the bottom of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really laying off the high fastball, so I said to myself, 'I got to 
get the off-speed stuff over,' " Etherton said. "I felt I got them off-balance 
with the change." 
</P>
<P>
 Talented Monarch sophomore right-hander Mike Hessman (4-1) gave up two 
unearned runs in six innings. Hessman was replaced by senior right-hander Adam 
Harris, who also gave up two unearned runs.

she stepped to the front, winning three games as the Pirates finished second. 
Varagne, a sophomore from Pacifica High, got two victories over Antelope 
Valley. One was in relief of Armbruster. The second was a one-hitter that OCC 
won, 4-1. She also beat San Diego Mesa, 7-1. Varagne allowed two runs and eight

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS TAKING AIM AT ANEMIC TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Snow was on the ground, not on the roster. Fluffy white Teflon clouds floated 
overhead, with the heaters blowing in. Stadium vendors roamed the aisles, 
hawking their wares -- "Ice . . . cold . . . Zima!! Get your chilled fruit and 
cheese plates here!"  
</P>
<P>
 For the Angels, this was opening night, 1994, and if the sights and sounds 
around them seemed a notch out of sync, you should have seen what the Angel 
hitters did to Kevin Tapani, ace pitcher of the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Angels batted in the first inning. Two scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Angels batted in the second inning. Four scored. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 6-0 before the home fans could stop shaking their heads over the 
removal of the fabled Plexiglas left-field fence, for 10 years as much a part 
of the Metrodome as the air ducts in the upper deck and the giant Hefty bag in 
right. And isn't that the trouble with baseball today? The game has no regard 
for tradition anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels rattled a few more long-standing perceptions -- e.g., they're lousy 
-- by rapping out 15 hits Tuesday evening, outscoring the Twins, 8-2, and 
refraining from popping any champagne corks afterward in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna have some games like this," Manager Buck Rodgers said 
nonchalantly as he stabbed a plastic fork into a postgame slab of roasted 
chicken breast. "Tonight may not be typical, but we're going to score a lot 
more runs than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet outside Rodgers' office, designated hitter Chili Davis was keeping 
pace shrug for shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're capable of hitting the ball like this," Davis said. "We've got guys who 
can swing the bat, do a lot of different things on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis glanced around the room and began to tick off names. 
</P>
<P>
 Damion Easley. Two singles, a double and three runs in his first 
regular-season game back from the worst case of shin splints in recorded 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my pick to click this year," Davis said. "If he stays healthy, he's 
going to make a big difference for us this year. The man can play. He can pick 
it, he can run. And we're going to need that, especially with the loss of Luis 
Polonia at the top of the order. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we see what Damion Easley can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson. Two RBIs and an infield single (!) from Hobble Along Cassidy, plus 
a powerful outfield relay from the warning track that helped shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina nail Twin Rich Becker at the plate -- another change from the Luis 
Polonia era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo adds a lot to this team," Davis said. "You get Bo Jackson hot and he's 
going to make our 1-2-3 hitters a whole lot better. He's the strongest man I've 
ever played with. I've never seen the kind of home runs he hits. I saw him hit 
seven in spring training and all of them were no-doubters." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Reynolds. The old second baseman, who is the Angels' new second 
baseman, debuted with two singles, a run and a potential double that wound up 
in the glove of a sliding Pedro Munoz, the Twins' left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he likes Reynolds because "he's older than me." Actually, Chili is 
wrong; the media guide lists Davis' age at 34, Reynolds' at 33. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm older than him?" Chili asked, incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
 Sad, but true. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're the oldest position player on the Angels," a Twin Cities writer 
informed Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't play a position," Davis said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, Davis thought about Chili Davis. Three more RBIs on opening 
night from the man who had 112 RBIs in 1993 and isn't supposed to come anywhere 
near in 1994 according to every preseason baseball magazine and manual on the 
stands. You know Chili: hot one year, cold the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "The off-years I've had," Davis said, "were usually years when I had injuries. 
Here (with the Twins) in '92, I went from 600 at-bats to 400 and never got a 
chance to get going. Now, you might say 400 at-bats is a lot of at-bats, but 
they could be split up over a whole year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In '88 and '89, I had two pretty good years with the Angels and in '90 I hurt 
my back. I had an off-year with the Giants in '86 when I dislocated my shoulder 
at the All-Star break. My shoulder popped out, but I stayed in the lineup. 
That's just something that happens sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he doesn't care about the critics because "the critics have never 
played the game. If they bring it up to me, I say to them, 'You've been a 
journalist 23 years and you're still no good at your job.' If you're gonna 
critic me, I'm gonna critic you." 
</P>
<P>
 The critics have also said that these Angels have little chance in the 
American League West, despite its realigned and weakened state, but again Davis 
scoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was the youth movement," he said. "We've got a little more 
seasoning this year. Harold Reynolds, Bo, Dwight Smith. We've got what you'd 
call a good blend of youth and age." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis grinned again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got . . . euthanasia!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, they had it, putting the Twins out of their misery early. Now 
it's on to Game 2 and the next act. Staying alive.

SMALL SCORING CHANGE IN TENNIS SERVES UP A CONTROVERSY; DEBATE: GIVING MORE 
WEIGHT TO RESULTS OF DOUBLES MATCHES IS THE SINGLE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION THIS 
SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If basketball can add a three-point shot, and the NFL can add a two-point 
conversion, then the Southern Section can surely add a third of a point to 
doubles sets in boys' high school tennis matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, say many of the section boys' tennis coaches. What seemed to be 
an innocent attempt to make matches more competitive is creating more 
controversy than anyone in the normally staid tennis community believed 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The new scoring system, which awards one point for each singles victory and 1 
1/3 points per doubles victory, was easily passed by the CIF-Southern Section 
Council in January. The rule's intent was to prevent teams with two or three 
talented singles players from winning a match by themselves and to give more 
weight to doubles because there are six players competing, twice as many as in 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: Three singles players could sweep their three sets and account 
for nine of a possible 18 points. With the tiebreaker being game scores, the 
three dominant players often had enough 6-0 or 6-1 victories to overcome their 
school's doubles losses. So three players could essentially beat nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Most coaches agree the new system has accomplished its goal -- to make matches 
more competitive and create more upsets. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all like the system, which has been in effect for more than a month. 
Ocean View's Sean Warner is so unhappy that he has refused to play by the new 
rules, even after his fellow Sunset League coaches and principals voted 7-1 to 
implement the system. 
</P>
<P>
 On two occasions, Warner told an opposing Sunset League coach that he was 
going by the old 18-point scoring system. In one instance, he reported his 
winning score using the old system. The other match was not completed because 
of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner could not be reached for comment, but his star singles player, Jakub 
Pietrowski, said: "I don't think it's a good way to score. If it is in the 
league constitution, of course we'd abide by the rules. If not, we have a right 
to play by the old rules." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ocean View is not the only school still playing the old way. The 21-point 
system is only mandatory during the postseason, not during regular season. Each 
league can decide which scoring system to go by during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ocean League in the Los Angeles area, has decided to stay the course. 
Oddly enough, Beverly Hills Coach Jason Newman, who introduced the new system 
to the CIF-Advisory Committee this year, coaches in that league. 
</P>
<P>
 "That certainly isn't my choice," Newman said, "but there's nothing I can do 
about it, because the coaches here still want the old system." 
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches are calling for a return to the old system, while others, such as 
Mission Viejo's Bill Smith, are hoping yet another can be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'd like to see is something where we'd have kids play both doubles and 
singles," Smith says. "What we're getting now is incomplete players. We're 
doing a terrible disservice to the kids. Every kid you ask will tell you he'd 
like to play doubles and singles." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clark, administrator in charge of boys' tennis for the section, said 
every coach was asked what they thought of Newman's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent out a questionnaire to all the section's coaches, and the 
overwhelming majority was in favor of changing the scoring," Clark said. "The 
vote on the council floor was not very close either. At least two-thirds of the 
leagues supported it." 
</P>
<P>
 So why all the negative feedback? 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar Coach Tim Mang, who introduced the new scoring formula some 
five years ago, isn't sure. But Mang is pleased people are voicing some kind of 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything in life, as soon as they start debating it, is exciting," he said. 
"Things become so stale sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 And if anything, staleness was the old system's worst fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches with three talented players often had little or any work to do before 
or during matches. They could line up their best players and tell them to play 
No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 singles. No strategy, no excitement and no upsets. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the system worked to Corona del Mar's disadvantage in a loss to 
University, which fooled Mang and moved its top singles player to doubles, Mang 
couldn't be more satisfied with what has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about guessing and strategy now," Mang said. "It's a real team 
effort. Now, the coaches have to tell this singles player that they have to 
work out with that guy in doubles. The kids who aren't flexible are going to be 
in trouble. This allows kids to experience different things." 
</P>
<P>
 It also allows tennis coaches to do the same. They are suddenly placed in the 
role of a baseball manager. Before the match, they must make out their lineup 
based on what they believe the opposing coach might do. 
</P>
<P>
 Will they move all their singles players to doubles? Will they move one 
singles player to doubles and leave the rest intact? Or keep their singles 
players in singles but combine their two top doubles players? 
</P>
<P>
 "I get less sleep now and think about big matches more," Mang said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith, whose Mission Viejo team has struggled because of its lack of 
depth, believes there's less thinking involved now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not strategy, it's guessing," he said. "You have no idea what the other 
guy is going to do. If you guess right, you're a hero. If you guess wrong, 
you're a flat-out dog. Each match, you're doing something you don't want to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Smith says, your players are often doing something they don't want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wondering if it will chase more good kids out of high school tennis," he 
said. "Singles is where the money is. That's what the colleges are looking for. 
Dana Hills has a really well-balanced team, but they don't have a player who 
will advance to (South Coast) League semifinals in singles." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith added: "I haven't heard a good word yet about this. Some have said, 
'This is terrible.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Coach Bob Walton doesn't think the new system is terrible, but he 
had concerns similar to Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is geared toward singles rankings, and doubles is in the 
background," he said. "You're almost telling your best players to play doubles 
now. I hope we don't lose some really good players because they have to play 
doubles all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already know of some professional coaches who are using this against us. 
Most pro coaches don't think high school tennis is good for kids anyway. This 
gives them that much more ammunition against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mang responded to Smith's and Walton's remarks with some ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any coach who would say that should hang up his sweat socks," he said. "If 
they have a superstar, then they're not coaching anyway. They're just filling 
out a lineup and watching him play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care who the superstar is, if he respects the coach, he'll play 
anything for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Meyers is University's superstar and had always played singles until 
this season. But in the key victory over Corona del Mar, he played doubles and 
helped University to an upset by scoring four points with three doubles 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like doubles, but it's not my favorite thing," Meyers said. "But if it's 
going to help us win, I'll play doubles. I don't know if I'd want to play all 
year, but in certain matches it's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mang says, there have been instances where star singles players have 
sacrificed and played doubles for an entire career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ricky Leach (at Laguna Beach) played with a weaker player for three years," 
Mang said. "It helped his team, and it really helped the heck out of his 
doubles partner's game." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach played during the early 1980s when doubles sets were worth 1 1/2 points 
and singles sets were worth one. The old system that awarded one point for 
singles and doubles sets was passed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Mang, known as one of the county's better doubles coaches, said he's happy to 
see doubles getting some recognition again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doubles is a different sport," he said. "It's a chess match out there. 
There's so many more strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gets coaches back into coaching more and it might make them earn their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Newman: "I think doubles is healthy, because it gets more kids to the net 
and has them playing more aggressive tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 As the season winds down and the playoffs approach, expect to see more singles 
players rotated to the doubles court and more doubles players moved to singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this what Newman was looking for when he proposed his 21-point system? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always room to make a system better," he said. "But any time we look 
at something, we should ask if it's going to be about teamwork, balance and 
equity." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, even Smith agrees, the 21-point system should be given a fighting 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do, from time to time, need some experimentation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If for nothing else, to create some lively debates.

RELUCTANT SAN CLEMENTE REAPS BIGGEST REWARD FROM SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Gustafson is almost embarrassed to admit it now, but he actually voted 
against the Southern Section's new scoring system for boys' tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson's San Clemente team has made the county's biggest turnaround, 
rebounding from a 1-17 record last season to open 8-1 this year. The reason for 
the turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the new scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson's well-balanced but not star-studded team probably has benefited 
from the sudden emphasis on doubles more than any other in the county. San 
Clemente is not blessed with a highly ranked singles player, but it does have 
some fairly decent doubles players. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Gustafson heard that doubles sets would given one-third of a point 
more weight per set than singles, he knew there was nothing left to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my kids, 'We're going to stack the doubles,' " Gustafson said. "It 
takes a player who understands the team concept to do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Some players weren't too happy about the doubles shift; four lettermen quit 
the team before the season. But those who stayed have bought into the team 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been great to see the kids leave the egos at home," Gustafson said. 
"Once we won our first two matches, it wasn't hard to convince them. It was 
right before their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson said it didn't take long for Trabuco Hills Coach Craig Orr to become 
convinced that doubles was the way to go. San Clemente defeated the Mustangs, 
11 2/3-9 1/3; the result under the old system would have been a loss in the 
tie-breaking games scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Orr) said, 'Thanks for illustrating to my players how to use this system,' " 
Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons have lost only to La Jolla, San Diego County's top-ranked team, 
and breezed through most of their other matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 doubles team of Daniel Roditi and Eli Engle is 15-0. The No. 2 team 
of Jeff Shoemaker and Jason Gavilan is 10-2, and the No. 3 team of John 
Aslanian and John Murphy is 10-5. Therefore, the doubles teams are often 
providing 10 to 12 points a match. Only 10 2/3 points are needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Singles aren't providing much, but Gustafson said their points are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our singles wins have been gratuitous, icing on the cake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson said the real secret to his team's success has been the chemistry 
between his doubles teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put Daniel Roditi with a guy right in the middle of the road in terms of 
talent, and playing with Dan seems to bring out some of Engle's best skills," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson said the natural inclination would have been to mix and match his 
three most talented players with his three least talented, but he said that 
didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of backfired, so I decided to match styles," he said. "That seemed 
to give us the best chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 Had the new system not come into play this season, Gustafson said Engle, 
Shoemaker and Aslanian probably would have played singles. And Roditi, the 
Southern Section individual doubles champion two years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 He would have probably been just another good doubles player on a team going 
nowhere.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS; ELDERS BUILDING A SOLID FOUNDATION 
FOR TITAN TRACK PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton track Coach John Elders is referring to members of this 
year's team as "the pioneers." He regards them as the building blocks to an 
even stronger program in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really thrilled that we've been doing a lot better," Elders said. "I hope 
that we can look back on this year's team as being the one that got us going to 
a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders is still smiling over the Titans' first-place finish last weekend in a 
four-team meet that included the three other Big West Conference teams: UC 
Santa Barbara, Long Beach State and UC Irvine. It marked the first time 
Fullerton has won a team event since track was reinstated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Fullerton's second try at producing a competitive Division I track 
program. The first attempt in the early 1980s fared badly. The Titans wound up 
last in the Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. meet three years in a row, from 
1981-83, and scored a total of only one point in the three meets. And, zap, the 
men's program was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The school had done well in Division II track in the 1970s but quickly found 
that the world was different in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years then, track at Fullerton became a sport only for women. Elders 
was a runner at the school in 1985 and he remembers how discouraging it was to 
members of the men's cross-country team when they had nothing to do in the 
spring except train. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders' goal for his team this year is to be the "king of the have-nots," the 
term he uses for the schools in the Big West whose track budgets fall well 
below those of the league's front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevada and Utah State have budgets well beyond ours," Elders said. "We know 
we don't have a powerhouse program at this stage, but we hope we can finish at 
least third in the conference this season. That's why we were so pleased with 
winning the meet last weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 The big difference between Nevada and Utah State and the other schools in the 
conference, according to Elders, is money. He said both schools have the full 
NCAA allotment of men's scholarship money, the equivalent of 12 full 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have roughly $6,000 in scholarship money for both men's track and 
cross-country," Elders said. "And that's not all money coming from the state. A 
lot is what I fund-raise myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders is optimistic that funding for the track and cross-country programs 
will increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the current administration is sensitive to looking at the individual 
sports and seeing what the needs are," Elders said. "We don't even have team 
sweat suits and we've had to help raise money for some of the team travel in 
the past. . . . We need a $4,000 to $5,000 equipment budget for each of our 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like the coach of any sport. I think ours is the most important, but I 
understand the priority system. I just want to be able to get what I think we 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders acknowledges that being located in Southern California's favorable 
climate zone has significant value. 
</P>
<P>
 "The location is definitely helpful to us in being able to field a competitive 
team," Elders said. "But, obviously, the more resources, the better we'll be." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's new track complex also should help recruiting, Elders says. "It 
makes it easier for a local kid to consider going to Fullerton," he said. 
"Before, we may not have been an option for them without our own track." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend at UC Irvine, highly regarded Titan runner Heather Killeen 
competed in her first meet since she was injured in cross-country, but she's 
still not back to full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was sixth in the 3,000 meters, but she ran very conservatively, just to 
get back into it," Elders said. "She's been back doing training for two months 
and light track workouts for about a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Her time was 10 minutes 33.1 seconds, well off the 9:59.7 winning pace set by 
Laura Monson of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But she's just happy to be back running again," said her mother, Sharon, "and 
she knows she's trying to condense a lot of training into a relatively short 
period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Killeen originally suffered an injured left hip, and then because of 
compensating for it, a problem developed in her right knee in October. That 
caused her to miss the Big West cross-country meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans' other top female distance runner, Tania Nahale, also is recovering 
from an injury. "She's missed two weeks because of a knee problem," Elders 
said. "She's been fitted for some orthopedic in-soles and we're hoping that 
will help." 
</P>
<P>
 Killeen and Nahale run the distance events from 3,000 to 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping now that they'll both be ready for the Big West meet," Elders 
said. The conference meet will be May 13-14 at Las Cruces, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the team's other top performers, sprinter Casie Lozano, had the best 
effort of her career in the 200 meters in the weekend meet, with a time of 
25.48. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton baseball team held its No. 1 spot in the Collegiate Baseball 
rankings but fell back to third on the Baseball America list, which has 
Fullerton ranked behind Florida State and USC. The Titans won two of three 
games against Big West rival UC Santa Barbara over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (26-6) are preparing for another three-game conference series 
Friday night through Sunday afternoon at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching continues to be a strength. The staff earned-run average is 2.62 with 
starters Mike Parisi (1.44) and Matt Wagner (1.46) leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ferguson has the top batting average (.347) among the regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Dante Powell, a preseason All-American choice, is behind the pace 
of his last two seasons. He's hitting .279 after reaching .335 in 1993 and .307 
in 1992. Powell, however, is tied for the team lead in runs batted in with 
Ferguson at 27. Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The women's gymnastics team will compete in the NCAA West Regional Saturday at 
Boise, Idaho. The Titans' Celeste Delia is tied for 20th nationally in the 
all-around. . . . The Titan basketball honors banquet will be held at 7 p.m. 
April 28 at the Fullerton Marriott.

THREE TITAN GYMNASTS ON BIG WEST ACADEMIC TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton gymnastics program placed three athletes on the Big 
West Conference's All-Academic team, which was released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Christi Clifford, Kristi Mardyn and Karena Mills made the team.Mardyn, a 
sophomore biology major from Coquitlam, Canada, had the highest grade-point 
average of any team member (3.91) and the sixth-highest among all conference 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford, a sophomore kinesiology/health promotion major, had a GPA of 3.53; 
Mills, a senior majoring in biology, had a GPA of 3.53. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 77 conference athletes who maintained at least a 3.2 grade-point 
average, competed in at least 50% of their program's competition and were 
sophomores or higher. This is the first time the Big West Conference has named 
an all-academic team. Other local athletes honored: 
</P>
<P>
 Women's basketball -- Fullerton's Shayla Bradshaw, sophomore, undeclared 
major, 3.37; UC Irvine's Michelle Kahler, junior, social sciences/economics, 
3.45. 
</P>
<P>
 Men's swimming and diving -- UCI's Elijah Fan, sophomore, undeclared, 3.27; 
Pat McDonough, junior, social sciences, 3.79. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's swimming and diving -- UCI's Dena Amr, junior, biological sciences, 
3.53; April Gibbs, junior, biological services, 3.78.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; GLENDALE'S GANTT PITCHES A PERFECT GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH

<P>
 David Gantt struck out James Downs on a full-count pitch to complete a perfect 
game and lead Glendale High to a 7-0 victory over Artesia on Tuesday in a Babe 
Herman tournament game at Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 Gantt (1-3), a senior right-hander, went to three balls on only one other 
hitter and did not allow a ball to reach the outfield.He struck out seven, 
induced 13 ground balls and one popup to the second baseman. Gantt also had 
three hits and drove in a run for Glendale (6-6). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar 5, Monroe 1 -- It promised to be the finest pitching duel in Valley 
Pac-8 Conference play. Sylmar's Carlos Velazco versus Monroe's Joel Zamudio. 
Each lost only one game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 With college and professional scouts behind the backstop clocking pitches, the 
game was everything it should have been -- until the bottom of third inning 
when Zamudio bowed out because of shoulder pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on a sharp curveball, Velazco (5-1) pitched a three-hitter, striking 
out 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Monday) I felt so good," Zamudio said. "If there was a game (Monday) I would 
have thrown good." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamudio struck out four of the first seven batters he faced. Then in the 
second, after loading the bases on three walks, he took himself out of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Perez (2-3) relieved Zamudio with one out in the third and retired the 
side four pitches later on a line drive that was turned into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sylmar (12-3, 3-0 in conference play) scored twice in the fourth on RBI 
singles by Hiram Damwijk and Xavier Gutierrez. PAIGE A. LEECH

WITH TAYLOR IN CONTROL, MOORPARK BEATS CANYONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a case study of two pitchers, one in command of his deliveries for most 
of the game and the other struggling to stay on the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 For Moorpark College right-hander Brad Taylor, throwing strikes consistently 
paid big dividends as he led the Raiders to a 10-5 victory over College of the 
Canyons in a Western State Conference interdivisional game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 His Cougar counterpart, right-hander Gary Stephenson, fought control problems 
during his 5 1/3-inning stint and his teammates could never quite do enough 
damage against Taylor in a game both teams desperately needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (13-10-1, 6-3 in conference play) trails North Division-leading 
Cuesta (8-2) by 1 1/2 games. Canyons (9-14, 5-8), which has lost six 
consecutive games, fell three games behind front-running Pierce in the South 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy to get out of here with a win," Moorpark Coach Ken Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor (3-2), a sophomore from Moorpark High, worked eight strong innings and 
got the offensive support he needed to pick up the victory. He allowed five 
hits, struck out 11 and walked four and did not give up a hit until Ted Kiester 
homered to right with one out in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad had a good curveball today and he was throwing it over for strikes," 
Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders broke away from a 4-2 lead with five runs in the sixth and cruised 
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Aaron Fischer led off the inning with his fifth home run, a 
towering shot against Stephenson (2-3) that opened the floodgates. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hits and two walks later, including run-producing singles by Sean 
Mitchell and Ryan Briggs, and a sacrifice fly to center field by Kent Cote, and 
the Raiders had blown the game open against Stephenson and reliever Anthony 
Chessani. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, who had done a commendable job of staying in the game and trailed 
only 4-2 after five innings despite yielding seven walks, threw 127 pitches and 
seemed to run out of steam. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Cougar bats didn't seem to have much energy either. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Kiester's home run and a two-run shot by John Billingslea in the 
seventh after David Castillo reached base on an error, the Cougars managed only 
three other hits, all singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not pitching in the clutch and we are not hitting in the clutch," 
Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. "We are doubting ourselves now, I think."

up seven hits and two earned runs. In a 10-2 victory at Hoover, he pitched a 
six-hitter and struck out 14. On Saturday, Parque pitched only three innings 
because of the state rule that limits pitchers to 10 innings a week. Parque 
struck out 10, four in the third inning after a Montclair Prep batter reached 
base on a passed ball. That resulted in an unearned run and saddled him with 
the loss in a 4-3 defeat. "He continues to impress everybody," Falcon Coach 
Tony Zarrillo said. "He just has a great blend of pitches."

MATADORS GET NO RELIEF, LOSE TO LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Vasey was well rested. 
</P>
<P>
 So was Tyler Nelson, albeit for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pair's career-best efforts for Cal State Northridge, the Matadors 
were shocked by seventh-ranked Long Beach State, which rallied to score five 
times in the bottom of the ninth inning Tuesday night and steal a 7-6 victory 
in a nonconference game before 628 at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey, a junior right-hander from Moorpark College, hadn't pitched since 1991, 
his senior year at Simi Valley High. Not that he was your run-of-the-mill high 
school pitcher: He was 10-1 and was named The Times' Ventura County pitcher of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey, in perhaps the best performance by a Northridge pitcher this year, 
scattered three hits through eight innings, but it only served to postpone a 
disappointing end. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (18-17) held a 6-2 lead in the ninth before Vasey wore down and 
surrendered a leadoff triple to Ryan Miller and a run-scoring single to Nate 
Vopata. After he walked Kirk Pierce, reliever Jason Vargas (1-3) was summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who lost to Long Beach (23-7) in relief last week, didn't record an 
out. He walked the first two batters to force in a run before Eric Martins 
stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Martins ripped a double into the gap in left-center to clear the bases and win 
it for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback wrecked strong efforts from Vasey and Nelson. Vasey had a 
run-scoring single, has hit safely in five consecutive games and is 10 for 20 
over that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, another 1991 Simi Valley graduate, had been on hiatus of a different 
sort. Before Tuesday night, he spent two games on the sideline in Coach Bill 
Kernen's doghouse, along with six other teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Nelson was allowed to suit up and was inserted at third base, his 
customary position. He remembered how to get there, and showed he hadn't 
forgotten what the bat was for, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson had two hits and drove in two runs, including a double to drive home 
Vasey with the go-ahead run that broke a 2-2 tie in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson later scored on a groundout by James (Scoody) Woods for a 4-2 lead. 
Freshman catcher Eric Gillespie, who played his home games for Millikan High at 
Blair Field last year, singled to center to drive in Jonathan Campbell, but 
Steve Moreno was tossed out at the plate for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey wasn't finished, however. In the seventh, Jason Shanahan reached base on 
a throwing error and took second on a passed ball. Vasey singled to center, 
driving home Shanahan for a 6-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (22-8) took a 2-0 lead on the legs of Rolando Avila and Ryan 
Miller, who manufactured a pair of runs in the first two innings. Each sparked 
mini-rallies by stealing second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila was thrown out at third base in the third by Gillespie, however, 
snapping a streak of 25 consecutive stolen bases. STEVE ELLING

MAN ABOUT CLOWN; FIXATIONS: TIM TEGGE CARRIES ON THE TRADITION OF HIS FATHER'S 
O.C.-BASED MINI-CIRCUS AND DREAMS OF OPENING A MUSEUM AND RESEARCH CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike so many kids growing up in this century, Tim Tegge never got to dream 
of running away from home and joining the circus. He was already there. That's 
the problem when your dad's a clown. 
</P>
<P>
 From the age of 3, Tegge, now 36, has been following in his father's big 
floppy footsteps. With his family's tiny troupe -- named the TNT Circus after 
his initials -- then on his own, and more recently with his wife of five years, 
Gigi, the circus has been his life. For their honeymoon, in fact, the pair went 
out clowning with a circus in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 They sometimes work 100 nights in a row, living in a van and slogging through 
devastating weather, yet on their first night off they'll travel out of their 
way to see another circus perform. In crisscrossing the nation they also have 
amassed a 10,000-piece collection of circus memorabilia and lore. It currently 
resides in several Orange County storage units, but the Tegges have a dream of 
making it the core of a circus museum and research center. 
</P>
<P>
 "People now might just go, 'Eh, so what?' But years ago the circus coming to 
town was the big thing," Tim said. "Even in the '30s and '40s, they would close 
down schools and let businesses out at noon so people could go to the circus. 
People saved all year long to go to it. It was a big deal . . . as big as 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't such a big deal when Tegge was growing up in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "While all the kids in school were out organizing their baseball games and all 
that, I was playing with my circus toys. That was pretty much a 
geek-of-the-world kind of thing at the time. They couldn't comprehend anybody 
doing that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tegge was a tyke, his father worked for a company that made automotive 
diagnostic equipment, but he loved clowning and did it on the side, calling in 
sick when he had a conflicting gig at a party, picnic or store grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally one day when he had a booking, my mom called the office and said, 
'He's not coming in today or tomorrow. In fact, he's not coming in at all. He 
quits.' She hung up and my dad goes, 'Uh oh, what did you do?' She said, 'You 
wanna do this, you got three years to try to make it. If it doesn't work, back 
to the office.' He never went back." 
</P>
<P>
 Tegge's own maiden stint behind the big red nose came when his father booked a 
Fourth of July celebration parade in one of the Chicago suburbs. He put 
3-year-old Tim in makeup too and had him pedal his trike behind the clown 
float. By the end of the parade, he was bushed -- and hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 He began performing with his father whenever he could, though he said the 
fledgling TNT circus was a far cry from Barnum and Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, some of those early shows were pretty bad," Tegge recalled. "(My dad 
would) have one or two professional acts and he'd do balloon animals and stuff. 
To fill time he'd get a bunch of kids from some dance school doing baton 
twirling or something. He'd hire an organist from church and instead of having 
'Ta-dah!' you'd get 'Amen.' It was just awful." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Tegge was 14, it had become a real, albeit small, circus, touring 
the Midwest with some 20 members and animals. He wanted to be on the road all 
the time but was kept at home by his mom during the school months so he'd have 
some semblance of a normal childhood. Not that it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated school and just went along with what I had to do, waiting for summer. 
I was just crazy for that. I loved being out there. I wanted to always be in 
clown makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 His father had started the circus in 1960, and moved the family to Orange 
County in 1976. "By 1984 he was slowing down pretty bad and was diagnosed with 
cancer -- he smoked like a chimney. But he wanted to get in that 25th year, and 
he managed to, working a few dates in 1985 before it got impossible for him to 
travel anymore. He died in April, 1985," Tegge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tegge considered keeping the family circus going, but an insurance crunch at 
the time made it nearly impossible for small shows to get liability coverage. 
Animal-rights activists were also up in arms then over shows' treatment of 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 While animals aren't necessarily asked their opinion before being drafted into 
performing, neither are they mistreated, Tegge maintains. When one has the 
better part of a house invested in an elephant, you're inclined to treat it 
well, Tegge maintains. He says there is also often a close bond between human 
and animal, though there can be risks for both. "I knew a woman years ago who 
worked with the same group of elephants for 30 years and had one particular 
elephant where they were as close to being soul-mates as you could imagine. And 
one day the elephant just decided that was it and he stepped on her, put a tusk 
through her and killed her instantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Though life on the road is always difficult (they don't have a home here but 
stay in Santa Ana with Gigi's mom when they're in California), Tegge says 
circuses are in an upswing, buoyed in part by the new audience attracted by the 
innovative Cirque de Soleil. Along with the huge three-ring circuses, Tegge 
estimates, there are some 60 small outfits now working, including his own Prof. 
Tegge's Circus Clown Revue. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new audiences, there is also a new generation of circus performer, 
young artists with no tradition or bloodlines in the craft. One such person is 
his wife -- Gigi, 24, who was working in a Garden Grove comic book store when 
she and Tim met six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always into clowns, but I never thought of them as real people," Gigi 
said. "When he told me he did a circus, I thought, 'That's a real profession?' 
Except for Ringling Bros., you don't see circuses out here." 
</P>
<P>
 They dated for a year, though he was gone on tour much of time, and then 
married. Meanwhile, he'd been offered a clowning gig in the Midwest, and Gigi 
insisted he take it, with the proviso that she be his partner. "So that was it. 
The day after we got married we headed in the car for Illinois, he put me in 
makeup, we did it, and that was our honeymoon," she said, turning to Tim: 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God you're a clown! There's no way you would've gotten me in the air on 
a trapeze or in a lion's cage." She is learning Western rope spinning from an 
80-year-old Wild West show friend of Tim's, and they're working up an illusion 
where she's in a box he sticks swords through. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim, for his part, is glad Gigi didn't come from a circus background. "If 
they're from a circus family, often what happens is you find you don't marry a 
person; you marry a whole family, an act. So you think you're getting a wife 
but you're getting a teeter-board troupe." 
</P>
<P>
 The circus world is a small one, as they found during one of their two tours 
in Japan. "Traveling during a night off by bullet train and cab to see a small 
Japanese circus, we got there just in time to see the parade of performers, and 
right in the middle were these German people that worked for my dad 20 years 
ago that I hadn't seen since." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan trips were high points in a profession that has a lot of low ones, 
especially, he says, for people who go into it not knowing what to expect. The 
Ringling Bros. Clown College, for example, may turn out fine clowns, but 
they're "Ringling-ized," he says, expecting ideal conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "So they get diplomas and are officially clowns, and wind up in (a tiny) 
circus, stuck in the mud having their truck pulled out by an elephant, when 
it's good and ready to. It's enough to send anybody packing home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we were up to our knees in mud for 27 days straight. Sometimes you 
can't get enough electricity, can't get hay for the animals, and your wardrobe 
gets ruined in the mud. And the longer it goes on the worse it makes you feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, they find, bad weather has a positive effect on attendance. "You 
get big audiences when it's pouring," Gigi said. "There's nothing else to do 
outside, so they really want to see us falling down in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing that and living in a van that breaks down, there's a lot of harshness 
to it, but it's romantic in a way too, a life that most people never see." 
</P>
<P>
 The main payoff, both Tegges say, is the effect they can have on audiences. 
Especially within the intimacy of the small one-ring circus, Tim said, "there's 
nothing quite like the feeling of going out in front of an audience and being 
able to entertain. It's like a gift you can keep giving somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy bringing the house down if I can," Gigi said. "From the sentimental 
side, I love the little kids that make little notes or pictures of the clown 
and give them to me. In Japan, kids would come to the show -- they must've seen 
it more than once -- and would bring presents for the clowns. That drives me 
nuts. That's one of the best things ever for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim loves being a part of a living tradition that he says even is evidenced in 
cave drawings and certainly was in full swing by the glory days of Rome. He's 
passionate about documenting circus history and devotes much of his free time 
to it. Because he's been in the circus world most of his life, old-timers 
readily share their memories with him and often pass on treasures they could 
easily sell for high prices. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a collection of stunning stone lithographs dating back to the turn of 
the century, many of which would start at $5,000 at auction. He has thousands 
of photos and slides, letters from P.T. Barnum and other luminaries and will 
often detour to tiny towns to scour old newspaper microfilms for information on 
old traveling shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "People now can't imagine a time when a circus train with 100 boxcars would 
pull into a city and unload 400 horses, 20 or 30 elephants, camels, zebras, 
lions, tigers, marching bands, 2,000 people, a tent you could barely see to the 
other end of," Tim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gigi continued, "Heading into WWI, the military followed the Ringling show 
around to find out how they could transport 2,000 people and thousands of 
animals and tents overnight so efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 With most of his 36 years spent in the circus, Tim sometimes gets a special 
thrill in his researches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a few weeks ago I went into a bookstore to look at this guy's old circus 
books. I got to talking with him and asked him if he had any kind of paper 
ephemera or anything else circus-related that wasn't on the shelf. He says 
yeah, and in his back room he pulled out some old programs and sandwiched in 
with all this stuff was something from the TNT Circus. As we get around the 
country I sometimes see scrapbooks and things that I turn up in. It's weird to 
think I'll be historical someday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With her five years, Gigi is already thoroughly immersed in the clown's life. 
"My old high school friends think it's pretty weird, I guess. Most of my 
friends now are in the circus. What we do is a conversation piece for other 
people. They ask us, 'What are you gonna have for babies? Kids with white faces 
and red noses?' "

KERNEN'S MESSAGE FOOLS NORTHRIDGE 6 LIKE A SLOW CURVE; COLLEGE BASEBALL: 
BENCHED PLAYERS JUST STARTING TO REALIZE THAT ANGRY COACH WASN'T KIDDING 
AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thing is, Bill Kernen rarely smiles once he puts on the Cal State 
Northridge uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, he thinks there are members of his team who still believe he's been 
fooling around when he benched a pack of players over the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some didn't fully realize that I wasn't kidding," Kernen said. "Now they're 
thinking, 'Hmmm.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Six players are thinking exactly that, and then some, though one more Matador 
worked his way out of Kernen's doghouse Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kernen blacklist continued into its seventh day when the coach again 
refused to let a half-dozen players suit up Tuesday night for a nonconference 
game won by Long Beach, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 In what has come to resemble a daily player vigil, Kernen said he will decide 
Thursday who makes the trip for a crucial three-game series at San Diego State. 
Northridge and San Diego State are tied atop the Western Athletic Conference 
West Division standings with 6-3 records. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, Kernen benched several starters for what he termed an overall 
lack of fortitude and made the team play a nonconference game with Cal Lutheran 
without its uniform shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, seven players -- including four starters -- were left behind as 
Northridge ventured to Malibu and defeated Pepperdine, 6-4. The seven made 
their way to the game on their own and watched from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious players learned who was making the trip by reading a list posted on 
the dugout wall. Twelve players dressed for the game, leaving as many coaches 
(three) as players in the dugout when Northridge was in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire team made the trip to Long Beach because of liability reasons; 
because the benched players haven't been officially removed from the team, they 
no longer will be allowed to travel to games on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 One player was granted a reprieve Tuesday and moved from street clothes and 
the grandstand into the starting lineup. And third baseman Tyler Nelson was 
more than glad to hear the news, though he wasn't particularly sure why he was 
excused from detention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess (Kernen) thought about it some more," Nelson said. "I'm just glad to 
be back." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kernen: "Nelson's stuff was minor in comparison with the others. He 
didn't have the same severity problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to work my way through this. I've talked to some people. I'm 
still looking for some answers (on other players)." 
</P>
<P>
 Six others remain in limbo: pitchers Rick Orr, Evan Howland and James Hines, 
infielder Keyaan Cook, outfielder Kevin Howard and catcher Josh Smaler. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen admitted for the first time that he feels badly for the seniors and 
players who haven't been in his doghouse because he knows he isn't putting his 
best possible product on the field. But he said he won't compromise his 
standards nor the program's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to win a league championship with this," Kernen said, 
motioning toward the field. "The worst feeling is for the guys who have been 
with us all the way and didn't get a chance to win it or lose it on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "But hey, it wasn't working before with those (benched) guys, so it was a 
no-risk move." 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen met Tuesday with Northridge Athletic Director Bob Hiegert -- who 
coached the baseball team to NCAA Division II titles in 1970 and 1984 -- to 
discuss the details of the weeklong affair. Kernen said the two will meet again 
today "for a progress report." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said the two discussed Kernen's decision to play without uniform 
shirts last week -- an NCAA violation -- and about the players' sardonic 
decision before the game to fly the American flag over the dugout at 
half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "That won't happen again," Hiegert said, referring to both situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen said he has met with each of the exiled players individually, but says 
that their status likely will not change.  
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers Marco Contreras and John Najar also spoke with the coach before the 
Long Beach game and made a plea on their teammates' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no guarantee more players won't ride pine, either. Just because the 
list shrunk by one Tuesday doesn't mean it couldn't grow. Here today, gone 
tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a day-to-day thing," Kernen said. "It's never going to be completely 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever's out there in uniform are going to be the guys who give me 100%."

 Federal spending -- In a story carried Monday by The Times, the Associated 
Press erroneously reported that the federal government spent an average of 
$4,599 for every American last year. The fiscal 1993 figure actually was 
$4,814. The $4,599 figure was the amount spent in fiscal 1992.

ACQUISITION OF VAN NUYS SOFTWARE FIRM PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Formation of a new major player in the personal-computer supplies industry was 
proposed Monday as hardware distributor AmeriQuest Technologies Inc. said it 
intends to acquire software distributor Kenfil Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-stock deal would be worth $17.5 million at Tuesday's market price for 
AmeriQuest shares -- although the actual value depends on stock prices several 
months from now. 
</P>
<P>
 If the purchase is completed, Van Nuys-based Kenfil would become an AmeriQuest 
division. Its addition would nearly triple the revenue of Irvine-based 
AmeriQuest, boosting it into the $300-million-plus category that some analysts 
believe is the minimum size needed to survive and grow in an increasingly 
competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are several huge distributors, like Santa Ana-based Ingram 
Micro Inc., with sales in the $1-billion to $3-billion range, there are fewer 
than a dozen in the $300-million-plus category, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would give AmeriQuest a big boost by providing it the software 
to sell to users of the computer equipment it markets, creating a unified 
company that eases retailers' shopping chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal makes sense because it is happening in an industry where you must 
grow to survive," said Ian Gilson, analyst with L.H. Friend, Weinress & Frankso 
investment brokerage in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But before AmeriQuest can expand through the Kenfil acquisition there is 
likely to be some shrinkage: Layoffs among the companies' combined 300 
employees are likely as the two consolidate warehousing and administrative 
positions. Company officials said they did not know how many jobs would go. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the combination is likely to benefit both companies by reducing 
overhead and broadening customer bases, it is unlikely to translate into price 
cuts that would be noticed by retail consumers of the goods AmeriQuest and 
Kenfil now distribute, officials of both companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do expect substantial savings through economies of scale," said Michael 
Rusert, AmeriQuest executive vice president and chief operating officer, "but 
it shouldn't affect the street prices" of the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
 The AmeriQuest software division, to be called AmeriQuest/Kenfil, would be led 
by Kenfil president and chief executive Irwin A. Bransky, who started the 
company in his Van Nuys garage in 1983. He would report to Carol Miltner, 
AmeriQuest's executive vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 The software sales and marketing operation would be run out of Van Nuys, but 
all other management and administrative functions will be consolidated in 
Irvine, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And most shipping and warehousing would be consolidated at AmeriQuest's 
central shipping and storage facility in Wilmington, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 That marks Kenfil's California warehousing operations in Van Nuys and Valencia 
as well as its warehouse in Salt Lake City and AmeriQuest's warehouse in Irvine 
as targets for elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenfil, with 150 employees and $191 million in sales last year, is one of the 
country's largest software distributors. Its clients include corporate users, 
retailers such as Egghead Discount Software stores, and mass merchandisers, 
including the Office Depot chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The company distributes more than 3,500 titles from publishers, including 
WordPerfect Corp., Peachtree Software, Corel, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. But it 
lacks distribution agreements with industry giants Microsoft, Lotus and 
Ashton-Tate. Those companies won't deal with Kenfil because it doesn't have 
enough vendors, said Peter Grubstein, Kenfil's chief operating officer. But the 
combined vendor bases after the acquisition could prove attractive to the giant 
software companies, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The company raised almost $6 million in December with a private stock sale to 
investors led by the Wendover Financial Group in Los Angeles. Company officials 
said at the time they intended to use much of the capital to spur growth 
through acquisitions and by improving sales and service. 
</P>
<P>
 With an additional 3.9 million shares to be issued to Kenfil shareholders and 
lenders in the proposed acquisition, the Wendover and Kenfil groups each would 
own 33% of the company with 11.7 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Kenfil stockholders would get one share of AmeriQuest 
common stock for every three shares of Kenfil common stock. Simultaneously, 
holders of approximately $7.3 million of Kenfil notes would exchange their debt 
for additional shares of AmeriQuest common stock. At Tuesday's closing price of 
$4.75 a share for AmeriQuest stock, the deal values Kenfil shares at $1.58.
