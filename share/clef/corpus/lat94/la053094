 MEMORIAL DAY: Former Marine Commandant Gen. P. X. Kelley kicked off memorial 
observances with a patriotic address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library 
(B1). While others flock to the beach today, veterans prefer to solemnly 
remember their fallen compatriots. . . . Two Navy bases and a former Air Force 
base, now Camarillo Airport, have lured many veterans to the region, 
particularly to Camarillo. Councilman Stan Daily said he understands his city's 
allure: "Most veterans have gone through hell one time or another and they know 
heaven when they see it."

 AUTHOR! AUTHOR! On page 39 of her self-published "Homeowners & Contractors 
Guide to the Building Department," Simi Valley Councilwoman Sandi Webb poses 
the question: "How long does it take for a plan check?" Beneath the question 
lies a caricature of a rotund bureaucrat happily snoozing on his desk. That and 
other barbs did not win the councilwoman any friends in her city's building 
department. "They were mad," Webb said. But the guidebook needed a light touch 
and she wasn't singling out Simi Valley. "These guys have to lighten up a 
little bit."

 WORLD CUP: As Pasadena prepares to host the biggest sports event in the world, 
Oxnard has its own little piece of next month's action. . . . Volunteers have 
spent months plowing, planting and tending fresh turf behind the Oxnard College 
gym. It'll soon become the official training site of the Cameroonian soccer 
team. On Thursday,, officials dedicate the two new soccer fields. Said college 
spokeswoman Cathy Garnica: "We are going to thank the volunteers for everything 
they've done to turn this weedy field into a soccer field."

 GULL LOVERS' TRAVELS: Sea gull chicks are pecking their way out of eggshells 
on Anacapa and other Channel Islands (B1). Their downy brown fuzz blends 
perfectly with the foliage, making them difficult to detect. . . . But their 
fuzzy camouflage isn't their only protection. Protective parents squawk, flap 
their wings and even dive-bomb intruders. Where Veterans Live

 Percentage of Ventura cities' residents who are veterans: Camarillo: 14.1%

 A recent poll by the Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press found that 
only 50% of Americans correctly named Boris Yeltsin as Russia's president. 
</P>
<P>
 That was better than the 13% who knew that Boutros Boutros-Ghali is the United 
Nations secretary general and the 40% who knew that the Palestinians are the 
people with whom Israel reached a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 So who are Americans familiar with? 
</P>
<P>
 According to a new Gallup Poll, 69% of adults age 18 to 49 can successfully 
identify television producer Aaron Spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling's work includes such current hit shows as "Beverly Hills 90210" and 
"Melrose Place" as well as such older shows as "Charlie's Angels" and "The Love 
Boat." Balkan Surprise

<P>
 One of the more colorful characters in the ongoing saga of beleaguered studio 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is Giovanni DiStefano, a former Beverly Hills resident and 
associate of former MGM owner Giancarlo Parretti. 
</P>
<P>
 DiStefano got a batch of ink in late 1992 when he proclaimed he was buying the 
studio with colorful financier Bernard Cornfeld. The studio laughed off 
DiStefano's bid. 
</P>
<P>
 An update on DiStefano was published last week in the Sunday Star Times in New 
Zealand, where DiStefano remains a notorious figure, having been banned there 
after an alleged investment scam. 
</P>
<P>
 DiStefano is now a Serbian businessman, the newspaper said, heading a 
multimillion housing housing project. Among the bizarre revelations in the 
story is that DiStefano's passport "bears the home address of Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic." The President and the King 
</P>
<P>
 The death last month of former President Richard Nixon has sparked a renewed 
interest in his Administration, as evidenced by the attention given diaries of 
his late chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes what undoubtedly is the most unusual Nixon nostalgia book: "The Day 
Elvis Met Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 The $18.95 book, for sale at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba 
Linda, is an account of the half-hour 1970 meeting between Nixon and Elvis 
written by Egil (Bud) Krogh, former Nixon deputy counsel and meeting 
eyewitness. 
</P>
<P>
 The book reveals that Krogh first learned Elvis wanted to meet Nixon with 
"Elvis handing a letter requesting to see the President to a startled guard at 
the Northwest Gate of the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 Krogh says Nixon and Elvis rummaged through a drawer looking at such 
presidential souvenirs as golf balls, cuff links and pins. The book also 
pictures an honorary badge Nixon presented Elvis making him a special assistant 
in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, something historians have noted 
as ironic given revelations about Presley's drug habits that emerged after he 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included is what undoubtedly are some of the last words penned by Nixon. 
On the back of the cover is a statement from Nixon dated eight days before he 
died congratulating Krogh on the book, saying it "shatters many of the myths 
that have spread" about the meeting.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; EAGLES OFFER A VISION OF THE FUTURE; REUNITED BAND GOES 
BEYOND EASY NOSTALGIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<P>
 The Eagles certainly didn't take it easy in returning to concerts after 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of playing it safe by simply serving up the two dozen or so of the 
best-known Eagles tunes in a nostalgia-to-the-max reunion package, the most 
celebrated Southern California band since the '60s gamely threw all sorts of 
surprises at the audience on Friday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise 1: Defying the conventional concert wisdom of saving your signature 
tune for a climactic moment late in the show, the Eagles opened with "Hotel 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise 2: Instead of inviting the audience to then settle into a golden 
oldies mode by following with such peaceful, easy trademark hits such as "Take 
It Easy," the band followed "Hotel California" with more challenging fare -- 
four more songs from the "Hotel California" album, including "Wasted Time" and 
"Pretty Maids All in a Row." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise 3: After devoting most of the opening hour to old Eagles material, 
the quintet shifted emphasis dramatically in the second half to focus on new 
Eagles tunes and the members' solo works. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise 4: The group didn't perform "The Long Run," "Best of My Love," "Last 
Resort," "Sad Cafe," "On the Border," "Take It Easy" or "Peaceful Easy Feeling" 
at all. The result: Only 13 of the 29 songs were from the Eagles '70s 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggest Surprise: The show still worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good party," a beaming Glenn Frey said at one point, looking out at the 
15,000 cheering fans as he stood on a stage whose set resembled a Mad Max-like 
industrial wasteland -- in keeping with the apocalyptic nature of some Eagles 
songs. "Real good party." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was equally enthused. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans, some of whom had come from as far away as New York and Kentucky to toast 
the start of the group's first tour since their bitter 1980 breakup, shouted, 
"Thank you" and "We love you" throughout the show. Many sang along with all the 
hits and danced in front of their seats to the upbeat tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the selection of songs suggested that the Eagles had more on their minds 
than merely the applause of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the talk about the tour simply being a one-time, money-driven affair, 
the Eagles were intent on demonstrating that, indeed, the band is in for the 
long run -- that the reason Frey, Don Henley, Don Felder, Joe Walsh and Timothy 
B. Schmit came back together after all these years was to resume writing and 
recording together. 
</P>
<P>
 And that issue -- the recapturing of the band's old creative spark -- is the 
real challenge facing the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 The band wasted little time Friday in passing Test One of the reunion 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 By midway through the opening hour, it was clear that the Eagles remain the 
masters of such '70s trademarks as sweet, seductive harmonies and precise but 
flavorful musicianship. It was also apparent that the band's best songs -- 
including "Hotel California" and "Desperado" -- speak of social and personal 
morality in ways that remain relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether the Eagles will be able to come up with new songs that 
continue to reflect on human rituals and rites with equal insight and skill. 
That is the more important Test Two -- and an answer isn't likely until the 
band delivers an album of new material, possibly next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the group is trying to encourage fans to look forward -- not just 
backward. The solo material -- notably Henley's "Heart of the Matter," "New 
York Minute" and "Boys of Summer" -- served as a bridge and helped add a more 
contemporary edge to the evening's tone. Similarly, the turning of the 
microphone over to Frey, Walsh and Schmit for solo turns was a reminder that 
the band isn't just a Henley or Henley-Frey proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four new tunes being introduced on the tour, the most striking is the 
fiery "Get Over It," a wickedly satiric reflection by Henley and Frey on '90s 
political correctness, with a strong commercial feel to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, who were joined on various numbers by four support musicians, 
haven't tried to add flash to their performances. The quintet still simply 
relies on its music -- and that music still serves them well. The Eagles are 
once again flying high. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; ROTELLA WARMS AUDIENCE BY PLAYING IT COOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a musician works with subtlety, there's usually one immediate payback: 
People don't talk during the performance; they listen. They aurally lean 
forward, opening their ears and trying to gather in what the artist on stage is 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Thom Rotella, who worked before a full house Saturday night at 
Randell's, knows about the value of subtlety. Everything he played in his first 
set came from a place of understatement, and most people in the room sat 
quietly, paying attention to what he was doing. His music drew people in; it 
didn't push them back. And at the conclusion of his selections, or after one of 
his multinoted, intriguing solos -- often dropped in over a rock-based pulse 
but crammed with jazz-based activity -- generous applause filled the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart man, that Thom Rotella. And a darned good musician to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the 41-year-old native of Niagara Falls, N.Y., worked toward a common 
denominator, delivering tune after tune that had a lyrical, pop-leaning flavor, 
or at least a melody that was accessible to the general listener. And these 
tunes, which crackled with a muscular yet never overbearing rhythmic drive set 
up by drummer David Dirge, bassist Reggie McBride and percussionist Arnold 
Lucas, were filled with surprises, which added interest.  
</P>
<P>
 Just when you thought there might be a guitar solo after a gentle melody, as 
on "Bring on the Night," there came a solo by Bill Cantos on keyboards. Or 
where the same tune suddenly ended, with an on-the-money tag, right after 
Rotella's solo. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-set program was built around six natty Rotella originals, several 
drawn from his three solo albums on DMP Records. These relaxed, pop-tinged, 
rhythmic selections were augmented by the James Taylor evergreen, "Fire and 
Rain," and the snappy '50s blues, "Let the Good Times Roll" -- made popular by 
Ray Charles and done here as an engaging shuffle. All these numbers were played 
with crispness and spark by Rotella's quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist also kept listeners involved by juxtaposing moods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bring on the Night" was perky and bubbly, as was "Best Friends," while "The 
Child" was tender, intimate, emotional. "Baka," though soft and slow, rippled 
with an undercurrent of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist's numbers were arranged so that sections within pieces shifted 
in feeling, heightening interest and curiosity. For example, "Fire and Rain" 
moved back and forth from brief solos to statements of the song's well-worn 
melody. On "Almare," Rotella played the melody alone, then was joined by Cantos 
and McBride, the sound thickening pleasingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for using an acoustic, gut-stringed guitar for the opening "Almare," 
the leader stuck with his Gibson L-4 electric jazz guitar, and emitted a tone 
that emulated the great Wes Montgomery. This vibrant, glowing sound stood front 
and center in the renditions, and gave an appealing jazz flavor to even the 
most rock-based pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baka" was the set's primary guitar feature. The recently composed song is 
Rotella's version of the classic Montgomery tune, "Bumpin' on Sunset," and was 
done at a let's-not-hurry, finger-popping pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a rhythmic platform that swayed easily, Rotella delivered a typical solo, 
using body language -- he leaned forward and back, bent his knees, closed his 
eyes, tightened his face into a grimace -- while mixing in all manner of 
listenable, melodic elements.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were one-note ideas, bounced back and forth over the bubbling rhythm. 
There were chunky chords that seemed to emit streams of light. There were long, 
serpentine-like flurries that led to brief, simpler ideas. This manner of 
employing what were essentially jazz-based improvisational statements over rock 
and pop beats gave Rotella's solos a broad appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantos, Lucas, McBride and Dirge brightened the show. Cantos used a gentle 
touch at his small Korg electronic keyboard, sometimes emitting fat, Hammond 
B-3 organ-like tones, or shimmering whines. He sang wordless vocals 
occasionally, the opening to "The Child" being particularly poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas was never at a loss to add color and texture, whapping his congas and 
bongos heartily, slapping a cymbal, running his fingers down a set of thin 
chimes to add a glistening sound.  
</P>
<P>
 McBride and Dirge understood each other's sense of time, establishing 
rock-solid bottom pulses that kept the band ever on track.

THEATER REVIEWS; LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE BRINGS 'HARVEY' INTO HARE AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing dated about "Harvey," Mary Chase's 50-year-old play, is that if 
an Elwood P. Dowd truly believed today that his best friend was a 6-foot, 1 
1/2-inch invisible rabbit, he'd be the toast of the daytime talk-show circuit, 
with a fat book contract on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you can put "Harvey" firmly in its time period, a time when social 
standing was directly tied in with conformity, one can appreciate Chase's 
message that there is magic everywhere -- even in crackpots -- and we'd do well 
to pay attention to the miracles that are daily with us. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Jolla Playhouse's flawless presentation of the Seattle Repertory 
Theatre production does just that, touching on the timeless aspects of this 
wise, witty work, unleashing the magic with fabulous performances and sumptuous 
production values. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a joyous season-opener at UC San Diego's Mandell Weiss Theatre, flavored 
with just the right touch of poignancy, to be savored in every rich detail. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the keys to a successful "Harvey" is the actor who plays Elwood; he not 
only has to make you believe and care about the character, he has to make you 
see Elwood seeing Harvey as convincingly as James Stewart did in the 1950 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Weiss does that with such ingenuous wonder and charm that you quickly 
fall under his spell, wanting him to keep his friend so much that reality 
becomes a secondary consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from the depths of his character's well-searched soul, he can deliver 
even the best-known line from the play -- "I wrestled with reality for 40 years 
and I am happy to state that I finally won out over it" -- with such hard-won 
clarity that you want to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Hughes, acting artistic director of the Seattle Repertory Theatre, 
directed with a graceful, loving hand. Every nuance is polished and burnished 
to full shine, and yet the show flows easily without a single forced note. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Pope and Marianne Owen humanize Veta Louise Simmons, Elwood's sister and 
her daughter Myrtle, two women who confuse social grace -- which Elwood has in 
abundance -- with their own social climbing, which Elwood impedes with his 
delusion. As the sanitarium's snippy but sexy Nurse Kelly, Katie Forgette spars 
stylishly opposite Christopher Evan Welch's Dr. Sanderson. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the key role of Dr. William Chumley, Rick Tutor brings dark, brilliant 
colors to the pompous psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Landwehr's stunning set serves the play well, as the lavishly detailed 
living room yields to a sterile tile-and-metallic sanitarium, both expertly lit 
by Greg Sullivan. Linda Fisher's elegant period costumes and Michael Roth's 
music composition turn the charm up full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, one could complain that "Harvey" romanticizes mental illness, or even 
drinking. But what it really does is take poetic license to romanticize life in 
all its infinite variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been spending my life with fly specks while miracles have been leaning 
on lampposts," Dr. Chumley says at one point. It's a feeling that audiences may 
well share as they follow that White Rabbit to Wonderland.

THEATER REVIEWS; SAN DIEGO PRODUCTION OF 'SPOOKS' BOOSTS COMEDY SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After decades of staging wrenching works by African American playwrights, the 
Southeast Community Theatre is now having fun with the black American 
experience in "Spooks." 
</P>
<P>
 This one-act, 72-minute comedy by Don Evans, which runs through Sunday in the 
Lyceum Space, is a clever, amusing piffle based on the comic premise that it's 
funny when a know-it-all finds out he doesn't know everything after all. 
</P>
<P>
 A "buppie" -- black yuppie -- couple from New York buy a Virginia plantation 
mansion where slaves were once housed in quarters at the back. The husband, 
Howard Johnson (Paul Jackson-Miles), has struck it rich with his first novel 
and relishes the idea of turning the tables on slave history by becoming a 
plantation owner. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Karen (Jackie Mari Roberts), is not so sure. The place is beautiful, 
and there's a great staircase for their daughter to come down for her wedding 
(if and when they ever have a baby), but this house seems haunted to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fears are exacerbated by an elderly black man, Son (Joel Brisker), and 
woman, Lucinda (Candace Ludlow-Trotter), who stop by to welcome them. They also 
relate stories of the revenge and tragedy that ensued when the antebellum 
mistress of the house discovered her husband's love for a slave. 
</P>
<P>
 These stories, told with relish by the exuberant and mysterious Ludlow-Trotter 
-- a voodoo expert who travels with a box of her nail and hair clippings -- are 
about as serious as the play gets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the script is peppered with jokes -- some at the expense of the 
sweet but silly chatterbox wife, but mostly at the expense of the husband, who 
thinks he is smarter than everyone else around him -- especially when it comes 
to old ghost tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Gaffney's direction, with the assistance of Manu Musaka, is mostly on 
the mark but could use some tightening. Veteran performers Brisker and 
Ludlow-Trotter are perfect, Brisker with his deadpan delivery and 
Ludlow-Trotter, resplendent with beads and jingly rings, with her over-the-top 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson-Miles and newcomer Roberts, a beautiful, fresh young face on the local 
theater scene, need to remember that they are the straight guys. They should 
pull back to give the comedy more room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast typically produces on a slender budget. Within these constraints, 
John Redmon's set gives a sense of the mansion's expanse. Judy Watson's 
costumes make a nice distinction between the country and the city folks. Keith 
Marcussen's sound design delivers on the thunder. And Erik Hanson's special 
effects keep the scenery literally moving when the ghosts come to roost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spooks" is about as substantial as the spirits that haunt the mansion -- but 
very, very funny. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Spooks," Lyceum Space, 79 Horton Plaza, San Diego. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 
p.m. Sundays, 2:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. Ends June 5. $12-$14. (619) 235-8025.

 Empty-Handed: Arsenio Hall took his final late-night talk-show bow Friday as 
more than 100 disappointed fans left empty-handed after camping out overnight 
to get tickets to the taping at Paramount Studios. Police, some in riot gear, 
were called in as the crowd threatened to get out of hand, but no arrests were 
made. The tickets were handed out on a first-come, first-served basis and the 
crowd exceeded the available seats. Hall was joined for his final show after 5 
1/2 years on the air by actor Whoopi Goldberg and singer James Brown.

COUNTERPUNCH : 'CROOKLYN'S' CRUEL TO ANIMALS AND VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THEO WILSON, Theo Wilson is a board member of the Hollywood Heights Assn. 
and a retired reporter from the New York Daily News. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have just seen Spike Lee's new film, "Crooklyn," and wish that I had been 
warned to avoid it because of the gratuitous acts of animal cruelty Lee felt 
impelled to include. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the movie, in general, is good or bad was for your reviewer to discuss 
("A Warm and Fuzzy Spike Lee," Calendar, May 13). But I wish the review had 
warned about the cruelty to animals that is so casually depicted in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow me to warn others who will find it revolting to see children open a gate 
to steal a big contented cat from its owner's front yard and then violently 
swing the cat (a simulation, I hope) by its tail and hurl it at other kids. 
</P>
<P>
 This brief act of trespass, theft and torture is presented as blandly as Lee 
presents the shots of children playing tag and hopscotch, jumping rope and 
singing. Impressionable children seeing this on the movie screen might consider 
such cruelty is as acceptable "fun" as any of the street games they are shown 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the movie, a little dog is found dead, smothered in a foldaway sofa 
bed while its distraught owner has been searching for it. True, the harmless 
little dog, Queenie, had yapped a lot. True, its devoted owner is an 
unsympathetic character.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, will somebody explain to me why Queenie's painful death and its 
owner's grief brought cheers, loud applause and gales of laughter from the 
audience at the screening I attended in Westwood? Will somebody tell me how 
this and the cat torture scene helped this movie? 
</P>
<P>
 Can I just give a bit of advice to Spike Lee? Mr. Lee, you want to be a great 
director? 
</P>
<P>
 Get a heart.

COUNTERPUNCH : WHAT'S THE MESSAGE IN ANN MARTIN'S MILLIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BARTH, John Barth is the senior producer of Marketplace, the daily 
business program produced at KUSC and heard nationwide on public radio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's be honest. If Ann Martin, who's leaving her KABC anchor desk for one at 
KCBS, can negotiate a $1-million raise in this economy, I say more power to 
her. We all should be so lucky ("KCBS Pays Top Dollar for Anchor Martin," 
Calendar, May 4). 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, very few people in her audience are. Economists are telling us 
that if Southern California isn't in a recovery, at least it's in a 
long-awaited transition. 
</P>
<P>
 But caught in the wake are millions of people who are either out of work, 
under-employed or facing some form of personal financial purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they see Martin next, or watch Golden Anchor No. 2 Paul Moyer, I 
wonder what they see. Those who aren't insanely jealous or too strapped to even 
own a television, might be getting mixed messages. The first is that the 
anchors are way out of touch with the lives and habits of the people they 
depend upon. Anchors don't have to be paupers or peons, but darn few people in 
Montebello, Compton, Long Beach and Pasadena are pulling down anything in the 
neighborhood of 1.7 million bucks a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The other message is that you can switch media jobs in this town, do the same 
job you were doing before, even work the same hours, and somehow take home a 
new paycheck that could choke a stable of horses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those people who are losing their jobs in this region are getting 
pink-slipped in the name of productivity: their companies need to do more with 
fewer people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the TV news business, someone who can pull in big ratings is considered 
highly productive. By that standard, Martin is very productive. She delivers a 
big audience to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 But what does the L.A. audience get in return? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, CBS and NBC aren't widget-makers. Their news operations are in the 
crucial business of helping to define, explain and translate this world to 
their viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, with new, expensive hires, it seems fair to ask whether this community of 
news stake-holders ends up with more value. Will KCBS ever employ a full-time 
reporter in Sacramento, the capital of the eighth-largest economy on the 
planet? Will Martin and Moyer ever deliver meaningful documentaries, or use the 
clout that got them incredible contracts to improve TV news in this town? 
</P>
<P>
 Are they really adept and credible communicators with the fastest-growing 
population here, Latinos? Have KNBC and KCBS uncovered the secret method of 
reaching Koreans, Cambodians and African Americans in this town? 
</P>
<P>
 Every manager knows that each new hire sends a message. This new hire sends a 
message. Remind me, what do viewers get out of this? 
</P>

 Mt. LaBelle -- the vocal volcano Patti LaBelle -- erupted for over an hour on 
Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Belting out tunes in her raging gospel/R&B style, she showered the audience 
with gut-wrenching emotion.In its best moments her show was like an opera, a 
soul music equivalent of "Pagliacci," as she seemed to be wailing from the very 
depths of her soul. When she's really on, as she was at times on Friday night, 
no R&B diva -- past or present -- is even close. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's exhilaration in being drenched in all that emotion, there are 
irritations too. Not only do you have to tolerate occasional vocal showboating, 
but also some lusterless songs. Choosing material has never been her strength, 
but it's not easy finding songs suited to such vocal eruptions. At times she 
takes the easy way out, giving tear-jerkers like "Wind Beneath My Wings" and 
"Over the Rainbow" the full LaBelle treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 She was followed by Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly. In his affable, easygoing 
style, Beverly crooned uplifting lyrics about life and love while Maze was 
playing irresistible, laid-back R&B riffs.

DANCE; CULTURES FUSE AT 'ROOTS' FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning Friday with antique Persian court entertainments and ending Saturday 
with a depiction of the suffering and solidarity of the urban homeless, the 
fourth annual "Dance Roots" festival brought a dozen, mostly emerging, mostly 
traditional companies to the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacular cultural juxtapositions of Southern California emerged as the 
theme of the free event -- a theme seized by the La Verne Reed Dance Company in 
two trios on Saturday: Wayne Biscomb's intense "Within and Throughout" (none 
too smoothly combining modern and jazz dance with an African vocabulary) and 
Reed's celebratory "Rock With You" (deliriously fusing hip-hop with classical 
ballet).  
</P>
<P>
 The same night, Al Desio's "Brandenburg Boogie" found him and four members of 
his Colburn Kids/Tap L.A. group achieving a jazz-Baroque fusion through 
intricate tap embellishments of a Bach score. However, the most artful -- and 
personal -- bridge between past and present came Friday with Tina Gerstler's 
duet "Lucid Dreams," in which Native American music inspired fluid, atmospheric 
modern dance focused on processes of self-realization. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to portray inner-city poverty, Adria Wilson's large-scale "Fallin' From 
Grace" for her Arts in Motion company kept fallin' into the trap of show-dance 
showcasing. Only in a sensational male duet at the very end did her 
work-in-progress discover a way of making technical flamboyance believably 
expressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the world-dance artists, pride of place belonged to genuine masters: I 
Nyoman Wenten and Nanik Wenten in their majestic Javanese "Mahabharata" duet 
for Bali Java Dance Theater on Friday. The same night, Alberto Toledano and 
Loreen Arbus dominated an Argentine tango segment with their heat and flash. 
</P>
<P>
 In two classical Cambodian dances on Saturday, Sophiline Shapiro floated 
through exacting tests of balance and sculptural refinement with serene ease. 
And two kinds of traditional Irish dancing the same night showcased the 
brilliant footwork of Annee Albritton and Nicole Torrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Alvaro Ramirez, L.A. Mexican Dance Theater contributed a vigorous 
interpretation of the Yaqui Deer Dance on Friday. And Shida Pegahi's Nay-Nava 
Dance Theater represented the local Iranian community with a gracious Persian 
suite adroitly shaped to her dancers' varying capabilities.

 Each Memorial Day weekend, the sounds of the Sacramento Traditional Jazz 
Jubilee suffuse the city like the aromas of grapes at pressing time in Napa or 
chocolate in Hershey, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 A heavy beat echoes through the vast Downtown Plaza shopping center; anthems 
from a dozen venues compete in the touristy Old Town Riverside area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a long hotel lobby, the Porcupine Ragtime Ensemble with a front line of 
flute, piccolo and violin renders "The Telephone" with the same gentle, strict 
politeness with which it was played in 1899.

<P>
 For this year's 21st running of the festival, there are more than 120 bands on 
hand, 10 from abroad, including the expert Fat Sam's from Scotland with its 
homages to Duke Ellington and Count Basie, and Allotria from Munich, with an 
all-stops attack suggesting Las Vegas more than Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, a Mexican group, Los Caribe from Guaymas, appeared and 
wowed the customers with jazz to a Latin beat. 
</P>
<P>
 The trad bands, from the Agony Hall Stompers to the Nuclear Whales and the 
Wildcats, predominate as always and many of them have fiercely devoted 
followers. The Hot Frogs filled a 900-seat hotel ballroom to capacity before 
they blew a note and some 300 more fans waited in a line that stretched down a 
corridor and half a block into the blazing Sacramento morning sun, waiting for 
seats to open. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also more than two-dozen individual virtuoso jazzmen here 
joining in ad-hoc groups like the Los Angeles, Midwest and New York All-Stars, 
and appearing as soloists and in duos to showcase their improvisational skills. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, a group led by the brilliant young guitarist Howard Alden 
and featuring Johnny Varro on piano, Ken Peplowski on reeds, Dan Barrett on 
trombone, Randy Sandke on trumpet and the Woody Herman alumnus Jake Hanna on 
drums, did a super-fast version of Herman's "Apple Honey" that was a stunning 
showpiece of chamber jazz enriched by glorious invention. 
</P>
<P>
 But invention is a function of player, not period, and one of the best of the 
trad groups, Boston's Paramount Jazz Band, has in reedmen Steve Wright and Gary 
Rodberg and cornetist Jeff Hughes musicians who honor the past rather than 
exploit it and seem to find fresh inspiration in every chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of the individual jazz artists in Sacramento is significant 
because the annual Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival, held each Labor Day 
weekend, has, after a recent palace revolution, appeared to move toward a 
future policy of more traditional groups and fewer visiting firemen. What will 
happen to the stars, including Bob Wilbur, Kenny Davern and Bob Haggart, 
already announced for this year, is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Krum, who is bassist with Sacramento's popular Fulton Street jazz band 
and also executive director of the festival, says, "They had such a good mix 
down there in Los Angeles. I don't know why they'd want to change it. We're 
such a big festival we try to offer a bit of everything. This year we had the 
Zydeco Flames out of Berkeley, and I was a little nervous about zydeco, but 
they were very popular." The festival is also offering several black blues 
groups. "Dixieland" no longer appears in its publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the groups on hand are several youth bands encouraged by the festival 
over the years, with some of the amazingly gifted players schooled at summer 
jazz camps run by the festival. By now, several of the groups are touring and 
recording on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the popular attractions has been Mr. Jack Daniels Original Silver 
Cornet Band, a brass-heavy big group with sleek arrangements, whose offerings 
range from a coronet solo as it might well have been heard on the village green 
a century ago, to a swinging version of "High Society," with the famous 
clarinet chorus taken with soaring skill by a coronet trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Krum himself plays and loves the trad style, but also vastly admires the 
visiting instrumentalists. At a pre-festival performance Thursday night, when 
an out-of-town visitor was delayed, Krum sat in with one of the all-star 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone asked me what it was like," Krum says. "I said, I felt like a sapling 
in the forest." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival concludes this afternoon.

VIDEO REVIEW; 'BIX' FAILS TO CLARIFY BEIDERBECKE'S GENIUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you separate fact from legend, authenticity from dramatic impact, in 
filming a movie based on an actual life? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is not entirely clarified in "Bix: An Interpretation of a Legend," 
which purports to tell the story of Leon Bix Beiderbecke (1903-1931).An 
Italian/U.S. production, it was directed and co-written by Pupi Avati and shot 
partly on location in Davenport, Iowa (Beiderbecke's home town), and other 
American locations. 
</P>
<P>
 That Beiderbecke was a genius can hardly be disputed. As a cornetist, he made 
a number of records in the late 1920s, mostly in partnership with the 
saxophonist Frank Trumbauer, that were timeless gems. As a pianist and 
composer, he wrote a brilliant series of impressionistic works, only one of 
which he recorded ("In a Mist"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beiderbecke, played by Bryant Weeks (with sound track by Tom Pletcher) is 
depicted as a rebel, torn by love of family and the need to succeed in jazz. 
Plagued by alcoholism, drifting in and out of jobs with the bands of Paul 
Whiteman and others, he died almost unknown to the public.  
</P>
<P>
 One complaint lodged against the Charlie Parker film "Bird" was that it never 
clarified just what made him a unique artist. "Bix" has the same problem. Among 
many omissions, his interacting with black musicians (Louis Armstrong inspired 
him; trumpeter Rex Stewart even copied Beiderbecke's famous "Singin' the Blues" 
solo) is bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie never catches fire dramatically, but the credible traditional music, 
directed by saxophonist Bob Wilber and featuring pianist Keith Nichols, 
clarinetist Kenny Davern and others, justifies following the somewhat episodic 
story, which flashes back and forth in often confusing disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bix: An Interpretation of a Legend" is available on cassette from Rhapsody 
Films, Box 179, New York, NY 10014, $64.95.

SCREENING ROOM; FILMS OF EAST GERMAN WOLF AT GOETHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Goethe Institute resumes its fascinating survey of films from the former 
German Democratic Republic with "The Films of Konrad Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, who died in 1982 in his 57th year, is virtually unknown in America, as 
are most GDR filmmakers. Like other East German filmmakers that the Institute 
has introduced, Wolf was a socially conscious realist. He had an exceedingly 
graceful and dynamic visual style and at times he ran afoul of censorship 
rules. There is a tremendous passion and vitality in his films, which are 
exceptionally well-written and acted; the same could be said for all the East 
German films that the Goethe Institute, 5700 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 110, has so 
far presented. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolf series opens Tuesday at 7 p.m. with "Lissy" (1957), which traces the 
impact of Hitler's rise to power upon a pretty, vivacious young woman (Sonja 
Sutter, in the title role) of leftist upbringing whose husband (Horst Drinda) 
joins the S.A. after despairing of finding work in the depths of the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lissy" is adroit at dramatizing how Nazism fed upon economic despair and in 
turn unleashed anti-Semitism long ingrained in a society looking for a 
scapegoat for all its ills. "Lissy" doesn't tell us anything that we don't 
already know, but what specifically led up to the Holocaust is depicted 
somewhat less often on the screen than its horrors and aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sterne" (Thursday at 7 p.m.) moves us ahead into World War II, in an 
idyllic-looking ancient Bulgarian town under German occupation. The town has 
become a stopover on the way to Auschwitz for Jews transported from Portugal 
and Greece. When a young German officer (Jurgen Frohriep), who for the world 
looks like a clean-cut American, reflexively refuses to allow a doctor to 
attend a Jewish woman in the throes of a difficult childbirth, he is shamed 
into changing his mind by a courageous young Jewish woman (Sascha Kruschkarska) 
addressing him from the other side of barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an act that will transform his life; the strength of this subtle, 
heartbreaking film suggests how an intellectual (which the officer is) can 
justify indifference to human suffering and injustice by retreating into 
cynicism and pessimism.

 BAROQUE BENEFIT: Beyond Baroque, the literary/arts center at 681 Venice Blvd., 
Venice, will present a benefit for itself Saturday at 8 p.m. and again at 11 
featuring folk singer Phranc, performance artist George Herms and a 26-minute 
film, Anna Biller's "Three Examples of Myself as Queen," an endearing camp 
travesty musical in which Biller envisions herself as a bored Arabian Nights 
ruler cheered up by her singing attendants, then as a queen bee (as in honey) 
in search of a hive and serenaded by her devoted drones, and finally as a girl 
at a '60s house party endangered by hooligans but rescued by a hero in white on 
a white horse. Sweet, funny with marvelous costumes, sets and even quilts 
designed and constructed by Biller; a kind of innocent homage to Maria Montez 
with a sense of color and decor worthy of Kenneth Anger. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 PHONY 'QUEST': Peter Delpeut, enterprising programmer at the Netherlands Film 
Museum, scoured the archives for silent era polar expeditions to create a fake 
documentary, "The Forbidden Quest" (Monica 4-Plex, Saturdays and Sundays at 11 
a.m.), purportedly investigating an ill-fated 1905 journey to the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Intercutting the found footage with a phony 1941 interview with a survivor of 
the voyage, an Irish ship's carpenter (Joseph O'Connor, a skilled teller of a 
very tall tale), Delpeut spins quite a yarn, a kind of exceedingly dry spoof of 
"Rime of the Ancient Mariner" yarns. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that by the very nature of this undertaking the most dramatic 
and horrific events must be related by O'Connor, for the silent footage, while 
beautiful, is of the travelogue variety. The result is a film that is at times 
more tedious than amusing for all its ingenuity. More rewarding was Delpeut's 
earlier work "Lyrical Nitrate," which celebrated the magic, charm and purity of 
the earliest cinema while exploring the techniques of silent-era actresses.

THEATER REVIEW; WE COULD USE MORE 'HYSTERIA' LIKE THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fair sex. The weaker sex. The pregnant sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Young believes women continue to be slaves to their bodies -- or to 
society's notions about their bodies. It's time for an Emancipation 
Proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 But her "Hysteria," at the Actors' Gang Theatre, is no solemn decree. It's a 
zingy musical comedy -- and some of the best evidence yet to refute the old 
canard that feminists are humorless. Staged satire is seldom this provocative, 
this meaty, this engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, an earlier version of "Hysteria" was mounted in the Gang's former 
home at 2nd Stage, a few blocks away. As with many of the Gang's sprawling 
productions, that stage was too small. "Hysteria" looks and sounds better now. 
</P>
<P>
 Young manages to sustain and unite two different narratives, set more than a 
hundred years apart in two different countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Her contemporary American story is built around Garnet Poindexter (Kate 
Mulligan), newly pregnant and not yet glowing. Her husband neglects her, and 
the family to which she has returned is, well, eccentric. Mom (Patti Tippo) is 
an ex-supermodel who isn't adjusting well to middle age, Dad (Daniel Parker) is 
touting his latest line of unisex clothing by wearing women's garb. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are Garnet's sisters. Corky (Tricia Parks) has imagined she's 
pregnant ever since a traumatic incident at college and has been a recluse for 
months now, awaiting her first contractions. Taylor (Evie Peck) wants to follow 
her mother into the modeling trade, even if it takes a few visits to Dr. Sandra 
Needles (Laurel Ollstein), mom's plastic surgeon. She's encouraged in her 
delusion by her father's lecherous friend Chadley (Kyle Gass), the cosmetics 
king. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, while examining old photos, Garnet suddenly finds herself in the 
presence of her great-great-grandmother Lilymoist Teagarden (Cari Dean 
Whittemore), a fluttery Victorian miss who, in 1888, has been diagnosed with 
female "hysteria" and confined indoors by her bullying doctor (Parker). Lily 
gets a second opinion from Lydia Tripplehorn (Molly Bryant), a speechifying 
crusader for women's rights and a champion of the condom and the clitoris. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the cast playing roles in both centuries, Young cleverly brings 
her stories together, eventually focusing on Lily's unwanted pregnancy as much 
as Garnet's. For this latest version, Young brings Lily's lover Heathcliff (V. 
J. Foster) out on stage for a funny, swoony seduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Young also changed the beginning -- sacrificing some childhood memories for a 
more coherent introduction to the family -- and the ending, which now includes 
a note of reconciliation between two arch-enemies. She's out to make a point, 
but she doesn't pretend that abortion is a painless choice or that the other 
side has no principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult audiences (there are bare breasts and frank talk) should welcome this 
savvy cartoon with open arms -- and minds. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hysteria," Actors' Gang, 6209 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. 
Ends June 18. $12-$15. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 hours, 45 minutes.

ART REVIEW; GROOMS' CIRCUS: ANARCHIC CHAOS AT PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Red Grooms is a well-known New York artist, a fact that often spells 
sophistication. In his case, however, all you probably really need to know is 
that as kid in Tennessee, Grooms was mightily impressed when the circus came to 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his circus is in these parts again in a show called "Target: Red Grooms!" 
Ensconced at Malibu's Pepperdine University's small art museum, it was 
organized by director Nora Halpern. Compared to Grooms' retrospective at MOCA's 
Temporary Contemporary a few years back, this is a bit of a one-ring affair, 
but a lot of fun, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms is something of a problem for serious art connoisseurs. They don't know 
quite how to classify work so deeply in the American vernacular of carnival 
posters, burlesque and grungy R. Crumb comics. It might be Pop but misses the 
requisite irony. It might be Expressionism but lacks mandatory anger. It 
definitely is "an installation" in the fundamentalist manner of Ed Kienholz. 
Maybe that's what makes it artistically respectable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Isolating Grooms' visual anarchy in Pepperdine's idyllic and slightly 
antiseptic precincts creates a dramatic contrast that reminds us there is more 
to art than stylistic categories. Here it's clear this is an art intended to 
evoke place and attitude. The place is the seamier side of New York City. You 
can practically smell gas fumes and grit. The attitude is the sense of humor 
required to survive Grooms' main love, chaos. If Damon Runyon were alive today, 
he'd like Grooms' guys 'n' dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discount Store" gives us a life-size Saturday morning in one of those 
cavernous populist emporiums that sells everything from flower seeds to 
firearms. The closest thing here to the contemporary art of social criticism is 
Grooms' gun counter and he plays it for farce. A Mr. Magoo hunter in requisite 
red mackinaw aims a shotgun at a crowd he's mistaken for ducks while the 
distraught clerk points a rifle at the head of a matron shopping for a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms sets himself the task of making everything from counters to people out 
of wood cutouts painted, padded and extended with truly wacky ingenuity. He 
manages to make right-angle carpenter joins become a cute little blond clerk 
using her charms to sell a vacuum cleaner to a young dude who really needs a 
shower. 
</P>
<P>
 He fashions a carnival-headed waitress for the doughnut counter. We know she's 
psyched herself up to believe this lousy, demanding job is as good as being 
Miss America. 
</P>
<P>
 Among smaller works "Flea Market" reverses scale, making a SoHo square into a 
miniature masterpiece of high-relief anecdote and deft characterization. You 
immediately know the pipe-smoking rich guy in golf pants. He thinks his 
superior taste will find a treasure in the junk for sale. A florid body-builder 
hawking sentimental mementos is even more trenchant. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms' only real problem is that the times have outrun him. Today the streets 
of all great American cities are infected with homeless derelicts and marauding 
gangs funny to no one. Circumstance has changed an art that was once slightly 
raunchy into a kind of populist pastorale. Like the Ashcan School of Old, an 
art that started out tough has become nostalgic.

TV REVIEWS; 'ROOMMATES' WITH AIDS LEARN TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally, a movie about AIDS that dramatizes the democratic nature of the 
disease -- specifically, a heterosexual who is homophobic to the core and dying 
of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In NBC's "Roommates," Randy Quaid, as a scruffy ex-con who contacted AIDS from 
a blood transfusion, is the wise-cracking, hard-drinking half of an "odd 
couple" sharing an apartment in a complex run by an AIDS action committee as a 
home for people with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaid's roommate, a sudden intrusion, is played by Eric Stoltz as a dapper Ivy 
League-educated homosexual who leaves the East Coast comfort of a loving but 
uncomprehending family to gain some control over his final months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Initially full of mutual disdain, the roommates regard one other with cultural 
snobbery and stereotypical intolerance. One reads "Moby Dick" and wears 
neckties, while the other smokes, drinks and watches sports on a blaring TV. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a match made in hell but one gradually, genuinely transformed by mutual 
needs that flowers into durable friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you just know early on that compassion and acceptance will supplant 
ignorance and prejudice. But the way these characters come to be soul mates 
feels right, instead of overly contrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lenski's teleplay and Alan Metzger's direction avoid land mines of 
sentimentality with a narrative full of surprises (a hilarious pool game) and 
candid emotions.  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its strong acting and technical polish, the production's thematic 
achievement is twofold: (1) it demolishes the myth that AIDS is a gay disease, 
and (2) it refreshingly punctures holes in the prejudices of both straights and 
gays (but mostly straights). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Roommates" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

TV REVIEWS; D-DAY INVASION FIRES EARLY SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The invasion is underway. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV invasion, that is, about the D-Day invasion 50 years ago. "Masterpiece 
Theatre" fired an early shot with its "A Foreign Field," soon followed by the 
spare, brilliantly constructed "D-Day" for "The American Experience" on PBS, 
and retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's own reconnaissance with CBS' Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
 With wave after wave of TV troops, it'll be easy to lose filmmaker Christopher 
Koch's 90-minute "Normandy: The Great Crusade" in the barrage. While it lacks 
the grim purity of PBS' "D-Day" film, it is an even more ambitious montage of 
archival film, photos and personal documents covering the entire course of the 
Allied campaign from the invasion to the eventual collapse of the Nazi 
occupation of France. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the product of the school of history-as-biography -- history 
reconstructed through the diaries, letters, poems, home movies and other 
personal scribblings of soldiers, loved ones and innocents caught between the 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In this latter category, Koch takes a huge interest in the plight of 
Marie-Louise Osmond (spoken fervently by Leslie Caron), whose Normandy manor 
home was occupied by the Germans in 1940 and then, in the summer of 1944, 
became the center for hot days of battles. Koch gets hokey, though, when his 
camera tries frantically to track Osmond's point of view as she escapes the 
bullets and bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 While "D-Day" recorded the voices of actual soldiers recalling those 
terrifying days, "The Great Crusade's" use of actors reading material written 
as blood was being spilled causes an odd distancing from a film full of 
visceral horror. (The images of a dead soldier covered in flies is out of 
Bunuel.) Narrator Charles Durning, himself part of the first invading force on 
Omaha Beach, adds to the distancing since he doesn't include (reportedly by his 
own request) any of his own personal recollections. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of its attention to the individual perspective, "The Great Crusade" 
encompasses a vast sound scape of voices, from American widower Karin King and 
Nazi-hating Berlin reporter Ursula von Kardorff (Joanna Pacula, in a reading 
tinged with bitterness) to early teen-aged Hitlerjungend sent to the front 
lines and confused but excited Allied troopers. Their words resound with the 
sense of people swept into forces beyond their control, fearfully expectant, 
even inspired by war's ferocity to poetry. * "Normandy: The Great Crusade" airs 
tonight at 9 and midnight on Discovery Channel. Other D-Day programming this 
week includes "George Stevens: D-Day to Berlin," Tuesday, 9 p.m. on Disney 
Channel; "Turning Point at Normandy: The Soldiers' Story," Wednesday, 9:30 
p.m., ABC, and "Fall From Grace," a two-part TV movie, Thursday and Friday, 9 
p.m., CBS.

GEORGE RAMOS: TIME AND LOSS TRANSFORM A VET'S ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS

<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a few things planned for this Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there's Andy of City Terrace. You remember him. He's the Chicano 
Vietnam vet I discovered one day selling oranges on a street corner in East 
L.A. He was out of work and desperately wanted to hang onto his dream house in 
Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 His story of trying to make ends meet touched me and we became fast friends. 
We had so much fun at last year's Memorial Day cookout at his place that we 
decided to get together again today. But before I get there, I'll stop off at 
the Garden of Valor -- a special section set aside for veterans at the Rose 
Hills cemetery -- to honor a special soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad is buried there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, I didn't give much thought to Memorial Day, or how I'd spend it. 
It was just another chance for a three-day weekend. But it was always a big 
deal to my father. 
</P>
<P>
 He served five years as an Army private in the infantry during World War II, 
and treasured those years in the Pacific. He'd tell the same stories over and 
over. I know them by heart. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite seemed to be about the vexing inability on one island to dislodge 
the Japanese from a strategic hill. Each morning at 9 for several days, the 
hill was bombed from the air, shelled from the sea and assaulted by GIs, but 
the enemy could not be overcome. The Americans seemed stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, some wise guy got the idea to hit the hill at 8 o'clock," Dad said. "We 
bombed the hell out of it. When we got to the hill, there was nobody there. We 
couldn't figure it out. Around 8:45, here come the Japanese to take up their 
positions on the hill. We wiped them out." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd laugh about it but would inevitably turn serious. "War is hell," he'd 
say, "and you may find out about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Like those who swore allegiance to Eisenhower for his leadership in Europe, 
Dad had his own favorite: Gen. Douglas MacArthur. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he was leaving for work or for his ritualistic Saturday visits to the 
union hall, he would intone the general's immortal words to state the obvious: 
"I shall return." 
</P>
<P>
 When President Harry Truman sacked MacArthur for insubordination, Dad without 
reservation sided with the president. "Truman was right," he growled. He rarely 
talked about his favorite general after that, but he never gave up that famous 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 He also did the little things to celebrate Memorial Day. He readily dug into 
his pockets for change when bemedaled veterans showed up on local streets each 
Memorial Day to sell plastic red poppies. "You always must help veterans," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't take seriously my dad's views of war, veterans or Memorial Day. Those 
things were for him, I decided. I had other things to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 I did turn to Dad when one particularly tough decision was to be made. The war 
in Vietnam was in full swing by 1965 -- my freshman year in college -- when I 
was asked whether I wanted to join the Army's ROTC program in school. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't have a clue, but Dad did. He reasoned that there was no guarantee of 
my finishing school and earning a degree in four years. Getting drafted by 1968 
was a real possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 If I joined ROTC, I could complete my studies without interruption and then 
enter the Army afterward as a second lieutenant. There was risk involved, but 
he explained that I should serve my country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom was against the idea, but Dad persisted. "If you have to go in, be an 
officer," the former Army private said. "Don't be like me, a dogface." 
</P>
<P>
 I then promptly joined ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
 After Vietnam, I just wanted to forget about it. I had no funny stories or 
sayings to share. I never told my dad about surviving two typhoons in the field 
or getting mortar fire from your own troops. 
</P>
<P>
 I was too ashamed to tell him that on my trip home from Southeast Asia, I had 
to change uniforms at the San Francisco airport because an anti-war protester 
had purposely vomited on me. "Baby killer," she screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the plane arrived at LAX at 4 in the morning, Dad was wearing his 
sunglasses. He was crying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Miguel Antonio Vargas Ramos died of cancer just a few days before 
Memorial Day, 1988, my attitude changed. 
</P>
<P>
 I now buy red plastic poppies to benefit disabled veterans. I can now tell 
stories about Vietnam or my favorite C-ration meal, chopped ham and eggs. And I 
make it a point to visit the graves of veterans on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish Dad were around, so I could share all this with him. In my own way, I 
try. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever I visit his grave, I tell him, "Old soldiers never die. . . ."

'THEY COME TO GAZE, TO WANDER TO SHOP'

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a daily occurrence in Los Angeles that flies in the face of what we read 
and hear. Blacks, Latinos, Asians, whites and every ethnicity in between are in 
a gathering place enjoying a moment of solitude and also togetherness. They 
come with their small children and babies, in carryalls or strollers. They come 
walking with the support of canes and even in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the melodic strain of a mixture of languages, both from Angelenos and 
the clusters of foreigners who come by bus. There is a lot of laughter, 
animated conversation and also the quiet contemplation of reading or just 
daydreaming. People dress in a rainbow of colors -- teens in fashion, seniors 
sometimes audaciously sporting colors and styles of the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 They come to gaze, to wander, to shop for novelties or groceries, and to be 
part of the experience. Often they come to enjoy an outdoor lunch. Alone or 
with others, it doesn't matter -- it's a "happening." Tables and chairs fill 
both the walkways and open spaces here and there. There are aisles lined on 
both sides with shops, stalls and booths. Every kind of food one can imagine is 
available, and all seem popular. One may choose American favorites and 
Louisiana-Cajun fare, Chinese standards, Italian dishes, Mexican delicacies, or 
fresh bakery goods. There is protection from the sun and also heaters for the 
chilly days. 
</P>
<P>
 But, there is something far more important to observe and not take for 
granted. The whites, Asians, blacks and Latinos order their food elbow to 
elbow, smiling, often helping one another. The elderly and the youthful share 
tables. When it's crowded, color doesn't matter and age is irrelevant. One can 
relax with a cup of coffee, or even a beer or glass of wine, and quietly read 
the newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 If Los Angeles' Farmer's Market at Third and Fairfax is a microcosm of Los 
Angeles -- and it is -- then we have much to learn from it. The answer to 
Rodney King's question is here: "People can get along."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: LETTERS TO VOICES; 
GENERATION X AND HOPELESSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a message to send to Kristen Perry (Generation X: 'We Tend to Value 
Things Instead of Life,' May 23). If all you see in our generation is 
hopelessness, violence, apathy and an overwhelming sense of being lost, you're 
hanging out with the wrong people. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me introduce you to the Generation X I know. Look behind successful 
corporate executives and political figures and you'll see an army of Generation 
Xers managing their portfolios, cranking out their financial analyses, setting 
up get-out-the-vote strategies and developing policy recommendations. In the 
face of a world full of injustice, twenty-somethings are making blockbuster 
movies, creating virtual reality, starting community gardens to put kids 
through college, editing magazines, managing homeless outreach centers and 
writing best-selling novels. We are clerking for Supreme Court judges, working 
on cures for breast cancer and AIDS, starting companies, organizing labor 
movements, serving as mayors, raising families, doing gang intervention, and, 
in 1994, electing a governor (after we rocked-the-vote to elect a President in 
1992). 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we face a more violent world full of broken promises. We also live in a 
world of tremendous opportunity.

<P>
 Kristen Perry's editorial comment about Generation X is most excellent and 
insightful. It evidences maturity of thought well beyond her years. 
</P>
<P>
 Few would disagree with her statements, " . . . We're just lost. It seems no 
one in this generation has a hold on anything important." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has recognized the crux of the problem. Earlier generations faced 
circumstances equally as challenging as those facing "Generation X," but they 
were sustained by having a firm "hold on something important." 
</P>
<P>
 They recognized moral and spiritual VALUE. It was taught to them in their 
homes by their parents and in their churches by their Sunday school teachers 
and by their pastors and at school by teachers who stood for and taught high 
standards of morality. All of the above, in their own way, stressed the 
importance of character and reputation and from all of these teachings, self 
respect and achievement were the inevitable result. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier generations those who failed in school failed. The lesson was that 
we progress in direct proportion to the effort and application we put forth in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has evidenced great understanding of the values of life. When others 
turn aside to accept lesser values just continue to be guided by your own star.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GRIPE; 'ELECTORATE 
IS BEING DENIED RIGHT TO VOTE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSEMARIE CLAMPITT, A deputy registrar, Los Angeles County; member of League 
ofWomen Voters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 14, in Los Angeles County, 161 judges completed their filing as 
"candidates" for November's general election. It will be a silent "election," 
with the electorate denied the right to vote for or against the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have filed as "candidates," the names of unopposed incumbent 
judges are not placed on the primary or general ballot, and they will be 
declared "elected" in November by a clerk. Our right to vote for or against 
them was abolished by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The current "candidates" are 92 unopposed incumbent Superior Court judges and 
69 unopposed incumbent Municipal Court judges. In 1992, there were 117 judges 
silently elected in Los Angeles County -- 79 in Superior Court and 38 in 
Municipal Court. The scenario is similar statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might say, "No one ever knows anything about the judges anyway," or "What 
difference does it make?" Well, I have observed thousands of cases in Southern 
California courtrooms and the discrimination and denial of constitutional 
rights by certain judges toward certain litigants is appalling. 
</P>
<P>
 With a "guaranteed reelection," the judge has omnipotent power in the 
courtroom and there is very little that anyone can do about it. The power of a 
judge is purportedly limited to the interpretation of the law set forth by the 
Legislature, but if you observe the courts, you will find that some judges 
write their own law to support their own prejudices. In some of the courts 
which I have observed, it appears that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of 
due process and equal protection under the law are nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 In some circumstances, the litigant has the right to proceed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court on denial of constitutional rights, but in reality, how many 
people are in a position to do that, financially or emotionally? Besides, what 
would you use for a transcript to prove what happened? In Los Angeles County, 
many judges will not permit a record to be made in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In Municipal Court, the court has refused to provide a court reporter, even 
though the court is required to do so by law if requested by a litigant and 
paid for by the party. In Superior Court, an electronic audiotape recording is 
made in some of the courtrooms, but not all, and the judge may refuse to permit 
a particular case from being recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, if you decided to fight a parking or a moving-violation ticket 
in Traffic Court, an electronic audiotape recording was made without your 
knowledge and the Appellate Department of the Superior Court would not permit 
the recording to be provided to you or to the appellate court if you decided to 
appeal. The same appellate court would not permit a recording to be made of the 
appeals proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 I just happened to discover the electronic audiotaping, and through my 
investigation, learned that it was authorized by the presiding judge of the Los 
Angeles Municipal Judicial District, and is in effect throughout the county. 
This is the same judicial district that will not permit electronic recordings 
to be made in a Municipal Court civil case; therefore, there is no record 
unless you bring in an outside reporter, which requires permission of the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, I witnessed a Traffic Court proceeding in which the judge did not 
know the difference between a parking ticket and a moving violation, and he 
would not allow anyone to leave the courtroom to use the restroom or to put 
money in their parking meters for more than a five-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is mandatory that a person appear before a hearing officer instead of 
a judge if the ticket is contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the judges whom I have observed will be declared "reelected" this 
November, and I will have been denied my right to vote against them. How did 
this happen? I do not remember waiving my right to vote for unopposed incumbent 
judges, so I started an investigation. I learned that Gov. Pete Wilson's office 
did not even know that citizens are denied the right to vote for these judges; 
neither did any of the other legislative representatives I contacted. 
</P>
<P>
 The representative at the Registrar's Office said that very few people know 
about this. When the judges file their declarations as "candidates," their 
names only appear in the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a newspaper for the legal 
community. A few judges are always on the ballot, so no one ever suspects that 
unopposed incumbent judges are being "reelected" for another six years (12 
years if they are appellate judges). 
</P>
<P>
 The only time that the name of an incumbent judge is placed on the ballot is 
when the candidacy is for a higher court -- that is, we are permitted to vote 
for a Municipal Court judge who wants to become a Superior Court judge or if an 
incumbent judge is opposed. However, I learned that very few incumbents are 
ever opposed because the attorney/challengers fear they would not be treated 
fairly by the judge if they lost the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, denying Californians the right to vote for unopposed incumbent 
judges, originated as an Assembly bill that was then added to the state 
Election Code in 1963, as Section 25304. It was never presented to the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 This absolute independence has cost us more than one fundamental right. A 
judge with unlimited independence has unlimited power, and we have been denied 
our constitutional right of liberty to obtain justice in the courts, another 
fundamental right of the Constitution. The denial of our right to vote for all 
judges has been ruled constitutional by California courts, but of course it is 
California judges who made that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it time that the system be redesigned so that we, the people, know what 
our judges are doing in the courtroom? Isn't it time that we know which judges 
are prejudicial and be allowed to vote them out? Isn't it time that we know 
more about our judges than where they went to school, their marital status and 
what their children are doing? Isn't it time that we are no longer intimidated 
by the judiciary? 
</P>
<P>
 Our Legislature abolished our right to vote instead of revising the system to 
allow us to vote out incumbent judges in a general election. Presently just one 
vote will retain each unopposed incumbent judge who is listed on the ballot. 
Most of us do not even know which judges are being automatically "reelected."

PAPERS PREVENT 'A WEAKNESS IN STUDENT VOICE'

 For 20 years Aaron H. Rotman was adviser of The Oarsman, Venice High School's 
weekly student newspaper. He says the trend to eliminate student papers because 
of budget problems is wrong. "Journalism gives kids a sense of a job. You have 
deadlines to meet, you have responsibilities, and you get a chance to produce 
something worthwhile. It teaches a skill, an art." Following are comments from 
student editors about what the papers mean to them.

<P>
 Senior, 17, managing editor and opinion editor of The Warrior, the weekly 
student newspaper of University High School, 
</P>
<P>
 West Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of not funding school newspapers is preposterous. At our school there 
is no danger of the demise of the newspaper. We come out with 30 issues a year. 
Journalism used to get a lot more funding in its heyday in the late '70s when 
it was really thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 If papers were discontinued, there would be a definite weakness in the student 
voice. The paper provides a forum for students to speak out, and also to show 
how students are achieving. It unites the school. 
</P>
<P>
 SABRINA TOM 
</P>
<P>
 Junior, 17, opinion page editor of The Samohi, the biweekly student newspaper 
at Santa Monica High School 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper is the perfect forum for students to voice their opinions and to 
make a significant difference. I know that our newspaper tries to make it as 
realistic a journalism experience as possible. I absolutely think that without 
the school newspaper, the school and students would have less of an identity. 
There are so many things going on stripping away students' power. The newspaper 
is a perfect forum to empower students. 
</P>
<P>
 LISA MORRIS 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, copy editor of Le Sabre, a monthly, Cleveland High School, Reseda 
</P>
<P>
 I think eliminating student newspapers is such narrow thinking. If you don't 
teach kids how to think and how to report a story and how to find out things 
for themselves, you're not really educating them. We're learning to look for 
both sides of the story and to check our sources. I think I carry that kind of 
guarded skepticism into the rest of my life -- the tendency not to believe 
everything I hear on the news. You can learn writing in other ways, like from 
your English class, but what you're missing there is that responsibility, and I 
think that's an important lesson that you can't teach any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 KEN LUONG 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, editor-in-chief of The Moor, a weekly student newspaper, Alhambra 
High School 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think it's possible to know everything about your school without a 
newspaper. To have a fulfilling school life, you should know what's going on. I 
had to teach staff writers how to interview people, how to research facts, how 
to present their stories. It's a good way for people to put their efforts into 
something rewarding. I learned that whatever the newspaper says, the whole 
staff has to stand by it.

ALLERGY DRUGS

 Your May 18 article on the possible relationship of cancer growth in mice to 
the antihistamines loratadine, astemizole and Atarax is of interest, but need 
not be of concern to allergy sufferers. There is published data showing that 
cancer occurs less commonly in individuals with allergic disease, indicating 
that histamine, the chemical that causes sneezing and running of the nose, may 
protect against tumor growth.Other articles refute the concept that individuals 
with allergies have less cancer. Antihistamines have been used in man for over 
50 years and are considered to be among the safest medications. Numerous cold 
remedies contain antihistamines as well. Nonetheless, multiple studies have not 
revealed an increase in cancer prevalence in allergic patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The most concern for the results of the study reported should be for mice 
injected with tumors by cancer researchers, and not for allergy patients 
seeking and receiving welcome symptomatic relief. If we allowed animal research 
to dictate drugs used in humans, penicillin would never have been produced. 
When injected into guinea pigs, penicillin produces paralysis and death. It has 
saved lives of hundreds of millions of humans since World War II.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Your interesting article and penetrating revelations about President Nixon's 
responses to minorities, such as African Americans and Jews, per the H.R. 
Haldeman diaries, were in keeping with Americans in general, unfortunately (May 
18). The ongoing ethnic gang killings make us wonder if the new generation has 
a different mind-set! 
</P>
<P>
 It would be well to remember President Clinton's most pertinent advice to all 
Americans -- let Richard Nixon be judged on the entirety of his record. How 
many, I wonder, realize that the young Nixon had an African American fraternity 
brother while at Whittier College? And brought him home to dinner to meet the 
family? 
</P>
<P>
 Such facts are on record in the Whittier College President Richard Nixon Oral 
History Project Tapes, which I had been authorized by the college to compile 
during the years 1971 to 1973. They would shed significant light on this most 
complex of complex personalities. Red tape has them stifled in the National 
Archives Annex at Laguna Niguel, disgracefully.

BEAR SHOT IN AZUSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Bear Killed by Police in Azusa Neighborhood," May 21: 
</P>
<P>
 With all the poaching that is already decimating the bear population in this 
country, you would think a little more care would go into protecting the bear 
that wandered into a neighborhood. More disturbing, though, is the fact that it 
seems this bear was killed for the convenience of time. I have read nothing yet 
that suggests this bear was about to maul someone, only that it had broken 
through two barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course there is the obvious question, why hadn't the state Department of 
Fish and Game wardens shot more tranquilizer darts into this creature? Did they 
only bring two with them? Sadly, unlike a burglar or murderer, this bear did 
not realize it was committing a crime, so it should have been given more 
latitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I don't think this sends a good message to the youth; there is enough 
senseless violence in this world. When we have a chance to save an innocent 
living creature, man or beast, we should try. This type of ending shows kids it 
is easier to shoot than try and resolve the situation to the mutual 
satisfaction of both parties.

 * I find it hard to believe that in this high-tech society, scientists have 
figured out how to go to the moon, how to shoot down Scud missiles, how to 
build a bigger and better electronic superhighway -- yet can't sedate a bear. 
What a crime against nature! When will we learn the high cost of exploiting our 
environment instead of preserving it?

 * It appears that if humans get their way we will soon be living in a concrete 
jungle where "wildlife" is something viewed through steel bars. The bear that 
lost its way in the streets of Azusa didn't realize it had entered the domain 
of humans and would soon become target practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The caption "Losing Its Bearings" (Orange County) above the photo of the bear 
taken before it was murdered is a sad parody of a play on words indicating the 
lack of respect and compassion humans have for animals. Humans aren't the only 
species in the world, they just think they are.

 * Regarding "Animal Lovers Distraught at Bear's Death," May 22: 
</P>
<P>
 Those animal lovers who were upset probably wish that the bear had killed a 
child or two before the police stopped him. That would have justified the 
shooting. The fact that no one was injured is a tribute to the officer in 
charge of the scene, Sgt. James Collins, and the officers under him. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we have encroached on the bear's habitat by building homes in his back 
yard. Yes, all our technology was unable to safely anesthetize the bear. Yes, 
it's a shame that a beautiful wild animal with every right to live was 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact remains that everyone on the scene did all they could to avoid 
killing that bear. When we weigh the right of a bear to live against the duty 
of the police to protect the people, the people must prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, Sgt. Collins, for doing your job and safeguarding the citizens who 
rely on you to be there.

 * Another wild vicious beast was mercifully put to death after intruding into 
the domain of civilized man. This frightful scenario will continue to take 
place as long as adequate measures to ensure human safety are postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month a jogger was put upon by a mountain lion who took her life when the 
woman inadvertently ran too close to the lion's lair. And as inhabitable land 
is developed and possessed by our ever-expanding population, the risk grows.  
</P>
<P>
 My proposal is this: Move now to contain and control all areas that could be 
looked upon as potentially developed by man. Confine small numbers of 
indigenous species to zoos and eliminate the rest. Semi-automatic weapons would 
be particularly invaluable to the cause and would prove their worth to the 
age-old sport of the hunt. Not to mention newly created jobs for inner-city 
youth in the taxidermy industry that is sure to experience a boom following the 
inordinate amount of trophies that will need to be mounted. And while we're at 
it, I would like to propose the elimination of all remaining forest in the 
state as well as in the nation. Forests tend to provide habitat for many 
dangerous species of violently inclined wildlife. 
</P>

 And then, there are the oceans. Let's not forget the oceans.

 * The Azusa Police Department has now provided me with a whole new definition 
for the term "out of control." A bear strolling down a cul-de-sac or sleeping 
in someone's off-limits driveway is now "out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Gee whiz and golly, I'm glad we citizens have got these tough guys to protect 
us. Who needs patience, ingenuity or compassion when we have tough hombres with 
guns?

KEEPER OF A VERY SPECIAL TREASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cynic about teachers -- or perhaps a romantic about students -- once defined 
the university as consisting of two essential parts: the library and the 
printing press. 
</P>
<P>
 With all due respect for the splendid faculty at UCLA, we must regard its 
6-million-volume University Research Library as at least a semi-distinct 
institution.Were the university to die, the library could live on. 
</P>
<P>
 This thought comes to mind because of the death this month, at 80, of Robert 
Gordon Vosper, the university's distinguished second librarian and the man who 
dedicated the research library in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Vosper is well remembered for his ability to blend sly wit, professional 
excellence and institutional sagacity in agreeably unpredictable measures as 
the occasion might require. 
</P>
<P>
 The library that Vosper helped build, for the millions who have used it over 
the years, including many who have never taken and never will take a course, 
may be the university's strongest claim on public devotion and the public 
purse. The library may not bring in revenue, but it builds a long-term 
institutional loyalty that counts with taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time when the perceived importance of the library seems to be dropping 
even in university circles, the priority-setters could do worse than to recall 
Vosper's words on a plaque in the University Research Library: 
</P>
<P>
 "If we mean, as we do, to support creative, imaginative research and inspired 
scholarship, UCLA must have a library rich in the whole history of man's 
intellectual and cultural life, crystallized, as it is, and presented in 
books."

HOMELESSNESS: PUTTING MONEY WHERE THE CONCERN IS; CLINTON CALLS FOR 
$1.7-BILLION OUTLAY; LOS ANGELES WOULD RECEIVE $40 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most promising element of the Clinton Administration's ambitious new plan 
"to break the cycle of homelessness and prevent future homelessness" is the 
amount of money requested from Congress. The Administration seeks an 
unprecedented $1.7 billion, which would more than quadruple the funds now 
available to Los Angeles and other heavily impacted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new federal funds would be allocated on the basis of poverty and 
unemployment rates, Los Angeles stands to get $40 million next year. Orange, 
Ventura, San Bernardino and Riverside counties would share $46 million. 
Washington wouldn't dictate how the new money would be spent. Rightly, that 
would be a local determination. By law, nonprofit organizations -- the key 
players in the recent assault on homelessness -- must get 51% of the funds. 
That mandate would allow groups that have long provided scarce social services 
and built affordable housing to collaborate rather than compete for crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's plan is expensive because the Clinton team honestly 
acknowledges the scope of homelessness, and the complexity of the multiple 
challenges. The federal plan cites recent studies finding that between 500,000 
and 600,000 people are homeless on any given night. Christopher Jencks, a 
sociology professor at Northwestern University and the author of the new book 
"The Homeless," believes that the number of the "visible homeless" -- who live 
in shelters or public places like doorways, parks and cars -- is between 
300,000 and 400,000. Jencks in large part links the recent increase in the 
numbers of aggressive panhandlers and confused or babbling men and women 
pushing shopping carts to the proliferation of cheap crack cocaine and 
government's failure to provide adequate mental health treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of three single adults who agreed to the voluntary and anonymous drug 
testing requested by the Cuomo Commission at New York shelters tested positive 
for cocaine, according to Jencks. In family shelters, 16% tested positive. 
Jencks puts overall drug use at 25%, and notes that it makes the users even 
less employable, deprives them of money for rent, drives away friends and 
family members who could give them shelter and in general prolongs their 
homelessness. They need drug treatment, job training and additional low-cost 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of three homeless people is severely mentally ill, according to Jencks. 
Many wouldn't be on the streets if states still operated the warehouse-like 
mental hospitals that were common in earlier generations. According to Jencks, 
these people require some mix of hospitalization, outpatient programs, rent 
vouchers to pay for board-and-care facilities and government support for 
relatives willing to provide care. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these daunting challenges, Henry G. Cisneros, the head of the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, promises to reduce homelessness by 
one-third. HUD has already selected Los Angeles, the second-largest city in the 
nation, to receive a special homeless initiative grant for pilot programs to 
close gaps in services. Officials of a new city-county effort expect to use 
that $20-million infusion to target a 60-square-mile area that stretches from 
East Los Angeles through the poor neighborhoods of Downtown, Pico-Union and 
Echo Park then south through South-Central, Watts and Willowbrook. Smaller 
satellite projects are planned in Glendale, Long Beach, the Westside and 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the homeless mentally ill, the most visible street people, new pilot 
programs expect to replicate the successful Los Angeles Men's Place (LAMP), a 
drop-in center that also offers short- and long-term housing. LAMP outreach 
workers avoid high-pressure tactics; their approach is to seek to help the 
homeless mentally ill reconnect to society. Helping sick people who hear 
voices, fear others and are prone to violence is difficult. As the Clinton plan 
and the Jencks book indicate, they need more than a place to live. Providing 
treatment, services and financial aid will require a long-term commitment from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration deserves credit for tackling a thorny social 
problem with a request for significant new funds and a well-thought-out plan of 
action that is long overdue. Now does America have the political patience 
required to make this plan successful?

THE REAL THREAT FROM RUSSIA; CRIME IS EXPLODING, PROMPTING INTERNATIONAL 
CONTROL EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest threat to international security coming from Russia these days, in 
the view of many concerned specialists, isn't military but criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Soviet Union's collapse 30 months ago organized crime has become 
Russia's major growth industry. The head of the organized crime control section 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow says nearly 5,700 criminal groups 
with about 100,000 members have been identified so far. Mikhail Yegorov warns 
that the activities of these gangs threaten Russia's economic and social life. 
They threaten more: Gangs rooted in Russia or one of several other former 
republics of the Soviet Union now operate in 29 countries, including the United 
States. The danger to American interests is serious enough that the FBI will 
soon open its first permanent office in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list of the FBI's concerns, Director Louis J. Freeh told 
Congress the other day, is that Russian criminal gangs might be able by theft 
or purchase to acquire nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction or the 
means for making them. Such weapons could then be sold to terrorist groups or 
to governments that have not scrupled before to engage in terrorist acts -- 
Iran, Iraq, Libya or North Korea, most prominently. So far, Freeh said, no 
"serious diversion" of weapons-grade nuclear materials has taken place. But 
significant amounts of "relatively low-grade nuclear materials" smuggled out of 
Russia have turned up in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The end or at least the easing of police repression in Russia and the chaotic 
conditions invited by an erosion of central control have opened fertile fields 
in which organized crime has been able to flourish. Extortion, kidnaping, drug 
trafficking, money laundering, smuggling, murder and other serious crimes have 
become commonplace. Just a few weeks ago, an outspoken anti-crime 
parliamentarian was assassinated in Moscow. Russian gangs, Freeh says, have 
forged ties with organized crime in Italy, Colombia and a number of Asian 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Internal Affairs ministry's Yegorov has called for greater 
international cooperation to combat the growing menace. Washington is willing. 
Next month Freeh and other U.S. officials plan to visit Russia to talk about 
improving information exchanges. Germany is urging improved anti-crime 
coordination through Interpol. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing merely symbolic in such efforts. Organized crime and the 
official corruption that everywhere accompanies it represent an unmistakable 
threat to Russia's chances for stability and economic development. And washing 
over Russia's borders, crime poses a new challenge to the security of other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater international cooperation to deal with this menace isn't just an 
option but an urgent necessity.

PERSPECTIVES ON WAGING WAR; THE GRAYING OF BITTERNESS AND PAIN; THE WORLD MOVES 
ON, EVEN FOR VIETNAM VETS, BUT IN MEMORY, THE DEAD ARE STILL YOUNG, TOO YOUNG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ESTES, Jack Estes, author of the Vietnam memoir A Field of Innocence, 
is co-founder of Fallen Warriors Foundation, a nonprofit organization doing 
humanitarian work in Vietnam. He lives in Lake Oswego, Ore.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a Vietnam veteran, and every year around Memorial Day I start to get 
depressed. I fade out. My wife notices it first. She says I am going numb, 
looking sad and distant. She knows I am thinking about the war. 
</P>
<P>
 At work, I find myself drifting, remembering when my friends' lives spilled 
into my hands. In between phone calls and memos, I see flatbed trucks stacked 
with dead boys from small towns that I can no longer name. In boot camp, they 
never told me I would see someone shot in the head and then carry him to bed 
for 20 years. Yes. The dead are my springtime disability. My red-white-and-blue 
Memorial Day reality. Every year it is the same. 
</P>
<P>
 I was 17 the year I met my first wife, Marcia. She worked at a hamburger joint 
not far from our high school. During those long, hot, summer days she would 
stand at the milkshake machine and look back over her shoulder at me. Just 
seeing her walk made me crazy. We graduated the following June, 1967. Before 
Christmas, Marcia was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, with no job and no apparent future, I joined the Marine Corps. 
That spring, Marcia and I were married. 
</P>
<P>
 By the summer of '68, I was toting a machine gun in the mountains near Khe 
Sanh while Marcia carried our unborn child to work every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenine was born at the end of August, as I sat in a night ambush somewhere in 
the jungle, on the side of a mountain, near a placed called Mothers' Ridge. I 
remember the night she was born because it was so dark and a kid named Flowers 
sat on a land mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the year, Marcia sent me letters. When I had malaria, she wrote; 
when I was wounded, she wrote. And then on Easter in 1969, just after Big Jimmy 
was shot in the throat, Marcia met me for R&R in Hawaii. I held my 9-month-old 
baby for the first time. A week later, I was back in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 When I came home, I was barely 20 and I had changed. Marcia cried all the 
time,it seemed, and I missed holding my rifle. Sometimes when I was angry I 
would imagine shooting people or dream again about how Gerny died, shot just 
below the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before Memorial Day, Marcia left me. She took Jenine and the few 
things we owned from our small apartment and we were never together again. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I drifted to the other side of right sometimes, punching holes 
in walls or unfortunate drunks, before finally settling down. But the images 
never entirely left me. Especially around Memorial Day, I would see head wounds 
and sucking chest wounds and the split-open bellies of bloated enemies floating 
in rain-filled bomb craters. 
</P>
<P>
 I have exorcised the war through acceptable and unacceptable means, and I have 
found that being with other veterans is the best. On Veterans Day two years 
ago, I flew to Washington to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial. I walked through the park where the black granite wall 
rests, etched with names of all those fine young minds that seem to have been 
wasted. In the park, near the statue of the three soldiers on patrol, I spoke 
with vets who'd lost arms and legs and drank beer with a guy who had been shot 
through the jaw. I felt good being there. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of the Veterans Day parade, thousands of us gathered under gray 
skies in front of the Smithsonian Institution. A small band played as we 
huddled in the cool morning air. The aged warriors stood tall, pumped up for 
their hurrah, some carrying banners -- 101st Airborne, 3rd Marines, Screaming 
Eagles. . . . Out front sat the wheelchairs with one-legged and no-legged 
reminders of what war really costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade headed down Seventh Street. From the middle of the pack I could see 
the front ranks turn into Constitution Avenue. I envisioned crowds and 
deafening cheers. As we reached the turn, I could see the peak of the 
Washington Monument, but there were no crowds. There were no banners or bands 
or fresh-faced kids running up to shake our hands. An elderly couple stood by 
the reflection ponds near the monument, waving little paper U.S. flags; two 
boys and their dad held a sign that said "We love you Uncle Jim." But the 
sidewalks were empty. Veterans on both sides of me wiped at their eyes or said 
obscenities.  
</P>
<P>
 I was embarrassed as we shuffled past the White House and worked our way back 
to the park. I felt sad as some marchers dropped out. In the park, there was 
cheering and clapping and music playing, but it was the veterans from the front 
of the parade, who had fallen back to greet their brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the wall, veterans and their families gathered quietly, feet 
shuffling, not speaking, eyes glistening, stunned by their failed parade. 
</P>
<P>
 To those folks, and to all the guys who died, whose names are etched on the 
black granite wall or in the minds of their brothers. . . . Semper Fi.

PERSPECTIVES ON WAGING WAR; TRICKING HITLER: SPIES, LIES, ULTRA INTELLIGENCE; 
THE SPY WARS THAT PRECEDED D-DAY GAVE THE ALLIES A CRITICAL EDGE; 
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE IS BY NO MEANS A 'SIDESHOW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY GODSON, Roy Godson is a professor of government at Georgetown University 
and coordinator of the Washington-based Consortium for the Study of 
Intelligence. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the coming days, we will celebrate the spectacular achievements, and honor 
the tremendous sacrifice, of D-day -- June 6, 1944. But the retelling of the 
massive invasion -- 5,000 ships, 20,000 vehicles, 150,000 soldiers on June 6 
alone -- will be incomplete if we do not recall that D-day's success was made 
possible by a counterintelligence operation so well-planned and coordinated 
that it remains to this day a standard of excellence.  
</P>
<P>
 British security forces were remarkably successful in detecting German spies 
sent to infiltrate the United Kingdom. Some were hanged, some imprisoned, but a 
number were turned into double agents by MI5, British counterintelligence. 
Through these double agents, the Allies learned what Nazi intelligence wanted 
to know and by inference, Nazi strategic designs. They also became part of an 
elaborate network of real and fictitious spies (the "double-cross system") that 
was used to feed false and misleading intelligence back to Berlin, including 
supposed plans and preparations for the Allied invasion of France. 
</P>
<P>
 A second critical element was the British ability to intercept and decode many 
Nazi military, diplomatic and intelligence communications. With assistance from 
Polish and French intelligence before the war and also from German security 
officials who refused to believe their codes had been broken, British 
cryptologists cracked "Enigma," Germany's sophisticated electro-mechanical 
enciphering machine. Known as "Ultra," the decoded German messages became the 
most closely guarded secret of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Double agents in place and Enigma broken, the infrastructure was set for a 
grand deception. The Allies had two goals: to mask the initial assault on 
Normandy and to buy time to gain a foothold in coastal France. The ruse they 
came up with was the linchpin of the invasion strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they had to persuade Hitler that the invasion would not take place at 
Normandy, but to the north at Calais. This was logical, since Calais is at the 
narrowest part of the English Channel. In the months leading up to D-day, what 
appeared to be a massive Allied buildup was deployed across from Calais in 
eastern and southeastern England. German reconnaissance planes spied this 
assemblage of tanks, barges and aircraft, but did not detect that most were 
made of plywood, paint and tarpaulin. Nor, because of artful Allied security, 
did they detect the building of the massive, man-made "harbor" for use at the 
Normandy beaches. And finally, German intelligence intercepted supposed Allied 
radio communications that were really the phony chatter of a nonexistent army 
over which a real U.S. general, George Patton, presided. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Ultra, the Allies knew that Hitler had swallowed the bait. But it 
was not enough to simply shield the June 6 assault. Success depended on 
persuading Hitler that Normandy was a feint to mask the "real" assault at 
Calais. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allies made a bold gamble. They provided the Germans advance notice of the 
Normandy invasion's beginning. British double agent Juan Pujol Garcia -- 
code-named Garbo -- tipped his German handlers of the landing hours before the 
first wave of men and equipment hit the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late to do the Germans any good, Garbo's warning cemented his credentials 
as a top spy, setting the stage for a more critical step in the deception 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 By June 9, 1944, German generals were clamoring for reinforcements in 
Normandy. Hitler initially complied. But then Garbo urgently reported that all 
of his agents -- all fictitious creations of MI5 -- were convinced that 
Normandy was a diversion. The real strike, Garbo insisted, would still be at 
Calais. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler read Garbo's cable and rescinded the order to reinforce Normandy. For 
critical weeks after D-day, Hitler continued to hold in reserve more than a 
quarter-million German soldiers, awaiting the much-anticipated Allied attack at 
Calais. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the lesson for today to be drawn from D-day? 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, it challenges the notion that "spy wars are a sideshow of 
passionate interest to the actors, but of marginal significance for national 
policy" -- as stated in a recent New York Times editorial.  
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the brilliance of Allied strategists, analysts and operators 
involved in D-day's plans is a reminder that governments that take 
counterintelligence seriously hold a sometimes crucial advantage over those 
that don't.

WHOSE SEX DRIVE NEEDS FIXING?; MEDICINE: HEALTHY WOMEN ARE BEING HORMONALLY 
'CURED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Barbara.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Medical researchers are busy playing catch-up. Studies are being designed and 
rethought to include the impact of various drugs, lifestyle changes and 
environmental factors on women's health, to balance the data available 
exclusively about men's health. This process is fraught with obstacles to clear 
thinking presented by the way researchers, both male and female, have been 
socialized. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of this is the search for medicines that will boost women's sex 
drives. A news release from a major medical school and research center came 
across my desk recently announcing"relief for menopausal women." It went on to 
say that "menopausal women suffering from reduced sexual desire may find relief 
from an alternative type of hormone-replacement therapy." The words suffering 
and relief in this context bothered me. The release further claimed that "women 
who took estrogen plus androgens reported improvement in libido and sexual 
satisfaction as early as three weeks after treatment began. . . . Their 
husbands reported the same thing." It made me wonder precisely who was being 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
 This perspective might not be so troubling were it not so pervasive. Not long 
ago, a male colleague sought my opinion about a patient who had come to see him 
because of her "decreased sexual drive." The patient was a woman in her mid-30s 
who, after having been married for 10 years, had a child, and then a year 
later, a second child. She had returned to work soon after the birth of each 
child and, at the time she saw my colleague, was working full-time and 
mothering 1- and 2-year-old daughters. She reported being exhausted most of the 
time. This patient's husband was distressed because his wife seemed 
uninterested in sex, hence her visit to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 After presenting this social history, my colleague went through the 
unremarkable findings of the physical exam and the negative results of several 
lab tests. What, he wondered, did I make of this case? I told him that his 
diagnosis was almost certainly in the first couple of sentences of the 
presentation and that his patient, happily, was a healthy, albeit overburdened, 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly stymied was a friend of mine, an extremely bright, socially 
competent and insightful woman, whose 15-year marriage had been in bad shape 
for some time. From many conversations, I gathered that her husband had 
particular and frequent sexual needs, but not the essentials of tenderness and 
respect. Over the years, she had undertaken couples counseling, read everything 
she could and repeatedly tried different ways of understanding her predicament. 
Despite all this, she called me one day and asked what she could take to 
"improve" her sexual desire. I told her I didn't think she needed improving. 
</P>
<P>
 In my practice, this pursuit by patients -- to medically understand and alter 
the woman's sexual desire -- is not uncommon. I have yet to hear, however, of a 
male patient seeking to deamplify his libido to meet his partner's needs. As a 
society, we hold very tightly to the notion that the male sex drive is a given 
and that any adapting must be done by women. How many men fake orgasms? 
</P>
<P>
 The curious aspect of this is that rarely do women's sexual impulses result in 
victimization. Women don't rape men, mothers don't sexually molest their sons, 
women teachers and ministers don't accost those in their trust. When we elect 
our first woman to the presidency, it's not likely that a series of men will 
emerge from the woodwork to accuse her of sexual harassment. The damage 
resulting from sexually aggressive women is sparse; that from male sexual 
aggression is legion. Still, we look to perk up the female's sex drive to meet 
the male's. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the ethics may not have been fully examined, we long ago headed down 
the road to medically manipulating behavior. Drugs like Prozac can chemically 
influence people's psychodynamics, changing their lives and relationships. Soon 
it may be possible to modify much of what we don't like about human behavior. 
Libido, in women, is the target of hormonal manipulation. Aside from not 
knowing the long-term health consequences of this hormone exposure, it may be 
that we're treating the wrong people. This possibility needs to be contemplated 
with caution, thoughtfulness and an eye to the biases that underlie our 
assumptions.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN ECONOMIC TERMS: PEASANTS, NOT ACTIVISTS, ARE THE KEY; CHINA: 
DEVELOPMENT IN TRADE ZONES IS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE. REFORM 
REQUIRES RESPONDING TO RURAL NEEDS.

<P>
 In all of the debate concerning the United States' renewal of China's 
most-favored-nation status in trade, two images have been dominant: a China 
that enjoys rapid economic growth and a China that refuses to improve its 
human-rights record. More specifically, while the success of special economic 
zones is praised as a symbol of China's effort to move from a centrally planned 
economy to a capitalist free market, its continuous crackdown on political 
dissidents is denounced as evidence of the regime's rigid adherence to 
communist dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 This oversimplification between an economically free China and a politically 
repressive China explains the inconsistency and awkwardness in the 
Administration's China policy. However, such oversimplification can be broken 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's China, the most blatant and massive human-rights problems are in 
rural areas, and they involve not just a few political dissidents but millions 
of the unprivileged peasants. During a recent visit, I was shocked by the sharp 
contrast between the affluent urban centers in special economic zones on the 
coast and the poverty and neglect in the rural inland regions, where the 
working-class peasants seemed resigned to their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosperity in Special Economic Zones has been made possible because they 
are granted the privilege by the government of taking up a disproportionately 
large portion of China's natural and financial resources. Unfortunately, such a 
practice has spiraled: As government favoritism enabled the coastal areas to 
develop at a much faster pace than other parts of China, their economic advance 
has put them in a position to absorb even more of China's resources. 
Consequently, the rich in the coastal cities are becoming richer, the poor in 
the inland rural areas poorer. 
</P>
<P>
 By pointing out the widening gap, I am not suggesting that China should return 
to the economic egalitarianism of the Mao era. But the unfair distribution of 
China's natural and financial resources has encroached on the rights of the 
unprivileged peasants. Most Westerners have not realized that this is a 
human-rights issue that deserves their attention; they associate the core of 
the human-rights issue with political affairs. As Lianyan Ge, a China scholar 
at Indiana University, argues, such a definition is one of the lingering 
legacies of the Cold War era. In reality, the Western preoccupation with the 
well-being of a small group of political dissidents has created a de facto 
"special human rights zone" which, not unlike the economic zones, privileges 
the few over the many. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not saying that the fates of the Chinese political dissidents do not 
deserve our serious concern. Surely, they do. Just as special economic zones 
may have played a pivotal role in transforming China's economic system, the 
"special human-rights zone" has been necessitated by the particular 
circumstances in Chinese society after the Tian An Men crackdown. But in the 
long run, both kinds of "special zones" have to be "despecialized" if the human 
rights of all the Chinese, not just a few, are to be respected. This may mean 
approaching China's human-rights issue increasingly in economic and 
environmental terms. This may also prove to be a way for the Clinton 
Administration to get over its painful vacillation on the China dilemma and 
syncretize America's business interests with moral commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, does not mean giving up the hope for a free and democratic 
China. However, as the situation in Taiwan, South Korea and other East Asian 
nations shows, a viable democracy requires a long civic tradition and 
significant economic development. There is a misconception among Westerners 
that all the Chinese are enthusiastic about democracy. This is true among the 
educated elite in affluent coastal cities. But peasants in poor inland areas 
appear suspicious about democracy and may not want to go along with the urban 
intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Russian lesson indicates that the collapse of communism is not 
necessarily followed by the universal triumph of democracy, then, according to 
what I have observed in rural China, a true political reform in Chinese society 
will not be possible unless the immediate economic concerns of peasants are 
adequately addressed. Otherwise, idealistic calls for democracy in China have a 
high chance of being self-defeating. Without economic improvement in rural 
areas, it will be difficult for the United States to make a positive impact on 
China's future.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: UTILITIES' BEATING POINTS UP COMMON RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Utility funds are suffering through one of their worst stretches since the 
1970s, but the pain hasn't been evenly distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Portfolios filled mostly with electric stocks, once synonymous with 
widows-and-orphans safety, have borne the brunt of the decline, while other 
utility investments, namely the telephone stocks, have held up better. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole episode underscores the importance of knowing what a particular fund 
holds, as the stereotypes once associated with utility funds crumble. It also 
points up the dangers of risking too much on any one industry, even one 
perceived to be stable. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people who sank money into utility funds between 1991 and 1993, when 
the group's combined assets swelled from $11.4 billion to $30.3 billion, 
probably expected fairly low volatility and generous dividend yields. And the 
funds, anchored by their electric holdings, had mostly delivered them. 
</P>
<P>
 But electric stocks have gone into a tailspin over the past eight months. Some 
utility funds with a heavy focus in this area are down 15% to 20%, including 
dividend income, over that stretch. And all of a sudden, critics are talking 
about long-lasting structural changes in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible utility funds, like bond portfolios, simply took a beating from 
the sudden reversal in interest rates that started last fall. If so, stable 
long-term rates could allow the shares to recover lost ground. Electric utility 
stocks trade much like bonds because of the large dividends they pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But a full-fledged rebound might be harder to achieve because of new worries 
surrounding deregulation. Some feel increased competition in the utility 
business will crimp earnings for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 Energy Policy Act created a competitive market for wholesale power, 
one that big industrial users are increasingly trying to exploit, says Charles 
B. Carlson, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts, an investment newsletter based in 
Hammond, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 These customers are demanding larger discounts. Downsizing offers a bargaining 
chip, as companies threatening to close plants might drive a harder bargain 
with the local electric company for lower rates on the ones that remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 Another threatening aspect is "retail wheeling," which would give any power 
generators access to a utility's transmission network, for a fee. Customers 
could then buy electricity from entities other than their local utility. Though 
not yet widespread, it could wreak havoc by making local demand hard to 
predict, Carlson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, lower-cost utilities and those with excess capacity could benefit 
from deregulation, so the outlook wouldn't be universally bleak. The 
telecommunications business provides an example of a deregulated industry that 
has thrived with competition. 
</P>
<P>
 So for investors, the relevant question is whether the bad news associated 
with deregulation is already reflected in the lower prices for electric stocks. 
Some advisers think so. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility "stocks have been the victim of bad press due to the growing 
competition in the industry," says Fund Profit Alert, a Cincinnati newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that this well-publicized growing competition has been more than 
factored into current utility share prices." 
</P>
<P>
 As positives, energy costs and utility borrowing expenses remain under 
control, the latter helped by the refinancing of debt at low interest rates. 
Also, some observers believe that deregulation in the electricity business 
could be less disruptive than in other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 And for contrarian investors willing to take some chances, the 5% to 6% yields 
available on some utility funds are certainly tempting, though it's worth 
noting that dividends could be cut in the face of deregulatory pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the more widely diversified utility portfolios, the recent ride 
has been much less bumpy. While nearly all utility funds have lost ground in 
1994, the telecommunications-driven portfolios haven't dropped as much, and a 
few funds with heavier foreign exposure are showing gains. 
</P>
<P>
 With the proliferation of fax transmissions, cellular phones, computer 
transmissions over phone lines and other high-tech applications, the domestic 
telephone industry is seen as a long-term growth business. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone industry is also viewed as a growth business abroad, especially 
in developing economies, where basic communications services are still in great 
demand -- hence the global reach of many telecommunications funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the third utility leg, natural gas shares, could offer good potential. 
Carlson predicts that these companies, which have already gone through their 
own bout of deregulation, will outperform electric stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Spitz, manager of the $4-billion Prudential Utilities Fund, the largest 
fund in the group, has boosted his natural gas stake to 30% of assets, compared 
to 5% for other utility funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, utility funds that can move among all three industries may well 
continue to be the best way to go for utility investors. Presumably, these 
people still want the stable performance they long associated with utility 
shares but which they are no longer getting with electric stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The worst may be over for fixed-income funds, says the chief economist at 
brokerage Kidder Peabody in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fairly bullish on long-term bonds," says Anthony J. Vignola, who thinks 
yields on 30-year Treasuries could ease to about 7% by year's end from 7.4% 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Vignola believes long-term interest rates have risen too fast since October in 
relation to short-term rates and inflation. While the nation is nearing 
realistic "full employment" with about 6% unemployment, inflation has been 
reined in, and the Federal Reserve Board has acted early to control it, he 
says. Also, rising productivity here and weak economies abroad are helping to 
keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet short-term bond funds may not fare so well, says Vignola, who believes the 
central bank will continue to tighten credit in the second half of 1994.

STREET SMART: U-TURNS NEAR AIRPORT EXIT WOULD CREATE TRAFFIC DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there a "No U-Turn" sign at northbound Campus Drive and Airport Way? 
Because of the sign, motorists are required to enter the airport to make a 
U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot see any problems that would be created by allowing U-turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Salisbury Newport Beach Rich Edmonston, traffic engineer for Newport 
Beach, said that if drivers were allowed to make a U-turn on northbound Campus 
Drive at that spot, they would be turning into lanes used by motorists turning 
right out of the airport on Airport Way. 
</P>
<P>
 And because that airport traffic is particularly heavy, the city does not want 
to allow a U-turn on Campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 This is regarding a traffic signal at the southbound Valley View Street 
on-ramp to the northbound San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lane which directs on-ramp traffic only. It is separated from the 
other southbound lanes by a solid line. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is a confusing traffic signal at the entrance to the on-ramp. 
The same light that controls southbound traffic on Valley View is placed to the 
right of the on-ramp entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there is no permissible access to the on-ramp from any other direction, 
is this light to be treated like a right-on-red situation?  
</P>
<P>
 Kevin E. Condon Garden Grove No. Because you have to go past the signal to get 
to the entrance of the on-ramp, a right turn on red is not legal, said Rose 
Orem, a Caltrans spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When is the extension of Weir Canyon Road from the Riverside Freeway to the 
end of Jamboree Road at Santiago Canyon Road in the Orange Hills planned to 
open?  
</P>
<P>
 This would provide an alternate route to the Costa Mesa Freeway, especially 
for South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian D. Bowski Mission Viejo The Weir Canyon Road extension is on the Orange 
County Master Plan, but it will be at least 20 years before anything is done 
there, said Richard Peterson, manager of transportation planning for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, when the economy started spiraling downward, development 
plans for the eastern portion of the city of Orange were squelched.  
</P>
<P>
 When those plans died, plans for the road died with it, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority has made several changes in its 
fares and bus routes. Route changes will take effect June 12 and the new fares 
will take effect July 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Transfers that now cost a nickel will be free. The transfers will allow 
passengers to board up to two other buses and can be used for two hours from 
the time they are issued. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA also is introducing a fare coupon book at a discounted price. Ten ride 
coupons worth $1 each will cost $9. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfers from Amtrak to OCTA buses now will cost 50 cents. Metrolink 
transfers will remain free. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on route changes will be printed in a new guide, which will be 
available at most major grocery stores and discount stores on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit terminals and buses also will carry the new timetables beginning July 
1. 
</P>

 Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now, or LEARN, is the 
latest effort to reform the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's 
second largest. Here is a look at how the reform effort began, where it is at 
now and how the first 34 schools have fared as they complete their first year 
in the program. Also included are some observations of critics and 
"stakeholders," LEARN's name for those who are integrally involved in the 
restructuringprocess. THE PROCESS The LEARN school journey involves many steps. 
In addition to several parent days and regular "stakeholder" meetings, each of 
the initial 34 LEARN schools went through the following: 1. Start-up Nearly 100 
schools express interes in participating. However only 34 meet the criteria of 
demonstrated support from parents, principal, school staff, students and 
teachers. Their applications are sent to the superintendent, who reviews 
applications in collaboration with teachers, parents and clerical and support 
staff leaders, with final approval from the school board. 2. Training. Each 
school community received the equivalent of $68,000 worth of outside help from 
the following two groups: UCLA Advanced Management program This 15-month 
training cycle involves intensive leadership development primarily for the 
principal and a teacher representative, called a "lead" teacher. Subjects 
include budgeting, strategic planning and conflict resolution. It also links 
each school with a mentor and other technical expertise from the business 
world. * Los Angeles Educational Partnership This 15-month training cycle with 
this 10-year-old nonprofit agency involves the entire school community. 
Principals and teachers are joined by classified staff and parents in workshops 
at the schools. The group looks at subjects ranging from grant writing to 
transforming classroom practices. Each school is assigned an on-site "school 
change" consultant to help through the transition. 3. Outcomes All school 
stakeholders reach consensus upon a final site action plan to improve academic 
achievement for all students and with clear timelines and targets. By the end 
of the first year, all plans will be in place. Some plan components are already 
being implemented. Other parts of the plan will be implemented in the next 
school year. HOW TWO SCHOOLS FARED Carthay Center Elementary Southgate area 
Wayne Moore, Principal "Our weakest link is getting more parents buying in, 
though the attitude of parents has changed. The parents were very honest with 
us and said, don't give us workshops, give us projects to do. So with them we 
repainted the school auditorium. Ad we had two 'clean and trim' days, where 
they trimmed and removed bushes and reseeded the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first reform effort in my career where the follow-through is as 
well thought out as the report. For example, I have business mentor who's a 
professional running a business. I know how to run a school, but Christopher 
Forman, president of Pacific Theatres Realty Corp., helps me stay on a steady 
course of management. LEARN is going to help us run schools as a business, 
where the children are the clients." * Paula Tsou, Kindergarten / first-grade 
teacher "We extended the traditional three-hour kindergarten to 8:25 a.m. to 
1:40 p.m. LEARN gave us the flexibility to create this kind of program. I have 
seen a remarkable growth in the students academically. Many of them are reading 
already. 
</P>
<P>
 "As LEARN lead teacher, I've been overwhelmed by the amount of things I've had 
to do. I've had my regular class and I feel like I've got another part-time 
job. What I've learned is that there can be true collaboration between 
administrators and other stakeholders." * Sharie LaKind, Mother of 
kindergartener and second-grader "The problem is getting people involved. The 
first couple of meetings we filled the auditorium. After that it cut in half, 
then it was 20 people for the rest of the year. A lot of parents don't get home 
from work in time to go to parent meetings. Our plan for next year is saying, 
'This is what we want to do this year' and giving parents choices. We'll let 
people pick the projects they want to work on and the hours they want to do 
it." * Bryson Avenue Elementary Wilshire area Merrilee Holzhauser, Assistant 
principal "Many of the programs we have are not adequate to meet our needs. A 
number of children or parents have emotional or other problems. We're in the 
initial stages of making connections with a local clinic to partner with us. 
With LEARN, we're discovering all these levels of services and people 
interested in assisting us that were never there before. Because we're here 
every day running a school, we were very used to being isolated. Now we're 
seeking out partnerships, whereas before we were used to doing things alone." * 
Richard Ingalls, Sixth-grade teacher "This is a 'we' effort. You just start 
feeling better about the type of job you're doing. That's right now the 
positive thing you could say about LEARN in the first year, that staff morale 
has been brought up. Under the goals we've set schoolwide, with parents, 
teachers, administrators and other staff, when a student gets to me in sixth 
grade, I will have known what they were given in the fifth, and my program will 
be a build-upon. We will now build in first grade on what happens in 
kindergarten, and then all the way up." * Melody Hernandez, Mother of a 
fifth-and first-graders "LEARN has helped the parents to be part of the school. 
I used to be on the other side of the fence, watch my children go through, and 
go home. Now I can go in and help other children. We have a new program called 
Bulldog Buddy. Parents take a child that needs reading, and help that child 
maybe half an hour. It's not just their own child, just whoever needs it. It's 
not the kid's school or the principal's school, it's the community's school. 
That's what's important. If you have the community to help, you're going to 
have a successful school." HOW SOME SEE IT State Sen David Roberti, D-Van Nuys 
"LEARN is trying very hard but the solution lies in the parents having more 
input and control over the children's education. That can only come with the 
breakup of the LAUSD. Ten years ago, LEARN would have been just what the doctor 
ordered but unfortunately the patient is still critically ill." * Helen 
Bernstein, President United Teachers of Los Angeles, union for the district's 
33,000 teachers. "You can only be held accountable for those things you can 
control. This gives teachers a great deal of control over things that for years 
they said they wanted control of. 
</P>
<P>
 "The training is invaluable. The money is raised privately and that is an 
opportunity that should not be missed. We've never had good professional 
development. We should find out once and for all if that does make a 
difference." * Walter Backstrom, Managing director of Service Employees 
International, Local 99, which represents 28,000 custodians, gardenes and 
teaching aides. "LEARN has been a learning process for teachers and 
administrators and our employees, because if there's a meeting about the budget 
or anything, classified employees are supposed to be in the room. It's been 
richly rewarding but difficult a times. It's been like a family, where you 
sometimes argue but you get together and are better for it." * Mike Ross, LEARN 
president and CEO "It's no surprise to us that a the district moves to public 
school choice, there is little-usually no-availability in the LEARN schools. I 
was having lunch with an Armenian fellow who develops low-end apartments. He 
was telling me he got a call at the beginning of the school year from a guy who 
manages one of his buildings in Sun Valley, a building he characterized as hard 
to rent. The manager said all of these people are applying to move in. The 
owner said to find out what's happening, and the answer came back from every 
applicant, "There's a LEARN school here and we want our kids to go there." * 
Sid Thompson, Superintendent, LAUSD "Other reform movements, such as charter 
schools, represent individual school efforts to improve education. LEARN, on 
the other hand, is a system-wide reform movement. It has as its basic concept 
the return of the public schools to the people. Its objective is improved 
instruction through a collaborative system in which all members of a school 
community will have a hand in the governance." Other Reform Efforts LAUSD 
reform is happening on more than one front. Besides LEARN, two other programs 
aim to increase authority of school principals, teachers, and parents over 
curriculum, staffing and budgets. Schools may participate in more than on 
effort. School-Based-Management: It was launched by the district in 1990 as 
part of its settlement of the 1989 teacher's strike. It broadened school 
autonomy in a three-phase process. Each school is run based on ideas generated 
by an elected leadership council of parents, principal and teachers. Waivers 
are granted for schools to operate outside district and state rules and labor 
contract provisions. Schools participating: 92. Charter Schools: A state law 
effective Jan.1, 1993, allows 10 schools from each district to operate free 
from control of local districts and exempt from some state educational 
regulations. LAUSD has 10 charter schools. TIMELINE 1991 Feb. 27 
</P>
<P>
 Dissatisfied with the city's public schools, business, community and education 
leaders form the nonprofit Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring 
Now (LEARN) to reform the Los Angeles Unified School District. The 13-member 
working group asks Mike Roos, then speaker pro tem of the California State 
Assembly, to be LEARN's president. Spring LEARN polls area residents and finds 
that 68% believe that the schools are doing a poor job preparing students for 
the job market. However, more than 80% would give city schools more money if 
they knew it would be spent more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 June-December LEARN gathers data on school reform practices throughout North 
America and drafts initial reform proposal. 1992 January-October Educators, 
business and community volunteers form seven task forces. They look at how to 
reshape student learning and assessment, educator professional development, 
parental involvement, school to work transition, and school governance, 
accountability, social services, facilities and finance. October LEARN sends 
its draft to 625 trustees -- a cross-section of academic, community and 
business leaders. They make some changes and help to ratify the plan. 1993 
March 15 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Board of Education unanimously approves the LEARN plan in the face 
of a campaign to break up the district and a statewide ballot initiative to 
give parents vouchers to send their children to private schools. Both efforts 
fail. May 17 Thirty-four Los Angeles schools formally join LEARN program. 
</P>
<P>
 July 11 A principal and one teacher from each school begin an intensive 
training course developed by UCLA's business and education schools. Parents and 
school staffs receive separate training. LEARN raises $1.2 million in private 
funds to underwrite these costs. 1994 February A teams of parents, teachers, 
administrators, classified staffers and the principal from each LEARN school 
begin attending a series of workshops, developed by Los Angeles Educational 
Partnership, to produce actual plans for improving student achievement. Each 
school is also assigned a BUSINESS consultant to be an "in-house coach" for 
implementation. April Parents, teachers, students and staff are surveyed on how 
they feel about LEARN's first year. Results are expected by July. May An 
additional 53 schools apply to LEARN program. LEARN officials begin raising 
about $2.4 million for training that will begin this summer for the new group 
of schools. May 16 LAUSD trustees reaffirm their commitment to LEARN by 
formalizing and streamlining funding for LEARN schools.

SHOP TALK: VACATION POLICY MAKES ADVANCE PLANNING NECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 D o you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions of general 
interest will be answered in this column on Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: My boss won't let more than two people at a time take vacation in 
our department, although we manage just fine when a lot more than that are out 
with flu, vacations or sick children. I have more than once been refused the 
time off I wanted, which makes planning vacations with my husband difficult 
because of his rigid work schedule. Any solutions to this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.S., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The solution to your problems may be as simple as planning ahead so 
you can schedule your vacation at the same time as your husband's. In many 
organizations, vacation planning takes place at least six months in advance; 
perhaps your boss would be willing to work with you so your preferences in 
vacation dates could be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
 Your belief that your department works just fine when more than two persons 
are absent should be documented and shared with your boss. Maybe the two-person 
policy is based on information that is no longer current. Your proof that the 
work overload during vacations or absences can be handled within the department 
may sway your boss to relax the policy.  
</P>
<P>
 You might also suggest that the department be organized into support teams. 
The team members would be given the responsibility to allocate the work of 
missing team members among themselves. This way they can cover for each other 
when absences occur. If the team members recognize the value of such an 
arrangement and are willing to do a little extra work, your boss might not 
notice any change in unit performance when occasional absences occur. My guess 
is that now your boss must go through the hassle of work reassignments when 
absences occur. If you and your co-workers can help your boss avoid this 
problem, he or she might be willing to be more lenient in vacation scheduling. 
</P>

<P>
 Question: Our company has a policy of doing performance evaluations every six 
months, but I would be surprised if most employees receive an evaluation once 
each year. How often should performance evaluations be done? Could there be any 
legal ramifications if we do not review an employee for an entire year? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A.G., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Conducting performance evaluations is one of the most valuable tasks a 
supervisor can do. Done correctly, performance evaluations serve many purposes. 
They are usually the means by which employees get raises and promotions. The 
company profits by gathering data on workers' performance.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, evaluations can be used to provide constructive feedback to help 
workers correct below-par performance. Given their tremendous value to the 
organization, performance evaluations should be done regularly. Formal 
evaluations should be done at least once every six months (if not more often). 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing an employee to go more than a year without a formal performance 
evaluation is a bad management strategy. While there are no specific laws 
mandating regular performance evaluations, a company could get into trouble if 
an employee files a grievance and there is insufficient or nonexistent data on 
an employee's performance. Regular performance assessment simply makes good 
management sense.

EX-FARRAKHAN AIDE SHOT AT UC RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Khallid Abdul Muhammad, a controversial former aide to Nation of Islam leader 
Louis Farrakhan, was wounded in a parking lot shooting Sunday evening at UC 
Riverside, where Muhammad had just given a speech, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riverside police sergeant said two or three other people were also wounded, 
none of them seriously.An Associated Press photographer said Muhammad was hit 
in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd surrounded the gunman in the parking lot outside a university 
auditorium where Muhammad had spoken, and beat him before authorities could 
break up the fight. He is in police custody, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were injured in the parking lot shoving after the shooting, said 
university spokesman Jack Chappell. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, 43, had been suspended from his duties as senior aide to Nation of 
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after a speech in November in which he called Jews 
"the bloodsuckers of the black nation and the black community." 
</P>
<P>
 That speech was denounced by President Clinton and other black and Jewish 
leaders, as well as by Farrakhan himself. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, Muhammad had spoken to a crowd of about 1,000 at the Vision 
Complex theater in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered no apology for his past remarks, warning the few whites in the 
audience that his speech would be "a rough ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad accused Jews of becoming involved in the civil rights movement in an 
attempt to advance their own interests and said their involvement had actually 
hindered black progress.

WOMAN'S $40,000 GOES OUT WITH THE GARBAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Joel Forrester pulled the lever on his garbage truck's trash compactor 
last week, an envelope burst open and $100 bills started floating out. 
</P>
<P>
 After calling his boss, Forrester and other trash haulers began picking 
through the garbage, coming up with more and more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a customer called and told them she had stashed $40,000 in a wastebasket 
that was disposed of by a relative helping her clean house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recovered $39,980," Dewey Strauss, president of Valley Garbage Service 
said Friday. The customer, whose name was not made public, got the money back. 
Forrester got no reward for turning in the money.

WORLD CUP GIVES ARTIST CHANCE TO SEND MESSAGE; ART: WILLIE HERRON'S MURAL 
SALUTING THE SOCCER TOURNAMENT WILL WELCOME LAX'S DIVERSE VISITORS WITH A CALL

<P>
 For Laguna Hills muralist Willie Herron, the part of the World Cup soccer 
tournament that will be played in Los Angeles represents far more than just the 
ending of an international ball game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an opportunity for him to capture, symbolically through art, the uniting 
of hundreds of ethnically and racially diverse players -- many on the same 
teams -- from around the globe in the struggle to achieve a single goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In his giant World Cup mural, which was unveiled in a San Juan Capistrano 
studio Sunday in its nearly completed form, Herron conveys his greatest hope: 
that, like the soccer players, the people of the world will unite, then 
struggle to cure their mutual ills. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of his banner-like mural is "Solo Unido Un Mundo Vencera" (Spanish 
for "only united can one world be victorious"). It is one of five that will 
welcome long-distance travelers to Los Angeles and commemorate the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to take a problem and create something positive from that in an 
image," Herron said of his mural, referring to the inability of many nations to 
work together. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural reflects his vision of a better world. "This mural was inspired more 
than anything else by a futuristic kind of feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The painting is an image of a group of nondescript athletes -- Herron 
intentionally leaves nationality out of the picture -- helping one another 
reach up toward a globe and a World Cup trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the 50-foot-high, 40-foot-wide mural will be rolled up and then 
trucked to Los Angeles International Airport, where it will hang from a parking 
structure facing the International Terminal. Travelers will be greeted by 
Herron's work for the next 4 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to welcome people from around the world to Los Angeles," 
said Mission Viejo resident and bus driver Mark Andrews, who spent an hour 
Sunday gazing at and photographing the mural. "I see a message we should all 
seriously think about: 'One world, one people.' As long as we're working 
against each other we won't make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Herron is a Los Angles native who is best known for his public art work in 
East Los Angeles. Those murals, painted on buildings or structures, deal with 
Latino and social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Herron was one of five painters commissioned to paint murals across Los 
Angeles for the World Cup soccer tournament, which begins in June. Eight games 
-- the finals -- will be played in Pasadena's Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four World Cup murals have been hung along freeway routes between 
LAX and the Rose Bowl. The mural program was commissioned by the Social and 
Public Resource Center in Venice. Herron, who usually earns about $30 a square 
foot for the murals he paints, will earn just $5 a square foot for his World 
Cup project. He'll split that with his partner and protege, Umberto Caiafa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing; we're basically doing it for free," Herron said of the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have worked 12- to 20-hour shifts over the last seven weeks to 
complete the mural. Utilizing the stimulative effects of coffee, jazz and 
various forms of upbeat Latin music, they have meticulously painted the 
2,000-square-foot mural one tiny section at a time. About 30 different colors 
of acrylic paint were used. 
</P>
<P>
 Herron and Caiafa rushed to complete the work by Sunday's public reception, 
but were unable to finish painting the World Cup trophy that will be situated 
toward the top of the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up until 5 a.m. this morning trying to finish. I'm very tired," said 
Caiafa, 29, in a heavy Italian accent. "I feel empty now." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing dark sunglasses to hide his tired and bloodshot eyes, 42-year-old 
Herron bounced from one guest or reception-related duty to another inside the 
warehouse during the public viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus among dozens of local residents who dropped by to view the mural 
Sunday was that the artists' long hours of work had paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The color work and the texture are good and the movement of the athletes is 
very exciting," commented artist Connie King, who lives in Irvine, as she 
viewed the mural. "I can't wait to see it all stretched out at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Herron said the mural should be hanging at LAX by the end of the week.

THE GRADUATES; 750 CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS MARK THE CONCLUSION OF YEARS OF 
STUDY AT SUNDAY'S COMMENCEMENT, A CEREMONY LIGHT IN MOOD, WEIGHTED IN 
TRADITION.

 Wearing beach shorts under black robes and everything from sandals to cowboy 
boots, Chapman University's Class of 1994 took its last bow Sunday during 
commencement exercises that drew more than 4,500 people on a sweltering spring 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does today mean? My whole life has changed," said Kevin Cook, 25, a 
business communications major who is seeking a career in marketing or 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The laid-back class of 750 graduates informally chatted, blew soap bubbles and 
sprinkled confetti on each other during the exercise. They heard welcoming 
remarks by Chapman President James L. Doti and a commencement speech by Jay H. 
Boylan, chair of the university faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan offered a light, yet thoughtful and witty address intertwining ideas 
borrowed from Hollywood movies and excerpted from books by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. He 
entitled the speech, "Advice I Got From Kurt Vonnegut Jr. That You Might Want 
to Remember." 
</P>
<P>
 "My first bit of advice," Boylan said, "is to advise you to turn off your 
television sets and start listening to NPR (National Public Radio)." 
</P>
<P>
 After talking about Vonnegut, Boylan borrowed from Hollywood when he counseled 
graduates, "Carpe diem" (Latin for "seize the day"), a phrase actor Robin 
Williams familiarized to a generation in the 1989 movie, "Dead Poets Society." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a maxim worth remembering," Boylan said. "But once you seize the day, 
and seize the future, what will you do with it?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Boylan roamed, then refocused on a phrase that begged more description, 
the audience wanted none of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me try to explain that," Boylan began before stopping short after the 
audience roared with laughter when someone shouted, "No!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Seize the day," Boylan said, ". . . seize the future. Use your consciousness. 
Or, borrowing from Jefferson Starship, 'Feed Your Head.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another lighter moment occurred when speaker Nader Baroukh, a legal studies 
and psychology graduate, propped a fishbowl on top of the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that President Doti once referred to Chapman University as a pond 
and the students as goldfish," said Baroukh, recipient of the Cheverton award, 
Chapman University's highest honor. "So I brought my goldfish here with me." 
</P>
<P>
 When the family and friends of Gina Garrovillas, a 28-year-old elementary 
school teacher in Moreno Valley, heard her name among the list of those 
graduates receiving master's degrees, they whooped with delight. Later, they 
hugged and took pictures of each other, posing with Garrovillas as she shared 
her special moment with her loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole family is here; they live in San Diego," Garrovillas said, lining up 
with five cousins for a family photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Mateo Garrovillas, said he was "on cloud nine." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to use our savings bringing up our kids and making sure they go to 
college," her father said. "Yes, and we had to pinch pennies too, because I 
have four children and three have already finished college. Our fourth is in 
junior college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made education our first priority before everything else, even cars and 
clothes," he added proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kevin Hughes, 33, from north New Jersey, graduating from college fulfilled 
a high school promise he made to himself long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on active duty in the United States Navy for 13 years," said 
Hughes, a business administration major and hospital corpsman stationed at El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station. "I couldn't afford to go to college from high 
school. It was a goal for me while I was in high school to someday finish 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said the degree will help him break from a bleak cycle of poverty that 
affects many African Americans like himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a very poor family," Hughes said. "But for a black kid growing up 
in an inner city, finishing college is very important to me. I'm the only one 
in a family of eight brothers and sisters to get a degree. To blacks, it's a 
full circle of welfare and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "My object is to break that circle, see?" Hughes said. "To change something 
that was bad to something positive. How do I feel? This graduation is the best 
thing in my damn life, I can tell you that!"

HE'S FOUND HIS NICHE RECOVERING STOLEN CARS; CRIME: SANTA ANA OFFICER KEVIN 
DEDEAUX SPOTTED 43 HOT VEHICLES AND ARRESTED 34 THIEVES LAST YEAR, A FEAT WHICH 
HAS EARNED HIM CRIME-FIGHTING HONORS. HE'S LOOKING TO IMPROVE ON THAT.

<P>
 Fourteen hours after his Toyota pickup truck was stolen from in front of his 
Oceanside office last November, Gary Williams received an unexpected telephone 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 On the line was Santa Ana Police Officer Kevin DeDeaux with good news: 
Williams' truck had been found and the two teen-agers who had taken it for a 
joy ride were in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," Williams said. "I thought it would be a one in a million 
chance that they would find my truck." 
</P>
<P>
 As the county's top recoverer of stolen vehicles in 1993, DeDeaux has made a 
habit of overcoming such odds and finding needles in the stolen car haystack. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he found 43 stolen vehicles and arrested 34 thieves, an 
accomplishment that led to his being honored this month as Orange County's 
Vehicle Theft Officer of the Year by the California Highway Patrol and the 
National Insurance Crime Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every cop has their specialty, and mine just happens to be looking for stolen 
cars," DeDeaux said as he cruised Santa Ana's Minnie Street neighborhood in his 
patrol car one day last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are real thankful when you find their cars for them," he added. "It's 
their personal property, they've worked hard and made payments and they usually 
have a lot of personal items inside. So, I get a real sense of satisfaction in 
finding them." 
</P>
<P>
 A four-year member of the force, DeDeaux relies mostly on sharp instincts and 
an eye for clues that other officers might overlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has just acquired this knack for finding stolen vehicles," said Sgt. Ed 
Andrade, DeDeaux's supervisor. "It takes a lot of work. He's one of the 
officers who goes beyond what's required without asking." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is just luck," DeDeaux said. "On some days you're real hot, and 
on others you can't find anything no matter how hard you look." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, recovering stolen vehicles requires painstaking, tedious 
work. It involves cruising alleys and parking lots on the lookout for cars that 
are popular among thieves. DeDeaux said he checks for anything that looks 
suspicious: broken door locks, out-of-state license plates or nice cars parked 
in bad neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 DeDeaux, 31, said he doesn't have any special training in recovering stolen 
cars, but has learned invaluable tricks of the trade from his fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot from more experienced officers," DeDeaux said. "They are 
willing to help me and show me what to look for." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes DeDeaux finds car thieves without really even looking. Once he 
casually glanced over at the car idling next to him at a stoplight and noticed 
that there were no keys in the ignition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'What is wrong with this picture?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, three bank robbery suspects in a stolen car drove right 
past him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked at me, I looked at them," he recalled. "I made a U-turn and began 
following them. The driver crashed the car and they all ran. We caught one guy 
hiding in a dog house, but the others got away." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the time that DeDeaux casually pulled into the parking lot of a 
bank to withdraw some money from an automatic teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on a lunch break and a guy gets out of his car and says, "Excuse me, 
officer, but is there a problem?' He seemed real agitated and I thought, 'This 
seems weird.' So, I (checked) the plate and it came back stolen. I made an 
arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 DeDeaux has heard every excuse in the book from thieves he has caught 
red-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, they'll pull over and try and be as calm as can be," he said. "A 
lot of times, they'll try and say that their friend lent them the car and that 
they didn't know it was stolen. You just know they're lying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also a real tip-off when a guy stares right at you, his eyes get the 
size of saucers, then he shoots around the corner and gives the impression that 
he wants to get away from you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While finding stolen vehicles might not seem as important as solving murders 
or cracking drug rings, DeDeaux said, "my idea is, if you get a stolen car, you 
might prevent a more serious crime from happening. Stolen cars are used in a 
lot of crimes like bank robberies, drive-by shootings and burglaries." 
</P>
<P>
 DeDeaux said he can't really explain why he has become so committed to 
reuniting stolen cars with their owners. But, he said it may have something to 
do with his love for vintage automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love cars," he said. "I go to car shows all the time to look at older cars. 
Everything about them is so detailed, and yet they have a simplicity." 
</P>
<P>
 DeDeaux spent six years in the Marine Corps and worked as a machinist in the 
aerospace industry before joining the police force four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A "family man" with a wife, Lanai and four children, he spends his off-days 
surfing and coaching his son's baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 DeDeaux, who was also recognized by the Santa Ana City Council this month for 
his 1993 record, said he finds the attention he's been receiving for his 
efforts somewhat uncomfortable. He is quick to share credit for his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes cooperation from citizens and colleagues to do what we do," he said. 
"This is not a one-man crusade. Teamwork is where it's at." 
</P>
<P>
 But awards are nothing new to DeDeaux, who was named the Police Department's 
rookie of the year in 1990. In 1992, he was honored at the city's annual police 
employee recognition awards ceremony for saving the lives of two people, 
including a suspect who collapsed and stopped breathing from a heroin overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to get the recognition, but I'm just doing my job," he said. 
"I'm doing what I like." 
</P>
<P>
 But those who have had their vehicles recovered by DeDeaux are long on praise 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He deserves every accolade you can give him," said Gary Williams, the 
Oceanside man whose truck was gone only 14 hours. "I don't know how he does it. 
I was lucky to get my truck back. If he hadn't been such a good police officer, 
I would have been unlucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana resident Carlos Servantes, whose 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme was 
stolen from in front of his apartment building last June, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect him to find it so soon," Servantes said. "I was thinking I 
would never see it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, DeDeaux noticed Servantes' car as he was recovering yet another 
stolen car -- one of two occasions where he has found two vehicles in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was giving a couple back their car and a car with four gang members drives 
by," DeDeaux said. "As soon as they saw me, they accelerated. I got in my car, 
drove around the corner and there was the car, abandoned and still running." 
Vehicle Theft Targets 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequently stolen types of automobiles in Orange County in 1993: Cars 
 
</P>
<P>
 * Oldsmobile Cutlass (1975-84 models) 
</P>
<P>
 * Toyota Corolla (1975-84) 
</P>
<P>
 * Toyota Celica (1975-84) Trucks and vans  
</P>
<P>
 * Toyota pickup (1985-94) 
</P>
<P>
 * Chevrolet pickup (1985-94) 
</P>
<P>
 * Toyota van (1975-84) Motorcycles  
</P>
<P>
 * Honda (1985-94) 
</P>
<P>
 * Yamaha (1985-94) 
</P>
<P>
 * Suzuki (1984-94) HOW TO PROTECT YOUR VEHICLE 
</P>
<P>
 Although an experienced, determined thief can steal just about any vehicle, 
you can make it difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Close windows, lock doors and take the keys; 13% of stolen vehicles have the 
keys in them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't leave your car running while you go in to a store or back in to the 
house to refill your coffee cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Park with front wheels turned sharply to the right or left and the emergency 
brake applied; 10% of stolen cars are towed away. 
</P>
<P>
 * Activate anti-theft devices. Steering wheel locks and alarms are good 
deterrents. Kill switches that shut down the fuel system can be installed by a 
mechanic and are quite effective. Tracking mechanisms that enable police to 
locate a vehicle are also effective but more expensive than other deterrents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hide all packages and personal items. Left in the open, they invite theft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use your garage; lock both the vehicle and the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't park on outskirts of shopping, motel or other parking lots. Park near 
the entrance, especially if you will be leaving your car unattended for an 
extended period. 
</P>
<P>
 * Etch vehicle identification number in hard-to-find spots, using an engraver 
or dye marker.

FLEEING SUSPECT LEADS POLICE TO BIG HAUL; CRIME: CHASE ENDS AT HUNTINGTON BEACH 
HOME WHERE OFFICERS FIND GUNS, DRUGS, STOLEN GOODS AND A HOMEMADE BOMB. TWO 
SKINHEADS ARE CHARGED, BUT MAN WHO RAN ISN'T.

 A man being chased by police inadvertently led officers to the home of two 
skinheads who were caught with drugs, several weapons, a homemade explosive 
device and $10,000 worth of stolen property, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers responding to a report of a man in a car with a gun, went to the 1000 
block of California Street about 4:20 p.m. Saturday afternoon. There they saw a 
car with a man in it and pursued the car into an alley. The man, whose name was 
not released, then jumped from the car and ran, said Lt. Patrick Gilday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran into a residence on California Street and officers followed him 
inside," Gilday said, adding the man did not live in the house but appeared to 
know its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As officers questioned the man, they saw marijuana, scales and other equipment 
used to package and sell drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police stopped their immediately investigation and obtained a search warrant, 
they said. Using the warrant, which took an unspecified time to obtain, they 
then discovered five ounces of marijuana, two grams of methamphetamine, a 
rifle, a shotgun, several handguns, a semiautomatic weapon and ammunition, 
Gilday said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the handguns and the semiautomatic weapon had been reported stolen, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also found numerous auto stereos, amplifiers, speakers, tools and 
portable cellular telephones that are also believed to have been stolen. Also 
found was an unspecified homemade explosive device, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested for suspicion of drug possession, suspicion of receiving stolen 
property and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony were 
25-year-old John Francisco Montiel and a 16-year-old male whose name was not 
released. They lived at the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilday said items in the home link the two suspects to a white supremacist 
skinhead gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Montiel, who is being held at Huntington Beach Jail on $25,000 bail, was also 
charged with suspicion of possessing an explosive device. The minor is being 
held at Orange County Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Sunday that Montiel and the teen-ager had been living on the 
property for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor said a lot of young men with "skinheads and tattoos all over 
their bodies" come and went from the residence "at all hours." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of late-night parties and people there all the time," said 
the neighbor. "They would smoke outside on the patio because the landlord does 
not allow smoking inside the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said that despite the constant traffic, they did not suspect that 
anything illegal was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird because I live right next door," he said. "This is an absolutely 
beautiful neighborhood and I've been here for 10 years. So this whole thing is 
kinda scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the man who initially fled from police and ran into the house to 
hide was not carrying a weapon as had been reported and was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just led the troops to the bad guys," Gilday said.

DRUNK-DRIVING SUSPECT HELD AFTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving early Saturday 
morning after leading police on a high-speed chase that ended when she lost 
control of her truck and crashed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Lavender of Azusa had apparently fallen asleep at a traffic light on 
Beach Boulevard near the Santa Ana Freeway, police said.She was discovered 
around 3 a.m. slumped over the steering wheel of her Toyota pickup truck by 
Officer Eileen Jones.

 As Jones approached the truck, Lavender woke up and sped away, reaching speeds 
of up to 100 m.p.h. while fleeing from police. She drove six miles southbound 
on Beach Boulevard before crashing into a fire hydrant, then a light pole at 
the Garden Grove Boulevard intersection, police said.

<P>
 Lavender suffered cuts on her face and was taken to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange for treatment. She was cited at the hospital for allegedly driving under 
the influence of alcohol, police said.

Q&A; REAL ESTATE CONSULTANT SAYS BUY NOW; CONSULTANT WHO HAS WATCHED O.C. 
MARKET FOR DECADES SAYS PENT-UP DEMAND WILL PRODUCE A STATEWIDE HOUSING 
SHORTFALL.

 Orange County home sales are up nearly 35% during the first four months of 
this year and with the prices for houses and raw land starting to firm, real 
estate experts are hailing the early stages of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates for fixed-rate mortgages now average more than 8% compared to around 7% 
a year ago, and some home buyers are wondering whether to rush in and buy a 
home now before rates rise further or hold off, betting that rates fall next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth W. Agid, founder and principal of the Marketing Department in Irvine, 
a real estate consulting firm to such master-planned communities as Rancho 
Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza, has watched the Orange County real estate 
market take a roller coaster ride for more than 20 years. Last week, Agid, 51, 
discussed the local home-buying market and made some predictions about its 
future health. His advice to those considering purchasing a home in Orange 
County: Buy now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What would you tell a potential home buyer nervously surveying the changes 
in our local residential real estate market, especially those concerned that 
the recent spike in home sales may prompt an increase in prices? 
</P>
<P>
 A. First thing I would say is hurry. I'm not saying they should rush into a 
decision without doing a thorough analysis, but I also think sitting at home 
and pondering a decision about whether to go out and start looking is the worst 
decision they could make.  
</P>
<P>
 It's liable to cost them $10,000 to $20,000 in the price or value of the home 
they will be able to acquire and the situation is not going to get any better. 
And the most important thing is that the housing alternatives available to them 
are going to be rapidly disappearing, and that's both in the resale and 
new-housing sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why do you say housing alternatives are rapidly disappearing? Lately there 
have been announcements about new housing projects throughout Orange County, 
including Centex Homes' purchase of 915 housing lots in Foothill Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 A. These projects that are coming down the pike are a drop in the bucket. 
Everyone keeps talking about this phenomenal housing recovery in terms of how 
strong it is, but this is just the start and we are nowhere near approaching 
the capacities necessary to keep pace with market demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing industry is in the process of emerging from one of the four 
elements of the typical cycles impacting this industry. There are four periods 
in a cycle: the period of contraction, the trough, which we are just coming out 
of, the period of accelerated growth and the peak. We are emerging from the 
trough and moving into a period of accelerated demand for housing. It's 
probably one of the sharpest periods of upside demand that the state of 
California has realized in eight or nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why do you predict such a strong demand for housing? 
</P>
<P>
 A. In addition to growing demand from new household formations and new 
employment this year, we're also going to be dealing with at least three or 
four years of pent-up demand from people who have been postponing decisions. So 
we're going to see increasing demand and, unlike past cycles, there is 
virtually no unsold inventory in the California new-housing market. In past 
periods of contraction, the building industry had some inventory of unsold 
housing to sell off. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this recession, unlike others, two things occurred. First, builders put 
down their hammers and nails in 1989 and have been loath to pick them up, 
mostly because of a lack of financing. The second is the engineers, the land 
planners and the developers put down their pencils and stopped drawing as far 
back as 1989, so there's been a curtailment on planning on projects, so there 
is going to be a bubble in the supply pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So, you are predicting a statewide housing shortfall of more than 300,000 
units for this year alone. How would that likely happen? 
</P>
<P>
 A. During the decade of the 1990s, we've been gaining households at a rate as 
great as 200,000 per year, while we've only been building new housing units at 
a rate of less than 100,000 per year. So for each of these years, there is an 
accumulated deficit of new-housing supply. In addition, there is a phenomenon 
of people doubling up in record numbers in California over the past few years. 
Many young people have moved back into their old homestead, so the bonus room 
has become the boarding room. Now, more and more of these young people will be 
emerging from the cocoon, and will place additional demand on the housing 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. But what does this potential housing shortfall mean for this year's home 
buyer? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We're going to see substantial increases in the price for dwellings in 
California. That includes rental as well as resale, and especially new-housing 
prices. More than likely, we will see prices start to go up by the end of the 
year. I think they firmed last year. Anecdotal evidence shows that at the 
bottom of the resale market there are multiple offers (to buy a single home) 
now and more homes are selling above or at listed prices. There is a mini 
feeding frenzy that's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We've talked about higher home prices and stronger demand, but what about 
mortgage rates? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Mortgage rates will stabilize at about 8.25% through the end of the year. I 
think interest rates will stay flat and then may dip back down and go up by 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have said last year was the best year to buy a home. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Well, next year, this year will be the next-to-the-best year to buy a home. 
What happened was last year we were in the trough. The market remained soft, 
and homes were being offered to buyers at record-low profit margins. In 
addition, we had interest rates at an all-time low. So with these combination 
of factors, last year was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What do you see happening to Southern California land values? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Land in Southern California in preferred locations is a finite commodity, 
and it is disappearing. Right now, you can still get your choice of good values 
in new detached housing. I work on projects that are 10 years out, so I have to 
look at what the supply is going to be five or seven years from now. I can tell 
you it is diminishing. And yes, there will be alternatives in housing and I can 
tell you it will not be conventional detached houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will replace the conventional detached home in Orange County?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Land values are being driven higher, so the cost of producing the detached 
home is going up. Builders are trying to become more efficient with the 
available land. So what's happening is we're going from living on five units 
per acre to eight to 10 units per acres to very shortly 15 units per acre in 
detached homes; that is, a single-family home with its own small yard and 
two-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd say this is the tail end of suburbanization in Orange County. About the 
second half of the decade we will begin the urbanization process, where we make 
the great leap forward to subterranean parking and living densities of 25 units 
per acre. Home-Buying Tips 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth W. Agid gives the following advice to anyone contemplating a new home 
purchase in Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Hurry! Don't sit and ponder the future. California is in the early stages 
of a major economic recovery. You have three to six months, at most, before the 
best bargains disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Don't close your mind to "alternative living" environments before actually 
visiting the new products. Today, many attached homes offer more privacy than 
comparably priced detached houses. Cluster housing products and small-lot 
single-family developments represent some of the most innovative new housing 
concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Be sure to include resale homes in your search. The new home industry is 
having trouble competing with its own products built in the past, in terms of 
location, quality, size and features of the house. Don't be myopic in your 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Consider location. Look for an area offering a reasonable commute to work, 
shopping, schools and recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Look for a master-planned community that offers a variety of housing, 
nearby shopping, typically better schools and recreation. Most important, look 
for areas which have "character and personality," and are not merely a tract of 
look-alike houses. These are locations that will retain their value.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; FIRED UP; POTTERY FIRM THRIVES DESPITE QUAKE, 
FOREIGN COMPETITION

<P>
 Clambering over earthquake rubble in his West Los Angeles pottery factory, 
Laurie Gates searched for more disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead in the darkness on Jan. 17 sat dozens of gold-emblazoned rabbit cookie 
jars that were scheduled to be packed that very morning for shipment to the 
Bloomingdale's spring catalogue operation. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was a sweet sight when Gates rounded the last corner to find the 
first rays of morning glinting through a skylight onto unscathed 24-karat gold: 
Not one rabbit had toppled over, and the $8,000 order was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it as a good sign," Gates said, despite the $200,000 in lost 
inventory, equipment and other damage caused by the Northridge earthquake. "It 
was a good day for bunnies." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a good two years all around for Gates' company, Los Angeles 
Pottery, which produces hand-painted ceramic bake ware, dinnerware, serving 
pieces, tile, salt-and-pepper shakers and lots and lots of cookie jars in 
little more than 18,000 square feet of jam-packed space. 
</P>
<P>
 In its short life, Los Angeles Pottery has survived earthquake, fire, and 
recession as well as low-cost foreign competition. It is one of the few 
remaining domestic firms in this sort of labor-intensive business. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviving the name of a long-defunct maker of early California ceramics, Gates 
has built a thriving company from the ruins of his previous employer, a dish 
manufacturer on the same site that fell victim to the changing marketplace. Los 
Angeles Pottery's sales reached nearly $3 million in 1993, more than triple the 
first year's total. Employment has climbed past 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates credits the designs of his hand-painted wares -- 25 patterns and growing 
-- coupled with an increasing interest by major retailers in buying from 
domestic sources for quicker turnaround of orders and less need for tying up 
capital waiting for container loads of dishes to arrive from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's something more at work here than attractive, pricey dishes: Behind 
it all is an entrepreneur who is not afraid to take some very big chances. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Gates chucked a comfortable life ranching and farming on 2,000 acres 
in Alberta, Canada, and running a few small businesses on the side, to move to 
Los Angeles with his 11-year-old son. Gates said he was looking for a change 
and some new business opportunities, and he liked the zest for life Los Angeles 
was showing in that optimistic Olympic year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a turning point in my life," said Gates, now 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates launched a new career as a manufacturers' representative for a large 
gift company, collaborating with clients on design ideas. After five years, 
Gates was asked to help straighten out a struggling dish manufacturer called 
Designcraft. But the company had too few designs to keep its products selling 
briskly, he said. In early 1992, Gates, by then general manager, was told to 
shut the firm down. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he took another chance and bought it with $435,000 in cash -- an 
investment recouped by the end of the year. Los Angeles Pottery remains 
debt-free, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up on the prairies on Canada, I never really believed in debt," he 
said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession was a scary time to launch a new venture, Gates acknowledged. 
But languishing retailers were desperately looking for products that would sell 
quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good reputation for sales and for selling lines that moved well for 
retailers, and they were open to me," Gates said. "The associations I had made 
from years of sales and from working (at Designcraft) kind of all came 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been challenges. The Northridge earthquake was a hard blow, but it 
closed Los Angeles Pottery for only three days, Gates said. A still unsolved 
arson fire last year slowed the firm down for only a few hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates found a receptive market for his designs, which range from ethnic to 
modern to country, and the quick turnaround he promised. Merchandise can be 
made and shipped in less than four weeks -- in an emergency, within days -- 
compared to three to six months for an overseas orders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Pottery's wares have found their way to such retailers as Macy's, 
Williams-Sonoma, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Harrods and even the new 
Flintstones store opening Memorial Day weekend at CityWalk. Gates has designed 
three fossil-themed dish lines for the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The stuff isn't cheap: A hand-painted dinner plate retails for under $20 and, 
when fired with gold or platinum, plates sell for close to $50. A snowman 
cookie jar wearing a gold-painted tuxedo was popular last Christmas for between 
$90 and $100, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the work is done in-house, including mixing the clay, making the molds, 
hand-painting the products and firing the goods. Each piece is handled again 
and again in a process that takes more than 30 steps. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an activity seldom seen these days in Southern California, which was 
once home to a thriving ceramics industry. Metlox Potteries and Franciscan 
Ceramics are two of the better known manufacturers to have closed their 
factories in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition is really tough," Gates said. "There are hundreds of 
factories in Italy that are hand-painting, and they can sell at cheaper 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates insists that domestic manufacturers can deliver a level of service 
unmatched by foreign competitors. Major retailers are beginning to get the 
message, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even one small client praised the firm's flexibility. When Livingstone's, a 
Beverly Hills gift shop, asked Gates to change the color of the fruit painted 
on one dish line, he did it, said buyer Sam Ouldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two ways of doing business," Ouldhouse said. "There is, 'This is 
what the business is,' and there is, 'How can I help you?' They're more 'How 
can I help you?' "

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: EUROPEAN STOCKS SLUMP, BUT PAIN MAY BE LOCALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

<P>
 American investors in European stocks and bonds experienced a bad case of deja 
vu last week: European markets plunged on growing fears that interest rates 
there have bottomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, it took an actual boost in short-term rates by the Federal 
Reserve Board to send U.S. stocks reeling. In Europe, all it took last week was 
for German central bank President Hans Tietmeyer to suggest that the Bundesbank 
may be finished cutting short rates for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of Germany's still-languishing economy, Tietmeyer said nothing about 
raising rates. Yet investors reacted with horror at the thought that European 
short rates might stop falling, after only 20 months of Bundesbank-led cuts. At 
about 5% now, the yield on 3-month German treasury bills is well above the 
4.25% yield on U.S. T-bills -- even though Germany's economy is weak while the 
U.S. economy is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattled by Tietmeyer, the Frankfurt stock market's DAX index slumped 109 
points for the week, to 2,140.99 Friday -- a drop of 4.8%, or the equivalent of 
the Dow industrial index losing 180 points from its current 3,757.14. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Bundesbank largely calls the tune for interest rates across 
Europe, most of the region's other stock markets also went down hard. In 
London, the FTSE-100 stock index tumbled 5.1% for the week; Milan's Mibtel 
index dove 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, in some respects, was the reaction in European bond markets to 
Tietmeyer's comments. In Britain, the yield on the benchmark 15-year government 
bond closed at 8.50% Friday, up from 8.18% just three days earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 But while investors were dumping European securities, other world markets paid 
scant attention. In fact, North American, South American and Asian stock 
markets generally finished higher last week or unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Other markets' ability to ignore Europe's turmoil may be a sign that 
international investing has become a stock-picker's game again -- unlike last 
year, when virtually all foreign markets rocketed.  
</P>
<P>
 As markets go their separate ways, U.S. investors will find international 
investing more challenging, but also potentially more rewarding. If you can 
recognize bargains among individual markets, or you're in a foreign mutual fund 
that has proved its savvy as a global stock-picker, you should earn 
above-average returns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far in 1994, a good defense has been the best offense in foreign investing. 
Early this year, the smart money was selling stocks in Hong Kong, Singapore, 
Bangkok and other Southeast Asian markets after their 60%-plus gains in 1993. 
Those markets began to dive in January, and only recently have they shown signs 
of bottoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Japanese stock market has been this year's big surprise. The 
Nikkei index has jumped 19.3% year-to-date, fueled by the perception that 
Japan's economy is bottoming after three difficult years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, European stock markets had held the middle ground between 
Southeast Asian markets' plunge and Japan's hot streak. Most European markets 
were off marginally for the year, though with the dollar's weakness American 
investors still were making money there. 
</P>
<P>
 Does last week's selloff suggest European stocks are poised for a meltdown? 
Many international stock fund managers don't think so. For the most part, fund 
managers still believe there's room for short- and long-term European interest 
rates to fall, because the Continent's economy is only beginning to emerge from 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, in fact, the Bundesbank's Tietmeyer tried to allay investors' fears 
by telling a radio interviewer in Germany that "it can be taken for granted" 
that the Bundesbank will keep cutting money market rates, even if it makes no 
additional cuts in its official discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But European stocks now face other obstacles, fund managers admit. John 
Hickling, who runs the Boston-based Fidelity Overseas fund, says too many 
European firms are trying to raise money with new stock offerings. "There's 
supply coming from everywhere," he warns.  
</P>
<P>
 Political risk is also high, with German elections looming this year. Pressure 
on politicians in Germany (and across Europe) to use government spending to 
bring down double-digit unemployment rates may keep inflation concerns at the 
forefront, in turn keeping bond yields artificially steep. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, there's the issue of valuation: Many European markets look expensive 
because corporate earnings remain depressed while stocks have rallied since 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, European stock bulls expect their markets to follow the U.S. 
script: As the economy improves, the bulls see investors flocking back to 
European industrial stocks, which have the most to gain from an economic 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Hickling's fund has about half its assets in Europe, mainly in 
industrial giants such as auto makers Volvo and Peugeot, and 
energy/petrochemical leaders such as Elf Aquitaine and Total. 
</P>
<P>
 Madelynn Matlock, manager of the Bartlett Value International fund in 
Cincinnati, has 59% of her fund's asset in Europe. She expects investors to 
eventually return to such industrial names as Tampella, a Finnish maker of 
mining equipment, and to French construction materials firm Saint Gobain. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Russell, co-manager of the Smith Barney International Equity fund in New 
York, argues that European stocks still don't reflect the future earnings 
benefit from corporate restructurings still in full swing there -- a couple 
years behind the U.S. restructuring binge. 
</P>
<P>
 His fund, about 45% invested in Europe, has targeted stocks in Italy, Ireland 
and other countries that depreciated their currencies 18 months ago. That 
depreciation made those countries' exports more competitive, giving their 
companies a head start in Europe's recovery, Russell says. 
</P>
<P>
 But some international stock fund managers contend that the best place to put 
new money to work today isn't Europe, but the beaten-down emerging markets of 
Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Kurland, head of Pioneer International Growth fund in Boston, is only 
35% invested in Europe. He finds more allure in markets such as Mexico, South 
Korea and Thailand, especially after their selloffs this year. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to bet on global growth, Kurland argues, it makes more sense to 
invest now in Asia or Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansions in the United States and Europe, he says, will be magnified in 
already-booming emerging economies that are major exporters to the developed 
world. And emerging markets' stock valuations are once again reasonable, he 
says. Comparing World Markets

 * What's involved: Dental hygienists work in conjunction with general dentists 
and periodontists, cleaning patients' teeth and educating them about proper 
oral hygiene. During a routine visit, they inspect the patient's mouth for 
cancer and other illnesses, then check tooth decay and gums for inflammation. 
They take X-rays and assess them to formulate a dental hygiene plan for the 
patient. They clean and polish the patient's teeth and occasionally remove 
inflamed tissue. Hygienists may administer local anesthesia or nitrous oxide 
under a dentist's supervision.

<P>
 * Qualifications: They must complete an accredited dental hygienist program 
offered at either a four-year university or community college. After completing 
their studies, hygienists must then take the National Board Examination, an 
eight-hour written exam. Next comes the state licensing exam, which involves 
four hours of testing in a clinical setting. The license must be renewed every 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: One of the 10 fastest-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of dental hygienists is projected to increase 
by 14.4% to 1,590 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Most hygienists work part time and receive $200-$225 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Dental hygienist is a popular profession for those with young children 
at home, since part-time work lets hygienists earn a good income and have a 
flexible schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Dental hygiene students sometimes discover that they are not 
comfortable doing work inside people's mouths. The job also requires constant 
contact with patients who are anxious and suffering various degrees of pain. A 
drawback to part-time work is that dental hygienists do not always receive 
health insurance or retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Hygienists may become involved in research or public health 
education and administration. Some work in sales for dental office equipment 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "The job requires me to be both an educator and a motivator. We teach 
people how to take care of their mouths so they can avoid painful and expensive 
dental work. Not all of them listen, but once you have brought them to a state 
of health and decreased their pain, they trust you." -- Ina Rydalch

HOT JOBS; THIS DENTAL HYGIENIST ALSO TEACHES THE ART 
</P>

<P>
 After working as a florist for 10 years, Ina Rydalch returned to school 17 
years ago to study art, with the idea of becoming an art teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 But after taking an anatomy class, she got hooked on medicine and ended up 
becoming a dental hygienist instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to make a decision between art and medicine, but I couldn't 
stand the thought of all the fatalities that most medical personnel deal with," 
said Rydalch, now 47. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I chose to become a dental hygienist and I'm happy to report that in my 13 
years as a hygienist, there have been no fatalities in my chair," she said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rydalch, a sense of humor helps, especially when trying to 
persuade patients to take better care of their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of scolding them, she teases a little, saying something like, "Floss 
the teeth you want to keep." 
</P>
<P>
 That gets the point across without annoying patients so much that they put off 
their next cleaning indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Rydalch, who also is a teacher in the dental hygiene program at Cypress 
College, describes herself as a care-giver, an educator and a motivator. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large part of being a hygienist is educating the patient about better 
dental care. And I have to find ways to motivate them the same way I motivate 
my students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rydalch said she finds teaching satisfying because it enables her to improve 
her profession by making sure her students are well trained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach them to scrutinize data and analyze new products. That way they are 
able to answer patients' questions and be well-informed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also encourage them to be active in professional organizations. There are 
constant changes in medicine and dentistry and the newsletters and journals 
provide the best way to keep up with all that's going on." JANICE L. JONES

 Doubt Is Cast on Pickup Recall Case Against GM: Federal lawyers say the 
government could lose a court challenge to a recall of 6 million General Motors 
Corp. pickups, the Detroit News reported. The government has been investigating 
GM pickups made between 1973 and 1987 to determine if they pose a deadly fire 
hazard.Sources reportedly said Justice Department lawyers had informed the 
Transportation Department's chief counsel that a recall of the pickups could 
probably not withstand a challenge. Critics say the GM trucks' sidesaddle fuel 
tanks are prone to punctures and explosions. GM says the trucks are safe. The 
lawyers reportedly said GM has three good arguments: The trucks have 
significantly lower crash fatality rates than many vehicles, including smaller 
trucks and cars; the government cannot recall vehicles that comply with federal 
safety standards, and there is little evidence the tanks leak excessively in 
crashes at less than 40 m.p.h.

INSURANCE MAY COVER SOME FIRST PENSION DEBTS; BANKRUPTCY: RECENTLY FOUND SMALL 
POLICIES COULD HELP SOME RETIREMENT INVESTORS, RECEIVER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A bit of relief may be available for some clients of failed First Pension 
Corp. in Irvine. Receivers have discovered two small insurance policies held by 
an affiliate that may cover some investor claims against the parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 The court-appointed receiver for Summit Trust Services, a Denver-based firm 
established by First Pension principal William E. Cooper to handle his clients' 
money, said Summit held a financial institution bond to cover as much as $1 
million in forgery and theft claims, and a $1-million policy to cover liability 
claims against the company's directors and officers. 
</P>
<P>
 While the small policies uncovered by receiver Snyder are unlikely to provide 
relief to all of the investors who put an estimated $99 million into First 
Pension's mortgage partnerships, it may help those who used First Pension 
solely as a pension fund administrator, allowing them to make choices about 
where to invest their retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The receiver believes claims are available against both of the policies for 
the retirement investors," receiver Andrew C. Snyder said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder would not reveal the name of the insurance company, saying he feared 
that it would be deluged with calls from First Pension investors. He did say 
that both policies are with an insurance company rated A-plus by A.M. Best Co., 
a national insurance rating service. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged in federal court that 
First Pension operated an elaborate scheme that led clients to invest in 
mortgages that did not exist. As much as $124 million of the $350 million 
invested through the firm may have been lost to fraud and theft, investigators 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as scores of the company's nearly 8,000 investors discovered that 
substantial sums were missing from their accounts, First Pension filed April 22 
for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. The day before 
the filing, Colorado banking regulators had seized Summit Trust after its 
president told them that millions of dollars in client funds were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those investors sent to First Pension checks that were cashed 
somewhere else or simply disappeared, the SEC said. The federal agency alleges 
that some of those checks were eventually deposited in bank accounts opened by 
Cooper and another First Pension principal, Robert E. Lindley. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court filings by the SEC, in April Cooper forged 114 checks 
totaling $1.3 million on a custodial account held at Summit Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "These policies may be sufficient to cover the deficiencies of the 114 
checks," said Snyder, who added that he has already filed a preliminary claim 
with the insurance company and will file a more complete statement within a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 And First Pension has a small amount of insurance coverage. The company held a 
$500,000 fiduciary fidelity bond through Utica National Insurance Group, a New 
York insurance company, said James Joseph, trustee for First Pension. That type 
of policy covers fraud by employees and is the only policy known to have been 
held by First Pension, Joseph said.SUMMIT TRUST SERVICES

 RTC Accuses Newport Beach Developer of Overcharging: Three real estate 
companies owned by developer Donald Koll overcharged the government $648,961 
for managing an office building, according to a federal audit.Resolution Trust 
Corp. sent a letter to Koll demanding repayment after the audit showed that 
Koll affiliates improperly billed RTC for an executive recruiter, sports club 
memberships and bonuses, a spokeswoman said. A Koll Co. spokeswoman said the 
company had no comment. Among RTC's findings, the audit showed Koll Management 
Services charged $416,000 for personnel, $83,000 in office expenses and $14,000 
in other charges that the management fee should have covered.

 White House Panel Calls for Less Labor-Management Hostility: Stagnant wages, 
global competition, polarized incomes and high unemployment for the unskilled 
are creating a crisis that requires major changes in labor policy, according to 
findings of the 10-member Commission on the Future of Worker-Management 
Relations.The current stalemate "holds back innovation and efficiency," said 
panel member and professor Thomas Kochan. The panel, which includes three 
former secretaries of labor, executives and union leaders, was asked by 
President Clinton to suggest ways for workers and managment to share power in 
running companies. The panel's findings were reported today in The New York 
Times and will be officially released later this week.

 Orders for Machine Tools Up: Manufacturers' orders for American-made machine 
tools rose 11.7% in April to the highest level in 12 months, according to a 
survey by the Assn. for Manufacturing Technology.The trade group said machine 
tool orders were $413.7 million in April, up from $370.4 million in March. 
Orders were up 18.8% compared with April, 1993. The monthly report covers 
metal-cutting and metal-forming machine tools, which are used to manufacture 
goods from household appliances to aircraft engines. Machine tool orders are 
considered a gauge of economic activity. The most significant rise in orders 
was in foreign markets.

 Upjohn Wins Halcion Libel Case: The company won $90,500 in damages over a 1991 
British Broadcasting Corp. program about the sleep-inducing drug. A U.K. High 
Court justice said the BBC was wrong to accuse Upjohn Co. of deliberately 
misleading regulators about the possible harmful side effects of Halcion.But he 
also criticized Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn for "serious errors and 
omissions" in reporting a clinical trial of the drug conducted at a U.S. prison 
in the 1970s. Claims that Halcion could have side effects such as amnesia, 
paranoia and violent behavior led to worldwide restrictions on sales. Britain 
banned the drug in 1991. But the court found no evidence that Upjohn had 
attempted to deliberately cover up the drug's possible dangers, as alleged in a 
BBC television program titled "The Halcion Nightmare."

 Plan for Dismantling Failed State Companies Announced: The government said it 
is determined to make its worst money-losing state enterprises swallow the 
bitter pill of bankruptcy this year after many faltering attempts. Beijing has 
already selected two unredeemable firms in the northern port of Tianjin and 
three in the Yangtze River city Chongqing for dismantling this year, said an 
official of the State Economic and Trade Commission.Bankruptcy is part of a 
broad state-sector reform plan. The plan includes the first meaningful audits 
of 10,000 failed firms, dispatch of supervisory watchdogs to 1,000 ill-managed 
firms and management of 100 promising firms under the rigorous dictates of a 
new Western-modeled company law. Hemorrhaging firms in April made up 50.9% of 
China's more than 100,000 state enterprises.

CHINESE SCRATCH A GROWING ITCH TO TRAVEL; TOURISM: WITH ITS INCREASING WEALTH, 
CHINA SENT 17% MORE VISITORS TO THE U.S. IN 1993 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE.

 At home in Shanghai, Yu Jing used to daydream over pictures taken by her 
husband on business trips to the United States, imagining herself on a sandy 
beach in Southern California, strolling through Hollywood or visiting other 
famous U.S. tourist spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Yu, a 29-year-old housewife, got her wish recently when she and her 2-year-old 
daughter accompanied her husband -- who is teaching under an exchange program 
at the University of Arkansas -- to an academic conference in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 After her husband's business meetings, the family visited Disneyland, 
Hollywood, the beaches and other Southern California attractions before heading 
north to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Chinese want to come to America," Yu said. "Their impression of 
America is very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese tourists still make up only a small number of the millions of 
foreigners who visit the United States each year, but their numbers are growing 
rapidly, thanks largely to China's increasing prosperity. The number of Chinese 
visitors rose 17% to about 293,000 last year from about 250,000 the year 
before, according to U.S. government statistics. In 1990, fewer than 200,000 
Chinese visited the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most Chinese visit this country primarily for business or education, 
they are also taking the opportunity to see the sights. More Chinese would 
visit purely for pleasure, according to some travel agents, if U.S. officials 
would grant more visas. Meanwhile, they say, Chinese have the itch to travel 
and are increasingly visiting nearby countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. cities may be missing out on a potentially lucrative new source of 
tourists, these agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a tremendous number of requests to come here," Gloria Lan, a 
travel agent at Los Angeles-based Jetours, said recently during a seminar at 
the Anaheim Visitors and Convention Bureau that focused on tourism from China. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lan said, most of the Chinese who have contacted her have been unable 
to get visas. "There are a lot of obstacles," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department does not discriminate in granting visas on the basis of 
nationality, a department spokesman said. But U.S. officials in various 
countries have the discretion to deny visas based on suspicions that applicants 
might attempt to stay in the United States illegally, said Gary Scheaffer, 
press officer of the Bureau of Consul Affairs at the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for Chinese applicants, Scheaffer said, is the recent increase in 
illegal immigrants from China. U.S. consuls in China have been especially 
cautious since the discovery last year that many illegal immigrants were being 
smuggled into the United States on ships from some of China's impoverished 
coastal provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you are trying to do is to judge intention," he said. "There's a pretty 
strong indication that there are those with a serious pull to immigrate to the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the recent increase in illegal immigration is that China's new 
prosperity is spotty, leaving out large areas of the country, including the 
poor southern province of Fuzhou. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic boom is most dramatic in the coastal cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen 
and Guangzhou, where per-capita income has risen dramatically in recent years 
to over $1,000, according to Chinese statistics. Prosperity has given some 
residents of those areas the means to travel and government economic reforms 
have opened the door by encouraging more Chinese to travel abroad for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and San Francisco are the ports of entry for 64% of Chinese 
visiting the the United States, according to a 1992 survey by the California 
Division of Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood is famous," Yu said. "Young people (in China) like American films 
and they are familiar with American stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese visitors also find Los Angeles' variety of retail stores and amusement 
parks appealing, travel agents say. According to a survey, 70% of Chinese 
visitors said shopping was a major activity for them during their stay in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese visitors tend to save up for a trip abroad, Lan said, and often spend 
heavily, especially on clothes and electronic goods, because they are either 
cheaper in the United States or unavailable in China.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things are cheaper here," Lan said. "You have such a large market, 
with products coming in from Japan and other countries. So you have more 
variety. . . . Southern California is very attractive to Chinese," he said. 
"That's why they choose this place (for business)." 
</P>
<P>
 Yu said Chinese visitors seem not to be deterred by California's high crime 
rate or other problems that have contributed to a decline in Japanese tourists 
coming to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "They consider the crime and the danger," she said, "and they just try to 
avoid it." On the Go 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese citizens account for a small percentage of the millions of foreign 
visitors to the United States each year, but their number has grown more than 
50% since 1990. In thousands '93: 292.96

CHINESE FIRM HELPS FIGHT PRODUCT KNOCKOFFS; LAW: SERVICE FOCUSES ON PROTECTING

 When Mickey Mouse returned to China last year to star in a monthly Walt Disney 
Co. comic book, a Hong Kong private investigation team was on hand to make sure 
impostors didn't steal his limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 IP Protect Services (China) Ltd., China's first foreign-invested joint venture 
specializing in protecting intellectual property, is helping Disney take a 
state publishing house to court for using Mickey in a competing comic. 
</P>
<P>
 IP Protect was set up in July, 1993, with a staff of Chinese lawyers and 
retired public security officers. Maria Tam, IP Protect's vice chairman and a 
former Hong Kong legislator, says the firm kept a low profile until it could 
"bring a tiger back to the village." 
</P>
<P>
 The timing is apt. On April 30, Washington gave China 60 days to prove it was 
enforcing its laws against piracy of U.S. goods or face a six- to nine-month 
investigation on whether economic sanctions are needed to force China's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although China has come a long way perfecting its legislation, enforcement 
leaves much to be desired," Tam said. "The major obstacle is local 
protectionism, and perhaps a bit of corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 IP Protect has gathered evidence for Disney to bring a case against a leading 
state publisher, the China Youth and Children's Publishing Corp. Disney is 
determined to prevent the massive tide of knockoffs that prompted it to pull 
out of China in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the head of the publishing house may scream and shout and go to some 
senior government official, but law is law and China is really taking active 
steps to make people more aware," said Felix Fong, director of IP Protect. 
</P>
<P>
 With its lack of trained lawyers and its local governments on the make, China 
has become a haven for pirates fleeing tougher intellectual property regimes 
across Asia. Washington estimates violations cost U.S. companies $800 million a 
year in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong says very little of that money makes its way into central government 
coffers and the "piracy haven" tag sabotages Beijing's long-term technology 
importing goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhao Damou, IP Protect's chairman, says Vice Premier Li Lanqing gave the green 
light for his Chinese legal consulting firm to set up the joint venture and the 
central government is also helping it cut through local protectionism.

 In March, IP Protect took two weeks to close down a Guangdong factory that 
U.K. chemicals firm Burroughs-Welcome had requested be closed down for making 
fake Hazeline soap two years earlier.

 There are no private investigation agencies in China. Government departments 
have investigated piracy cases but are woefully understaffed, and the fines 
levied on prosecution have been pitifully low. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Microsoft employed Hong Kong's Pinkerton Investigative Services to 
discover the source of hundreds of thousands of its holograms being exported 
from a Shenzhen university for use on pirated copies of its software. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop was raided but was only fined $23,000. Now Microsoft is seeking 
$22 million in damages in an appeal that Washington is watching closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fines are low because China is a developing country and people's living 
standards are lower," Zhao said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington may not be satisfied by that argument. The last probe by the United 
States into China's intellectual property rights violations ended in January, 
1992, with Beijing narrowly avoiding $1.5 billion in sanctions.

GE, AUSTRALIAN FIRM PLAN POWER PLANT IN VIETNAM ; TRADE: $810-MILLION PROJECT 
WOULD INCLUDE A FERTILIZER FACILITY. IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
IN THE NATION.

<P>
 Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Co. and U.S. industrial giant General 
Electric Co. are planning an $810-million power and fertilizer project near Ho 
Chi Minh City, a semiofficial publication said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the project would be by far the biggest foreign investment in 
Vietnam, which is seeking foreign funds to develop its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnam Investment Review, published by the State Committee for 
Cooperation and Investment, said BHP and GE intend to build a power plant run 
on GE gas turbines near Thi Vai River east of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly 
Saigon). It would transmit electricity to Ho Chi Minh City and fuel a nearby 
urea fertilizer plant with an annual capacity of 600,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Review said BHP and GE were setting up an investment consortium for the 
power and fertilizer plants, in which Japan's Nissho Iwai Corp. and Tomen Corp. 
had expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 It quoted a BHP official as predicting the plants could start operating by 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives were not immediately available for comment on the report, 
which was apparently based on a presentation BHP made to the Vietnamese 
government last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas to fuel the projects would come from Vietnam's offshore fields in the 
South China Sea. BHP Petroleum, a BHP subsidiary, expects to start producing 
oil from the Dai Hung (Big Bear) field next October. 
</P>
<P>
 BHP chief executive John Prescott said in Hanoi recently that Dai Hung was an 
oil, not gas, field. But some other companies see Vietnam as a major potential 
gas producer. 
</P>
<P>
 British Petroleum has said it has found gas in its offshore Vietnam 
concessions but has not yet revealed whether it considers the find large enough 
to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam has made a modest start in developing its natural gas by signing up 
South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries to build a pipeline to take gas that is 
now flared off during oil production from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field -- a 
small part of potential output. Construction started last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is considering bids for bigger projects, estimated to require 
$400 million in investment, including a compression station at White Tiger, a 
liquefaction plant and a pipeline linking the oil industry base at Vung Tau 
with Ho Chi Minh City.

 Rules on Foreign Oil Investment to Ease: China plans to introduce a more 
flexible policy for foreign investors in its oil industry, allowing foreign 
joint ventures into more areas of the business, the head of the state oil 
company was quoted in the China Daily's Business Weekly as saying. Wang Tao, 
president of the China National Petroleum Corp., made the statement before 
heading to Norway to attend the World Petroleum Congress, the paper said. China 
has been gradually moving to relax restrictions because wells are running low.

 Cathay Pacific Seeking Alliances with Chinese Airlines: Cathay Pacific Airways 
hasn't ruled out the possibility of taking equity stakes in China's airlines, 
company Chairman Peter Sutch said.He said that in the past, Cathay hasn't seen 
the merits of entering into share swap or equity agreements with other 
carriers. But he added: "I think the situation is different with China and 
therefore we will certainly have another look at it." Sutch said that Cathay's 
interests could be damaged if a major European or U.S. carrier built a close 
alliance with one of the Chinese airlines.

 Top Japanese Banks Report 41.6% Profit Decline: Japan's top 11 commercial 
banks said their current profits plunged in the year ended March 31 as they 
continued writing off bad debts from the late 1980s.The earnings reports showed 
that the banks are making some progress toward reducing a mountain of bad debt 
that the Bank of Japan now concedes is a major obstacle to economic recovery. 
But they said bad debt write-off would continue to be a drag on their earnings 
this year. Meanwhile, Japan's electronics giants reported improved profits for 
the year, as booming U.S. demand for microchips and cost-cutting helped offset 
slow demand in the home market, according to earnings reports released last 
week.

 Nation Aims to Boost Its Currency: The government said it plans to reduce the 
use of U.S. dollars for internal transactions. In a speech opening a new 
session of Parliament last week, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said the 
government aims to introduce measures to ensure the national currency, the 
dong, is the only one used internally.Since free market economic reforms were 
launched in the late 1980s, the dollar has been virtually interchanged with the 
dong and foreign firms are required to pay staff salaries and expenses such as 
airline and hotel bills in dollars. Khai said the government is revising the 
structure of management of foreign currencies "in order to stabilize the real 
exchange rate and to narrow gradually the scope of the use of domestic U.S. 
dollars." But foreign bankers said attempts to stop Vietnamese from using 
dollars risks creating a black market.

 U.S. Investment in Vietnam Soars to $78 Million: The United States has climbed 
six notches on Vietnam's foreign investment chart in the past month and the 
amount invested has nearly quadrupled to $78 million, according to official 
figures released Friday. U.S. companies now have 11 projects licensed in 
Vietnam, compared with four projects with capital of $20 million on May 3, the 
State Committee for Cooperation and Investment said.

 Cross-Island Ferry Workers Notified of Lockout: New Zealand Rail Ltd. said it 
is issuing notices to Cook Strait ferry workers that they will be barred from 
coming to work June 27 unless maritime unions agree to new work provisions.The 
company runs ferries between New Zealand's North and South islands. The lockout 
notices follow the breakdown of talks with maritime unions over labor 
conditions. New Zealand Rail says the unions are featherbedding, with about 40% 
more workers than needed to meet safety standards. New Zealand Rail is 
controlled by U.S.-based Wisconsin Central Transportation Corp.

VOLKSWAGEN STRUGGLES THROUGH SLUMP; ECONOMY: POSTWAR GERMANY'S WORST RECESSION 
HAS FORCED THE GIANT AUTO BUILDER TO MAKE MANY WRENCHING DECISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Every 16 seconds, a new car zips off the assembly lines at Volkswagen's huge 
headquarters factory in this northern German city. 
</P>
<P>
 But that blinding speed hasn't been enough to spare Volkswagen the need to 
make wrenching changes affecting its corporate culture and the lives of the 
51,000 people behind the auto maker's shiny products here. 
</P>
<P>
 They numbered 65,000 only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 VW has trimmed staff but says the number is still too high. To avoid more job 
cuts, Europe's biggest auto maker and its union have agreed to shorten the 
workweek and reduce annual pay by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big surprise to take such a big cut. I never thought it was 
possible," said Heinz Mutzick, a 33-year factory veteran who brings home about 
$1,750 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay cut really hasn't hit yet. The lower pay will come in the form of 
reduced bonuses, so the ax will fall in June when workers won't get the extra 
month's pay they're used to. 
</P>
<P>
 VW workers are dialing back vacation plans and reducing their savings and 
other expenses to compensate for the lower income. 
</P>
<P>
 Joerg Wolter figured he might have been laid off, even after 16 years on the 
assembly line. So he was happy to take a pay cut instead. Part of his personal 
defense, however, will hurt VW's sales. Wolter had bought a new VW every year 
at a discount. Now he'll wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar things are happening around Germany as the nation creeps out of its 
worst recession since World War II and many companies deal with tough 
competition from countries where workers are paid less. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations of climbing wages are kaput. Last year, average wages in western 
Germany grew 3.8%, while inflation was 4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen AG, which lost a whopping 1.94 billion marks, or $1.13 billion, 
last year, has made one of the most radical changes of any German company. 
</P>
<P>
 The government reacted angrily when VW said it would go to a four-day workweek 
to avoid laying off 30,000 of its 100,000 workers in Germany. Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl said Germans need to work more hours, not fewer, to regain 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The promised four-day week has turned out to be a five-day week with shifts of 
five hours and 46 minutes for many assembly-line workers. But VW management is 
certain it made the right move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to find a typical VW solution," said Guenther Koch, a personnel 
executive. "If we thought we wouldn't remain No. 1 in Europe, we would have let 
a lot of people go." 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of the short workweek, Koch said, is to keep skilled people, 
"get over the hump" and move back to longer shifts in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch's negotiating adversary, Bernd Osterloh, head of shop stewards for the IG 
Metall metalworkers union, said it was an "intelligent solution" in comparison 
with Daimler-Benz AG's laying off of 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the shortened VW workweek also was better than the solution at General 
Motors Corp. subsidiary Opel, which agreed last year with its union to cut 
bonuses and trim pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're working 36 hours but getting less pay," Osterloh said, while VW's 
move showed "good solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
 Solidarity and loyalty run through the VW factory and the city of Wolfsburg, 
which was created from scratch in 1938. After World War II, the best-selling VW 
Beetle was built in Wolfsburg and the state-owned company was largely 
privatized, though the state of Lower Saxony still holds 20% of the shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of worker loyalty extends beyond the factory to German society as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutzick, the veteran factory hand, said the world suffered terribly from the 
1930s mass unemployment that helped bring on the Nazi government. Today's VW 
solution can provide an example for the nation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedhelm Schofeld, one of thousands who took early retirement in recent years 
as VW was trimming its work force, said Volkswagen acted humanely following his 
32 years' employment -- and was still doing so with the reduced workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is unsure of the future. "There won't ever be another boom and I won't 
be surprised if there have to be more cutbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 The new shifts for a 28.8-hour workweek went into effect after the Easter 
factory shutdown. Life is not the same in Wolfsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pulse of the factory sets the pulse of public life," said Koch, the 
personnel executive.

SENIOR TRIP: INNOCENT FUN -- OR 'RISKY ENDEAVOR'?; GRADUATION: AS STUDENTS 
PREPARE FOR A LAST FLING WITH THEIR CHUMS, SOME PARENTS AND ADMINISTRATORS SAY 
THE TROPICAL VACATIONS ARE JUST BOOZY PARTIES.

 This summer, high school graduates from all over Ventura County will jet off 
to Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and other tropical haunts for their traditional 
"senior class trips." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, some adults say, the teen-agers will travel without school 
sanction or adult chaperons, and the trips will degenerate into little more 
than big, boozy parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one big orgy, and there's enormous pressure on kids to go," said Jean 
Ferguson, a Thousand Oaks family therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost entirely just partying," said Ferguson, who forbade her daughter 
to join her classmates in Mexico three years ago. "Half the parents think it's 
a school trip, and I don't know why. It's one of the most difficult things for 
parents to say no to." 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools forbid travel agents to advertise the trips on campus because 
administrators refuse to condone them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't sanction these trips," said Tony Diaz, activities director at Oxnard 
High School. "It's a risky endeavor. The drinking age is lower, most of the 
kids go down and let off steam, and, hey, you've seen the way some of those 
spring breaks turn out." 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't touch those things with a 20-foot pole," said Keith Wilson, 
principal at Thousand Oaks High, where seniors are planning a late-June trip to 
Cancun, Mexico. "They're just out of hand, with no supervision. They just scare 
me to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, say travel agents, many students and even some parents: The trips 
are safe and sane. 
</P>
<P>
 The graduates are 18 now, they say -- legally adults in the United States and 
old enough to drink in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 All this tut-tutting disapproval, they say, is just rank jealousy from adults 
who never had it so good. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get these narrow-minded adults that just think it's a drunken orgy for a 
week," Marc Forman, president of New Horizons Tours in Newbury Park, said with 
a sigh. "They were teen-agers once -- what's wrong with them?" 
</P>
<P>
 This year, graduates from Westlake, Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park, Channel 
Islands and Camarillo high schools are booking trips to Mexico through his 
company, Forman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they go out and drink in the bars," he said. "But they handle 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The worst thing that ever happened on a student trip was when two girls on a 
ski vacation to Vail were briefly jailed for shoplifting a Coke, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many school officials admit that they have never heard any horror 
stories from senior class trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never heard of anything bad happening," said David Hess, activities 
director at Ventura High School. "It just doesn't mean you want to wait until 
something does happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior class trips became popular among Ventura County graduates in the late 
1970s and early '80s. Travel agencies began touting them to college-bound 
students across the county -- and the country -- as the best kind of last fling 
with their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now senior trips are big business, with thousands of graduates from around the 
United States flocking to Mexico in late June and early July. 
</P>
<P>
 That, Simi Valley High senior Carrie Jenkins said, is "the coolest part about 
the trip. . . . It's all seniors from all over the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Some travel agencies have even enlisted students such as Carrie to recruit 
traveling companions. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she helped sign up 30 classmates for the trip, she said, she will fly 
round-trip to Puerto Vallarta and stay for a week in a beachfront hotel room -- 
a $369 expense -- for free. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Horizons Tours sells packages for USA Student Travels, a Sacramento-based 
company that arranges trips for high school and college students from 
California, Washington, Nevada, Texas, Florida and Illinois -- many of whom hit 
Mexico at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids by and far handle themselves real well," said John Duby, owner of 
USA Student Travels. "When the students arrive, we meet them at the airport, we 
bring them to the hotel and we brief them thoroughly, including behavior and 
different customs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're on their own; however, we make them aware of the ground rules that 
exist," Duby said. "And if there were problems on tours with drunkenness, the 
Marriott and the Hyatt and the other five-star hotels wouldn't work with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Adult supervisors, provided by his agency, "can knock on a door to a room and 
say, 'Look guys, you need to cool it because either we can ship you home or 
you're going to be bounced from the hotel,' " Duby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You say that to a college kid and you don't know how they're going to 
respond," he added. "You say that to a high school senior, it really has an 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have taken the trips admit that drinking is a big part of the 
activity. But nothing, they say, ever got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Smith, Thousand Oaks High class of '93, said he and three buddies spent 
a week last year cruising the coast of Mexico on a luxury liner. His parents 
paid the $730 cruise fee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting the Corona beer factory in Puerto Vallarta, the four smuggled a 
couple of cases aboard to duck the $3.50-a-bottle prices charged at the ship's 
bars and drank it at night in their cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents knew that they would drink, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew it (drinking) was going to happen. They just thought I was 
responsible enough to control myself. . . . But it's not all about that. When 
you're in a foreign place, you kind of hold back and just enjoy it instead of 
going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The only bad experience, he said, was when stormy seas on the trip's final 
days took the young men on a queasy detour to seasickness. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Gonzales of Thousand Oaks sent her son to Cancun with classmates in 1991 
after he graduated. This year, her daughter is going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably my biggest concern is the drinking that I'm sure that will go on," 
Gonzales said. "I think most parents are a little apprehensive about their kids 
going out of the country -- about letting go, more than anything. . . . I think 
they're responsible enough and, if I didn't feel she was, she wouldn't be 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 For many parents, this is the deepest fear -- cutting the apron strings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Clardy's parents are paying her way as a reward for devoting her 
senior year to her studies, cheerleading and work as student body president at 
Camarillo High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan on doing straight partying when I'm there," Cynthia said. "I 
want to do sightseeing and sports, like water skiing. . . . I'm going with 
three of my closest girlfriends; it's sort of a bonding thing before we go to 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 But her mother admits that she's a little nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time my daughter will go anywhere by herself," said Connie 
Clardy, who tries to console herself with the thought that one of her 
daughter's classmates has a grandmother in Cancun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still thinking about flying there myself," Clardy said. "I trust her, but 
the only thing is the people around her."

FOR MANY, LIFE'S A BEACH ON HOT HOLIDAY WEEKEND; MEMORIAL DAY: THOUSANDS FLOCK 
TO PARKS AND COASTLINE. OTHERS ATTEND ADDRESS AT REAGAN LIBRARY NEAR SIMI 
VALLEY.

 From Silver Strand to Simi Valley, Ventura County visitors and residents 
Sunday spilled into area parks and beaches, taking advantage of spicy 
temperatures and the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the coast, lifeguards scanned the beachfronts for wayward swimmers while 
families propped up umbrellas and children sculpted castles made of sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost didn't come because it's Memorial Day weekend and the beach gets 
kind of crowded," said Joe Kolb, an aerospace manager from Camarillo who 
brought his wife, Kim, and two boys, Michael, 5, and Kevin, 3, to Silver Strand 
beach Sunday. "But it was too nice a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Scott Ofriel was busy setting up his blanket and barbecue, and 
planting a pink-and-yellow umbrella in the white sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's days like this you wish you'd bought a house on the beach -- even if 
it's just a shack," said Ofriel, an electronic engineer from Port Hueneme who 
was relaxing with his wife, Dana, and their three children. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi Valley, visitors were 
treated to a pre-Memorial Day address by Gen. P. X. Kelley, a retired 
commandant of the U. S. Marine Corps who advised Reagan during key military 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley spoke for about an hour to hundreds of people gathered in the 
auditorium, railing against the Clinton Administration's military downsizing 
and naming North Korea as the biggest threat to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took $10 billion out of the budget just to balance the books," the 
retired general told an enthusiastic crowd. "And that means 250,000 jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley spoke fondly of the former President, relaying a series of anecdotes 
and vignettes that showed Reagan to be a gentle and caring leader. On one 
occasion, Kelley said, the President spent 30 minutes on the telephone with the 
widow of a young Marine killed in the 1983 attack on U. S. barracks in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Kelley said Reagan spoke ruefully about making the decision to 
send troops to war. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never hesitated when it was the right thing to do, but that doesn't mean 
he liked it," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Audience members said they came away with a better understanding of the 40th 
President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of expecting a little more flag-waving, but it was very 
interesting," said Anthony Stock, a Marine based in San Diego who was in 
Ventura County visiting family. "The general's a little bit of a politician, 
but that's his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl McFarland, a Simi Valley medical manager, was also impressed with the 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was very moving, powerful," said McFarland, who brought his 
wife, Sue, and his parents to the Reagan library. "It's easy to see why he's a 
commandant in the Marine Corps." 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl's father, Al McFarland, a retired Marine of 20 years visiting from 
Vista, said the general's speech was inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with the man wholeheartedly," the senior McFarland said. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Pat, agreed. "There wasn't a Clinton admirer in the crowd," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Conejo Creek Park near the Thousand Oaks Library, the Marshall family was 
celebrating more than Memorial Day. It was Frances Marshall's birthday, but she 
declined to say which one. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids are here from Orange County with my three grandchildren," she said, 
resting in a lawn chair in a shady spot in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away, Chuck Marshall was preparing the picnic spread -- fresh 
vegetables, meats and cheeses. A Marine fighter pilot based in El Toro, he said 
he would wait until today to observe Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all like to have a day off, but the holiday's there for a reason," he 
said. "We need to remember all the people who have given their lives for our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At San Buenaventura State Beach, lifeguard Jessica Morse sat atop her station, 
thankful for the first nice weekend in nearly a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything looks great," she said. "We've got perfect weather, the ocean is 
calm and there's no rip currents. People are enjoying themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Minegar drove from Lancaster with her daughter, Laura, 11, and twin 
9-year-old nieces, Brittany and Jamie, to get a taste of the salt air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the closest beach we have, without going to Los Angeles," said Minegar, 
who runs a day-care center in Lancaster. "And it has the best waves." 
</P>
<P>
 About eight miles south, Pete Reed and his fiance, Andrea Freidline, were 
camped out near the breakwater jutting along Silver Strand beach. Reed had 
brought a cooler full of beer, snacks and a cassette tape deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're from here, so we always kick back here with weather like this," he 
said, gulping a light beer. "We've been waiting for a couple of months for it 
to clear up." 
</P>
<P>
 At his side and covered in sunscreen, Freidline said she was too scared to 
venture into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cold," she said, shuddering to make her point. "It's very, very cold."

SEA GULLS FIND A HAVEN FOR THEIR NESTS ON ANACAPA ISLAND; NATURE: THE BIRDS 
FLOCK TO THE REMOTE BREEDING GROUND TO ESCAPE PREDATORS ON THE MAINLAND. THEY 
DON'T WELCOME HUMAN VISITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nestled in the fuchsia blooms of the ice plant, tending their eggs and downy 
brown chicks, the sea gulls on Anacapa Island look positively serene. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until you walk anywhere near their nests. 
</P>
<P>
 A loud squawking sound commences, followed by the flapping of wings and a 
webbed foot aimed squarely at the intruder's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever see that Hitchcock movie 'The Birds'?" asked Howard Level, a 
retired Ventura College instructor who just finished fending off a swarm of 
gulls. "That's what I think of every time I see those angry birds." 
</P>
<P>
 The western gull can perhaps be forgiven its protective urges. After all, half 
to two-thirds of the gull chicks don't live past their first year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the birds did choose this remote breeding ground in Channel Islands 
National Park specifically to avoid the sort of predators that exist on the 
mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, some 15 miles from the Ventura beaches and trash dumps that they scour 
for food, the gulls come home to roost on the three islets that make up Anacapa 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to see their family life," said Jack Gillooly, a seasonal park ranger 
fascinated with the gulls on East Anacapa. "People sort of think of them as 
winged rats: They eat just about anything, they raid trash, they eat people's 
lunches. The general perception is they are nuisances to be put up with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming out here and seeing how they nest, the cute little chicks, you get a 
whole different perspective of what kind of creatures they are." 
</P>
<P>
 On their island domain, sea gulls soar majestically above 200-foot cliffs. 
They perch atop the giant coreopsis bushes. They lay their mottled eggs on the 
ground and watch them hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 A glance across the sloping terrain reveals hundreds of sea gull heads peering 
out from the low-growing shrubs that cover Anacapa. The birds are eight to 10 
feet apart, each preserving its territory and protecting its young. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have counted 1,000 nests on this islet alone, and another 4,000 to 
5,000 on nearby islands -- making the national park one of the largest breeding 
grounds for western gulls in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the only place the gulls can nest because on the mainland 
you've got dogs, cats, all sorts of predators," said Lisa Porto, a seasonal 
ranger with the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here, humans are the pests, if not the predators. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first human residents arrived with a new lighthouse in the 1930s, the 
brown pelican population fled to more remote West Anacapa. The sea gulls 
stayed, but have not made it easy on intruders. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Coast Guard installed a cement slab to catch rainfall and provide 
drinking water for its human visitors, the birds turned it into a prime perch. 
They plastered the cement with droppings and rendered the water undrinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the slab, used only as an emergency helicopter pad, bears the 
unmistakable stains and stench of the sea gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Even regular visitors such as the park rangers, who live in a tiny house on 
the island, get no welcome from the gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two birds, they see us from a distance and they start toward us," said 
Olga Timofeyeva, a Russian who is staying at the rangers' residence with her 
2-year-old daughter. So far, the birds haven't actually touched her. "I think 
if they did, I would never leave the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers and park rangers forgive the gulls their inhospitable conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, we're in their territory," Gillooly said. "They are really 
territorial birds. They don't like to be disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That extends to other gulls as well. In fact, if a newborn chick wanders out 
of his nesting area, it can be pecked to death by another bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Other chicks fall prey to ravens or the occasional rat. Still others starve to 
death in lean years or fall off the steep cliffs surrounding Anacapa -- 
contributing to the 50% to 70% mortality rate for first-year gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds also face an occasional human predator: A year ago, two men stranded 
on West Anacapa in a boating accident ate raw sea gull eggs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The more typical encounter with mankind comes on the 1 1/2-mile walking trail 
that rings East Anacapa. On a recent day, a crowd stopped to gaze into a sea 
gull nest, where a chick was pecking its way out of the eggshell. 
</P>
<P>
 The angry parents began squawking, then fluttering their wings as if ready to 
attack. The crowd moved on, and the birds quieted down. But when two visitors 
veered off the trail and marched through an ice plant patch, a flock of gulls 
took flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds swooped close to their heads, as the two men waved their hands 
frantically over their heads. "All those mamas, they don't want you near their 
chicks," said Howard Level, emerging unscathed from the episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Level and his friend, Casey Casella of Ventura, had used the preferred 
technique for dispelling enraged sea gulls. The gulls tend to aim for the 
highest point on the body and rarely inflict any damage, Gillooly says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most that usually happens is that people get kicked in the head with 
little webbed feet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their unfriendly attitude, the birds do find some uses for human 
visitors. As a group of people gathers for lunch, a gull perches on the picnic 
table, hoping for scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 And the birds often bring pieces of the mainland back to their island home. 
Rangers keep finding plastic bags, emptied of sandwich scraps from trash dumps 
or schoolyards, on Anacapa. And visitors often see mysterious bones lying along 
the walking trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't bird bones," Gillooly said. "They aren't ancient Indian burial 
bones. They are chicken bones."

STREET SMART: LACK OF MONEY CURBS PAINTING OF MEDIANS IN VENTURA

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to suggest that reflectors or yellow paint be applied to medians 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The medians are often the same color as the roadway, which makes them 
difficult to see, especially at night and when it's raining. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the medians be painted to make them easier to see? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your suggestion is a good one, but the city of Ventura does not have the cash 
to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 To paint medians around Ventura, the city would need to greatly increase 
funding for road crews, Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, road crews barely have time to keep the lines marking street lanes 
looking fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Lalani says, the city has cut back on what little median painting it 
performs. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the city did paint a very low median on Telegraph Road between Main 
Street and Mills Road, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an extreme case where the median is very low," Lalani said. "In most 
cases, we just don't have the resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with a recent letter asking for road improvements to ease congestion 
near San Buenaventura Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials responded by saying they are waiting until mall expansion plans 
are completed, but I think that there could be another, more immediate, 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The troublesome intersection is at Mills Road and Dean Drive at the entrance 
to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that most cars exiting the mall turn right onto southbound 
Mills, instead of going straight onto Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 This creates problems for cars on Dean that are also trying to turn onto 
southbound Mills, because the road is too narrow to handle the heavy traffic 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
 This problem could be solved quickly and easily if mall developer MaceRich 
would add a right-turn lane at the mall exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for the mall expansion to wind its way through City Hall could take 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 We need relief at this corner now!

 Dear Street Smart:

 Driving along the Moorpark Freeway, I've noticed signs saying ramps will be 
closed in the coming weeks.

<P>
 Ramps on the Moorpark Freeway will be closed periodically until early July so 
that the state Department of Transportation can spruce up the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is part of a $283,000 project to grind and repave five off-ramps 
along the Moorpark Freeway from the Ventura Freeway to Tierra Rejada Road. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the inconvenience for motorists, only one ramp will be closed at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound ramps will be closed weekdays from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and southbound 
ramps from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. ROAD CLOSURE 
</P>
<P>
 The westbound Santa Paula Freeway at Kimball Road will be closed from 9 p.m. 
to 5 a.m. Tuesday through Friday. Road crews will be finishing up construction 
on the Kimball overpass. Traffic will be detoured at Wells Road, north to 
Telegraph Road, west to Kimball and south back onto the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The eastbound lanes are scheduled for closure next week. Watch this space for 
details.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RAMP BRINGS WHEELCHAIRS TO OCEAN'S EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent visit to Marina Cove Beach, Ron Herrera enjoyed his bumpy ride in 
a wheelchair along a newly reinstalled access ramp near Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like I'm strolling over a pier," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers laid down the tough 200-foot plastic path late last month, seven 
months after it was removed to make way for a construction project at the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was initially put in place last summer to allow wheelchair-users to roll 
right up to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide platform at the path's end allows users to watch waves lap at the sand 
up close, observe children playing or just laze in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The day Herrera picked to visit was damp and chilly, but he said he enjoyed 
the ride anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his first visit to the city-installed ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great for someone like me who has never gone out to the water 
unassisted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, 38, a Ventura resident, has spina bifida, a birth defect that has 
confined him to a wheelchair his entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he does not go to the beach often because it has not been accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, working with a coalition of government agencies and philanthropic 
groups, raised the $20,000 needed to install the ramp last year. The ramp is 
the first of its kind in Ventura County, although a shorter, concrete ramp is 
available to the mobility-impaired at a beach in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has 15,000 people who use wheelchairs or are otherwise 
impaired, said Renee Gomez, a city recreation coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the ramp is also used by parents pushing strollers or beach-goers who 
don't want to get sand in their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I'm down there, it's the most well-used, well-traveled part of the 
beach," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is being used by all types of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is purchasing a special wheelchair with inflated wheels that will 
allow wheelchair-users to roll even closer to the water's edge, Gomez said. 
That wheelchair should be available at Marina Cove Park in a few weeks. KAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SUMMER PROMOTIONS SPOTLIGHT DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A series of attractions and cultural events is planned throughout the summer 
to lure both residents and visitors into Oxnard's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown merchants have banded together to promote the historic district, 
which over the years has become the economic victim of regional shopping malls 
and other development outside the city's core. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty or 30 years ago, people sort of got away from downtown as the malls 
got built," said Ruth Bernstein, of the Oxnard Downtowners, the central city 
merchants coalition staging the promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to bring people back downtown again and also bring tourists here for 
the first time to visit our museums, Heritage Square, and all the unique and 
smaller shops," Bernstein added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a romance campaign, in the sense of romanticizing downtown and 
trying to create a positive image there." 
</P>
<P>
 Promotions include the third annual Summer Concert Series, which features 
various types of live music at 6 p.m. Fridays between June 24 and Aug. 26. The 
free concerts will be held in Heritage Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Other events include the Oxnard Farmers Market, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. every 
Thursday at Heritage Square, and the A Street Antiques & Collectibles Faire, 
held the second Saturday of each month through September between 3rd and 5th 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the merchants coalition will present "Rediscover Downtown's 
Treasures," an afternoon open house featuring tours of the Gull Wings 
Children's Museum, the Oxnard Civic Center, the Carnegie Art Museum and other 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in June, the Downtowners will stage the drama "Hay Fever," which will run 
Friday and Saturday nights through July 9. 
</P>
<P>
 For information or to participate in any events, contact the Downtown Events & 
Promotions office at 483-7960. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SCHOOL HONORED FOR ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saticoy School in Ventura is one of 63 elementary schools nationwide that has 
been honored for its efforts to steer children away from alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Nancy Bradford and two other staff members will travel to Washington 
early next month to receive the award at a White House Rose Garden ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get to shake (President) Bill Clinton's hand," Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 109 schools nationwide, including 21 high schools and 23 junior 
high schools, will receive the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the award officially recognizes Saticoy as one of the nation's best 
"Drug-Free Schools," Saticoy's programs do more than just try to keep drugs and 
alcohol off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Saticoy has an array of support groups, counseling programs and classroom 
activities that reach out not only to its kindergarten through fifth-grade 
students but also to their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who are withdrawn or shy participate in a program designed to boost 
their self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who have a sibling or parent with a drug or drinking problem may join 
support groups to help them cope with the addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 And pupils who have lost a family member can get grief counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, Bradford said, is to help children who are deemed at risk of 
resorting to drugs or alcohol later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are kids that could be substance abusers if they didn't have help with 
their emotional problems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that intervention at an early age will prevent whatever problem it 
might be, whether it be gangs or drugs or alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 The school also reaches out to families, offering classes that teach parenting 
skills and support groups on issues such as helping parents recognize whether 
their children are affiliated with gangs. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PLAZA WILL CATER TO PICNICS AND 
BANQUETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aiming for an atmosphere both informal and elegant, Thousand Oaks theater 
commissioners have approved a catering program for the Civic Arts Plaza that 
includes both plastic-silverware picnics and bone-china banquets. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member panel has recommended granting an exclusive concessions 
contract to Warner Center Marriott of Woodland Hills.The City Council will 
consider the contract at its June 7 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In its catering proposal, the Warner Center Marriott team sought to blend the 
casual, jeans-and-sneakers tradition of the Hollywood Bowl with the more 
upscale, formal ambience of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater-goers in Thousand Oaks could order a $6 dinner, featuring cold chicken 
or croissant sandwiches, for a "picnic under the oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy patrons -- those who have contributed at least $50,000 to the arts 
center's endowment -- could enjoy a banquet served by waiters in black-tie 
tuxedos in the Founders Room. 
</P>
<P>
 And during intermissions, all spectators could buy drinks and desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 To sweeten their proposal, Warner Center Marriott executives promised 10% of 
their gross revenue to the city. They also offered to steer hotel guests toward 
shows at the Civic Arts Plaza, perhaps by selling discounted, last-minute 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll absolutely guarantee that this will be a success," said Robert Graney, 
the hotel's general manager. "We won't let you down." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners have also approved a deal with Century Parking Inc. of Los 
Angeles to run the 735-space parking garage. Under the contract, which also 
goes to the City Council for approval, ordinary parking would cost $4, VIP 
parking in preferred spaces would go for $7 and valet parking would be priced 
at $10. STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 Citing low patronage, the Simi Valley City Council has approved a plan to shut 
the city's landfill on most Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan -- recommended by staff from Ventura County and the cities of 
Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks -- the landfill would be open Mondays 
through Saturdays, and the third Sunday of each month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the dump must be open two other Sundays each year under the 
agreement reached with landfill operator Waste Management. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan must receive final approval from the Board of Supervisors before 
going into effect. The board is scheduled to consider the matter in the next 
month. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; DEVELOPER TO PREPARE ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark city planners will soon measure the environmental effects of a 
proposed 620-unit housing development on the city's north side. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a plan last week to allow the Levy Co. to perform an 
environmental impact report, the first step in its effort to build houses on 
285 acres north of Poindexter Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased traffic from the proposed project will be among the most difficult 
issues to resolve, according to city planners. Local residents argue that the 
roads surrounding the property already have too much traffic and are too small 
to handle the potential increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walnut Canyon Road is already impossible," said Jim Latunski, who lives on 
the road. "It's a narrow, rotten road and there's no way it can handle any more 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Hardgrave of Development Planning Services, which represents the Levy 
Co., said the environmental report would address some of those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the report is completed, the City Council will review the project in more 
detail. The study could take several months, planners said. Councilman Scott 
Montgomery said there are no guarantees the city will approve the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are simply processing the developer's application," he said. "After he 
prepares the EIR, we'll be able to see what sort of problems with (traffic) 
circulation there are and see what kind of alternatives are offered. Until we 
see that, we don't really know what we're up against." SCOTT HADLY

URBAN PROBLEM PITCHES A CURVE TO SANTA MONICA LITTLE LEAGUE; RECREATION: 
PARENTS AND OFFICIALS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RISING NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE 
CAMPING NEAR BASEBALL FIELDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the Little League diamonds of Santa Monica, the great American pastime 
clashes almost nightly with a great American problem -- homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bad mix, parents and league officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for the homeless, but I feel sorry for the children who are put 
at risk," said Diana Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle is one of many parents who are complaining to the city about a growing 
number of homeless people camping this spring at Memorial Park, where the Santa 
Monica Little League has played since 1950. League officials say they were 
warned by city officials even before the season began to be on the lookout for 
guns, criminals and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lump in my throat when (my son) has to walk through there alone," 
said another mother, Susan Kleisley. "It's not a nice, safe environment for 
Little League kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people disagree, saying Little League parents would simply rather 
ignore the appearance -- and plight -- of the poor. Said one homeless man: 
"We're reminders to them that they could be here on the streets anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict at Memorial Park, located about a mile from the ocean on Olympic 
Boulevard, is the latest flare-up in this liberal city's longstanding battle 
over the impact of homelessness on the rest of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have long complained that most parks are generally unusable by their 
children. To many, encroaching on the Little League is the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been hurt, but a few parents have complained to police that their 
kids often encounter homeless people in the park's public restrooms, and on a 
few occasions have been hassled by them. Homeless people also wander onto the 
field during games and practices, sleep under the bleachers and urinate in full 
view of the children, league officials say, and drug dealing and drunkenness 
are a common sight. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, during an adult softball game, a transient man brandished a gun 
when he was asked to leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole memory of their youth will be of playing baseball on a Skid Row 
baseball field," said Larry Mollin, the league's president. "Does anybody care 
about the next generation of Santa Monica kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mollin, who presides over a league that has almost 1,000 players, blames the 
problem on city policies that he terms pro-homeless. "The city is strangled by 
its homeless policies and the kids are losing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he complained to police before the start of the season, Mollin was 
informed in writing that his problem was "of a political nature" and could not 
be resolved by them. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they are doing everything they can to monitor the parks, 
but concede that the homeless population in Memorial Park has risen of late. 
Between 35 and 70 transients a night stay there. Some sleep on the tennis 
courts. The small park has several baseball fields, a gymnasium, a playground 
and a grassy area. The homeless count is up at Memorial because two other city 
parks where homeless people tend to congregate are closed for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Memorial Park has showers open in the evenings and the city's 
only public bathrooms open around the clock. The bathrooms were opened as part 
of a deal made with homeless people last summer to get them to end a 
months-long protest at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica is building a 100-bed homeless shelter as part of its periodic 
efforts to address the conflicts involving homeless people and residents who 
say their parks have been taken over by transients. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, when the shelter is up and running, the City Council plans to 
enforce a ban on transients living in the parks. This represents the latest in 
a series of crackdowns that have so far failed to make a dent in the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 At Memorial Park on Thursday night, park rangers and police officers were out 
in full force, responding to a spate of complaints by Little League parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The scene at the park was of a city divided. 
</P>
<P>
 The Little League fields, on the 16th Street side of the park, looked like a 
Norman Rockwell tableau. There, the first-place Padres were playing the Mets, 
their parents cheering or groaning with each crack of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' younger siblings hopped up and down on the bleachers. One small 
boy in an oversized baseball cap stood on tiptoes to reach the counter at the 
snack stand, where hot dogs went for a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love this world," said Mollin, a television producer and writer. "It's 
magical here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the park milled dozens of homeless men and women, 
surrounded by their bedraggled belongings. A Santa Monica police officer, on 
his last night on the homeless detail, was hosting a barbecue for the park 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 A lone baseball player and his coach sat among them. The player was David 
Greenberg, whose mother, Asha, a Santa Monica city councilwoman, ran on a 
public safety platform two years ago that she is still trying to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach was waiting with David until his mother arrived. Because of safety 
concerns, the league insists on this. Whenever possible, players are escorted 
to the bathrooms and some parents say they try to avoid the area where the 
homeless congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of homeless people playing dominoes at a picnic table said the 
parents' fears were unfounded. "Nobody bothers those people," said a 
gray-haired woman named Sandy as she slapped down her tile. "They just don't 
like the looks of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Police Sgt. Gary Gallinot said many of the homeless people at 
Memorial Park are harmless, although some of them complained to him recently 
that a few rowdy sorts had joined them recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the parents at the park that night said they had no problems with the 
homeless population there. 
</P>
<P>
 Another family reported that one homeless man comes to Memorial Park during 
the games on their account. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Doc. He spends every night in an alley next to Brian Bourget's 
business, cleaning up after himself in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evenings, Doc sometimes comes to the park to root for Bourget's son, a 
third baseman for the Padres.

ALICE IN TRANSIT LAND ; ON SOME SOUTHLAND PROJECTS, LOGIC SEEMINGLY HAS TAKEN A 
U-TURN

 Ford engineers designed the classic '55 Thunderbird, but they also came up 
with the '57 Edsel. NASA scientists put a man on the moon, but a glitch in the 
Hubble telescope stumped them for years. 
</P>
<P>
 History teaches us that for every act of genius, there is a blooper. 
</P>
<P>
 For Southern California, the 1990s have been peppered with historic 
accomplishments in transportation: Officials reopened the quake-shattered Santa 
Monica Freeway 2 1/2 months ahead of schedule. They cut the ribbons on L.A.'s 
Red Line subway, the Century Freeway, the Metrolink commuter train, an Orange 
County toll road and the Long Beach trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, some baffling or plain wrongheaded transit projects and 
policies have been set in motion.  
</P>
<P>
 The lesson to be learned, experts say, is to beware the politics of 
transportation -- a labyrinthine maze in which common-sense planning and logic 
sometimes lose out to political concerns or even greed. It is a system in which 
large sums of money are spent with spotty accountability, an equation that 
occasionally allows shortsightedness and often rewards political muscle, these 
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, for example, bus passes for the poor cost more than passes for the 
general public. And why the planned rail route from Downtown to Los Angeles 
International Airport would involve riding two trolleys, one subway, a bus and 
a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You dignify a couple of these decisions to call them dubious. They are 
amazingly dubious," said James Moore, associate professor of urban planning and 
co-director of USC's Center for Advanced Transportation Technology. "You are 
heading fast and deep toward the category of stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a score card of some of the transportation bloopers that cover our 
landscape, and the reasons they happened: 
</P>
<P>
 * Why don't trains go where you want to go? The Red Line subway will stop a 
half-mile from the L.A. County Museum of Art and the Hollywood Bowl. It goes 
nowhere near Dodger Stadium or the Great Western Forum. And the last stop of 
the Green Line trolley -- running between Norwalk and El Segundo -- will end 
1.5 miles from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, here's your route to LAX from the subway once the Green Line trolley 
is finished next year: Tote your luggage over to your favorite Red Line 
station, transfer to the Blue Line, switch to the Green Line until the last 
stop, take the bus to Parking Lot C, and then hop on the airport shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 In devising the routes of the Red Line and Green Line, transit planners had 
one main goal: transporting commuters. Officials have said the system is 
designed to serve those going to work -- not sightseers, culture aficionados or 
sports fans. The number of people who would use the Green Line to get to the 
airport wouldn't compare to those who would take the trolley to work, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why widen a freeway to six lanes and connect it to three lanes? In Orange 
County, Interstate 5 will be widened from three to six lanes of traffic in each 
direction -- a $1.6-billion extravaganza to be finished in 2001. One problem: 
when the roadway hits the Los Angeles County line, it returns to three lanes. 
Ever heard of bottleneck, asks Ryan Snyder, a transportation consultant and 
vice president of the L.A. Board of Transportation Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said they hope the I-5 will someday be widened in Los 
Angeles County as well, although the project will not even be considered until 
2010. In any case, officials do not think the traffic jams will be bad at the 
point where the freeway narrows. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of planning is what happens when different jurisdictions install a 
piecemeal approach to solve traffic woes, said Genevieve Guiliano, associate 
professor of urban and regional planning at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a regional planning problem," she said. "It's a question of different 
philosophies about how traffic should be managed." 
</P>
<P>
 * Why does the MTA need imported granite? The Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority -- currently facing a $126-million operating shortfall and proposing 
fare hikes -- will pick up part of the tab for a trip that sent five 
contractors and two agency employees to Italy and England to inspect bricks and 
granite for the agency's new headquarters, which is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for MTA officials was $7,538. It's not yet known how much was spent 
for the contractors' travels. In response to criticism, Rob Vogel, project 
manager of Catellus Development Corp., which is building the MTA's 
headquarters, has told the agency he will not ask for reimbursement, according 
to MTA spokesman Steve Chesser. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first of two trips to Europe, the agency's development specialist, 
Robin Blair, and four members of Catellus traveled to Pisa, Italy, from Jan. 10 
to 16. They viewed granite samples. 
</P>
<P>
 The following month, Blair, MTA supervising engineer Vasan Srinivasan and four 
Catellus members (three from the previous trip, one for the first time), 
traveled to a quarry in Savema, Italy. From there, the group went to London to 
visit a brick factory and "sites where bricks are extensively used," said 
Shaker Sawires, the MTA's deputy executive officer of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawires said it was essential that each person travel. "Each one has a 
different function," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, from now on, authorization will be needed for all overseas 
travel by the agency, according to MTA chief Frank White. 
</P>
<P>
 This from the agency that became the butt of talk show jokes two years ago 
when The Times disclosed that the agency's staff spent almost $3 million on 
catered meals, doughnuts, entertainment and automobile expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting aside the issue of propriety in spending taxpayers' dollars, another 
question remains: Aren't American bricks and granite any good? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently not. "We tried to use local bricks, we made tests and it did not 
withstand busloads," Sawires said. 
</P>
<P>
 By using the Italian-manufactured granite, the agency saved $200,000, said 
Chesser, who added that 83% of the stone materials used on the building are 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two years ago, the MTA came under fire when it awarded a $122-million 
contract for rail cars to the Japan-based Sumitomo Corp. At that time, agency 
officials were blasted for not "buying American." (The contract was later 
canceled.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Does anyone know where the DASH buses go? The routes of the DASH buses, 
which traverse Downtown, have changed more than 10 times since the service 
began in 1985. Nor do these buses take a simple approach -- a map of DASH 
routes looks a jumble of bent coat hangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They zigzag and are completely illogical," said Bob Saunders, a travel writer 
with the Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Chunming Yen, a planning associate with the city Department of Transportation, 
conceded that the maps are difficult for passengers to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not complicated to us ," Yen said. 
</P>
<P>
 DOT officials say they are trying to devise a simpler map. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why do we pay for the rich to take trains?  
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers pay a $21-per-passenger subsidy for everyone boarding the 
periwinkle-and-white Metrolink commuter trains. The average household income of 
these passengers is $63,300. (By comparison, the per-passenger subsidy on the 
bus is $1.17.) 
</P>
<P>
 Should we pay these subsidies, asks planning expert Guiliano, when most 
mass-transit users -- who have an average household income of $15,000 -- ride 
the bus? 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials respond that they are carrying out the will of the voters, 
who in 1990 approved a county ballot measure and two state initiatives that 
provided funding for the commuter rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 "In asking for good viable transportation for everyone, voters are asking for 
choices and they are willing to tax themselves to have choices," said Annette 
Colfax, Metrolink's director of finance and passenger service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why do bus passes for the poor cost more? Concerned about low-income transit 
users who cannot come up with $42 for a monthly rail/bus pass, MTA officials 
last year devised a program that allows passengers to purchase semi-monthly 
passes. Each two-week pass costs $23 . . . or $46 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials say they have to charge more for the semi-monthly pass to cover 
the administrative costs. Conceded one of them: "It's probably not the biggest 
contribution to mobility that we've ever done."  
</P>
<P>
 * Why do transit officials spend 20 times more for security on rail lines than 
on buses? MTA officials spend more than $1 per passenger to provide security on 
trains and trolleys and a nickel per passenger for security on buses, even 
though the vast majority of transit users -- 1.3 million passengers -- travel 
by bus.  
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about inequity," said Earl Clark, general chairman of the United 
Transportation Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials insist they must guarantee the safety of rail passengers if 
the fledgling system is to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community made a major capital investment of $1.4 billion on the Red Line 
and nearly $900 million on the Blue Line. Those investments were done to give 
people a new way to travel," said MTA spokesman Jim Smart. "If you do not 
secure people's safety, then they won't use that capital investment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What you have seen here, says planner Guiliano, are "illustrations of how 
politicized transportation decision-making is, and what power local groups have 
over regional planning. The alignment of rail lines, for instance, is 
completely political." 
</P>
<P>
 The power structure of an agency like the MTA also prompts decisions that are 
made with an eye to the next election, she said. The MTA, which controls a 
$3.4-billion annual budget, is ruled by a 13-member board that includes county 
supervisors, city council members, mayoral appointees, and four officials from 
smaller cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental problem in L.A. is that one agency has control over a huge 
amount of money that makes everything they do very visible," Guiliano said. 
"It's not helped by the fact that its board is local officials who each want 
something for their own area." 
</P>
<P>
 Because local transportation agencies funded by tax dollars have no 
competition, they can afford to make mistakes, adds planner Moore. "Since 
there's no penalty for being foolish, you get foolish outcomes," he said. "If 
revenues depended on the quality of decisions, then decisions would be better."

GOP LEADER WHO BLASTED RIGHT WING IS OUT OF JOB; POLITICS: STATE DIRECTOR MADE 
THE COMMENTS BEFORE A GAY CLUB. PARTY CHAIRMAN CALLS DEPARTURE A VOLUNTARY 
RESIGNATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The executive director of the California Republican Party, Bob Carpenter, is 
out of his job after a furor over a speech he gave to a gay and lesbian GOP 
club in which he accused elements of the party's right wing of being 
intolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican state Chairman Tirso del Junco said Carpenter and his wife, Pat 
Giardina-Carpenter, the state party's finance director, "voluntarily resigned." 
</P>
<P>
 But del Junco's predecessor as chairman, Jim Dignan -- among those criticized 
by Carpenter in his talk to the Log Cabin Club of Los Angeles -- said he 
believes that del Junco forced Carpenter's removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco severely criticized Carpenter's April 25 speech, saying in an 
interview, "It isn't the role of the executive director of the party to make 
such remarks. It's an administrative job. He's not the spokesman for the party. 
It's not his role to advance his own agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 John Allan Peschong, the party's communications director, was named interim 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter could not be reached for comment. Del Junco and Peschong said 
Carpenter and his wife were driving to Washington, D.C., to seek other 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Log Cabin Club's Los Angeles chapter, Ritch Colbert, 
commented bitterly, "I can't help but believe if Carpenter were bashing a more 
moderate or liberal faction of the party, he would still be executive 
director." 
</P>
<P>
 In his extemporaneous speech to the club, which was tape-recorded and later 
written up by a reporter for the weekly newspaper Gay and Lesbian Times, 
Carpenter vowed, "We're going to turn this party around. . . . We're going to 
make this party tolerant if it's the last thing we do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said he had recently spent a weekend attending a convention of the 
College Republicans group in Sacramento "with probably the most intolerant 
people that I've ever spent time with . . . the right and the further right," 
adding that this demonstrated how intolerant the party had become. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticized Dignan, who is now the treasurer for the insurgent Ron Unz 
gubernatorial primary campaign against Gov. Pete Wilson. "Probably one of the 
worst things that our party ever did was to elect Jim Dignan," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added in his speech that he became a Republican 20 years ago because he 
believed in less government, lower taxes and other principles. "We've moved so 
far away from that," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Producing a party card titled, "I'm a Republican because," he said that 
nowhere among the eight points listed "does it say, 'I'm a Republican because 
I'm straight. I'm a Republican because I don't believe in alternative 
lifestyles.' We've got to get away from the intolerance that our party has 
become." 
</P>
<P>
 To help make their point, Carpenter and his wife joined the Log Cabin Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Soojian, state chairman of the College Republicans, said he tried 
unsuccessfully to reach Carpenter to protest his speech, but abandoned the 
attempt when he heard "he was not going to have his job much longer anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 "As to the charge of us being intolerant, we are not intolerant of people 
collectively," Soojian said. "We believe strongly in the 1st Amendment and 
individual rights. But we do believe it's wrong for government to be used to 
promote alternative lifestyles or agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 Dignan said he was appalled by Carpenter's remarks "because I don't believe 
they were fair statements about our volunteer organizations or the party 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The former state chairman said he did not object to Carpenter and his wife 
joining the Log Cabin Club, because "any individual can join whatever club they 
want to, that's their right." 
</P>
<P>
 But as for the speech, he said, "I felt Dr. del Junco would handle it and he 
has handled it. . . . Those statements could not be tolerated, and I felt that 
in time Dr. del Junco would clear this up, and he has cleared it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco said, "No director (of the party) asked me to fire Carpenter. He 
came to me and said . . . 'We're leaving.' . . . He's right, he was having 
difficulties in his job. For any executive director to bash any element of the 
party -- it's unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco contrasted the incident with the 1992 Republican National Convention 
in Houston when speakers such as Pat Buchanan denounced gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the reverse of what happened in Houston," del Junco said. "There it 
was the bashing of gays. Now, it's the bashing of the conservatives."

MAN SOUGHT IN DESERT BOMB BLAST THAT KILLED WOMAN, INJURED SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 31-year-old Littlerock man is being sought for questioning about a pipe bomb 
explosion that killed a woman and injured her 4-year-old son earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Douglas Hamby is believed to have made the bomb, but investigators are 
unsure whether the device was intentionally placed or simply discarded along 
the dirt road where it exploded when the woman found it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidence recovered at the scene of the explosion links the suspect to the 
crime," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Larry Mead. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Standish, 33, a single mother of three, was killed May 20 after she came 
upon the pipe bomb while searching for recyclable items in the open desert near 
her Pearblossom home. There is no indication that Hamby knew Standish. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's 4-year-old son was injured in the leg by the explosion and is 
still at Antelope Valley Hospital, where he is expected to undergo surgery. An 
older brother was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamby, who is on parole, has a history of manufacturing and possessing 
explosive devices," Mead said. "He is considered extremely dangerous and could 
be a danger to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamby is described as 5 feet, 9 inches tall, white, with brown hair, blue eyes 
and a mustache. He weighs about 180 pounds and has a rose tattooed on one 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 He drives a blue-green, older-model, full-sized Ford pickup with a white 
camper shell and Nevada license plates. Hamby is often in the Antelope Valley 
and San Bernardino County areas, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on Hamby's whereabouts is asked to contact the 
homicide bureau of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a quarter-century, he dominated California's courtrooms, defending 
wife-killers and lawyers more famous than himself. 
</P>
<P>
 So great was his renown that murderers clamored "Get me Earl Rogers!" Fans at 
ballgames would shout at ballplayers arguing with the umpire: "Go ahead and 
kill him, we'll get you Earl Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
 His celebrity clients included the fabled Clarence Darrow, a Los Angeles 
police chief and the philanthropist-scoundrel Col. Griffith J. Griffith, who 
shot his wife in the eye but atoned by giving Los Angeles a mammoth park. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers also considered himself a defender of lost -- or strayed -- sheep, and 
pleaded on behalf of whores, pimps and robbers. At a time when murderers were 
routinely executed, he did not believe in the death penalty and he clung to his 
minister-father's belief that justice should serve the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the advent of television and radio, Angelenos packed the courthouse and 
read every word printed about Rogers' often tawdry cases. He introduced 
innovative cross-examination styles and trailblazing courtroom pyrotechnics. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a genius, a showman, the son of a Methodist minister. At the University 
of Syracuse in New York, he played football and met Hazel Belle Green, whom he 
married three times and with whom he had four children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1894, after their first child, Adela, was born, they moved to Los Angeles. 
Fascinated by the law, Rogers soon became the protege of Stephen White, the 
famous attorney and U.S. senator who became instrumental in establishing the 
harbor at San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men had a lot in common: a bottomless capacity for knowledge and booze. 
White liked Rogers' quick mind and style. 
</P>
<P>
 Their friendship would break up in court. Soon after Rogers began practicing 
in 1897, he defended an unemployed plumber accused of murdering a popular young 
lawyer named Jay Hunter over a $4 plumbing bill. White was working for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers won, stunning the city and his onetime mentor; for the first time, 
White had been beaten in court. And upon the "Little Giant's" fall, Rogers rose 
to glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' immaculate appearance -- spats, monocle and a different suit each day, 
set off by a gardenia in his lapel -- played to his flamboyant image. 
</P>
<P>
 His reputation and stature soon towered over others; he was earning more than 
$100,000 a year in the second decade of the century. He rarely took cases that 
he thought were sure losers, but he saw ways to win cases that others had 
written off. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 77 murder cases he argued, only one defendant ever hanged. And most -- 
as even Rogers admitted -- were probably guilty. After one man was acquitted of 
murdering his wife, he turned to Rogers and said: "The truth will prevail, 
Earl." Rogers snarled: "Get away from me, you slimy pimp! You know you're 
guilty as hell." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1906, Rogers was persuaded for the first time to switch roles and assist 
the district attorney in prosecuting Morrison Buck, the former chauffeur of Los 
Angeles oil magnate Charles A. Canfield. Buck had asked Canfield for a loan of 
$2,600, but when Canfield refused, he shot Canfield's wife, Chloe, twice in the 
head. The defense tried to prove Buck was insane, but Rogers proved he was sane 
and Buck hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Rogers' victory filled him with a remorse that never healed. Only seconds 
after Buck was pronounced dead at San Quentin, Rogers wailed: "We're all wrong. 
. . . Who are we to take life? . . . I can't forgive myself." 
</P>
<P>
 When attorney Darrow was accused of bribing the jury during his defense of 
J.B. McNamara in the bombing of the Los Angeles Times in 1910, Darrow hired 
Rogers to defend him. Darrow was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Rogers' career soared, his personal life was reduced to shambles. All 
three of his stormy marriages to Hazel Belle ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 His heart mended quickly after he met Edna (Teddy) Landers, a tall, redheaded 
Irish-Canadian with a beautiful singing voice. In 1916, she gave up her Roman 
Catholic faith to marry Rogers, who was almost twice her age. Their fairy tale 
marriage ended three years later, when she died in the worldwide influenza 
epidemic at the age of 29. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point, the drinking problem that had plagued him grew worse. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was not in court defending the downtrodden, his influential friends 
had been in court defending him, mostly because of his drinking. His famous 
journalist daughter, Adela, spent much of her life perpetuating Rogers' 
legendary reputation as a legal tactician, bon vivant and uncommon drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 His drinking accelerated with the guilt he carried for sending Buck to the 
gallows. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Rogers sank into drunken irresponsibility. His eldest son signed a 
complaint to have him committed, and Adela appeared in court against him. When 
her direct testimony was ended, Rogers -- defending himself this time -- 
approached the witness box. He asked softly: "You don't think I'm crazy, do 
you, honey?" 
</P>
<P>
 Adela burst into tears and the complaint was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Rogers was in and out of hospitals until he was found dead in 1922 
at age 51 in his room at the New Broadway Hotel on Bunker Hill between 1st 
Street and Temple -- a block from the courthouse. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

D-DAY EVENTS BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sunday benefit concert spotlighting the work of the USO kicked off a round 
of ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-Day, the invasion of 
Normandy during World War II. More events were scheduled for today, Memorial 
Day, including the closure of Wilshire Boulevard for an hour while a short 
segment of the street is renamed. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, which celebrated the USO tours during the World War II era, was 
held at the Wadsworth Theater on the grounds of the West Los Angeles Veterans 
Administration Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical center is also the locale for a 12:30 p.m. ceremony today, during 
which a portion of Wilshire between Veteran and Federal avenues will get the 
honorary moniker "Veterans Parkway." 
</P>
<P>
 Guest speaker at the event will be Gen. Paul X. Kelley, former commandant of 
the United States Marine Corps. Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a display of World War II equipment and a 10-plane flyover 
of World War II-era aircraft. The movie "The Longest Day" will be shown for 
free in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 All the programs are sponsored by the Veterans Park Preserve. 
</P>

 Sue Young, a spokeswoman for the group, said the ceremonies are intended as a 
first step in beautifying the 445-acre VA site, which straddles the San Diego 
Freeway. Other proposals for the hospital grounds include a botanical garden 
and a national cemetery, she said.

JAZZ NOW ABOUT OUT OF TIME; NBA PLAYOFFS: ERROR BY TIMEKEEPER ADDS 10 SECONDS 
TO THE GAME, BUT ROCKETS ESCAPE WITH AN 80-78 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you thought only God could make a miracle, welcome to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 The globe did not stop spinning, the mountains didn't slide into the seas, but 
time stood still in the Delta Center Sunday when the Utah Jazz's clock operator 
gave the home team 10 extra seconds to try to tie the score at the end of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the Jazz didn't score in their extended possession or they might 
have required the commissioner, top NBC executives and the National Guard to 
sort things out. The Houston Rockets won, 80-78, and took a 3-1 lead in the 
Western finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long 13 seconds, I know that," said Utah's Tom Chambers, who missed 
his team's last shot. "We were just talking in the shower that it seemed like a 
long 13 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they should make him the new timekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The last play was supposed to take 13.5 seconds. Replays showed it took 24. 
</P>
<P>
 It started when John Stockton, who had just hit a three-pointer, drew an 
offensive foul on the ensuing inbounds play against the Rockets' Sam Cassell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan set up his blue plate special, a pick-and-roll with 
Karl Malone, but then things got weird. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz threw the ball in . . . but the clock didn't start. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator was Wayne Hicken, who has held the post since the Jazz arrived in 
1979 and who also works University of Utah games. Timekeepers have been accused 
of shaving a second or two but rarely 10 of them. Hicken either had delusions 
of grandeur, hit the wrong button, missed the right button or, most likely, 
just forgot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason he started the clock," a Jazz official said, "was the 
scorekeeper yelled at him, 'Start the damn clock!' "  
</P>
<P>
 "I got caught up in the game," Hicken told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back on the floor . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz ran their pick-and-roll. Jeff Hornacek dropped the ball off to 
Malone, but "The Mailman" was 15 feet out and covered. He swung the ball to Jay 
Humphries, spotted up at the three-point line on the other side of the floor. 
Humphries started to shoot but changed it to a pass to Chambers on the 
baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers tried to turn into the lane but lost control of the ball on the way 
up and wound up batting it at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a nice little five-footer," Chambers said, "and they fouled the . . . 
out of me, to put it bluntly." 
</P>
<P>
 The rebound rolled into the far corner. Houston's Robert Horry dove on it and 
several players dove on him. Horry managed to get the ball out of the pile, the 
Rockets got it to the other end of the floor, dribbled it a few seconds and, 
finally, the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on the Rockets bench. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching it right from the start," Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. 
"I couldn't believe it. I'm looking up there thinking, 'Maybe that's not the 
real clock. Maybe that one on top of the basket is just stuck.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets led throughout the game as Kenny Smith, who had 27 points in Game 
1 and only 10 shots in Games 2 and 3 combined, scored 25. 
</P>
<P>
 This was fortunate for the Rockets, since the Jazz' bumper-car defense had 
pushed Hakeem Olajuwon out of the lane. Reduced to shooting jump shots, 
Olajuwon missed 12 of his 18 and scored 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets led, 75-68, with 3:58 left, when they got careless. 
</P>
<P>
 They turned the ball over six times in the last 3:41. Some were nice plays by 
the defense and some were mistakes, as when Vernon Maxwell tried a two-on-one 
break that missed with 30 seconds left and Houston leading, 79-74, rather than 
pull the ball out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't express the terrible feeling I have," Tomjanovich said. "We work on 
those things." 
</P>
<P>
 With 13.5 seconds left, Stockton hit a three-pointer, cutting it to 80-78, 
then drew the foul on Cassell. What happened next was the stuff of legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomjanovich was asked if he had ever gotten an explanation from the referees. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said. "I just got out of Dodge, happy to get a W."

WITH HELP FROM ANGELS, BLUE JAYS BACK ON THE RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two World Series championship banners hang triumphantly above the center 
field scoreboard. The trophies sit in the office lobby. The championship rings 
grace the players' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toronto Blue Jays have been the class of all of baseball, averaging 91 
victories a season the last 11 years, winning five division titles, and 
back-to-back World Series championships. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the significance of their 5-0 victory Sunday over the Angels 
absolutely defies the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 They finally became a .500 team again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays, featuring a lineup that is usually found at All-Star games, are 
in fourth place in the American League East with a 24-24 record, nine games 
behind the New York Yankees before the start of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks in these parts are having difficulty enough coping with their hockey 
team being eliminated from the Stanley Cup, but to realize that the Angels 
might have a better shot of being in the playoffs than the Blue Jays, well, 
that's too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been frustrating," Blue Jay right fielder Joe Carter said. "We know 
we're too good of a team to be playing this way. No one's panicking, I mean 
it's still May, but I think everyone in here realizes that we've got to get our 
act together pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Blue Jay hitting coach Larry Hisle: "I don't think anyone on our team 
believes the race is over, but nobody's comfortable, either. We know we're 
better than this. And we know there are teams in our division that aren't as 
good as this. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's got to start changing pretty quick before things get out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Blue Jays are to get back in the race, it's going to require more 
pitching performances such as Todd Stottlemyre's on Sunday. Stottlemyre, who 
opened the season in the bullpen, pitched a four-hit shutout for his fourth 
victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we (the pitching staff) have all been sick and tired of being blamed 
for everything," said Stottlemyre, who didn't allow an Angel past second base. 
"If all the fingers were pointed at you, you'd be sick and tired of it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays' pitching staff is ninth in the league in earned-run average at 
5.14. Pat Hentgen is the only starter with an ERA of less than 4.50. And 
Toronto sorely misses closer Duane Ward, who, according to General Manager Pat 
Gillick, could miss the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this will get the monkey off the pitching staff's back," Carter said. 
"This was big weekend for us. We not only won two in a row, but we beat (Mark) 
Langston and (Chuck) Finley in back-to-back games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept hearing how we couldn't beat lefties, well, to beat those guys is a 
pretty big accomplishment for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Finley: "I'm sure after they lost Friday, they thought, 'Oh God, we've 
got Langston and Finley in next.' But hey, you look at that lineup, and there's 
one All-Star after another." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto defeated Finley, but the Angels' defense did as much damage as the 
Blue Jays' bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley (4-4) pitched a five-hitter, but three balls were botched by third 
baseman Damion Easley, and second baseman Harold Reynolds' error cost Finley 
two other runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the scoreboard in the sixth inning," Finley said. "I gave up 
three hits. Stottlemyre gave up four hits. And he was the one who had a 3-0 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Blue Jays were putting on a fielding clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Alomar, who hit a two-run homer in the first inning, robbed Bo Jackson 
of a single in the fourth. Alomar made an over-the-shoulder catch in shallow 
right field against Dwight Smith that saved a run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 And center fielder Devon White made a basket catch against the fence off Gary 
DiSarcina's fly ball in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best infielder I've ever seen," DiSarcina said of Alomar. "He can 
beat you in so many ways. He's just a cut above the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 And White? 
</P>
<P>
 "There ain't nothing that Devo can't catch," Finley said. "You hit the ball to 
any part of center field, and it's an out." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, with the Blue Jays this far out of first place for the first time since 
1989, and with the Yankees playing almost .700 baseball, could Toronto's reign 
be over? 
</P>
<P>
 "You kidding me?" DiSarcina said. "To me, they're still the best. They'll rise 
to the top before the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "After what I saw today, there's no reason to think they won't be back in the 
World Series again."

DREIFORT SHOWS PIRATES HE ISN'T MERELY HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort spoiled what might have been a good weekend for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie Dodger pitcher beat the Pirates with his bat Friday night, then 
came back Sunday to stop them with his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, cheered on by most of the 44,622 Dodger Stadium fans, retired the 
last two Pirates with two runners on in the ninth inning to save a 4-3 victory 
for Kevin Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, the 12th in the last 15 home games, enabled the Dodgers to stay 
three games ahead of the San Francisco Giants in the Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers hit well, play solid defense, have a deep bench and the starting 
pitchers are going very well. 
</P>
<P>
 But, oh, that bullpen. Manager Tom Lasorda is trying to save games with a 
committee. Most of his relief pitchers seem able to get the first man out, then 
hardly anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Dreifort came on to strike out Jay Bell and get Andy Van Slyke on an 
easy grounder to short, Lasorda tried three other relievers. And the one 
expected to be the closer, Todd Worrell, was the one who put the potential 
tying and go-ahead runs on base in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to come through when needed," Dreifort said, adding with a smile, 
"It was more exciting winning it with a hit." 
</P>
<P>
 But because the youngster earned his sixth save doesn't mean the Dodgers are 
giving up on Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still our closer," said pitching coach Ron Perranoski. "We're not paying 
him $3 million for nothing. I think he just needs a little more work." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Hernandez, whose two-run single in the third inning gave Gross a 4-0 
lead, said of Worrell: 
</P>
<P>
 "He was throwing hard. He just needs better location. He'll be all right. But 
I think the Pirates are in awe of Dreifort. I don't blame them. I faced him in 
the spring and he broke the bat off in my hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, as most of the starters have, pitched a strong six innings on a hot 
afternoon. He gave up a run in the seventh, then had two runners on with two 
out and Lasorda began his bullpen parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Al Osuna, who struck out the only batter he faced Friday night to 
get the victory, struck out pinch-hitter Brian Hunter to end the seventh. But 
in the eighth, he gave up three hits, two runs and left with a one-run lead and 
two out. Jim Gott came on to get Don Slaught for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 With a one-run lead in the ninth, it's time to bring in the closer. Worrell, 
who couldn't hold the lead Friday night, got the first batter, then gave up a 
hit and a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Ronnie (Perranoski) if Worrell didn't get the next guy (Carlos Garcia, 
who walked) to bring in Dreifort," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, barely batting .200 when the Pirates arrived, already had seven hits in 
the series. But, according to Hernandez, when he saw Dreifort come out, he 
said, "Wow!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda believes his bench is as good as any in baseball. He is getting the 
most out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we had to shore up the bench," Lasorda said. "I think we've done a 
good job of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Key bench players have been Hernandez, who was playing three games in a row 
for the first time all year because of the injury to Mike Piazza, and Mitch 
Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster was in the lineup partly to give Brett Butler a day off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never have hit Zane Smith and I'm in a bit of a slump," Butler said. "To 
win, we need 25 players. Mitch is hot, and I told Tommy to play him. It was a 
good idea, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster had two hits against Smith (4-5), including the lead-off hit that 
started the three-run rally in the third.

GOLF ROUNDUP; STORM FORCES EXTRA DAY IN COLONIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Simpson held a one-stroke lead Sunday when the approach of a 
thunderstorm forced an overnight suspension of play in the Southwestern Bell 
Colonial at Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament is scheduled to be concluded today -- the first time a PGA Tour 
event has gone to an extra day since a playoff in the 1991 Doral Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson had seven holes to play and his closest pursuers, Hale Irwin and Nick 
Price, five each when play was halted at 6:17 p.m. CDT because of an 
approaching thunderstorm. The day's play was declared over 38 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who set a 54-hole scoring record in taking a four-stroke lead, was 14 
under for the tournament. Irwin was 13 under, Price 12 under. 
</P>
<P>
 Final-round play was delayed 2 hours 31 minutes Sunday morning, long before 
the leaders' tee times. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At Malvern, Pa., Lee Trevino shot a two-under 68 on one of the most difficult 
golf courses on the Senior Tour to win the Bell Atlantic Classic for the second 
time in three years. Trevino finished at four-under 206 for a two-shot victory 
over Mike Hill. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At Corning, N.Y., Beth Daniel made a remarkable birdie on the final hole to 
win the LPGA Corning Classic by one shot over third-round leader Nancy 
Ramsbottom and Stephanie Farwig. Daniel drove left on the 18th hole, then had 
to skim a four-iron along the ground to the green from about 100 yards out. She 
sank a 12-foot putt for a round of three-under 69 and a 10-under total of 278 
at the Corning Country Club. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At Frisco, Tex., Patty Sheehan became the biggest single-event money-winner in 
women's golf history, collecting $285,000 over the two days of the LPGA JC 
Penney Skins Game. Sheehan won five skins and $145,000 in the final nine holes 
after capturing six skins and $140,000 Saturday.

FRENCH OPEN; RENEWED CONFIDENCE HELPING PIERCE REGAIN WINNING FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Mary Pierce, last year's personal problems seem to be in her past, and it 
is showing at the French Open, where she advanced to the quarterfinals at 
Roland Garros Stadium with another convincing victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce gave up two games -- her most in four matches -- in beating Amanda 
Coetzer of South Africa, 6-1, 6-1, and sees no reason for her rhythm to be 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" she asked. "I'm playing very well at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 The same could not be said of top-ranked Steffi Graf, who looked a bit ragged 
during the tournament's first week. But that changed Sunday when she routed 
Irina Spirlea of Romania, 6-0, 6-1, in 40 minutes. Spirlea, who upset No. 10 
Mary Joe Fernandez in the third round, was expected to be another stiff test 
for Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was apparent from the beginning it would not turn out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I went on the court, I wanted to see how she would do," Spirlea said. 
"Then after the first and second games, I said, 'Uh, oh!' " 
</P>
<P>
 So far, all of Pierce's opponents have had that feeling. She will play No. 99 
Petra Ritter of Austria in the quarterfinals, and could face Graf in a highly 
anticipated semifinal matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking lean and powerful, Pierce, ranked 12th, says she is enjoying her game 
despite all the controversy that has surrounded her. Pierce had been something 
of a pariah on the tour because of her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Pierce, Mary's former trainer and coach, was so disruptive during her 
matches he eventually was banned from tournaments. Then, last year, Pierce 
filed a restraining order to keep him from bothering her. Although she said 
they have improved their relationship, Pierce no longer is coached by her 
father, and he no longer can be heard yelling from the stands at her matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce credits her new coach, Nick Bolletieri, with instilling a new 
confidence in her game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was very difficult for me," she said. "I made a big decision in my 
life and I don't regret anything that I did." 
</P>
<P>
 She is not regretting anything she has done on the courts at Roland Garros, 
where her serves and returns have been crisp. Pierce said she is playing her 
best tennis, which started last year at the Virginia Slims championships in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Once considered a tier below the tour elite, Pierce believes she is ready to 
break through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first time I have been feeling that way every day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coetzer is not convinced, despite the defeat. She recalled Pierce's past 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute someone starts forcing her, we'll see how well she really is 
playing," Coetzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf was pressured in the second and third rounds, but, as usual, found a way 
to victory. But when she met Spirlea, 20, Graf's game seemed to improve. It 
took the 5-foot-9, 150-pound Romanian 28 minutes to win a game as she had no 
answer for Graf's devastating forehands. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirlea let volley after volley bounce past her without attempting a return. 
Graf seemed to be making a point on Court A as the tournament reached its 
halfway juncture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the three matches I've had, I didn't look very well," she said. "I 
didn't play patiently like you have to on clay." 
</P>
<P>
 The day's only upset came when Julie Halard of France defeated No. 7 Natalia 
Zvereva of Belarus, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5, a day after she eliminated No. 9 Lindsay 
Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was close, Zvereva was unable to hit openings to slow down the No. 
25 Halard. 
</P>
<P>
 "My game is more complete, so I can pressure my opponent better," Halard said. 
"My backhand shot down the line is something new." 
</P>
<P>
 Halard's third consecutive seeded opponent will be difficult, though. Halard 
will play No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the quarterfinals after the Spaniard 
routed No. 11 Anke Huber, 6-2, 6-2. Sanchez Vicario has quietly made a strong 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Stafford of Gainesville, Fla., the lone U.S. women to reach the fourth 
round, was defeated by No. 16 Sabine Hack of Germany, 6-4, 6-2. Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Luke and Murphy Jensen, the defending doubles champions, lost to Todd 
Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde of Australia, 6-1, 6-2. . . . Olivier Delaitre 
believes Jim Courier is less confident than in the past three years when he 
reached the French Open final. "Sometimes he plays his points too quickly," 
Delaitre said. Courier agreed. "Sometimes, I am doing that," he said. "I'm 
getting older. I feel old."

 Pete Sampras has a 10-2 record against his long-time rival Jim Courier, but 
they have never met on clay. 
</P>
<P>
 That will change Tuesday when two of the United States' best players will meet 
in the quarterfinals of the French Open in a match that is expected to breathe 
new life into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Sampras and No. 7 Courier overcame tough fourth-round matches 
Sunday to set up the match many in Paris have been waiting to see. The two met 
in the Australian Open semifinals in January, with Sampras winning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other quarterfinal of the top-half of the men's bracket, No. 4 Andrei 
Medvedev of the Ukraine will play No. 6 Sergi Bruguera of Spain, last year's 
champion. Bruguera has four consecutive straight-set victories after defeating 
Patrick Rafter of Australia, 6-4, 6-3, 6-1. Medvedev ousted Jacco Eltingh of 
the Netherlands, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras had to fend off qualifier Mikael Tillstroem of Sweden, 6-4, 6-4, 1-6, 
6-4, in a match that could easily have gone five sets. Moments earlier on 
Center Court, Courier escaped with a 6-1, 6-7 (9-7), 6-1, 7-6 (8-6) victory 
over French favorite Olivier Delaitre. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras had to break Tillstroem in the fourth set to serve for the match. But 
the Swede did not give in easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing the No. 1," Tillstroem said. "I had nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Tillstroem, who had never played in a Grand Slam tournament, said his only 
goal was to not lose in an hour. If not for a few missed opportunities, the 
match could have continued late into the evening instead of ending after 3 
hours 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised by him," Sampras said. "He showed a lot of determination. I 
can't play that way against Courier." 
</P>
<P>
 But Courier also will have to improve if he hopes to get past his old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-time winner at Roland Garros Stadium, Courier has not been on top of his 
game, and it showed against Delaitre. He was lucky to end it in four sets after 
trailing, 5-1, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Delaitre has a weak serve, so he was not surprised when Courier broke him to 
begin the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 But after breaking Delaitre to take a 6-5 lead, the Frenchman broke back to 
force a tiebreaker. Delaitre stopped one match point in the tiebreaker, but on 
the second one Courier made a nice cross shot at the net to end it. ELLIOTT

 On May 21, President Clinton played golf early in the morning at Riviera 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, of course, accompanied by the usual entourage of Secret Service 
agents. The agents were wearing capes even though it was a warm day. 
</P>
<P>
 Track and field promoter Al Franken, a Riviera member, asked an agent why he 
was wearing a cape.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have weapons," the agent replied. 
</P>
<P>
 It's presumed he wasn't talking about a three-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Clinton: The President lost his wedge on the front nine, but it was found 
and returned to him later. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the Secret Service didn't find it.

 No Showtime: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe isn't impressed with the New 
York Knicks: "It's almost painful to watch Pat Riley coach these players. Riley 
in his former life was in charge of some of the most gifted basketball players 
of all time.

 "He had Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Byron Scott and Norm

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People at Dodger Stadium are saying that Raul Mondesi reminds them of the 
prototype right fielder, Roberto Clemente, so I went to the club level Sunday 
to talk to an authority on the subject. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Mondesi has a lot of the same attributes that Clemente had," Al Campanis 
said. "The kid can hit, throw and run. He's more powerful than Clemente, but 
Roberto was so incredibly quick.". . .  
</P>
<P>
 When Campanis was a Brooklyn Dodger scout in 1953, he conducted a tryout camp 
at Sixto Escobar Park in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Of the 71 players who showed 
up, Clemente was the only one who earned a contract. The 18-year-old kid just 
out of high school hit deliveries from a Triple-A pitcher over the left, center 
and right field fences. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He had more talent than any player that age I had ever seen," said Campanis, 
who was crushed when the Dodgers lost him in the draft the next year to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente had a .317 batting average in 18 seasons before dying in an airplane 
crash on the last day of 1972, but might have been best known for his throwing 
arm. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente's season high for assists was 27 in 1961. Not even one-third of the 
way through his rookie year with the Dodgers, Mondesi has 11 assists. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Barring injury, Mondesi's going to be a star," said Campanis, echoing what he 
said about Clemente 41 years ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Now let me get this straight. The Atlanta Braves didn't re-sign Otis Nixon 
because they wanted to make Deion Sanders an everyday player and Sunday they 
traded Sanders to the Cincinnati Reds for Roberto Kelly? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That timekeeper at Utah Sunday -- didn't he work the Raider-New York Jet game 
last year at the Coliseum? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing got only four times as many rebounds as points Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Much of my interest in the Indy 500 evaporated when Mario Andretti fell out of 
contention early. Oh well, at least Andretti won the 500 once. Sam Snead never 
won a U.S. Open and Pancho Gonzalez never won a Wimbledon singles title. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's pictures were better than its commentary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When he faces Bien Bien among others in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap 
today, Arcangues will attempt to become the first Breeders' Cup champion 
besides Sunday Silence to win a Grade I race the following year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we have the two best horses in the country in this race, so let them 
carry the same weight and prove who is better," racing secretary Martin Panza 
said after assigning Arcangues and Bien Bien each 124 pounds. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Riddick Bowe-Larry Donald bout July 15 will be the first fight at 
Hollywood Park not involving jockeys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There are two ways to look at Oscar De La Hoya's latest performance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The pessimists say his defense is porous and his chin is weak because he was 
knocked down by Giorgio Campanella in the first round Friday at the MGM Grand. 
A journeyman named Narciso Valenzuela also floored De La Hoya in the first 
round in October. That was a flash knockdown, but this time he was hurt after 
getting clipped on the jaw by a left hook. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The optimists say the 1992 Olympic gold medalist demonstrated poise, 
resiliency, and punching power by climbing off the canvas, keeping his 
aggressive opponent at bay with a jab, and stopping him in the third round. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to lose," De La Hoya said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He also showed a mean streak by landing a four-punch combination while 
Campanella was on the floor near the end of the second round. That brought back 
memories of Rocky Marciano pounding on a fallen Don Cockell one night at Kezar 
Stadium in San Francisco. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The fight I want to see is James Toney-Roy Jones for the super-middleweight 
championship. Promoter Bob Arum is trying to line it up for Oct. 1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jones flashed uncommon hand speed during his second-round knockout of Thomas 
Tate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Ruelas had target practice, scoring 212 bull's-eyes in 533 seconds 
against Mike Evgen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings will pick seventh in the NHL draft. The Hockey News ranks Jason 
Wiemer -- a 6-1, 215-pound left wing in the mold of Cam Neely -- as the 
seventh-best prospect. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 USC's victory in the NCAA men's tennis tournament was its 89th national sports 
championship, the most for any school. . . . 
</P>

 Mary Pierce is proof that father doesn't always know best. . . .

OKLAHOMA STATE DEFEATS FULLERTON ON BENZ'S THREE-RUN HOMER IN NINTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jake Benz hit a three-run homer against Ted Silva in the bottom of the ninth 
inning Sunday night to give Oklahoma State a 13-11 come-from-behind victory 
over Cal State Fullerton in the NCAA Midwest I Regional at Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Benz's homer capped a five-run rally by the Cowboys.

left, driving in both runners, and Scott Doma walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva struck out Roberto Lopez before Benz hit his homer to right to end the 
game.

NCAA SOFTBALL; UCLA RUNS OUT OF GAS AGAINST ARIZONA IN SEMIFINAL, 5-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fatigued from 10 innings of work a day earlier, UCLA ace DeeDee Weiman held 
Arizona to its lowest hit total in the Women's College World Series, but she 
couldn't stop the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by key hits and clutch defensive plays, Arizona beat UCLA, 5-2, Sunday 
in a semifinal game in front of 3,648 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (63-3) will face Cal State Northridge (52-9), a 4-2 winner over 
Oklahoma State, in today's championship game at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will be televised live for the first time in the event's 13-year 
history. It will be shown on ESPN 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiman (21-9), who allowed six hits, three walks and four earned runs, was 
still tired from her two losers' bracket victories over Illinois-Chicago and 
Utah on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pretty tired today after yesterday," Weiman said. "I was really 
struggling with the energy factor. I didn't feel at my best today at all." 
</P>
<P>
 After Arizona scored single runs in the second and third, UCLA tied the game 
in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Odom, who reached on an error, went to second on a sacrifice and 
advanced to third on Janae Deffenbaugh's single, scored the Bruins' first run 
on a bloop single by Ginny Mike, who had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh later scored on Jen Brundage's bases-loaded sacrifice fly to left, 
which fell short of the fence by about three feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 4-2, in the fifth inning, Mike singled with one out. Kelly Howard 
followed by ripping a liner into the right-center field gap. But right fielder 
Andrea Doty made a shoestring grab and then threw out Mike at first for a 
double play, which ended the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things had been going, I pretty much expected her to catch it," 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doty's grab was par for the course, said UCLA Coach Sharron Backus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The score was not indicative of the game. I knew we'd come out battling," 
Backus said. "A few inches here and there and who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's Jenny Dalton capped the scoring by ripping a 2-2 pitch 225 feet, 
over the center field fence for a 5-2 lead.

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's bid to return to the College World Series for the first time in 16 years 
ended Sunday with a 12-10 loss to defending national champion Louisiana State 
in the South Regional at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Schultz struck out first baseman J.P. Roberge with the bases loaded in 
the bottom of the ninth inning to preserve LSU's victory and send the Tigers to 
the College World Series for the seventh time in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU (46-18) had 17 hits against six pitchers. It will be attempting to win its 
third national title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's loss spoiled the performance of Trojan outfielder Jacque Jones, who hit 
three two-run homers. The Trojans, who had 14 hits, finished 41-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if we had been at two different regionals, we both would have been in 
Omaha," said LSU second baseman Todd Walker, an All-American who hit two home 
runs Sunday and was named most valuable player of the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU, which handed USC both of its defeats in the tournament, broke an 8-8 tie 
by scoring four runs in the seventh with the help of an error by USC pitcher 
German Casillas (0-1), a sacrifice fly by Jason Williams and solo home runs by 
Walker and Ryan Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' two-run homer in the eighth pulled USC to within 12-10. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth, Shon Malani reached on an error by Walker with one out, Jones 
singled and Jason Brown reached on a fielder's choice to load the bases. 
Schultz induced Aaron Boone to fly out to shallow right, then struck out 
Roberge. MIDWEST II 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State was eliminated at Wichita, Kan., by a 6-2 loss to Washington, 
the 49ers' second defeat by the Huskies in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington erased a 2-0 deficit with a five-run two-out rally in the fifth 
against starter Michael Hernandez. Ryan Rutz and Joe Trippy had run-scoring 
singles and Rutz scored on a throwing error by Long Beach outfielder Ramon 
Smith before Sean Linville hit a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach pitcher Scott Rivette (14-1) struck out 13 in a 6-3 victory over 
Santa Clara earlier Sunday. OTHER REGIONALS 
</P>
<P>
 John Powell (5-3) struck out 10 and held Notre Dame scoreless through eight 
innings as Auburn topped the Fighting Irish, 8-0, to win the NCAA East Regional 
at Clemson, S.C. Auburn advances to the College World Series for the first time 
in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Atlantic I regional at Miami, Bruce Thompson drove in four runs as 
top-seeded Miami defeated Minnesota, 11-3, to clinch a berth in the 
championship game against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mideast Regional at Knoxville, Tenn., Todd Cady's two-run homer in the 
seventh helped Arizona State beat Tennessee, 10-5. The unbeaten Sun Devils play 
Tennessee again today for the right to advance to Omaha.

 Oklahoma defeated Texas, 15-4, to remain unbeaten in the Central Regional at 
Austin, Tex.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; HERSHISER SAYS FORM RETURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser might not regain the form he had in 1988, when he won about 
every honor a pitcher can earn, but he believes he is getting closer to that 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Hershiser won 23 games, including five shutouts in a row to close out 
the season, then led the Dodgers to victory in the World Series.The fact that 
Hershiser came back at all from the delicate shoulder surgery he had in 1990 is 
amazing. Now, at 35, he is once again the leader of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting closer to the old form all the time," said the pitcher Manager 
Tom Lasorda calls "Bulldog." "I keep getting a little better all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, he broke Don Drysdale's scoreless-innings streak, going 59 innings 
without giving up a run. Then, he went 1-0 in the championship series and was 
2-0 in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes a 3-1 record and an earned-run average of 2.50 into tonight's game 
against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Delino DeShields on the disabled list and catcher Mike Piazza still 
battered and bruised from a collision at the plate, the Dodgers are hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we're fortunate to still be in first place," Lasorda said. "Delino 
seemed just ready to break out." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza probably will return tonight. He warmed up the pitcher between innings 
Sunday and appeared to have no trouble throwing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Dodger Alejandro Pena, on the disabled list all of last season, is 
making a comeback. He looked sharp in two innings for Pittsburgh on Sunday, 
striking out four and giving up one hit. DAN HAFNER

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FINLEY SAYS TEAM WAS FLAT IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel starter Chuck Finley, whose teammates seemed to reserve their worst 
fielding for the days he pitched last season, perhaps should be used to this by 
now. Twenty of the Angels' 80 unearned runs last season occurred during his 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Angels' 5-0 defeat Sunday to the Toronto Blue Jays, Finley 
wasn't bothered by the physical mistakes as much as by the lethargic play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were dead on our feet a little bit," Finley said. "We hadn't 
been that way all year, but I thought we were flat today." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little Finley's teammates could do about Roberto Alomar's two-run 
homer in the first inning and Pat Borders' solo homer in the second, but they 
had a hand in everything else. Third baseman Damion Easley threw the ball away 
on the first play of the game, immediately followed by Alomar's homer. In the 
seventh inning, Easley couldn't pick up Devon White's grounder, which was ruled 
a hit. White then stole second base, and Alomar walked. White stole third. And 
when Alomar attempted to steal second, catcher Jorge Fabregas' throw deflected 
off Harold Reynold's glove into center field, White and Alomar scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to play more solid, consistent defense," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann said, "and we will. The effort was there. The concentration was not."

 Angel designated hitter Chili Davis, who suffered a jammed left wrist while 
breaking up a double play Saturday, was scratched from the lineup. He took the 
first round of batting practice, but after he swung and missed at a high pitch, 
the pain returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate being out of the lineup," said Davis, who is batting a team-high .366. 
"You can't have your fourth hitter out of the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson was moved from left field to designated hitter and Dwight Smith was 
added to the lineup to replace Davis. They were hitless in seven at-bats 
without hitting the ball out of the infield.

 Angel starter John Farrell, who spent his first eight years in the Cleveland 
Indian organization, returns to pitch in Cleveland for the first time since 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The only difference is that he will be pitching at new Jacobs Field instead of 
antiquated Cleveland Stadium. "There's a lot of people who'll always remember 
that stadium," Farrell said. "It wasn't one of the greatest places to play, but 
hey, you were still in the big leagues."

 Lachemann, who was swarmed with congratulatory telephone calls and telegrams 
after he was hired as manager, said few meant more than the one sent by former 
USC coach Rod Dedeaux. "That one was special right there," said Lachemann, who 
played for Dedeaux and also coached with him. "He was some manager. What he 
did, winning five straight championships in baseball, was unbelievable." BOB

 Robin Yount rode off into the right field bullpen on his new Harley-Davidson 
motorcycle after the Milwaukee Brewers retired his No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount, who rode into County Stadium on a motorcycle during a post-World Series 
celebration in 1982, took one victory lap, then drove out of the stadium on the 
motorcycle given to him by the Brewers and Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Co. 
during a ceremony before Milwaukee's game against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Yount, 38, retired in February after 20 seasons in the major leagues, all in 
Milwaukee.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; PHILLIES' WEST NEEDED PIT STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The needle was pointing toward empty, so Philadelphia Phillies pitcher David 
West didn't complain when Manager Jim Fregosi pulled him after six innings with 
a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have if I could have, but I was getting a little low in the tank," 
West said. "If they sent me out there, I would have kept going, but he probably 
made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Heathcliff Slocumb continued the combined no-hitter into the ninth before 
giving up a clean leadoff single to Houston's Steve Finley. The Astros got two 
more singles and scored twice in the ninth but still lost, 4-2, Sunday at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi said there was no question in his mind that he would remove West, a 
converted reliever who already had thrown 102 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got to 100 pitches and that's as far as he was going to go," he said. "He 
got us through six innings and that's all we could ask." 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros' Doug Drabek (7-2) lost in his bid for a career-best eight-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Williams, who has predicted he will be released by the Astros this week, 
pitched the eighth against his former team. He gave up Philadelphia's fourth 
run on a leadoff walk and Milt Thompson's two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
 West, whose fastball had dropped from 92 m.p.h. to 87 by the sixth inning, was 
just glad to have a good outing. He was 0-4 as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved out of the bullpen because of injuries to three Phillie starters. 
"Originally we planned to start him only one time," Fregosi said. "Now he'll 
stay in the rotation." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Atlanta 2 -- Sammy Sosa hit Tom Glavine's first pitch of the game 
for a home run and last-minute starter Jim Bullinger gave the Cubs six strong 
innings at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves, who just before the game announced the trade of outfielder Deion 
Sanders to Cincinnati for outfielder Roberto Kelly, lost four of six games on 
the home stand and are 12-11 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs, who have won 10 of their last 12, also took advantage of Glavine's 
four walks in the first inning to score two more runs after Sosa's 11th homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullinger (3-0), making his second start and 16th appearance of the year, was 
given the start when scheduled starter Jose Guzman was scratched due to 
stiffness in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullinger gave up only two hits and struck out four before making way for 
reliever Dave Otto after giving up his first walk to Tony Tarasco leading off 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 8, Cincinnati 5 -- Bobby Bonilla set a team record by driving in a 
run in his ninth consecutive game, and the Mets beat the Reds at New York for a 
three-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds lost for the eighth time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla, who drove in two runs, broke the Mets' mark of eight consecutive 
games with an RBI set by Keith Hernandez in 1986 and matched by Jeff Kent 
earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla had RBI singles in the first and fourth innings, extending his hitting 
streak to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 3, Florida 1 -- Matt Williams doubled home the go-ahead run with 
two out in the eighth inning at San Francisco. The Giants added a second run in 
the inning on Willie McGee's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jackson (3-1) got two outs in relief of Bryan Hickerson for the win. Rod 
Beck got three outs for his 11th save.  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 7, St. Louis 2 -- Joey Hamilton won his second consecutive start 
since being called up from the minors as the Padres swept the Cardinals at San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals, who have lost nine in a row at San Diego since July 8, 1992, 
were swept in a three-game series for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton (2-0), whose contract was purchased Tuesday from triple-A Las Vegas, 
gave up one run on six hits in six innings. Jeff Tabaka went 1 1/3 innings for 
his first major league save. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, Colorado 3 -- Larry Walker homered on Bruce Ruffin's first pitch 
in the 10th inning to give the Expos a victory at Montreal.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MORRIS STRUGGLES, STILL KEEPS INDIANS ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attitude was vintage Jack Morris, regardless of how the box score looked. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by four home runs, Morris won his third consecutive decision as the 
Cleveland Indians defeated the Oakland Athletics, 7-5, Sunday for their ninth 
consecutive home victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The streak is the Indians' best at home since they won 13 in a row at 
Cleveland Stadium in 1965. The current streak was interrupted by a 2-4 trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack struggled," Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove said. "He fought himself all 
day. He gave us five innings on pure guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris (4-4) gave up four runs -- one of them unearned -- and seven hits in 
five innings, striking out four and walking three. He also threw two wild 
pitches and made a throwing error that gave Oakland a 4-3 lead in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he improved to 3-1 with a 2.72 earned-run average in his last five 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Paul Shuey, Cleveland's fourth pitcher, gave up Brent Gates' 
run-scoring double in the ninth but held on for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris left the clubhouse before reporters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland, swept in a series for the 10th time this year, has lost four in a row 
and 31 of its last 37 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 10, New York 6 -- Vince Coleman tripled twice, singled twice and 
drove in three runs at Kansas City as the Royals stopped the Yankees' four-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman tied a team record for triples in a game. He has 10 hits in his last 
23 at-bats after a three-for-25 slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire Dave Phillips, who sustained a mild concussion Saturday night when he 
was hit in the head by Jim Leyritz's bat on the backswing, missed the game. A 
crew of three umpires was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gubicza (3-4) ended his six-game losing streak against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 8, Chicago 4 -- Sid Fernandez held the White Sox to five hits -- 
including Frank Thomas' 20th homer -- in seven-plus innings at Chicago and the 
Orioles stopped the White Sox's winning streak at seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez (3-2) gave up three hits over seven innings before yielding a 
leadoff single to Ozzie Guillen in the eighth and a home run to Tim Raines, his 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who has homered in five consecutive games, homered with one out in the 
fourth to reach 20 homers faster than any White Sox player in history. Dick 
Allen hit his 20th home run in his 75th game in 1974. Thomas, batting .468 in 
May, hit No. 20 in his 46th game. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 8, Boston 6 -- Dean Palmer hit a three-run homer and Ivan Rodriguez 
homered two pitches later, highlighting the Rangers' five-run rally with two 
out in the fifth inning at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Gonzalez of Texas and Mike Greenwell of Boston were injured on the same 
play in the third inning. Gonzalez hurt his right knee fielding a double by 
Greenwell, who hurt his hip running to second. Both players soon left the game, 
although neither injury was serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 9, Seattle 8 -- Greg Vaughn hit a 415-foot, two-run homer in the 
four-run sixth as the Brewers rallied from a seven-run deficit at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee swept the three-game series after losing a club-record 14 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle, which had gotten six runs with two outs off Teddy Higuera in the 
first inning and led, 7-0, in the second, lost for the 20th time in 25 road 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, Minnesota 1 -- Bill Gullickson gave up one run in seven innings at 
Minneapolis as the Tigers held an opponent to less than two runs for the first 
time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullickson (3-4), who had compiled a 9.82 ERA in losing his previous three 
starts, gave up eight hits. He entered the game having given up 79 hits in 50 
1/3 innings.

 Only 19 days before the World Cup opener, defending champion Germany was 
shocked, 2-0, by Ireland on Sunday at Hanover, the German's first loss at home 
in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cascarino and Gary Kelly scored for Ireland, which beat Germany for the 
first time in 34 years. Germany hadn't lost at home since June 21, 1988, when 
the Netherlands won, 2-1, at Hamburg in the semifinals of the European 
Championship. 
</P>

 It was the third consecutive victory over a World Cup team for Ireland, a 1990 
quarterfinalist that was coming off 1-0 victories over the Netherlands and 
Bolivia.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; JOHN ANDRETTI DRIVES 820 MILES FOR 'DOUBLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Andretti held up fine Sunday in his quest to become the first driver to 
complete an 1,100-mile racing adventure. His cars didn't do as well. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing 490 of a possible 500 miles for a 10th-place finish at the 
Indianapolis 500, Andretti caught a plane to compete in the Coca-Cola 600 at 
Concord, N.C. A broken crankshaft ended his day on lap 220, after 330 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, he drove 820 miles. A good day for the common motorist, but far short 
of what Andretti had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it was worth it," Andretti said to reporters in front of the 
tractor-trailer that was to take his Chevrolet back to the team's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that it was worth it. We didn't run as good as I wanted 
to down here, and we didn't run as good at Indy as I would have hoped. But it's 
not from a lack of effort from my guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, I'm fine," he said. "Mentally, you want more. You want to run 
better. You want to be more up front." 
</P>
<P>
 After completing his run at Indy, Andretti caught a helicopter from the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway that took him to a chartered jet for Concord. 
Throughout the trip, he received fluids intravenously to keep him hydrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Concord, he took a helicopter to the track and landed moments after 
the rest of the field had been introduced to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not tired at all," said Andretti, who started 10th and moved up to as 
high as third during the Indy 500. "I'm disappointed, but we'll get over that. 
. . . I knew the car was going to run all day. At the beginning, we had a 
pretty good race car, but we couldn't get it straightened out to go fast all 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti blamed his problems at Indianapolis on a slick track that hurt the 
car's handling. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gordon got his first Winston Cup victory, tricking the sport's veterans 
on a late-race pit stop and pulling away to win the Coca-Cola 600. 
</P>
<P>
 While all of the leaders pitted for four tires and fuel with about 20 laps 
left, the 22-year-old Gordon waited to see what they did, then came in for only 
two tires and fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The gamble paid off, moving him from third to first, and he easily kept his 
Chevrolet Lumina up front the rest of the way at Charlotte Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, the 1993 Winston Cup rookie of the year and the pole-sitter for the 
600-mile event, the longest on the circuit, finished 3.91 seconds ahead of 
Rusty Wallace. Wallace, who led seven times for 187 laps, was trying to give 
car owner Roger Penske a unique Memorial Day double. Penske's car driven by Al 
Unser Jr. won the Indianapolis 500 earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Bodine was third, followed by Dale Jarrett and 1994 Winston Cup points 
leader Ernie Irvan.

hour 36 minutes 14.374 seconds for the 65 laps of the 2.95-mile course, a total 
of 191.727 miles.

<P>
 Twining remained undefeated in five starts with a 7 1/2-length victory over 
stablemate Lahint in the Grade II Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not nominated for the Triple Crown series, Twining is not eligible for the 
Belmont Stakes on June 11 and will have to wait until later to challenge the 
rest of the year's top 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Twining, carrying 122 pounds and ridden by Jose Santos, stalked the pace 
before taking command in the upper stretch. He ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:49. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scotty Schulhofer-trained colt, a son of Forty Niner, earned $90,000 from 
the total purse of $150,000 for owners Mohammed al Maktoum, Helen C. Alexander 
and Helen K. Groves. 
</P>
<P>
 Twining and Lahint returned $2.40 and $2.10. There was no show wagering.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY: SMITH'S SUCCESS HAS A FLIP SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Smith, who has become one of the world's most accomplished track coaches, 
is a victim of his own success. After one of his 1992 Olympic gold medalists, 
quarter-miler Quincy Watts, left before the start of this outdoor season, the 
other, 400-meter intermediate hurdler Kevin Young, soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both complained that Smith has attracted so many outstanding athletes to the 
track at Westwood that he no longer has time to give them the individual 
attention he once did. 
</P>
<P>
 Separating was particularly painful for Young because he and Smith had been a 
team since the hurdler first began to realize his potential six years ago at 
UCLA, where Smith is an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the closeness I had with Coach Smith as a collegiate athlete wasn't there 
any more," Young said last week. "He has a great number of elite athletes out 
there now. I tend to want to be more isolated. I want a closer connection to my 
coach." 
</P>

 One of Smith's new international stars, France's Marie-Jose Perec, did not shy 
away from competition at the recent New York Games. The 1992 Olympic gold 
medalist in the 400 meters chose that meet for her U.S. debut because she 
wanted to test herself against U.S. quarter-milers Jearl Miles and Natasha 
Kaiser-Brown. While Perec was concentrating on the 200, they were finishing 
one-two in the 400 in last summer's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy to compete against them because I wanted to show that I am 
the best," said Perec, who did that by winning in 50.59 seconds. Miles was 
second in 50.68, and Kaiser-Brown was third in 51.01.

 After setting an American record with a long jump of 24-feet-7 in the New York 
Games, Joyner-Kersee said she had dedicated the performance to her namesake, 
the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her strength was exemplary," Joyner-Kersee said. "If there's anything I want, 
it's the strength to be able to endure like she did, to be a classy lady like

 Responding to an article by Ian Thomsen in the International Herald Tribune 
that questioned Atlanta's ability to organize an Olympics as gracefully as 
Barcelona and Lillehammer did, the Atlanta Journal Constitution criticized the 
foreign press for its "pedantic arrogance" that borders on "outright hostility" 
toward the city.

 Atlanta is taking hits from all sides. During a speech in which he discussed 
the organizing committee's financial balancing act, International Olympic 
Committee executive board member Richard Pound caused a furor by describing the 
decision to award Atlanta the Games as a "dreadful mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 He later told USA Today that he intended the remark as a joke. Pound, who is 
Canadian, made the speech to a largely Canadian audience at the Canadian 
Embassy in Washington and said he was referring to the fact that one of the 
cities bypassed when the IOC elected Atlanta was Toronto.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess this is what happens when you try to be funny during a speech," Pound 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping he doesn't stop because being funny is one of his special 
talents. In 1988, after the islands of the Seychelles announced a boycott of 
the Summer Olympics in Seoul, Pound said: "The Seychelles? They're only a 
country at low tide."

PENSKE TEAM BENZ, BUT IT DOESN'T BREAK; INDY 500: UNSER JR. WINS FOR THE SECOND 
TIME AFTER TEAMMATE FITTIPALDI CRASHES WITH 15 LAPS TO GO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fears that Roger Penske's new Mercedes-Benz-powered cars would run away with 
the Indianapolis 500 proved well-founded Sunday, but even a powerful engine 
can't overcome smacking the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time champion Emerson Fittipaldi led with 15 laps to go when he cut a 
corner too close and his car slid sideways into the fourth-turn wall. Not to 
worry, the only car on the same lap with him was Al Unser Jr., also in a Penske 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser, who had been a lap down only moments earlier, gave his father, a 
four-time winner who announced his retirement last week, a 55th birthday 
present by winning the 78th 500 in a red and white Penske with the Mercedes 
push-rod engine developed by Ilmor Engineering expressly for Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy for Al and happy for our team and our sponsors, but I'm 
disappointed we didn't finish one-two," Penske said. It was the 10th Indy 
victory for Penske since he first came here in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the ninth victory for the Unser family. His Uncle Bobby won three 
times to go with his dad's four and his own two. Junior also won in 1992 
driving for Rick Galles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Villeneuve, a Canadian rookie who came to Indianapolis with a 
reputation for crashing, drove a patient race to finish second in a 
Reynard-Ford Cosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti finished third, but was penalized a lap for passing under the 
yellow caution flag and was dropped to sixth. This gave third place to former 
winner Bobby Rahal, who was driving a Penske-Ilmor that he leased from Penske 
after his Honda proved too slow. It was the model that Unser, Fittipaldi and 
Paul Tracy would have driven had the Mercedes experiment not been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Vasser was fourth and Robby Gordon fifth, as only 16 of the 33 starters 
were running at the finish after a series of accidents knocked out nine cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti's 29-race Indy 500 career ended in disappointment. A faulty 
pressure valve on the fuel system sidelined him after only 23 laps -- the 
second driver out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 A third Andretti, Mario's nephew John, finished 10th and immediately hopped in 
a helicopter for a jet flight to Charlotte, N.C., to drive in the Coca-Cola 
600. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy finished 23rd, going out on lap 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi's crash was a shocking sight for the more than 350,000 spectators 
as his car slid to a stop in the middle of the track, near the start-finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 On lap 184, Fittipaldi ran too close behind Unser, who was nearly a full lap 
behind, and the turbulence from Unser's car caused Fittipaldi's front end to 
lose its grip on the track. "It was a shame, I had everything under control." 
Fittipaldi said. "The engine did a fantastic job. For sure, we should have 
finished one-two." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser said he almost lost control of his car at the same place, under the same 
circumstances, a lap earlier when he was running behind Fittipaldi in an 
attempt to get back on the same lap with the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was all elbows in the cockpit, yanking it every which way to keep from 
losing it," Unser said. "When his turbulence hit me, it just washed out the 
front end. I was fighting to get back on the same lap with him and he was 
fighting to keep me a lap down." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser was asked if teammates should play turbulence tag late in a race. "Emmo 
and Paul (Tracy) and I are teammates who work very hard together to get our 
cars as perfectly tuned as possible, but once the green flag drops, it's every 
man for himself," he said. "Emmo was just as much the enemy as any other driver 
when the racing started." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser, the pole-sitter with a qualifying speed of 228.011 m.p.h., took the 
lead as the field raced toward the first turn. It was the seventh time an Unser 
had led the first lap at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Fittipaldi took turns leading except for a couple of times when 
Villeneuve took over when the Penske cars were in the pits. Penske cars led 193 
of the 200 laps, one more than in 1988 when Rick Mears finished first, Al Unser 
Sr. third and Danny Sullivan also led 91 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominance of the Ilmor-designed and built Mercedes engines became apparent 
before the race was half over. By lap 75, Fittipaldi and Unser had lapped every 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five accidents, which brought out yellow flags and bunched up the field 
behind the leader, kept the Penske pair from lapping everyone again. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Guerrero, the hard-luck kid of Indy racing, was the first casualty. 
Guerrero, who lost the 1987 race when his engine stalled on his final pit stop, 
spun across the short chute coming out of the first turn and hit the 
second-turn wall on the 21st lap. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not injured. It was the second time Guerrero finished 33rd in the 500. 
In 1992, as the pole-sitter, he crashed on the parade lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caught me totally by surprise," Guerrero said. "For no reason, the back 
end came around." 
</P>
<P>
 Dominic Dobson and Mike Groff tangled in the first turn on lap 29 and the 
debris from their accident forced Scott Goodyear and rookie Adrian Fernandez 
from the race and sent Lyn St. James to the pits for nearly 30 laps while her 
crew repaired damaged suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was running in a straight line going into turn one when I felt someone hit 
me from behind," Groff said after being released from the infield hospital with 
a swollen left ankle. "Once I was popped, I slid backward into the wall and hit 
pretty hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The day's most bizarre accident occurred after rookie Hideshi Matsuda slid 
into the wall, bringing out a yellow flag on lap 92. Nigel Mansell headed for 
the pits but never got there as another rookie, Dennis Vitolo, somehow got his 
car up on top of the rear end of Mansell's No. 1 Lola. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell, the defending PPG Cup Indy car champion, was livid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently he was packing up, (going too fast), and he braked too late, so 
the next thing he was on top of me," Mansell said. "He probably hit me in 
excess of 100 m.p.h. more than I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell leaped from his cockpit and rolled on the ground as the invisible 
methanol fumes burned around him. After a quick visit to the infield medical 
center, Mansell declined to be hospitalized and flew home to Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't mind being put out of a race by a mistake by yourself, or a problem 
in the pits, but I'm almost in shock being put out under a yellow flag," he 
said. 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: THIS TIME, FITTIPALDI HAS HIS BACK TO WALL 
</P>

<P>
 Imagine that! An Unser winning the Indy 500! 
</P>
<P>
 How's that for stop-the-presses stuff? 
</P>
<P>
 But wait! There's more! How about, "We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a 
special news bulletin fresh off the wires from Indiana. Roger Penske's car won 
the 78th Indy 500." 
</P>
<P>
 If you can recover from that shock, I'll get down to the fine print. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, for most of the day, it wasn't a race, it was a parade. Penske 
cars and Mercedes-Benz engines giving a recital. Those other 31 cars were mere 
scenery. Or the brass section. They kept crashing into walls trying to keep up. 
The Mercedeses, on the other hand, kept turning left. It looked like a 
Secretariat race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Indianapolis is satanic.  
</P>
<P>
 You've heard all the cliches -- Yogi Berra said, "It's never over till it's 
over." Dick Motta said, "It's never over till the fat lady sings." 
</P>
<P>
 Put 'em all together and you have a fix on Indianapolis. It's never over until 
the yellow lights go out. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago this week, they had the 73rd Indy 500, and, as luck would have 
it, two cars came into the main straight only noses apart and a lap or two 
ahead of the competition. In one of them was the wily Brazilian veteran and 
one-time world champion, Emerson Fittipaldi. In the other was an Unser. Emerson 
had locked wheels with some of the registered legends of the racing road. Right 
on his hubcap was -- of all things -- an Unser. You could tell because he was 
leading the race. Unsers usually are. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsers win because they hate to let anybody by them on a track. And Little Al 
Unser was so upset to find Fittipaldi trying to go around him that he edged his 
car down to the cutoff point to put a stop to this. That's when their cars 
collided. 
</P>
<P>
 The Unser for a change got the worst of it. Little Al's car swiveled into the 
wall. Fittipaldi's got through. It was Lap 199 and Fittipaldi continued on to 
the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
 We fast-forward now five years to Sunday afternoon about five minutes before 
2. Once again, Fittipaldi and Little Al are dueling in the late stages of the 
race. They are the only two cars on the lead lap. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Fittipaldi is ahead. He has almost a lap lead on lap 184. 
</P>
<P>
 He had only to coast for 15 laps. With a 31-second edge, he could even afford 
the luxury of a stop for gas and still win. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows what to do in this situation. In golf, you play for the fat 
part of the green. In football, you fall on the ball. In boxing, you clinch. In 
poker, you stand pat. Simply get the thing in the hangar. Don't do anything 
rash. No one knows what the great Fittipaldi thought he had to do. A fighter 
leading on points doesn't throw crazy rights. A football team with a lead and 
the ball doesn't pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi attacked. Somehow, on turn 4, near where five years before he had 
gone in the corners with young Unser and come out with roses, he now ran his 
car down on the apron where the new configuration of Indy has put corrugated 
ridges. His back-end spun. He lost steering. He swerved across the track and 
into that boulevard of broken dreams -- the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 He handed the race to young Unser. Little Al had only to take heed and clinch 
and fall on the ball himself and say "I'll play these" and he could 
rocking-chair his way to his second Indy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? Well, it is the view of young Unser that his teammate (read 
"adversary" in this case) was trying "to bury me." That is, recover the full 
lap lead he had barely lost moments before. Overtake Little Al again. Put a 
full lap between them. "Emmo got in my turbulence. He was trying to put me down 
a lap. But what happened was, his front end wouldn't turn. I know, because the 
same thing almost happened to me a lap before. You see, you do everything in 
your power to put a competitor a lap down. It would have been a final nail in 
my coffin." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi will admit only he made a mistake going so low on the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the facts, the final score of the race will show E. Fittipaldi 
finished 17th. Stats, as usual, lie. He was like a golfer going for a 2 who 
hits it out of bounds and in the water and makes 12. He died with his guns out 
and his lip curled. He had the best car in the race. He simply forgot where he 
was. Indy hates for you to get too cocky. It's always got the wall for guys who 
take liberties with her. He lost what he should have won, but the other 
Mercedes won anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 If you ever get on a riverboat or in a card parlor and you see Roger Penske 
sitting there riffling a deck of cards, get back out of there. Fast. If you 
don't, sure as God made little green apples and it rains in Indianapolis in the 
summertime, you're going to be looking at a lot of straight flushes. Not yours, 
his. If he's got dice, they're his. Don't fade him. Fade, period. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the ninth time an Unser has won this race. But it was the 10th time 
Penske has won. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lore of auto racing, Penske comes into focus as the greatest coach in 
the history of his game, a Knute Rockne of the Brickyard, as it were. Vince 
Lombardi of this automotive Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 When he puts a team on the track, you better get ready to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, when an innovator comes to Indy with a new idea for a power plant, it 
either doesn't work or doesn't last. The rear-engined Fords were the last to 
revolutionize Indy -- and it took them three years. 
</P>
<P>
 So, nobody was unduly alarmed when they heard Mercedes-Benz was getting into 
racing for the first time in more than 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they heard it was Roger Penske calling the plays, they ran to the 
rule book. Sure enough, Roger had found a loophole that allowed him to put a 
motor in a race car that legally could out-boost and out-horsepower the rest of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving this racer's edge to an Unser, a Fittipaldi -- and a Penske -- is like 
giving Nick the Greek a fifth ace, a lion another claw or Germany another army. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bit of overkill. Unsers win races without Penske and Penske wins races 
without Unsers. 
</P>
<P>
 Penskes and Mercedes-Benzes are formidable enough, but a Penske-Mercedes-Unser 
team should be in violation of antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the word "Unser" means "ours" in German. So, "Unser Indianapolis" 
would not necessarily be hyperbolic. But adding Penske should be Roger and out.

WORLD CUP '94: 18 DAYS AND COUNTING; LAID-BACK LEADERSHIP; ARGENTINA COACH 
BASILE WILL STRETCH THE RULES, BUT HE IS UNDECIDED ABOUT THE STATUS OF MARADONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a Hollywood studio were to cast an actor to play Alfio Basile, chances are 
Robert Mitchum's name would come up. 
</P>
<P>
 Basile, 50, is a large, hulking character with wrinkled features and sad, 
penetrating eyes. He is a chain-smoker, an habitue of coffee houses and the 
race track. He has the look of someone you would rather not meet in a dark 
alley. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also Argentina's national soccer team coach. 
</P>
<P>
 His task this summer is nothing short of Herculean. He is expected to emulate 
his immediate predecessors, Cesar Luis Menotti and Carlos Salvador Bilardo, and 
lead an inconsistent and erratic Argentine team to victory in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, things are not going well. Argentina is struggling and Basile has 
stopped speaking to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it is difficult to know whether Basile is angry, concerned or indifferent 
about Argentina's recent run of bad results, including a 3-3 tie with Chile in 
Santiago and a 1-0 loss to Ecuador in Guayaquil in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is equally difficult to know whether he has decided to include a visibly 
out-of-shape Diego Maradona on the World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is impossible to understand -- as the Argentine media have been quick 
to point out -- why Basile appears to be losing control of his players. Two 
examples will suffice: 
</P>
<P>
 When the Japanese government refused to grant Maradona a visa to enter the 
country for the Kirin Cup tournament this month because of his record of drug 
abuse, Argentina's players took a vote among themselves and refused to travel 
to Japan without their captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Basile was not consulted in the decision and apparently neither he nor the 
Argentine soccer federation had the gumption to override the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when Maradona and teammates Gabriel Batistuta and Oscar Ruggeri 
left training camp and attended an all-night party at a discotheque, Basile 
appeared unperturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players are only human," he said. "They have girlfriends or wives. Every one 
of them used their free time as they saw fit after training." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former national team member himself -- albeit only a fringe player who 
saw action in a handful of international matches -- Basile might be a little 
too understanding of his players' impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Bilardo, who coached 
Argentina to its 1986 World Cup triumph in Mexico and to second place four 
years later in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudio Caniggia (who, like Maradona, has served a lengthy suspension from the 
game for cocaine use since the Italia '90 tournament) has played for both 
coaches. During the Copa America, or South American Championship, in Chile in 
1991, he made this comparison between them: 
</P>
<P>
 "Bilardo was a dictator," Caniggia told Eric Weil, an Argentine-based 
journalist covering the tournament for London's World Soccer magazine. "During 
training sessions, he got angry if we put our hands on our waist or looked 
anywhere else. He insisted that we should all be obsessed with soccer, like 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under Basile, we have much more liberty. We can all give our points of view 
and don't have to spend hours watching videos of matches. Basile isn't obsessed 
like Bilardo was." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that Basile has not devoted his life to soccer. On the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Buenos Aires on Nov. 1, 1943, which makes him a genuine "porteo," as 
Argentines call those from the port city, Basile took to the game at an early 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his professional debut with the Racing Club of Avellaneda on Dec. 3, 
1964, and stayed at the club until 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, Racing achieved all that a South American club can achieve 
-- it won the Argentine championship in 1966, followed that up by winning the 
Copa Libertadores, or South American club championship, in 1967 and then won 
the Toyota/Intercontinental Cup for the world club championship that same year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Basile, a defender who was not afraid to foul opponents if that was the 
only way to stop them, the latter competition was what earned him the "thug" 
reputation that he has never been able to completely erase. 
</P>
<P>
 In the deciding game of a three-match series between European champion Glasgow 
Celtic and South American champion Racing, Basile spat at one of the Scottish 
players, sparking a brawl that resulted in five players being red-carded. 
</P>
<P>
 After he retired as a player in 1975, Basile's coaching career involved a 
series of stops at no fewer than eight Argentine clubs of varying ability and 
one Uruguayan club, Nacional of Montevideo. His best achievements were a couple 
of second-place finishes in the Argentine league. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when Bilardo stepped down after the 1990 World Cup, Basile was not high on 
anyone's list as a possible successor. The favorite was Daniel Passarella, 
captain of Argentina's 1978 World Cup-winning team, who had led River Plate to 
the national championship in his first season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Argentine federation, split between the supporters of former coaches 
Menotti and Bilardo, each with different philosophies about how the game should 
be played, reached a compromise, selecting Basile, who had aligned himself with 
neither camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Basile was surprised by the choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, they pick a coach in charge of a successful club -- as was the case 
with Menotti and Bilardo -- and I was out of work at the time," he told Weil. 
</P>
<P>
 Basile's first match in charge came on Feb. 19, 1991, against Hungary in 
Buenos Aires. It resulted in a 2-0 victory and began a remarkable string of 33 
consecutive games without defeat, including 31 full internationals. 
</P>
<P>
 During that streak, Argentina achieved something it had not achieved in 32 
years: It became South American champion in 1991 by winning the Copa America 
tournament in Chile, then successfully defended its title two years later in 
Ecuador. In between, it was victorious in the first Intercontinental Cup in 
Saudi Arabia in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Basile was riding high. How many other national team coaches in the world had 
gone undefeated for two years and won two continental championships? He was 
somebody, his opinion counted, he was able to voice it and people would listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the rules (of soccer) are perfect," he said. "Nothing has to be 
changed. But I would like to see soccer played between teams of 10. It could be 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they send off one or two players, the game usually becomes more open." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Basile, Argentina has, at times, played excellent and entertaining 
soccer, but the closer the World Cup has come, the more into a defensive shell 
the team has crept. It is as if the pressure of 1994 and the thought that he 
might not be able to bring the World Cup back to Buenos Aires has forced Basile 
back into his old habits as a defender. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach and the team have lost a great deal of confidence over the past 
year. It began when Colombia ended the 33-game streak by defeating Argentina, 
2-1, in Baranquilla during World Cup qualifying play. It became a crisis when 
Argentina crashed to an unheard-of 5-0 defeat at home to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very tough blow," Basile said at the time. "I am entirely 
responsible and this was my worst day as a coach. We were beaten by a better 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Paraguay been able to defeat Peru in Lima that same day instead of tying, 
2-2, Argentina would have been eliminated and would not be coming to the United 
States. As it was, Basile's team was forced into a two-game playoff against 
Australia, which it won, 1-1 and 1-0, to become the 24th and final World Cup 
participant. 
</P>
<P>
 It was against the Australians that Basile reorganized his side, bowing to 
public pressure and including Maradona on the team even though the midfielder 
clearly was out of shape. Maradona had not played on the Copa America-winning 
teams or in any of the previous qualifying matches. 
</P>
<P>
 His inclusion against Australia upset the balance of the side and Argentina 
has not looked anywhere near as good as it did in Basile's first two years in 
charge. The coach, praised before, has become the target of fierce criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 This has forced Basile to worry more about losing in the United States than 
about winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have to realize," he said recently, "is that both Brazil and 
Argentina are under enormous pressure. We have the whole weight of our soccer 
history on our shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we win a match, everybody back home rushes into the streets to 
celebrate. It's the result that counts." World Cup Coach Profile

CALCANTE AND CSUN HANG ON; SOFTBALL: LEFT FIELDER BOOSTS NORTHRIDGE INTO WORLD 
SERIES FINAL WITH HOME RUN-STEALING CATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Perhaps Oklahoma State softball Coach Sandy Fischer said it best. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game came down to one pitch and one catch," said Fischer at the postgame 
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Cal State Northridge, the Matadors benefited from both to beat 
Oklahoma State, 4-2, Sunday in a semifinal game of the Women's College World 
Series in front of 2,275 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (52-9) faced elimination after losing to Oklahoma State, 3-2, in 
a 15-inning, four-hour-and-20-minute game earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State (46-12) needed to beat Northridge twice Sunday to advance, but 
a three-run home run by Shannon Jones and a home run-stealing catch by left 
fielder Beth Calcante helped the Matadors advance to today's championship game 
against Arizona at noon PDT. The game will be televised live on ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 22 innings and 6 1/2 hours to determine which team would get the honor 
of facing Arizona (63-3), which beat UCLA, 5-2, in another semifinal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Momentum changed sides all day, but when Calcante stole a two-run home from 
Karie Langelier for the third out in the sixth inning, it stayed with the 
Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have very easily been Oklahoma," Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson 
said. "I think both teams didn't quit at any point in time and that's the kind 
of softball you want at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 With Oklahoma State trailing, 4-2, and Tonia Brown aboard on a single, 
Langelier ripped a shot to left field and Calcante dropped back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying it wouldn't go over," Calcante said. "Then when I went back, my 
butt hit the fence and the ball landed in my mitt." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante fell into the four-foot fence 190 feet from the plate, but held on to 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's reserves bolted out of the dugout and the Matadors had a short 
celebration in left field with Calcante as the guest of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly thought it was gone based on where Calcante started out," Fischer 
said. "But, it was an incredible catch. The outfield play in this tournament 
has just been outstanding. They have been making Barnum and Bailey catches out 
there all week." 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge, Calcante's catch was payback as Oklahoma State left fielder 
Michelle Kelly had robbed Terri Pearson of a two-run home run in the third 
inning of the first game. Northridge scored all the runs it needed in the 
fourth inning of the second game. Jen Fleming led off with a double to center 
field. Calcante followed with a bunt, but the first baseman's throw to first 
was wide and Fleming scored for a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With Calcante and Tamara Ivie, who singled, aboard, Jones ripped the first 
pitch over the left-field fence to give the Matadors a 4-0 lead. The Cowgirls 
scored two runs on three hits in the fifth, but it was all they could muster 
against Amy Windmiller (26-2),

SANDERS TRADED FOR KELLY AS BRAVES, REDS SEEK A FIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to add right-handed punch to their lineup, the Atlanta Braves traded 
two-sport outfielder Deion Sanders to the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday for 
two-time All-Star outfielder Roberto Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal apparently was an ideal match for both clubs.The Reds were seeking a 
leadoff hitter, having used shortstop Barry Larkin there recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade was made moments before both clubs were scheduled to play Sunday and 
both players were replaced in the starting lineups. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the trade during the second inning of the Braves' game 
against the Chicago Cubs was greeted by boos from the fans at Atlanta-Fulton 
County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt like we needed another right-handed hitter to balance our lineup," 
Atlanta General Manager John Schuerholz said in announcing the trade five 
minutes before the Braves took the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got an All-Star right-handed hitter," Schuerholz said, adding that Kelly, 
29, would be used in the leadoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati General Manager Jim Bowden said the need for a "pure leadoff 
hitter" was the reason for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deion is that," Bowden said. "Our team was too right-handed. This will be a 
good fit for both teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said he thought Schuerholz was behind the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see (Manager) Bobby Cox saying, 'Let's get rid of Deion,' " Sanders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was an an All-Pro defensive back with the Atlanta Falcons, but the 
team rescinded his status as a transition player last month and made him an 
unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an exciting player," Bowden said. "He's a great athlete, probably the 
fastest runner in baseball today. He has the type of personality that can help 
us sell tickets."

STANLEY CUP FINALS; GHOSTS OF SEASONS PAST STILL HAUNT RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The real Ranger fans knew their hearts would be broken again. The Wall Street 
types in the expensive suits thought the game was over and were high-fiving 
each other, but the fans in the cheaper seats -- no seats at Madison Square 
Garden are cheap -- held back. 
</P>
<P>
 They were wondering what form the torture would take this time, how the defeat 
they saw coming would compare to all the other wounds they had suffered since 
the Rangers last won the Stanley Cup in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 In Section 322, Anthony LaRe of Queens watched nervously as the clock reached 
the last minute of Friday's Eastern Conference playoff finale against the New 
Jersey Devils. "I'm still pessimistic we may not win," he said before the teams 
faced off with 18.6 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 He was almost right. The Devils pulled even with 7.7 seconds left. LaRe 
slumped in his seat, his face pale. "You can't just think this team is going to 
win," he said. "Every year, it's something." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rangers won in double overtime Friday and advanced to the Stanley 
Cup finals, New York fans remain wary. They've seen this before, and it didn't 
have a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 They remember 1972, when center Jean Ratelle, who was leading the NHL in 
scoring, broke his ankle when he was struck by a Dale Rolfe slap shot. They saw 
Brad Park hurt his knee in 1971. And they saw goaltender John Davidson carry 
the Rangers past the Islanders in the 1979 semifinals, only to injure his knee 
and flame out in a five-game loss to Montreal in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans fear this is the biggest tease yet. They expect the Rangers, who had the 
NHL's best record this season (52-24-8), will lose the Cup to the Vancouver 
Canucks, who were 14th, at 41-40-3. Cub fans know the feeling. Red Sox fans 
understand. Whose twisted knee will cause the cruel twist of fate this spring? 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the fans have been through a lot of agony," Ranger right wing Joe 
Kocur said. "(The semifinal series) was a big win, but 1940 will not be put to 
rest until we win the big one." 
</P>
<P>
 Said General Manager Neil Smith: "The ghosts and goblins won't really be gone 
until we win four more games." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Ranger general manager since 1940 has ignored the club's hexed past, but 
Smith confronted it. Among his first moves when he took over in 1989 was to 
commission rings for the seven survivors of the 1940 team. He also bought a 
tattered jersey worn that season by Art Coulter and displayed it in his office. 
He opened the door to the closet where the ghosts were confined, daring them to 
haunt again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have a hard time going on if I really felt that the Rangers can't win 
because of a curse," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they have endured so much misfortune, how can it be anything else? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers were a power in the NHL's early years, winning the Cup in 1928, 
1933 and 1940. World War II broke up the 1940 team, and the Rangers didn't get 
back to the finals until 1950. Forced to play home games in Toronto when the 
circus occupied the Garden, they lost a seven-game series to the Detroit Red 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 There were Ratelle's broken ankle, Vic Hadfield's broken thumb in 1973, and 
the Flyers' Dave Schultz pummeling Rolfe and the Rangers into submission in 
1974. In 1979, slick Swedish forward Ulf Nilsson got the worst of a check from 
the Islanders' Denis Potvin, and his knees were never the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The curse lived on into the '90s. In 1993, All-Star defenseman Brian Leetch 
broke his ankle when he slipped on a patch of ice outside his Manhattan 
apartment. Without him, the Rangers, who had compiled the NHL's best record in 
1992, missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Keenan, completing his first season in New York, knows he must 
erase the perception of the Rangers as losers. "It's been an interesting part 
of the opportunity here," Keenan said Sunday after his team practiced at Rye 
Playland for Tuesday's Cup opener. "We can't deal with the paranoia of what 
surrounds the team about 1940 except by winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they do win, their triumph will be tinged with tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cecile Saidel, co-founder of the Rangers' Fan Club, missed a playoff game 
against the Capitals, her friends knew something was terribly wrong. A week 
later, police discovered her body crammed beneath the stairs of her Bronx 
apartment building. Saidel, 67, had gone to feed a neighbor's cats and caught 
the neighbor's boyfriend using drugs. After she threatened to call the police, 
the boyfriend apparently strangled her. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was found, she was wearing a gray Ranger sweat shirt.

IT WASN'T THE FINISH THEY HAD DESIRED; INDY 500: ANDRETTI KNOCKED OUT AFTER 23 
LAPS. MANSELL DOESN'T ENJOY PIGGY-BACK RIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least no one had to listen to track announcer Tom Carnegie saying late in 
the race, for the umpteenth time, "Mario Andretti is slowing down." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti has led lots of times here -- he even won once, in 1969 -- but that 
five-word sentence has haunted him for most of his career here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, it was different. Starting his 29th and last Indy 500 -- he is 
retiring from Indy car driving after this season -- Andretti was through early. 
His Lola-Ford quit only 23 laps into the 200-lap race because of a faulty fuel 
system. He was running fifth when he pulled in for his first pit stop and the 
problem manifested itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing," he said. "We were competitive. We were pretty much where 
I was hoping we'd be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why? You wonder why, you know? Anyway, it's just one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti drew a thunderous ovation when it was announced that his race was 
over. "That's what makes it bearable, all the support," he said. "It's been so 
phenomenal and I feel very blessed because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti's teammate, defending national champion Nigel Mansell, also 
experienced wretched luck in what many suspect might also have been his last 
Indy 500. Rumors are rife that the Englishman will return to Formula One 
racing, and he never quite denies them. He won the Formula One title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, his race ended on lap 92 when, during a caution period, Dennis 
Vitolo drove his car up the back of Mansell's, Mansell narrowly escaping 
decapitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just following everyone else slowly around in the slip road to the pit 
entrance," he said. "The next thing I know, I'm sort of going half backward 
with a car on top of me on fire. . . . I've never had an accident when you've 
been under the yellow flag. It's just unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vitolo, "This is racing. I can't blame anybody but myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell was treated for a concussion and burns, then returned to his home in 
Clearwater, Fla.

VILLENEUVE AVOIDS THE ROOKIE MISTAKES TO FINISH SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rookie finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Villeneuve, 23, the kid everybody had funny feelings about, the 
charging young driver who had been responsible for a terrifying accident last 
month in Phoenix, drove a cool, professional, incident-free race and finished 
second Sunday in the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
 He even led seven laps, when the dominant cars of Emerson Fittipaldi and Al 
Unser Jr. were making pit stops. Not that he realized it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point they put 1 on my (pit) board and I wasn't sure what they meant," 
he said. "Does that mean I'm pitting in one lap? And then I looked at the big 
(scoring) tower and saw my number up on top." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, he said, the whole thing was a magnificent experience. "It feels 
great," he said. "It feels great because it's the most important race in the 
world and these are my first points in Indy cars and it's a great place to 
start the season. Coming here, I was hoping to be in the top 10. It feels 
fantastic, finishing second. It's something I never dreamed of, being on the 
podium. I was just hoping not to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, he did make one, killing the engine on his first pit stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "That got me mad a little bit and I was more careful the rest of the race," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Careful is not a word previously used to describe Villeneuve's driving. He 
crashed in each of his three previous races and the one at Phoenix prompted 
questions as to his readiness for Indy cars. Failing to see a yellow light 
signaling a caution period, he plowed into the disabled cars of Hiro Matsushita 
and Paul Tracy, breaking Matsushita's car in two. Amazingly, no one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened at Phoenix could happen to anybody," he said. "I just missed 
the lights. Being a rookie, I was to be blamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve is hoping his performance here might modify some attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be a rookie the whole season and if anything happens and I'm in the 
middle of it, eyes will be on me," he said. "That always happens to rookies. 
But I'm happy if this changes that just a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian driver's only real regret was that he, in his Reynard-Ford 
Cosworth, wasn't able to really race the Mercedes-Benz-powered Penske cars of 
Fittipaldi and Unser. Fittipaldi dominated until he hit the wall coming out of 
Turn 4 with 15 laps to go, then Unser took over for the rest of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't difficult (racing with them) because I didn't see much of them," he 
said of the Penske machines. "I couldn't really race with them. I was just 
happy to be behind them." 
</P>
<P>
 After Fittipaldi's accident, there was hope that Villeneuve might be able to 
challenge Unser on the restart, giving a racing finish to what had pretty much 
been the greatest spectacle in boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 No such luck. Villeneuve apparently thought he was a lap down at the time and 
got caught in traffic when the green flag flew. And even had he realized the 
circumstances were different, he said, it wouldn't have mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even at the end, if I'd been on the same lap as Al, I knew I really couldn't 
fight him, so I just laid back and took it easy," he said. "I didn't want to 
lose second. Third position was 25 seconds behind me and I wanted to keep a 
little gap to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Team managers are quick to recognize maturity in a driver who respects his 
car's limitations, especially when a race is unwinnable. And Villeneuve made 
points with his boss, Barry Green. "Jacques continues to impress every time he 
gets in the car," Green said. "A great driver, a lot of potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi saw it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Villeneuve was doing a great job," he said. "At one point I tried to 
lap him and he was hard to pass. He was running strong."

KWOK IGNORES PAIN, LEADS NADADORES TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was at the half-way mark of the grueling 1,500-meter freestyle that Mission 
Viejo Nadadores' Mark Kwok felt intense pain. Nevertheless, he held on to win 
this race Sunday in the final day of the Finals International Grand Challenge 
Swimming Invitational at Heritage Park Aquatic Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwok, 16, had just won the 200-meter butterfly. He had not dried off from the 
previous race when he got on the block to start the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really hurting at the 900 (-meter) mark," Kwok said, who also won the 
200-meter freestyle Saturday. "I started to think about practice, and how I 
feel good when I'm working out." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, the mind trick worked with Kwok, a Laguna Hills junior, finishing 
in 16 minutes 25.80 seconds, a junior national qualifying mark.  
</P>
<P>
 Kwok's time in the 200-meter fly was 2:09.89, three seconds ahead of teammate 
David Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 In other men's competition, Woodbridge senior Derya Buyukuncu of the Irvine 
Novaquatics made the 100-meter freestyle look easy, winning in 51.57.  
</P>
<P>
 Kwok's strong performances Sunday, coupled with teammate Philippe Demers' 
second-place finish in the 1,500, were enough to give Mission Viejo the top 
spot in the men's overall competition with 206 points. Novaquatics was second 
with 122 and Rose Bowl was third with 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Olympian Angie Wester-Krieg of Stanford, capped her third day winning 
two events, the 100-meter freestyle (59.91) and the 200-meter fly (2:16.60). 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro High sophomore Katie Lowes, representing the Novaquatics, finished 
second in the 100-meter freestyle in 59.23, a junior-national qualifying time 
and less than a second behind Wester-Krieg. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's team scores, the Novaquatics finished third with 90 points behind 
Stanford (115) and winner Blue Fins Swim Club (148).

RANCHO SANTIAGO, CYPRESS IN THE FINAL; BASEBALL: CHARGERS WIN TWICE TO SET UP 
FIRST ALL-ORANGE COUNTY FINAL IN TOURNAMENT HISTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Cypress, facing vacation with its next loss, got a pair of outstanding 
pitching performances Sunday to remain alive in the State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Hendren pitched a six-hitter as Cypress beat Lassen, 4-2, in the 
afternoon game at Cerritos. Josh Belovsky had 14 strikeouts in a complete game 
as the Chargers eliminated Chabot, 9-4, earlier Sunday at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress takes on Rancho Santiago at 11 a.m. today in the first all-Orange 
County final of the State tournament since it started in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (41-11) must sweep two from the Dons to win the championship. 
Rancho Santiago won the title last season; Cypress did the same in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, the Orange Empire Conference champion, beat third-place Rancho 
Santiago three of four times this season. But two of the victories, both 
shutouts, were by Belovsky. The other victory was by Rob Crabtree. 
</P>
<P>
 Crabtree was among the possible starters Cypress Coach Scott Pickler listed 
for today. Crabtree (3-2) had arm trouble in late March and missed almost six 
weeks. He returned last weekend to pitch one inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we're going to do," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler. "But at 
least we got there. Your goal is always to be playing on the last day of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Hendren (11-2) turned in his best performance of the season against Lassen. 
Hendren, a sophomore left-hander, had 10 strikeouts was only in trouble once, 
in the ninth. He allowed a lead-off home run to Chris Webb (his 11th) and a 
double to Tim Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 But he then settled down to get the next three hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers led, 2-1, and had the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth. 
Cypress got a two gift runs when Lassen pitcher John Bradley bounced a pick-off 
throw past first-baseman Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Selway had an RBI single in the second and Jason Hodges added an RBI 
single in the fifth for the Chargers' other runs. 
</P>
<P>
 In another tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 9, Chabot 4 -- Belovsky (11-1), a sophomore right-hander, pitched a 
nine-hitter with 14 strikeouts for Cypress. He was helped by what Pickler 
called the best catch he has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress led, 6-3, in the top of the seventh when Chabot had two on and two 
outs. Chabot's Tim Morrow hit a deep drive to center. Eric Stevens made a 
stunning over-the shoulder catch in full stride then slammed into the 
center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, down for a few seconds, quickly showed the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Gonzalez had a double, his single-season record tying 29th for Cypress.

RANCHO SANTIAGO, CYPRESS IN THE FINAL; BASEBALL: AFTER WINNING, 16-3, THE DONS 
BECOME THE TEAM TO BEAT IN THE STATE TOURNAMENT.

 Rancho Santiago, the third-best team in the Orange Empire Conference this 
season, is in prime position to finish as the top team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons got 18 hits, including three home runs, to beat Lassen, 16-3, Sunday 
at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Rancho Santiago's seventh consecutive playoff victory this season and 
the 11th in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago can win its second consecutive State title with a victory over 
Cypress in an 11 a.m. game. If Cypress wins the first game, a second will 
follow. It is the first all-Orange County final since the tournament started in 
1950. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on both sides," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. "This thing 
is far from over." 
</P>
<P>
 Sneddon's 1986 an '88 teams were in the same position but were beaten twice on 
the final day and finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the Dons (40-11) got key home runs from Joe Fraser, Darren Troilo and 
Daryle Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraser hit a three-run homer over the 350-foot sign near the left-field line 
in the second inning. It was his second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 One out later, Troilo hit his fifth home run, just to the left of the 410-foot 
sign near center field, to put the Dons ahead, 6-0. It was Troilo's fifth 
overall and third of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's home run was a line-drive to the left of the 350-foot sign down the 
right-field line. It was his ninth and put Rancho Santiago ahead, 8-2, to start 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "To hit three home runs in this park is an awesome feat," said Sneddon. "We 
just demoralized them right off." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Kastelic and Jason Minici set Rancho Santiago career records in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kastelic started the game with a bunt single, which was the record 155th hit 
of his two-year Don career. He began the day tied with Conrad Colby (1989-90) 
at 154. 
</P>
<P>
 Kastelic added an RBI double in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Minici had a single, double, triple, scored three runs and drove in three.  
</P>
<P>
 His fourth-inning triple was the ninth of his career, establishing a Rancho 
Santiago record. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago got its second consecutive strong pitching performance of the 
tournament. Brian Martineau (6-3) threw a six-hitter and finished with six 
strikeouts. He is 3-0 with a save in four postseason appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Hoalton pitched a complete game as Rancho Santiago beat Chabot, 8-5, 
in the first round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sneddon wouldn't say who will start today but Kirk Irvine (8-1), Ethan Wyckoff 
(3-1) and Micah Stovall (5-4) have yet to throw.

SOFTBALL / COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; NORTHRIDGE'S HIRED HAND ACHIEVES FEAT: 
MATADORS REACH FINAL; IMPROVEMENT: NORTHRIDGE OFFENSE CRANKS UP WITH THE AID OF 
ASSISTANT COACH BOB VANDERBERG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge softball Coach Gary Torgeson wasn't going to let it 
happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was ranked second in the nation at the end of the regular season 
last year after belting a record-setting 40 home runs, but the Matadors tanked 
it offensively in postseason play, managing just 18 hits in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting .309 in Western Athletic Conference play, Northridge batted an 
embarrassing .125 in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 That fact was not lost on Torgeson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came down to crunch time, we didn't hit very well last year," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually all of his starters returning -- the 1994 Matadors were touted 
as his best chance yet to win an NCAA Division I championship -- Torgeson 
didn't want to chance fate, so he went out and got a hired hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Vanderberg, 41, has been a softball pitcher for nearly 30 years. He still 
competes at the highest level of men's fast pitch, but lately he's acting as 
the Matadors' pitching machine, throwing at speeds up to 75 m.p.h. from 43 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has master control of his pitches," Torgeson said. "Bob pitches to spots 
so it forces our hitters to stay balanced." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderberg, who served as a pitching coach to Arizona's Nancy Evans while she 
was at Hoover High from 1991-93, joined the Matadors as an unpaid assistant 
coach about a month ago at the players' urging. Torgeson wanted the Matadors to 
peak offensively in the postseason and figured the best way to do that was to 
throw them as many live pitches as they could handle. "We complained to coach 
about it a lot, because our pitchers don't like to throw live," center fielder 
Jen Fleming said. "You get maybe five pitches and they're done." 
</P>
<P>
 Non-pitchers Beth Calcante and Kelly Hunt were called into action for batting 
practice earlier this season, but it was not a popular set-up with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants a certain pitch and Kelly Hunt and I can't guarantee it's 
gonna go there," Calcante said.  
</P>
<P>
 Vanderberg, who heard through a friend that Torgeson was in the market for a 
chucker, has solved that problem. He studies charts on opposing pitchers and 
throws their mix of pitches in the batting practices leading up to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has showed vast improvement at the plate since Vanderberg's 
arrival, averaging better than eight hits a game in eight postseason contests 
en route to reaching today's final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors like Vanderberg's endless energy and his willingness to throw the 
kind of pitches they need work on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my pitch selection is better and I'm able to hit the inside pitch 
better now," said Fleming, who has five doubles in the past eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vanderberg showed up for his first Northridge practice, however, his 
pitching prowess raised a few eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was throwing gas," Fleming said. "I couldn't even get my bat around on 
him. And we're like, 'Bob, you need to slow it down. They don't pitch that fast 
here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Vanderberg, who started pitching before he was a teen-ager, the chance to 
help one of the nation's best collegiate teams has been a treat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being around the game and if I can be around it at the top level, it's 
all the more exciting," he said.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER: NEVIN'S FRUSTRATION GROWING DOWN IN TUCSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sure, leaving 18 men on base during a four-game series is frustrating, but 
baseball players don't usually destroy parts of the clubhouse just four games 
into a new season. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he got to Tucson, however, Phil Nevin was already ready to break 
something. Nevin, the first pick in the 1992 draft, believes he should be in 
the major leagues right now, not toiling in the desert for Houston's triple-A 
affiliate, the Tucson Toros. 
</P>
<P>
 So he was in a foul mood when he left spring training for Tucson and after 
leaving all those potential runs batted in standing on the bases, he decided to 
rip the top off of a water fountain. He didn't intend to catch the middle and 
ring fingers of his left hand on a jagged edge of sheet metal and slice them 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing has been blown way out of proportion," Nevin said. "The 
fountain was already broken." 
</P>
<P>
 True. Nevin failed to mention it had been broken by the intense bat barrage he 
had inflicted on his target before engaging in hand-to-hand combat. 
</P>
<P>
 Five stitches and 10 games later, Nevin was back in the Toros' lineup, but to 
say he was happy to be there is stretching it a bit. Nevin, who batted .338 
with runners in scoring position and had 93 RBIs for the Toros last season, was 
the first Tucson player since Glenn Davis in 1984 to drive in more than 90 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 He felt that was good enough to earn him a spot on the Astros' roster and even 
the starting third base job, and it probably would have been if not for the 
play of Ken Caminiti, who is hitting .294 with eight home runs and 35 RBIs this 
season for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to feel I can play up there, too," Nevin said. "At least they've 
told me they think I'm ready. But they don't want me to go up there and sit. 
They have a pretty much set lineup so it's really just a matter of having a 
spot for me, I guess. But that doesn't make it any less frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always talk about possible trades, but there's nothing I can do about 
any of that. I guess I just have to wait my turn. It's all out of my control 
and it's extremely frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 So disappointing that Nevin has discovered the game he has always loved can be 
reduced to nothing more than dreaded work. A 
punch-the-clock-and-complete-your-shift sort of drudgery he thought was 
reserved for guys on the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are days when I come to the park and I don't even want to play," he 
said. "I mean it really has gotten that bad at times, especially if you have 
just watched a game on TV and seen guys you played against in college and you 
know you can do everything they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes some effort to get up for each game and do your best each day. Once 
you're on the field, you try to block it out, but it's no fun. This is the 
first time in all the years that I've played the game, that I go to the park 
and it's not fun. I've never felt like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when his heart isn't totally in it, Nevin is an offensive force. The 
former Cal State Fullerton star hit .402 with 22 homers as the Titans advanced 
to the College World Series championship game in 1992 and, going into Sunday 
night's game, he was batting .318 with two homers and 23 RBIs in 38 games with 
the Toros. 
</P>
<P>
 He's slightly behind last year's RBI pace -- thanks to the ability of a 
mangled water cooler to fight back -- but he's shown the consistency and power 
to prove again he deserves a shot a major league pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to hit many homers in this park," Nevin said. "I've already 
hit quite a few balls that probably would have gone out of a lot of other 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the type of guy who sets goals as far as numbers go, but by the end 
of the summer, I think you'll see my RBIs up there and my batting average up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But will Phil Nevin be up there? Or still down in the dumps down here? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great manager here (Rick Sweet) who also believes I've proven I can 
play in the majors," Nevin said, "and he's been very understanding of what I'm 
going through. He'll give me a day off if I feel like I need it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once you're between the lines, you just try to turn your attitude around 
and remember that baseball is baseball. And I guess I'm just going to have to 
sit here and wait my turn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One man's ceiling . . . Jason Moler, Nevin's close friend and former Titan 
teammate, is one guy who's very happy to be in triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Moler, a catcher who attended Esperanza, was moved up from Philadelphia's 
double-A club in Reading (Pa.) to the triple-A affiliate in 
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre (Pa.). Moler was hitting .294 in double-A and is batting 
.325 with Scranton-Wilkes-Barre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's doing great," Nevin said. "We talk quite a bit and he's really having 
a good time these days. He's definitely ahead of schedule and that's a credit 
to the way he works and the way he plays the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that he was able to make the jump and prove all those scouts wrong. 
Jason's a guy who will make to the big leagues one day and then he'll be there 
for awhile."

FROM HOT CORNER TO HOT SEAT; FORMER CSUN STANDOUT IS BIG HIT AS SEATTLE 
BULLPEN'S CLOSER-IN-TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 It was a desperate situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chattanooga Lookouts were hammering the Jacksonville Suns last August, and 
the Suns were out of pitchers. They needed a mop-up guy, someone to get through 
one inning as painlessly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Marc Hill flipped through the file cards in his head. Hmmm, Craig 
Clayton. Didn't he used to be a pitcher?  
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, a third baseman, relished the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw that first pitch for a strike, and it all came back to me," said 
Clayton, an All-American utility player at Cal State Northridge in 1991. "I set 
them down, 1-2-3." 
</P>
<P>
 Thereafter, a career path was altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, a good-hit, no-power infielder, has moved onto a 90-m.p.h. track to 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance as an emergency reliever impressed Mariner officials and 
reminded them of his pitching abilities. They sent him to the Arizona 
Instructional League to get a look and then placed him on the 40-man roster 
after getting an eyeful. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of months, Clayton went from being a tomato can, asked to get 
three measly outs, to contender for a spot in the Mariner bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to realize that I could be in the big leagues as a pitcher," 
Clayton said. "As a third baseman, I might have kicked around the minor leagues 
for six or seven years, then maybe got a cup of coffee in the majors. I just 
love pitching again." 
</P>
<P>
 He is getting a refresher course. Clayton is back in Jacksonville, but his 
progress is being closely monitored in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good-looking young pitcher, one of the most impressive pitchers in 
camp," Manager Lou Piniella said during spring training. "With a little 
improvement and experience, he's not far from pitching in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
 Heady stuff for a guy who hadn't thrown a pitch in more than two years, but 
Clayton has reacquainted himself well. His fastball has been clocked in the 
90s, almost a full 10 m.p.h faster than when he was in college. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 games, he has a 3.65 earned-run average and has struck out 13 batters in 
12 1/3 innings, including a game-ending strikeout of Michael Jordan to record 
his first save. This despite spending a week on the disabled list with 
tendinitis in his shoulder. A minor setback, but hardly one to dampen his 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, I didn't know how much I missed pitching until I got back on the 
mound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton's last stint as a pitcher was highly successful. In three seasons at 
Northridge, he established himself as one of the best and most versatile 
players in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton was third in the voting for Collegiate Baseball player of the year in 
1991 after leading the Matadors to the West Regional II final as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton was 14-5 with a 2.25 earned-run average that season. He also led the 
nation with 166 strikeouts and was a first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 He won 27 games in two seasons as a pitcher. He helped the Matadors get to the 
NCAA Division II World Series final as a sophomore and put them within reach of 
the Division I series the next season. Clayton beat Fresno State, 6-2, on two 
days' rest to force a second game in the double-elimination regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had tremendous confidence on the mound," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a sophomore, he faced Cal State Fullerton, which was one of the top teams 
in the nation. That didn't bother Craig. He threw a one-hitter, facing one 
batter over the minimum. I knew that day he was a tremendous pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma, if you can call it that, was Clayton was equally effective at the 
plate. He hit .397 at Northridge and played every position except catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a 21-game hitting streak as a junior and also threw 28 consecutive 
innings without giving up an earned run. So was he a pitcher who hit or a 
hitter who pitched? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners figured they could worry about that later after taking Clayton in 
the sixth round of the 1991 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really a two-way prospect," said Ken Compton, the Mariners' West Coast 
supervisor for scouting. "The plan was to send him out as a hitter and see what 
he looked like. We felt we could always move him back to pitcher if it didn't 
work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton hit well. In 1991, he batted .264 at Bellingham, the Mariners' lower 
Class-A team, and was bumped up to San Bernardino, where he hit .333. He hit 
.249 in 1992 but missed three months after breaking an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Clayton was hitting .328 at Riverside (Class A) with 32 runs 
batted in. He was selected to the California League all-star game but couldn't 
play because he was moved to Jacksonville, where he hit .298. "We might have 
moved him back to pitcher a couple years ago, but he kept hitting .300," 
Compton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But while Clayton made some progress, he also had drawbacks as a third 
baseman. He didn't hit for power -- only 10 home runs in three seasons -- and 
he wasn't a slick fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't the prototype third baseman," Clayton said. "I was never going 
to hit 20 home runs and drive in 100 runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He had good command of the bat," said Jim Beattie, the Mariners' director of 
player development. 
</P>
<P>
 So Clayton continued to tread water until the day the bottom fell out of 
Jacksonville's bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Down by 10 runs, Hill just wanted to get the game over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to use up our pitching, and I knew Craig had a strong arm," 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't prepared for how strong it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "My pitching coach and I looked at each other and went, 'Whoa,' " Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton made two more emergency appearances. He didn't give up a run in four 
innings. In his last game, he pitched one inning, striking out the side. 
</P>
<P>
 He also hit a three-run homer in his last at-bat to tie the score, but by then 
reports about his arm strength were winging their way to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I was throwing harder," Clayton said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I matured. Maybe the years away from pitching rested my arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, one thing was clear. "When we saw that arm strength, we 
knew it was time for us to move him back to pitcher," Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the instructional league, Clayton was 2-0 with a 1.55 ERA and struck out 21 
batters in 23 1/3 innings. The Mariners, fearing another team might draft him 
under Rule V, protected Clayton on the 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to spring training, where he began learning the subtleties of 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Clayton: "The first game I pitched, we were sitting in the bullpen, and 
the guys were talking about this one hitter. The guy couldn't hit a breaking 
ball, but he he could crush a fastball. I get in the game, and this guy is the 
first batter. So I threw him a fastball, and he hit it out. I found out it was 
a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that setback, Clayton was impressive. In fact, he got a 
where-have-you-been reception from pitching coach Sammy Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made him a third baseman, for what reason I don't know," Ellis said 
during spring training.  
</P>
<P>
 "After I saw that arm, I questioned it, but it wasn't my decision. I'm just 
happy we put him back on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
 As is Clayton. "They carry 11 pitchers on a team and only one third baseman," 
he said. "I like those odds better."

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: FISHING

 FISH TALES: Memorial Day is the unofficial beginning of the summer fishing 
season, a signal for anglers to restock tackle boxes and restring reels. . . . 
Irvine Lake is teeming with trout, a result of a bigger-than-usual 14,000-pound 
stocking last Tuesday. Recent catches at the lake, which does not require a 
fishing license, include a 10.6-pound rainbow trout as well as several 
aggressive six- to seven-pound bass. . . . According to angler Scott Sargent, 
the fish have been hitting nearly everything. Sargent was recently out trolling 
a lure designed to catch trout when a bass bit. "I've never seen a bass do 
that," he said. A day of fishing costs $11 for adults and $9 for children 12 
and under. Kids 3 and under are free. 
</P>
<P>
 BAT COOKIES: Strange things are being brought up from Newport's Back Bay 
lately. "Last week, someone brought in a bat ray that they had caught out in 
the harbor," said Jaye Apperson of the Balboa Angling Club. Bat rays are 
relatives of sharks that resemble their flying namesakes but with wingspans 
reaching six feet. And they can be quite tasty. "Their wings are delicious," 
Apperson said. "You just use a cookie cutter and cut them into little pieces 
and fry 'em up." 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD CALL: Irvine resident Joe Grant had the catch of his life nine days ago 
when he landed a 331-pound thresher shark. Grant took 50 minutes to bring in 
the beast, which he found six miles off Laguna Beach. . . . When a reporter 
inquired about the Balboa Angling Club record for 50-pound-test fishing line, 
Grant found out just how big his accomplishment was. A search of the books 
found that the old mark was 249 pounds, and cheers erupted. Said Grant: "Thanks 
for asking!" 
</P>
<P>
 SHARK ATTACK: Night shark fishing has been born at Dana Point Sportfishing, 
where a boat is departing Wednesday evenings at 5:30 for six hours of sharking. 
The maiden voyage aboard the Gamefish on May 18 was a hit: Four fishermen 
caught 11 blue sharks. . . . The sharks, which are not nearly as savory as 
their thresher and mako relatives, were all released, said company spokeswoman 
Donna Hansen.

 ICE CREAMED: We may all scream for ice cream, but not for convenience, it 
seems. That's why the Baskin-Robbins in Burbank recently tore down its 
drive-thru, the only one in the L.A. area. . . . According to company 
spokeswoman Lisa Van Velthuyzen, "People tend to want to come in and look at 
the dipping cabinets and see the flavors." 
</P>
<P>
 CRASH AFTERMATH: The Mercedes convertible was speeding toward him so fast he 
barely remembers it. And in the ensuing collision, Gregory Moore's face was 
tragically disfigured. An aspiring composer and singer, the Saugus man now has 
double vision, a shattered mouth and numerous other problems. He still faces 
extensive reconstructive surgery -- and still expects an apology from the 
former high school football star who allegedly caused the crash (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN IN FINALS: With a win over Oklahoma State Sunday, the Cal State 
Northridge softball team advanced to the NCAA title game against defending 
champ Arizona. The Northridge team lost its first game, 3-2, in 15 innings to 
Oklahoma State, but bounced back to win the second, 4-2, and advance to today's 
championship game against the Wildcats. Above, CSUN's Tamara Ivie, center, 
celebrates with her teammates (C1). 
</P>
<P>
 VALLEY CRUSADE: You've probably seen his bumper stickers. Or his posters or 
lawn signs. There are so many in the Valley you may think Luis Palau is running 
for office. But Palau is a preacher, not a politician. And he will be the 
featured evangelist in the Valley's first-ever mass evangelism crusade. Palau 
is not well-known in the U.S. but has preached to 10 million people in 60 
countries, second only to Billy Graham. Five nights of rallies start Wednesday 
at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 LANDMARKS: Women have made history all over this country, and that includes 
the Valley. According to a new edition of a book about women's achievements, 
the Valley has two special landmarks: The Amelia Earhart Statue in North 
Hollywood -- she lived in the city for many years -- and the Root Poultry Ranch 
in Glendale. Kara Smart Root was one of the first women in the California State 
Poultry Assn.

ESPERANZA'S PUGMIRE IS MAKING UP FOR LOST TIMES; TRACK: A LOW FINISH KEPT HER 
OUT OF THE BIG MEET LAST SPRING. THIS YEAR, SHE HAS HIT HER STRIDE TOWARD THE 
STATE MEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 5 feet 6 inches, 120 pounds, a bow holding her red hair off of her freckled 
face, Esperanza junior Courtney Pugmire is anything but intimidating as she 
toes the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sound of the gun ignites a fire in Pugmire, one that burns intensely 
against every middle distance runner she has raced this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire stems from a missed opportunity in last year's State track and field 
meet. Pugmire was sixth (2:16.77) in the the 1993 Masters Meet in the 800 
meters, one place shy of qualifying for the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the motivation for this year." Aztec cross country Coach Rich 
Medellin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is really focused and knows what she has to do every single day, both 
when she practices and races." 
</P>
<P>
 That focus, which Medellin says exemplifies Pugmire's determination since that 
outing last may, has not only helped Pugmire achieve her goal of running in the 
State meet in the 800, but the 1,600 as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of myself, because I conquered that fear that I had about the 800 
after last year's Masters Meet," said the junior, who finished third in the 
Masters 1,600 (5:04.07) and fifth in the 800 (2:15.50) just 45 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally she gets 2 1/2 hours between the two races," Aztec track Coach Al 
Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had never been faced with just 45 to 50 minutes, not to mention running 
against some pretty good runners." 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said Pugmire's tenacity was never more evident than at the Southern 
Section Division II finals, where Pugmire helped the Aztec girls to their first 
team title. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugmire, the three-time all-county selection in cross country, won the 1,600 
meters in 5:06.62, then managed to hold off late-charging freshman Katie Nuanes 
of Santa Margarita to take the honors in the 800, posting a personal best of 
2:16.64. 
</P>
<P>
 "Courtney is such a great competitor," said Britt about Pugmire, who also 
anchored the 1,600 relay to crown the Aztecs in the divisional championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she's got it, she'll lay it out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Her coming-out party began after a cross-country season in which she was 11th 
at the Orange County championships. 
</P>
<P>
 At the county championships at Trabuco Hills in April, Pugmire's blistering 
finishing kick enabled her to lead a 1-2 Aztec sweep of the 1,500 with teammate 
Carrie Caulkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an awakening day," said Pugmire, who posted a time of 4:41.98, which 
converted to 1,600 meters is her personal best of 5:02.78. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the day that I realized that I can run with the big girls." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as though running with the big girls has always come easily to 
Pugmire, who attended her first cross-country practice a third of the way 
through her freshman season and finished third in the ensuing meet on one of 
the county's most talented teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right away, I knew we had something special with her and that she had some 
talent," said Medellin, whose Aztec squad finished second in the county meet 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt saw the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her talent isn't much different than the other kids on the team, it's just 
all in her personality that's very competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Pugmire was the top Aztec at the prestigious Mt. San Antonio 
College Invitational and moved on to qualify with the ninth and final spot to 
the section finals, where she finished seventh in her first season running the 
800. 
</P>
<P>
 What is unusual though for a distance runner is the fact that Pugmire has been 
versatile for the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
 Experiencing every event from the 400 through 1,600, Pugmire has run legs on 
the 400 and 1,600 relays and even found time to advance to the section 
preliminaries in the 300 intermediate hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed her to hurdle the last couple of years and she did that for the 
team," said Britt of Pugmire, who posted a best of 47.2 in the event. "But her 
temperament is best suited for the 800 meters because you have to be able to go 
out and run hard and then kick at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't miss running the hurdles," Pugmire said. "It was something that 
was fun and the coaches were great, but I wasn't really that good." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding her niche this spring, Pugmire has focused on distance running all 
season, choosing to train with the cross-country team year-round, rather than 
venture onto the track for spring-time training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al and I talked it over and decided that Courtney would train with me all 
year, and it has been good for both her and the team," Medellin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was much easier than the one Pugmire faces now: which event to 
concentrate on at the State meet this Friday and Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 As she will tell you though, it's better to have and choice than not have one 
at all.

MIKE PENNER: NEW YORK RANGERS, KNICKS PROVE EVERY DOG TEAM HAS ITS DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been 54 years since the New York Rangers won the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 21 years since the New York Knickerbockers won the NBA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Good years, all in all. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing New York City needs more than a dose of strong air freshener is 
a dose of humility, and the ringless streaks of the Rangers and the Knicks have 
happily provided that. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when the Giants won their first Super Bowl, back in 1987? They beat 
the Denver Broncos. Big accomplishment. Four different teams, four different 
cities have beaten the Denver Broncos in Super Bowls. That's only because the 
Broncos have appeared in four Super Bowls. Put the Rams or the Falcons or the 
Saints in those games and they'd have beaten the Broncos, too. The Giants just 
happened to be there, and they did what was expected of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of country took it that way, too. Nice little team Parcells has 
there, we said before nodding off into a Bud Lite-induced stupor, but they're 
sure no '85 Bears, are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Manhattan, however, it was V-J Day II. Civilization had been saved. 
The solar system could resume spinning around the sun. The Greatest Football 
Team Ever Assembled Had Just Won The Greatest Game Ever Played. Books were 
written about Phil McConkey. Books were written about Jim Burt. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone living west of the Hudson gave a rat's eye about the 
philosophical leanings of the Giants' field-goal unit, but from the New York 
perspective, none of that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 If it happens in New York, because it happens in New York, it is intrinsically 
bigger, better, more notable, more important and more irresistibly fascinating 
than anything that happens anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 That is Rule 1 for the New York sports fan, writer, broadcaster and 
commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no Rule 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks, and especially the Rangers, have been useful, then, in 
uncluttering the mind of the average American sporting spectator -- to say 
nothing of uncluttering the sports section of the average American book store. 
</P>
<P>
 Two whole generations now have been reared with the knowledge that the center 
of the hockey universe is not Madison Square Garden. They know hockey as a 
sport that has been mastered in steel towns (Pittsburgh) and oil towns 
(Edmonton) and cow towns (Calgary), but something of a problem in sleek, 
sophisticated Gotham. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanley Cup scoreboard, post-1940, tells all: 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 5, New York City 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, New York City 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 2, New York City 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Island 4, New York City 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the last 20 years atop of the NBA have been Knickless and painless. 
Between appearances by New York in the championship round, Portland and 
Washington have reached the finals three times apiece, with Phoenix, Seattle, 
and Houston each breaking through twice. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been one long, cool drink of water, until now, these sobering days of 
late May, 1994, which has seen the re-emergence of the two-headed hydra from 
the five-borough sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers are in the Cup finals again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks are two victories away from the NBA finals, again. 
</P>
<P>
 The world, as we know it, is about to be swept off its axis. 
</P>
<P>
 As the country braces itself for tabloid apocalypse, the Rangers and the 
Knicks represent two entirely different case scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ranger Stanley Cup would be seen as a triumph of rightful order. The Rangers 
led the league in points, they own the most talent, they have the best 
goaltending -- they are the team that deserves to win. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ranger Stanley Cup might even be tolerable, too. Finally, we'd be rid of all 
this tiresome moaning about 1940 and so much overwrought, angst-ridden prose 
about curses and ghosts and demons that supposedly vex the Garden pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 As if Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr, Wayne Gretzky and the Montreal Canadiens had 
nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing positive can come from a Knick championship. There will be no joy 
in any headline declaring "KNIX HAX WAX 'EM IN SIX!" What's good for the Knicks 
is bad for basketball, pure and simple, and if Larry Brown can't stop them in 
this round, we had best pray for the mighty hand of Hakeem to smote them in the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we really want a basketball champion that wins solely on its ability to 
impersonate British soccer fans? 
</P>
<P>
 That scored 68 points in a semifinal-round loss to the Indiana Pacers? 
</P>
<P>
 That received a total of one point -- one more than a dead man, as Al McGuire 
used to say -- from its best player and media-created "fearless warrior," 
Patrick Ewing? 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, Ewing has already been anointed as an automatic Hall of Famer, 
one of the top 10 centers of all time, yet I have trouble remembering Wilt 
Chamberlain or Bill Russell or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Willis Reed or Bill 
Walton or Hakeem Olajuwon or Moses Malone or Bob Lanier or Nate Thurmond or 
Robert Parish or Dave Cowens or Wes Unseld ever going 0-for-10 from the field 
in an important NBA playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 See, this is the problem with New York and its sports teams. There, decent 
players are exalted as all-stars and good players are transformed into living 
deities. Meanwhile, the real thing -- John Stockton, say, or Reggie Miller -- 
is relegated to the obscurity bin, simply because his mailing address is Salt 
Lake City or Indianapolis and not upper Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Thuggery is popular in the Big Apple as well, which explains the fanaticism 
over the Knicks. New Yorkers identify with a good elbow in the Adam's apple, a 
swift kick to the groin. Hey, Looie, that Starks plays just like me tryin' to 
get on the subway.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, keep it out of our kitchen. If we ever do need a fix of TV nastiness and 
violence, we'd rather not find it watching the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what baseball's for.

TROUBLES TEST ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District is beset by which of the following 
problems: (A) a leadership vacuum; (B) an austere budget; (C) bitterness from a 
recent strike by classified employees; (D) costly legal hearings involving 
alleged sexual harassment by three top administrators who, in turn, are suing 
the district for $60 million; (E) ethical questions surrounding a 26-year-old 
board member with a criminal record or (F) all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Partial credit for A-E. The correct response, to the chagrin of those 
who care about the district, is: (F), all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once hailed throughout the state as a model school system, the Orange Unified 
School District is viewed today as one of the education system's most 
dysfunctional. 
</P>
<P>
 The reverberations from its latest spate of bad publicity are being felt 
throughout the 26,000-student district, which serves Orange, Villa Park and 
parts of Anaheim Hills, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Its poor public image has district officials worried about retaining and 
attracting quality staff and has local realtors -- fearing a drop in housing 
prices -- quietly taking teachers aside and asking them when the school system 
will straighten itself out. 
</P>
<P>
 Many trace the source of the problems to a revolving door in the 
superintendent's office -- there have been seven since 1989 -- and to strife 
and turnover on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past four or five school boards have been dysfunctional, each in its own 
way," said Lee Newcomer, an education consultant who has conducted more than 45 
superintendent searches nationwide, including two for Orange Unified. "This 
board hasn't spent 10 minutes talking about where the district is going. They 
are spending all their time fighting with one another." 
</P>
<P>
 After enduring a rash of embarrassments including a bid-rigging scandal, a 
bitter recall movement aimed at five trustees and a teachers' strike between 
1987 and 1993, community hopes ran high in December that the district's 
reputation for controversy and scandal would be erased when four new trustees 
were sworn onto the seven-member board. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of quickly putting the troubles behind them, board members 
discovered the past was hard to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there were allegations in December of sexual harassment involving three 
top administrators. Then, in retaliation, the trio filed a $60-million lawsuit 
against the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, faced with a $2.2-million shortfall in a $107-million budget, the 
board approved eliminating 20 teaching and classified positions. In April, 
trustees unilaterally forced a contract on classified workers, which imposed 
furlough days, cut health benefits and gave the district the power to lay off 
or reduce an employee's hours at will. In protest, hundreds of the classified 
employees -- including bus drivers, maintenance, clerical and custodial workers 
-- held a strike for two weeks in May, crippling the district's bus and child 
care systems. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the midst of these crises, the board was unable to select a new 
permanent superintendent -- a post that has been vacant for more than two 
years. Finally, in mid-April, interim superintendent Marilyn J. Corey resigned 
after clashing in a closed session with board members about rising legal fees 
for ongoing sexual harassment hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, officially, no one is in charge at district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems we have now are far more severe than at any other time in the 
district's history," said David Reger, head of the district's teachers union. 
"We want to discuss issues. We want to solve problems, but you need someone to 
talk to to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But some board members -- Maureen Aschoff, Robert Viviano and Max Reissmueller 
-- contend that most of their recent troubles are inherited from previous 
boards. Moreover, they argue, some district unrest should be expected given the 
changing of the guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to build a new building, you have to tear down the old one," said 
Reissmueller, one of four new board members. "There is a lot of restructuring 
that needs to go on in the district. Change is painful." 
</P>
<P>
 And while there is disagreement among the board members on many issues and 
even on whether the board should stick to policy-making or engage in managing 
day-to-day district problems, they agree that hiring a permanent superintendent 
is the first step on the path to recovery. Though the new board has had more 
almost six months, it seems to be no closer today to filling the position. 
Board members say the slew of recent troubles sidetracked them in their 
superintendent search. 
</P>
<P>
 And Orange Unified's poor administrative reputation hasn't made the search any 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response I'd get from prospective candidates when I asked them to talk -- 
not apply, just talk -- to the board was 'What have you got against me?' " said 
recruiter Newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
 The school system's leadership vacuum exacts a heavy price not only on its 
day-to-day functioning, but also on its morale, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paranoia sets in. There's mistrust, hostility." said Newcomer. "There's 
nobody giving strokes when someone does a good job and nobody giving them hell 
when they are doing a bad job. It's like a rudderless ship." 
</P>
<P>
 If the district doesn't turn in the right direction soon, many fear a the 
teaching staff -- still a source of pride for the district -- will be affected. 
The experienced teaching staff is credited with keeping student scores above 
state averages on the California Learning Assessment System and the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test, despite the embattled administrative atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials wonder how long students will continue to perform well given 
that the district has had mixed success in recruiting young teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to lose a lot of very good teachers soon," said board member 
Bill Lewis. "They aren't 30 years old anymore. They are 50 and 60, and they are 
looking to retire. We need to rebuild our image so we can attract new 
teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's reputation for trouble not only hurts recruiting, but also 
makes it harder to keep current staff. Shortly after being honored as a top 
high school principal in the state two years ago, then-El Modena High Principal 
Gail Richards left Orange Unified for another principal job in Irvine -- in 
part because of the district's management and financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The instability didn't help any," said Richards, who is now at Irvine High. 
"The cutbacks were discouraging too. You're doing more with less all the time, 
and it was a lot of stress." 
</P>
<P>
 The financial difficulties are weighing heavily on the district now and will 
be an important hurdle even if the trustees' bickering, lawsuits and current 
labor trouble evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp drops in state funding and mismanagement pushed the district to the 
brink of bankruptcy only four years ago. The district has clawed its way back 
to fiscal health, slashing $11.5 million from its past three budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cutbacks meant pay cuts for teachers and classified staff, layoffs, 
curtailed athletic programs and increased class sizes. Orange Unified has an 
instructor to student ratio of 39.6 to 1 in secondary classrooms, one of the 
highest in Orange County, says union official Reger. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 budget looks no better. There's a shortfall of at least 
$1.7-million, which may rise when state budgets figures are released. The 
district is also looking to scrape together another $400,000 for its depleted 
reserve fund, which is at 2.6% less than the 3% minimum recommended by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bare-bones budget that lost more weight," said Chief Fiscal Officer 
Joyce Capelle. 
</P>
<P>
 Finances are so tight that an unexpected expense of $100,000 could throw the 
district into bankruptcy, which would prompt state educational authorities to 
step in and seize control, Capelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regard the ongoing disciplinary hearings -- connected to allegations of 
sexual harassment by three top administrators -- as a threat to the district's 
shaky fiscal health. The hearings started in March and now are expected to last 
through October. The district has already spent $150,000 in legal fees, but has 
stalled paying another $90,000 to its attorney because the board feared the 
payment would throw its precarious financial house into the red. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Supt. Richard L. Donoghue has been accused of inappropriately touching 
employees, distributing lewd materials and using sexually offensive language in 
the workplace. Capelle and Transportation Director Howard Mason are charged 
with engaging in and tolerating sexual banter in the workplace. Donoghue faces 
possible firing, while Capelle and Howard could be demoted and see their pay 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members quietly second-guess their decision to discipline the trio 
using a costly public hearing process, but all board members said rumors that 
the district may halt the hearings are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Further tarnishing the district's public image was the disclosure earlier this 
month that Reissmueller pleaded guilty in 1987 to contributing to the 
delinquency of a minor -- a misdemeanor. A group of parents distributed 
leaflets with Reissmueller's court records at a school board meeting earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller, who was 18 at the time of the incident, originally faced the 
more serious charges of sex with a minor and battery. Those charges were later 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller, who will disclose few details of the case and declined to 
provide even the age of the victim, said he did nothing "morally wrong." He 
denounced the release as politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The information has raised questions about Reissmueller's fitness for office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really destroys any credibility he has. He should come forward with the 
details," Reger said. "He should probably do the Nixon thing and resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members criticized the media in its recent coverage of the 
district, especially during the recent classified workers' strike. They say the 
district is being treated unfairly and singled out by the media because of its 
past troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recent unfavorable publicity has had an upside, points out board 
president Aschoff. It has attracted a more "aggressive" breed of parental 
volunteers who are determined to help their children's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a parents group recently began publishing a newspaper designed to 
highlight district accomplishments that often go unreported in the larger 
media. The first issue praised parental volunteers for helping out during the 
classified strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The troubling issues have brought this community together like never before," 
Aschoff said. "The community is coming forward and saying how can we help." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those eternal optimists," she added. "We are on the brink of 
success."

GARDEN GROVE OFFICER'S VEST, PEN HALT BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-year-old Garden Grove reserve police officer was shot near the heart 
during a gang fight at the Strawberry Festival, but a bullet-resistant vest 
saved him from serious injury, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Gary Cunningham was trying to break up a melee involving 50 members of 
two rival gangs about 11 p.m. Saturday when one youth pulled a small-caliber 
handgun from his waistband and fired at Cunningham, who was standing five to 10 
feet away, said Capt. Scott Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vest saved (Cunningham's) life because the bullet hit right about where 
his heart is," Jordan said. "If he didn't have the vest on, the bullet could 
have killed him." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Campbell survived, the shooting served as a grim reminder for the 
department, still recovering from the slaying of veteran officer Howard E. 
Dallies Jr., who was shot to death March 9, 1993, during a routine traffic 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The department requires its officers to wear the vests, yet it has seen five 
officers slain in the line of duty since 1912, more than any other law 
enforcement agency in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's incident, the bullet deflected off of a Cross pen in 
Cunningham's left breast pocket before lodging into the lining of the vest, 
which is made of Kevlar, a tough synthetic fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham suffered a bruised chest but was otherwise uninjured, Jordan said. 
The officer was taken to a local hospital, where he was examined but not 
admitted. He could not be reached for comment later. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged gunman, 18-year-old Cesar Julio Luevano of Santa Ana, was arrested 
a few blocks from the festival as he tried to hide between two houses on Walnut 
Street, Jordan said. Another officer apparently tried to subdue Luevano before 
the shooting, but the suspect broke free of the officer's grip, turned around 
and shot Cunningham "point-blank," according to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially detained eight people as possible suspects, but soon focused 
on Luevano when he was seen quickly walking away from the festival, held at 
Village Green Park on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spotted him and he took off running into a residential neighborhood just 
north of the park," Jordan said. "He tossed his gun over a fence and into a 
back yard, then tried to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered a .25-caliber pistol believed to have been used in the 
shooting. A spent casing and a live round of ammunition were found at the site 
of the shooting. The bullet fired at the officer was found lodged in the vest, 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Luevano was identified as the alleged gunman by several witnesses and 
another police officer. Luevano is being held at Orange County Jail on 
suspicion of attempted murder of a police officer. Bail was set at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other males were arrested in connection with the fight prior to the 
shooting, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular festival, expected to draw about 200,000 visitors over the 
three-day weekend, has attracted gang members late at night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The festival seems to be family oriented until the late evening, when a 
younger crowd comes in and some of the problems happen," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the shooting, officers immediately shut down the festival, an hour 
before its scheduled closing time of midnight, and closed the event two hours 
early on Sunday to avoid any further problems. The festival ends today. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional officers were sent to the grounds to serve as reinforcements as 
officers escorted the crowd out of the festival two hours early Sunday. Jordan 
declined to say how many officers were present. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival officials weren't available for comment. Jordan said the officials 
didn't want to make a statement and asked police to handle news media 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most festival-goers on Sunday seemed unaware of Saturday's shooting, but many 
supported the decision to close the event early. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cruising scene when it gets to be that late," said Angel Granados, a 
22-year-old bank teller from Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Giancarlo Poncedeleon, a 16-year-old Garden Grove Boy Scout working in a game 
booth, said "midnight is too late to be open anyway. It doesn't matter to me 
that we are closing earlier. Actually, I think it would be better." 
</P>
<P>
 Several festival-goers were concerned about troublemakers returning to the 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, they can't provide everyone with a vest, not just the cops," 
said Pete Werth, a 28-year-old contractor from Fountain Valley. "It just seems 
like everyone should get one." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials estimate that since the 1970s, more than 1,500 
officers lives have been saved by bullet-resistant vests. Although the body 
armor is not a cure-all for the dangers on the street, it can reduce the 
likelihood of fatal gunshots to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fatal shooting of Dallies, his vest shielded him against one round 
fired by a motorcyclist during a routine traffic stop but couldn't stop another 
bullet that entered beneath his vest and tore through his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the luck of the draw," Jordan said when comparing the two shootings. 
"The vest will only protect you in certain ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham was reportedly traumatized by the shooting and will be given time 
off. He has been a reserve officer in Garden Grove for more than four years, 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's home and he's OK," Jordan said. "He is shaken up by the realization that 
he has been shot, but he's really thankful that he was wearing the vest." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said officers are carrying on like "business as usual" but such 
incidents have a sobering affect on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun and rewarding job, but incidents like this serve to remind us that 
someone can kill us without notice or provocation," Jordan said.

TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL; 6 OF 10 OPPOSE EL TORO COMMERCIAL AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About six out of 10 Orange County voters say they are opposed to a measure 
proposed for the November ballot to require conversion of the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station into a commercial airport, according to a new Times Orange 
County Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 If the election was held today, the poll showed, 58% of the county's 
registered voters would vote against an El Toro airport, while only 39% would 
support the non-binding measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the airport has remained constant over the past year, and 
actually increased slightly. An April, 1993, Times Orange County Poll showed 
that 54% of the county's voters were opposed to a commercial airport at El 
Toro, while 39% favored it. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Times Orange County Poll, conducted from May 19 to May 22, showed 
that opposition to the airport is solid in both northern and southern areas of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 When the measure was filed with the registrar of voters in March, most 
observers thought it would generate a regional battle, with residents in the 
northern cities favoring the new airport and South County residents opposing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 But a telephone survey of 600 registered voters found that a majority in both 
regions oppose the airport -- 54% of North County voters and 68% in the south. 
When presented with various alternatives for the reuse of the base, scheduled 
to close by 1999, only 28% of those polled favored a commercial airport at the 
site, just slightly ahead of the 20% who want to see it converted into an 
industrial-commercial zone. 
</P>
<P>
 When voters were offered similar alternatives in the 1993 poll, they favored 
an industrial-commercial zone at El Toro by 22%, followed closely by 21% who 
wanted a commercial airport there. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare & 
Associates and included several questions about the proposal to build a new 
airport at El Toro. Cheryl Katz, who co-directed the poll, said voters are not 
convinced the airport would become the "job machine" promised by proponents of 
the ballot measure, called the Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus 
Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't see the clear benefits of a second major airport in Orange 
County," said Katz. "They are reluctant to approve something they think will 
end up costing taxpayers money." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the airport was the top choice in the recent poll when voters were 
offered several alternatives for developing El Toro, Katz said support for it 
is still soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a significant consensus on the airport. Proponents can say that 
it remains the top choice, but 28% (support) is really a low number," Katz 
said.

 Backers of the airport initiative, including several influential business and 
political leaders in the county, have until Wednesday to collect at least 
66,703 signatures on a petition to place the measure on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
Business groups favoring the airport claim it would create 21,000 new jobs in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Katz said backers of the initiative have not succeeded in convincing 
voters that the airport would be a boost to the local economy. She said that 
county residents "are still very concerned about jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed initiative asks voters to approve an amendment to the county's 
General Plan to authorize a civilian airport on about 2,000 acres of the 
4,700-acre base. In addition, the measure seeks permission from the military 
for use of the base runways by commercial air cargo carriers while the Marines 
go ahead with plans to leave the base by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 But the initiative is an advisory measure, and even if it is approved by 
voters, the Marines have said they do not favor joint use of the El Toro base. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Maguire, a Lake Forest resident, said she intends to vote against the 
initiative and does not believe a new airport would have a positive impact on 
the county's economy or the quality of life in surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a two-edge sword. I don't think we would see that many new jobs," said 
Maguire, 40. "But even if it did improve the economy, it would be done at the 
expense of the communities around El Toro. We would be giving up our quality of 
life. This area could become like the communities around Los Angeles 
(International) Airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove resident Charles Lamourex, 57, supports the initiative and 
believes a new airport would improve the county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if El Toro became just a cargo airport, there would be a number of new 
jobs that would be created. The demand for cargo handlers alone would be 
significant," said Lamourex, an environmental consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll respondents expressed little confidence that the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority -- the county agency sanctioned to study redevelopment options for 
the base -- can come up with a development plan for the base that would 
stimulate the economy and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 9% of the registered voters polled said they have "a lot of confidence" 
in the agency's ability to do the job, while 37% said they have "some 
confidence." An almost equal number, 35%, said they have "not much confidence" 
in the county planning authority's ability to develop a plan for El Toro that 
could help the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Higgins, a 21-year-old sales representative from Fullerton, said that 
county officials have "demonstrated they can't do much more than talk" about 
what to do with the Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to wake up and do what needs to be done, and that's put an airport 
there," said Higgins. "We're all tired of sitting around waiting for things to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said that Higgins' complaint echoed the frustration of many voters who 
are growing impatient with the process. How the Poll Was Done 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 Orange County registered voters was conducted May 
19-22 on weekday nights and weekend days. The margin of error for the total 
sample is plus or minus 4%. For subgroups, such as Democrats or Republicans, 
the margin of error would be larger. Times Orange County Poll / What to Do With

 Six out of 10 Orange County voters say they would oppose an initiative that 
would convert the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into an airport. Half of

for residents, while a third say a conversion would help improve the Orange 
County economy.

AS ISRAEL FACES PEACE, OLD CHALLENGES RETURN; MIDEAST: WANING SECURITY CONCERNS 
POINT UP SOCIAL, SPIRITUAL ISSUES. FUTURE OF NATION, JUDAISM PONDERED. 
</P>

 In leaving the Gaza Strip after a quarter of a century of military occupation 
and looking toward withdrawal from the West Bank, Israel is finally able -- in 
the view of many of its liberal thinkers -- to return to the question, profound 
and contentious, of what kind of nation it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we were occupying another people, depriving the Palestinians by 
force of arms of their basic human and political rights, we were not a 
democratic state ourselves. And as long as we had more than 2 million 
Palestinians under us, we were on the way to losing our Jewish identity," 
philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can again ask ourselves the question, 'What does it mean for Israel to be 
Jewish? What kind of democracy should we have? What sort of nation are we? What 
sort of people should we aspire to be?' After a generation, those questions are 
back at the top of the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the iconoclastic Leibowitz challenged Israel's occupation of the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip immediately after the 1967 Middle East War, and called for 
a Palestinian state, he is joined today by many others closer to the Israeli 
political center in suggesting that the country must now confront new issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The glue of security has kept this country together," said Rabbi Naama 
Kelman, who directs Reform Judaism's education program here. "If we obtain 
peace with the Palestinians and then with the other Arab neighbors as we hope 
-- and that is a big if -- we will face serious questions like social unrest, 
poverty, domestic violence, intolerance, economic priorities and relations 
between synagogue and state. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Once Israelis are less concerned about physical security, they will have time 
to worry about spiritual security -- and they will find there is a lot to worry 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Israeli liberals, there already is a lengthening agenda: the role of 
religion in the Jewish state, improvement of education after years of 
degradation, relations between Jews and Arabs within Israel, how to close 
social gaps while encouraging entrepreneurs, the future of Judaism itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Many on the Israeli right share these concerns. But their focus, more than 
ever, is on security, because of their fear that an agreement with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian self-government will prove to 
be a deathtrap for the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Even liberals preface their discussions of where the country should go with 
clearly stated assumptions that the autonomy deal must be the first step into 
an era of peace -- and with warnings that if it fails, Israelis will respond 
"very, very vigorously and violently," as Rabbi David Hartman put it, and then 
retreat back into the "world of conflict" that they know so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelist Amos Oz, while noting that "everything depends on the Arabs and their 
acceptance of us," said it "already feels a bit strange -- this life 'after the 
(occupied) territories' and the possibility we will look out and not see 
someone ready to kill us." 
</P>
<P>
 "The overwhelming presence of conflict in our lives will diminish, and that is 
maybe already beginning," Oz said. "Just how should we spend the 'peace 
dividend'? It's a question now. We will have to go about our real business, but 
working out what our real business is will itself be a challenge. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I worry sometimes that Israel at peace will lose its character and become 
part of a homogenized, CNN world. That would be a great pity, because Jews form 
a unique instrument in the world orchestra of art and culture, and it would be 
a shame if it vanished." 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question is whether Israel is the end of Jewish history or another 
chapter of Jewish history," said Hartman, a theologian and philosopher. "People 
are wondering seriously about that. There is a profound Jewish identity crisis 
in Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 With the establishment of Israel as a modern state in 1948 -- and earlier, in 
the Zionist movement -- according to Hartman, Leibowitz and others, many Jews 
came to substitute the founding and building of a national home for the 
spiritual values and way of life that had defined Judaism for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's triumph in the 1967 war, including the conquest of the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, confirmed for many that "the whole biblical promise was being 
worked out . . . and we were living in God's redemptive scheme," Hartman said. 
"That meant they need not ask any difficult or embarrassing questions about the 
future of the Jewish people or the purpose of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 That was an illusion on virtually a national scale, Hartman and others 
maintain. And because of the fundamental shifts implicit in recognizing the 
Palestinians' right to self-determination, including a share of the biblical 
Land of Israel, Israelis will soon be searching for new points of orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religious Zionism has to offer a different perspective . . . a different way 
of understanding the return of the Jewish people to national sovereignty that 
doesn't define the holiness of the task by how much land you own but by the 
quality of daily life of the society," Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Breeson, who writes provocatively on political and social issues under 
the name "B. Michael" in Israel's largest newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, was even 
more pungent in assessing this historic juncture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over our 27 years in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank, we became 
occupation junkies, hooked on power and running -- and ruining -- other 
people's lives," Breeson said, "and now we have to give it up. That will be 
tough. People know they have to kick the habit -- and that means getting out 
entirely from the West Bank, settlements and all -- but they say, 'Just a 
little more.' 
</P>
<P>
 "What do they get instead? Quite banal problems like education, social 
welfare, garbage collection -- in short, ending the slow but very sure 
deterioration in our quality of life over the past 30, 40, even 50 years. This 
will be very difficult. It requires a sense of who we are and where we are 
going and proper leadership. At this point, we have neither." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Leibowitz expects that Israel's "liberation" from its long occupation will 
not only force the country to confront these challenges but provide the energy 
and new political and religious leaders to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "After partition, and we are partitioning the (biblical) Land of Israel to 
share it with the Palestinian people, we will have to fight out our internal 
problems, most of which we conveniently put aside for years," Leibowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the first, of course, will be the problem of the Jewish people, who for 
200 years have been in crisis, facing dissolution, disintegration and 
assimilation. If we do that, we will know where we are going and how to solve 
the other questions." 
</P>
<P>
 For secular Jews such as Ilana Hammerman, a prominent literary editor and 
translator, the questions may be the same as they are for Leibowitz, Hartman 
and others who are religious, but the answers are certain to be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is Israel a religious state, a theocracy run by rabbis, or is it democratic 
and pluralist?" Hammerman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a very big discussion on that. Having our lives run by rabbis, as it 
is now at the most important points like birth, marriage and death, is the 
first battle I will fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there is education -- that is the very future of our society. Next is 
the forced nationalism, the militarism and all the holy little rituals that 
remind me of countries we fled. What about the cultural conflicts we have among 
us? I could go on -- the list is long. But when can we start? If we have to 
wait another 40 years, we will cease to exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Many liberals are looking to an emerging generation of political leaders -- 
dovish in their approach to Israel's Arab neighbors, social democrats on 
domestic issues, pluralist in philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the good life as well as the secure life," Kelman said. "We are an 
urban people moving into the suburbs, Westernizing at a dizzying speed, anxious 
that our children are not only well-fed and well-educated but also well-dressed 
and, overall, getting on with life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been on this journey for a while, but the changes are crystallizing 
as peace becomes a real possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Oz also believes that "the future has already begun -- getting out of Gaza 
just confirmed it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn your back on Jerusalem and scan the entire coastal plain from Haifa down 
to Ashdod, and you see a land that is secular to the core, hedonistic, 
passionate, noisy, warmhearted, temperamental like Greece, Italy, Spain and 
North Africa," Oz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel is finding its place in the Mediterranean where it belongs. I like it. 
People smoke a lot, speak loudly, push a lot, but are open and creative, very 
creative. What makes me relatively optimistic is that it is not going to become 
a boring place for a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hartman insists on a spiritual renewal as the foundation for Israel's 
re-creation of itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest of the world in Israel is not because they feel greater computer 
technology is going to come out of here," he said, "but because they think in 
some way we are destined to be an important voice about the moral conscience, 
about God, about what the spiritual life is about and about the meaning of 
life."

SCHOOL FUROR MIRRORS L.A.'S STRUGGLES WITH DIVERSITY; EDUCATION: ARTS HIGH 
TEACHER IS REASSIGNED AFTER BOOING A STUDENT PLAY. UPROAR CENTERS ON RACISM, 
ARTISTIC FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you met Don Bondi, you'd see he is a dancer. At 61, his body twists and 
turns with nearly the ease of a kid's. His gait is deliberate, toes cocked 
outward, heels resting on an invisible cushion. His face belongs to an artist: 
It is lined, passionate, short of patience for those who do not share his 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 For nine years, Bondi has been teaching at the Los Angeles County High School 
for the Arts, an alternative school for budding artists and a cherished success 
in an educational system often associated with failure. 
</P>
<P>
 But since last month, Bondi has been barred from the halls of Arts High, 
reassigned indefinitely to a desk job at a school for troubled children. His 
offense: booing at a student Mexican-heritage production that portrayed Gov. 
Pete Wilson as a bumbling bigot who speaks in racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after his protest, Bondi, who is white, was confronted by a Latina 
school board member who warned him to "control your racism." Within the hour, 
board member Maria Elena Gaitan, whose son was among the actors in the show, 
had Bondi removed from his job. 
</P>
<P>
 The reassignment of Bondi, a founding Arts High faculty member and chairman of 
the dance department, has thrown the Eastside school into crisis, turning a 
behind-the-scenes struggle over racial diversity into a nasty public feud. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, Arts High, where nearly half of the student body and most 
of the faculty is white, has been grappling with how to expand the presence of 
minorities -- an awkward transition at a place that has been, by design, blind 
to color. With Bondi's ouster, the elite sanctuary for creative teens is being 
forced to openly confront one of the thorniest realities of the outside world: 
how to deal with a mostly white Los Angeles becoming a Los Angeles that is 
mostly not. Some fear the controversy threatens the school's very soul. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since the Wilson parody, students, faculty, administrators and 
parents have clashed in a disquieting debate over political correctness, racism 
and artistic freedom. "It is a reflection of what is going on in our time, if 
not at our school," said senior Rigo Jimenez, 17, who directed the Mexican 
heritage production. "People here are not exposed to that." 
</P>
<P>
 In an open letter distributed on campus, student body President Mosa 
Maxwell-Smith and senior theater student Justin Wheeler complained that Bondi's 
reassignment is a move toward the "destruction" of Arts High. Two weeks ago, 
dozens of students of all races skipped classes to protest outside the school, 
which is on the campus of Cal State Los Angeles and draws its 480 students from 
districts across the county through a rigorous audition process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are artists!" the letter said. "This institution was founded to perpetuate 
and teach art, to allow a haven of creativity for young artists of this 
community, not as a political arena for racial debate or a pawn to be wasted in 
a game of political intrigue." 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi, an accomplished dancer and choreographer with a loud voice and short 
fuse, has become an instant symbol of the school's internal wrenching. Friends 
see a dedicated and caring artist who has been victimized for being white and 
daring to speak his mind. Detractors describe an explosive and culturally 
insensitive old-timer who has a history of run-ins with administrators and is 
out of sync with changing Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi says he is a convenient target in a debate that has grown much larger 
than he. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a political thing," he said. "It has nothing to do with kids, except, 
unfortunately, young people are being used." 
</P>
<P>
 The moments that pushed Bondi to center stage came near the end of the 
hourlong show April 21 when a young actor portraying Wilson began a rambling 
monologue about Wilson's immigration policies. His remarks, which lasted only a 
few minutes, wasted no time in depicting the white governor as a racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, I am not racist," the Wilson character said. "I love 
Mexicans -- everyone should have one. . . . I even shop at K-Martinez, I mean 
Kmart. And I love Pick 'n' Spick." 
</P>
<P>
 That Bondi was offended by the scene was immediately evident. As the monologue 
came to a close, he joined a chorus of boos and hisses from the audience. Some 
of those jeering agreed with the portrayal and were protesting Wilson's 
politics. Others, like Bondi, saw the skit as an outrageous caricature of a 
white person. When the stage went dark, the auditorium fell mostly silent 
except for Bondi's continued objections, audible on a student videotape of the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 "How vulgar!" he announced from his seat near the rear. "A lack of taste!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that Gaitan, vice president of the county Board of Education, left 
her seat near the stage and approached Bondi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Control your racism!" she ordered from the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gaitan returned to her seat, student director Jimenez appeared on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we offended anyone. . .," he started to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have!" Bondi interrupted, his voice thick with rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You needed it then!" an angry Gaitan shouted from across the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the show ended, Gaitan approached Bondi again and escorted him outside. 
According to witnesses, the two engaged in a heated discussion en route to the 
principal's office, with Gaitan accusing Bondi of racism and at one point 
pushing him. Later, the witnesses said, Gaitan's son joined the fray, cursing 
at Bondi and threatening to physically harm him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened in front of 10 to 20 students," said Leslie Lopez, 17, a senior 
dance student and Bondi supporter. "They were yelling at each other. . . . She 
told him that everything he did for multiculturalism at the school was for 
show. She said that the dance department was racist too." 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, Bondi was handed papers placing him on temporary leave and 
ordered off campus. He was forbidden to return for performances of a play about 
the Holocaust that he had directed, and was allowed to attend his department's 
annual dance concert only in the company of an administration chaperon. Some 
students protested the decision by leaving an empty chair on stage and dressing 
in white with black gags. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi was subsequently instructed to report to an alternative school in 
Whittier while the county personnel division investigates the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaitan did not return telephone calls from The Times. County education 
spokeswoman Laurie Twineham said Gaitan and her colleagues on the Board of 
Education -- all of whom are appointed by the county Board of Supervisors -- 
refused requests to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi has been shaken to the core by the controversy but remains unrepentant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I booed because I wanted to make a point," he said. "And booing is a natural 
part of the theater. . . . Whether you like Pete Wilson or not, we are not here 
to defame people. There needs to be some guidance for young people as to what 
is appropriate in art. We are there to guide the young people, and I am always 
looking for innovative ways to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Arts High Principal Bo Vitolo said Bondi was reassigned with full pay, but 
would not comment further on the investigation. She described the Wilson skit 
as a "production piece" intended to draw a reaction from the audience, just as 
many professional films and plays do. She said she did not consider the parody 
racist, although she said the actor portraying Wilson "got swept away" by the 
role and spontaneously added lines that were not in the script submitted to a 
staff adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Bondi's booing, Vitolo said: "Freedom of expression has limitations, or 
we would have anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 The furor created by the Bondi-Gaitan clash is complicated by the fact that 
both have attracted unusual attention in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Bondi said, he was accused by two students of abuse after he 
squeezed a prickly seed pod in their hands during a class. Bondi, who said he 
was never charged or disciplined in the incident, said he has used the 
technique for years to demonstrate that dancing is painful. One class actually 
presented him with decorated pods as a graduation gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi has also clashed with administrators over issues of ethnic diversity. 
Although he has been credited with winning grants for multicultural programs 
dealing with Japanese, African American, Native American and Latino art and 
dance, he has also flatly opposed the school's growing emphasis on diversity, 
saying it undermines the unifying message art is meant to foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, he wrote a note to administrators complaining about a 
survey that asks incoming students to identify their ethnic origin. The form 
listed 20 classifications, only one for whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of document is divisive and separatist, possibly appealing to the 
political correct, but then in Nazi Germany it was politically correct to 
segregate . . . any group not considered 'Aryan' by those in power," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 David Flores, director of the county's division of alternative education, 
which oversees Arts High, responded with a memo describing Bondi's views as 
disturbing and ignorant and "reflective of your lack of sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaitan has made a name for herself at Arts High because of her willingness to 
question what she has called the school's "Eurocentric" curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1992 memo from former Principal James Cusak, Gaitan pushed to 
have recruitment materials printed in Spanish and questioned whether the 
school's program reflected "the cultural composition" of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Gaitan's involvement in the education of her son, now a senior, 
has struck some teachers, parents and students as inappropriate and meddlesome. 
They contend that she has used her influence to intervene on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Warner, a film director who works as a guest teacher at the school, said 
he was once summoned to a meeting with Flores and Gaitan after dismissing 
Gaitan's son from a school show for absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very unpleasant," Warner said. "I was subtly accused of 
mistreating her son because I threw him out for disciplinary reasons. She has 
said that she doesn't want to interfere in the school or her son's education, 
but she has done the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Vitolo acknowledged that Gaitan "wears two hats," but said she has 
taken the same interest in her son's education as many other parents do in 
their children's schooling.

 Administrator Flores said the issues surrounding the Bondi-Gaitan controversy 
have struck such a chord because they illustrate the pains of the larger 
discussion about diversity in a county where whites make up only a quarter of 
public high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of the . . . demographic shifts we see in Los Angeles County, 
and sometimes not everybody is comfortable with those changes," Flores said. 
"We have concerns from the community about access from all ethnic groups, and 
we have concerns from the staff that maybe things are changing too fast and 
from students that perhaps there may be preferential treatment in some cases 
for students from different ethnic minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores met a week ago with members of Friends of LACHSA, a parents' 
organization that helps set policy at the school, and agreed to create a task 
force to look into some of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, who have been split over Bondi's handling and the move toward greater 
diversity, requested the meeting. Some have called the school to complain, 
while others have written to the Board of Supervisors demanding Bondi's 
reinstatement and disciplinary action against Gaitan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is ironic that the biggest thing to come out of the handling of this case 
may be that the students will experience firsthand a brand of injustice at the 
hands of the administration that is precisely the kind that was hoped to be 
addressed in the Cinco de Mayo play in the first place," wrote Douglas B. 
Millar, a parent from Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Perez, co-president of the parents' group, said supporters of a more 
diverse school have been unfairly characterized by critics as wanting to 
hastily alter the school by eliminating white teachers and lowering admission 
standards. Perez, who has served on audition panels for new students, said that 
ethnicity has never played a role in the panels' decisions, and that teachers 
should only be replaced through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anybody who is saying we should let anyone go because their skin 
is the wrong color," Perez said. "But students need role models. If all of the 
faces students see as teachers are white, where are the role models?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well-known dancer and choreographer Rudy Perez, a guest instructor at Arts 
High who is not related to Judy Perez, said more than four decades working as a 
minority artist has taught him that racial agendas and art do not mix. He said 
Arts High is in the midst of an identity crisis, caught between its mission to 
be the best arts school possible and a social agenda to become more racially 
diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to decide what they want to be. Being an arts school means being 
different from other public schools," he said. "It should have nothing to do 
with race. It should be about individuals. When I grew up in New York, we 
didn't go around claiming pieces of the rainbow. We all considered ourselves 
Americans."

LAND FIRMS GIVE GREEN TO PARKS INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $2-billion statewide parks bond measure that has captured a broad base of 
support from California nature lovers has also attracted tens of thousands of 
dollars in campaign contributions from landowners who stand to gain if the 
initiative passes June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 If a majority of voters give the nod next week, Proposition 180 will free up 
the richest package of park bonds ever seen in California. The money would fund 
more than 400 land purchases, improvements and cultural projects statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents, ranging from environmental groups to law enforcement to community 
leaders, herald the measure -- known as CALPAW -- as an opportunity that may 
never present itself again. To wait for the Legislature to come up with such a 
sum to preserve open space would be to lose much of the land to development, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents attack CALPAW as too costly during an era when fundamental needs 
such as education, health care and crime-fighting beg for additional funding. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two sides squabble over pros and cons of the initiative, the 
campaign treasury of its sponsor, the Planning and Conservation League, grows 
exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $2 million has been raised to promote CALPAW, some of it from 
private, for-profit firms whose property is likely to be purchased if the 
measure passes. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Irvine Co., Orange County's vast landholder, donated $60,000 to the Yes 
on 180 campaign. A spokesman said the company has three parcels that would be 
purchased under the bond act for a total of $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avatar Properties gave $10,000 to the initiative effort. The firm, based in 
Coral Gables, Fla., owns land at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains in the 
western San Fernando Valley. If CALPAW passes, the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy plans to spend at least $13 million to acquire land in the area 
known as "Big Wild." Not all of that money would go to Avatar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canyon Oaks Estates L.P. gave $25,000 to the initiative effort. CALPAW would 
free up the final $5.8 million needed to complete the mountain conservancy's 
purchase of 662 acres of Canyon Oaks property in Topanga Canyon, a conservancy 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulk of the money behind CALPAW appears to be generated by the 
nonprofit groups that would benefit from its projects: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Big Sur Land Trust kicked in $300,000, so far the largest donation to 
the bond act's campaign. Trust executive director Brian Steen said CALPAW 
contains $32.6 million for scenic land in Monterey County. "We felt with that 
kind of opportunity, we needed to step up and make a good-sized investment to 
support 180," Steen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Philharmonic pumped $60,000 into the campaign in hopes of 
ultimately winning $15 million worth of improvements to the Hollywood Bowl, 
said Lynn Sadler, campaign director for the Planning and Conservation League. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not illegal for contributors to gain from a ballot measure they 
support, Sadler says her group took great pains not to accept any donations 
before the initiative's ballot language was finalized. That way, no one could 
claim that a particular project was included in exchange for a contribution, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very careful . . . so there would be no appearance of exchanges, no 
quid pro quo," Sadler said. "We made it so it's absolutely clear that 
everything's aboveboard." 
</P>
<P>
 But if that's the case, say two miffed state senators, why did the Planning 
and Conservation League slip language into the ballot measure exempting CALPAW 
from a state law requiring full disclosure of quid pro quo arrangements? 
</P>
<P>
 Among the general provisions of Proposition 180 is one that says "Section 5358 
of the Elections Code does not apply to this division." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) sponsored that law after growing 
concerns over the Planning and Conservation League's last parks measure -- 
Proposition 70, a $776-million bond initiative approved by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's suspicious," Kopp said. "They are trying to cover themselves. I oppose 
this and I strongly recommend its rejection." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Planning and Conservation League is trying to knock down 
Kopp's law through court appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Said state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), "What do they intend to do that 
they don't want any scrutiny of? Something tells me they are up to something." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadler says the group isn't trying to hide anything but merely added the 
wording to protect CALPAW from a potential legal challenge by its foes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always venal people who can sue and create havoc even though there's 
nothing there," Sadler said. "We could end up losing forests or wetlands while 
it's hung up in court for a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kopp and Wright oppose CALPAW primarily because of its cost, estimated at 
$142 million annually for the 25 years it will take to pay off interest and 
principal. They say they'd rather see voters choose the nearly $4 billion in 
earthquake, higher education and school bonds that are also on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In that view, they are joined by the organized opposition to the initiative, 
Taxpayers Against Proposition 180, a coalition including taxpayers groups, the 
California Chamber of Commerce, the Farm Bureau Federation and California 
Wildlife Federation. Coalition contributions to defeat Proposition 180 have 
totaled $85,000 so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest argument against it is that it was put together without any 
overall thought to how it might impact the financial health of California," 
said Stu Mollrich, coalition spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Planning and Conservation League argues that CALPAW is a prudent 
investment, particularly with land prices at their lowest in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has amassed a broad base of supporters, including Los Angeles 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams -- who praises CALPAW's proposed programs for 
at-risk urban youths -- the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
and the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of nature clubs, land trusts and preservation groups statewide have 
offered backing to CALPAW, including the heavyweights -- the Sierra Club, the 
California Native Plant Society, the Audubon Society and the Nature 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 At eight phone banks throughout the state, volunteers make calls from two 
dozen telephones, trying to spread their now-or-never message to convince 
voters that they have a historic opportunity to expand parklands. 
</P>
<P>
 About two-thirds of the parks bond money is earmarked for buying land to 
protect it from development. Backers are quick to point out they will only 
approach willing sellers, and do not plan to kick anybody off their property. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, three parcels owned by the Irvine Co. -- including a 77-acre 
blufftop property in Newport Beach and more than 2,000 acres of a pristine 
greenbelt in Laguna Canyon -- are slated to be purchased with $36 million 
provided by CALPAW. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. spokesman Larry Thomas said the Planning and Conservation League 
worked directly with local environmental groups and governments to draw up a 
list of Orange County projects. The league, he said, did not approach the 
Irvine Co. about being included. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Nature Conservancy asked for a donation to help the CALPAW 
campaign, the Irvine Co. came up with $60,000. "We were solicited by them," 
Thomas said. "They made a commitment to PCL to raise X amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environmental groups with which we work view this bond issue as probably 
the most significant environmental effort of the past decade," Thomas said. 
"Given the high priority these organizations placed on this bond measure, we've 
been responsive when they've asked us for support." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, CALPAW -- shorthand for the California Parks and 
Wildlife Initiative -- would provide more than $360 million for various parks, 
improvements to cultural facilities, youth programs and land acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, it would spiff up the Santa Monica Pier's promenade, the 
Venice Beach waterfront, the Hollywood Bowl, the Museum of Chinese History, the 
California Museum of Science and Industry, the Afro-American Museum and the 
property around the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Los Angeles County's piece of the pie would go to the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy or its sister agency, the Mountains Recreation and 
Conservation Authority, for land purchases and programs in a vast area ranging 
from Whittier to Pasadena to Santa Clarita to the Malibu coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said in interviews that, among the lands included on the 
CALPAW wish list are portions of Canyon Oaks in Topanga Canyon and Avatar 
properties south of Tarzana and Woodland Hills. Company officials could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Senate analysis of CALPAW, the initiative also contains 
language to repeal a state law sunset provision that strips the conservancy of 
any state general fund money after July 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 To Wright, a frequent critic of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, this 
is another sign that CALPAW's reach stretches too far. "What they are trying to 
do is remove what little oversight we have of that agency, and I think that's 
wrong." 
</P>

L.A. GANGS' NEW TARGET -- VEGAS STRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like corporate raiders seeking new markets to exploit, Los Angeles gang 
members have come gunning for easy money on the high-rolling Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 In a spree of brazen invasion-style heists -- three of them in the last three 
months -- suspected Bloods and Crips have stormed into casinos, rifled through 
the cashier's cages and made off with tens of thousands of dollars in a matter 
of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 No bystanders have been injured in any of the holdups, which reflect the 
continuing evolution of some South-Central gangs into profit-driven 
enterprises. But the robberies, captured on dramatic surveillance videotape, 
have stunned this mushrooming tourist mecca and forced image-conscious 
proprietors to begin beefing up their intentionally low-key security measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see these guys jumping like animals over the counters with their 
pillowcases ready to fill with booty, that really strikes fear in people's 
hearts," said Beecher Avants, security chief at the Gold Coast and a candidate 
for Clark County sheriff. "This is going to continue . . . as long as we leave 
cash laying out there like candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with a November, 1992, robbery at the San Remo Hotel and Casino, 
there have been seven casino heists in Las Vegas, including holdups at the 
Aladdin, the Flamingo Hilton, Harrah's and the San Remo again. Although Los 
Angeles gangs are suspected in five of the crimes, authorities have had enough 
evidence to file charges in only two. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost every case, at least three or four masked gunmen have burst into the 
neon-bathed gambling halls, waving shotguns and shouting for everyone to hit 
the floor. A few times, the crowds failed even to hear the commands, drowned 
out by the clatter of slot machines and the unshakable lounge bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaulting over the belly-high counters of the cashier's cages, the robbers have 
scooped up bundles of large bills, then sped away in stolen cars. One group of 
alleged thieves, all suspected Crips, was caught in Las Vegas after a 
high-speed chase. The 15-year-old triggerman in another casino robbery was 
arrested in South-Central Los Angeles after an informant overheard him boasting 
about his feat. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the loot, which has ranged from $47,000 to $158,000, has been 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like they think we're the new frontier, that we're easy pickin's," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Victoria Villegas, who successfully urged a 30-year prison 
term for the juvenile shooter. "We're trying to send a message to L.A. gangs 
that this is not going to be looked upon lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the old days, when legendary mobster Bugsy Siegel first envisioned a 
shimmering oasis in the desert, the implied threat of Mafia retaliation was 
enough to discourage almost anyone from pulling such a high-stakes heist. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran newsman Don Digilio likes to tell the tale of Tony Brancato, a daring 
crook who stole $4,000 from the race book at Siegel's Flamingo in 1951 with 
three henchmen. When mysterious fates befell all his cohorts, the story goes, 
Brancato decided he was better off surrendering to the FBI -- only to be shot 
to death in a parked car in Hollywood shortly after his release on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is . . . a big-time problem here that wouldn't be one if the 
broken-nose crowd still ran the gambling houses," Digilio wrote in a Las Vegas 
Sun column last month. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Mafia's influence waned, large publicly held corporations moved in, 
eager to erase the Sin City image. In their effort to lure a more 
family-oriented clientele, many of the Strip's tonier resorts toned down their 
security features, replacing armed guards with radio-toting officers in sports 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditionalists could still go downtown to haunts such as Binion's 
Horseshoe, a dark, wood-paneled joint where iron bars cover the cashier's 
window and the Western-style guards swagger with large revolvers on their hips. 
But at the fuchsia-trimmed Flamingo, now owned by the Hilton chain, company 
officials decided to yank out the cashier's bars two years ago on an interior 
designer's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to make everything very open and inviting," said Flamingo 
spokesman Terry Lindberg. "Unfortunately, it was to the wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 22, four young men in ski masks burst through the doors, dashed past 
Bugsy's Bar, knocked over a blackjack table and hurled themselves over the 
unprotected cashier's counter, where Shipley Stratford was ducking for cover. 
"Don't look at me, bitch," one of the robbers snarled. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a minute, they had escaped with more than $150,000. Stratford, 28, 
recalls that her terror briefly melted when she spotted one of the fleeing 
thieves -- dressed in baggy gang style -- struggling to pull up his pants from 
around his ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flamingo's management wasted no time enclosing her cashier's cage again 
with shiny gold-colored bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot safer now, really," said Stratford, who had trouble sleeping 
after the attack. "Without the bars here, you're just so vulnerable and 
exposed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably only a matter of time, authorities say, before South-Central's 
gangs seized upon Vegas' vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the last decade, Crips and Bloods have been evolving from 
turf-oriented neighborhood cliques into business-minded outfits. Some of the 
more sophisticated factions have helped fuel a nationwide drug-trafficking 
network, while others have been linked to the alarming rise in Southern 
California bank robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our gangbangers are master opportunists," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Sgt. Wes McBride, who fields calls from law enforcement agencies across the 
country seeking information about Crips and Bloods migrating from Los Angeles. 
"Like any predator, they take what they can get." 
</P>
<P>
 With the crack cocaine market saturated and banks rapidly bolstering security, 
gang experts say, the fast cash of Las Vegas became a lucrative target. Not 
only are many of the cashier's cages wide open, but there is little chance that 
a security guard would risk firing a gun in a casino crowded with tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what gets taken in a robbery, it's not as much as they'd have to 
pay if Grandma gets shot at the damn slot machine," said Jim Galipeau, a deputy 
probation officer in South-Central. "It's well-known in the gang community that 
you can go in and take anything you want from a Vegas casino as long as you can 
get out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Six suspected gang members between the ages of 17 and 24 currently are 
awaiting trial for their alleged roles in the Harrah's and San Remo heists. 
Four suspects in the Aladdin robbery also were arrested, though later released 
for lack of evidence, after an anti-gang raid at their South-Central home 
unexpectedly turned up a bag full of the casino's money wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
 The only suspect to be convicted is 15-year-old Donathan Darnell Smith, known 
on the streets as Deuce Dog, who entered the San Remo casino in August with 
three youthful-looking friends. 
</P>
<P>
 When a security guard told them they would have to leave, court records show, 
Donathan stuck a .22-caliber pistol to his head. "You, whitey. . . . I'm going 
to blow your brains out," the guard, Colin Keel, recalled his attacker saying. 
</P>
<P>
 As Donathan's cohorts leaped into the casino cage and snatched $78,000 in 
cash, Keel tried to grab the gun, which discharged into the boy's thigh. The 
guard broke free and began to flee. Donathan, though wounded, fired at him 
several more times. After Las Vegas police caught up with him a few months 
later in Los Angeles, Donathan confessed that he had been paid $150 for his 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Donathan's public defender and gang veterans said he had been used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of the big homies sending the little homies in on suicide 
missions," said T. Rodgers, an ex-Bloods leader who now works as a TV producer 
for "Behind Bars," an upcoming Fox series based on jailhouse interviews. "The 
younger homies only want to earn some respect, but the older homies treat them 
like they're expendable. It's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the wave of robberies does not seem to have had any ill effect on the 
seemingly insatiable demand for gambling in Las Vegas, which annually lures 
more than 20 million visitors to its multibillion-dollar casino industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing the potential for serious harm, however, the Nevada Gaming Control 
Board this month met with casino chiefs, Las Vegas police and the U.S. 
attorney's office to map a preventive strategy. Afterward, the board issued an 
advisory, recommending that all casinos consider installing more bars, alarms 
and surveillance cameras, as well as reducing the amount of cash available in 
the casino cages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Future robberies involving serious injury or death could, in addition to the 
tremendous harm suffered by individuals, have a very negative impact on our 
tourism and gaming industry," the May 17 memo warned. 
</P>
<P>
 At some of the Strip's more posh resorts, where the exotic theme is as big a 
draw as the casino itself, officials have been reluctant to erect any barriers 
that might detract from the aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 William Thompson, a gaming expert at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 
likens this to his own unsuccessful attempt to market in-room safes to the 
hotels; several balked, he said, because they didn't want to create the 
impression that the rooms were not secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these places are more worried about the perception than the reality," 
Thompson said.

U.S. LAWMAKERS RENEW WARNING TO NORTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a breakdown in talks between a U.N. team and North Korea, U.S. lawmakers 
issued new warnings Sunday about the consequences if Pyongyang does not agree 
to international monitoring to prevent development of a nuclear weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the defense of South Korea a "sacred obligation," Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.) said the North Korean government's brinkmanship could ultimately 
endanger its survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang "should make no mistake about our dedication, our intention and our 
absolute firmness in continuing the course of making sure they do not become a 
nuclear weapons state," Nunn said on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions heightened over the weekend when North Korea announced that it will 
continue unloading spent fuel at its main Yongbyon nuclear reactor but would 
"never allow" the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the facility to 
determine whether fuel has been secretly diverted from energy to weapons use. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has repeatedly denied that it has any form of nuclear weapons 
program, but U.S. intelligence agencies believe that enough enriched plutonium 
has been siphoned off to make one or two crude bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 After talks broke down Saturday, part of the IAEA team left North Korea, 
abruptly ending the latest effort in the 16-month crisis that has swung 
erratically between near-calamity and tentative cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse could open the way for punitive U.N. economic sanctions, which 
North Korea has said it will treat as an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want a war," added Nunn, who is chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. But "if North Korea brings a war in reaction to any kind of 
sanctions, then they will bring about the destruction of their own country." 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the Clinton Administration has tried a carrot-and-stick strategy 
to engage the Communist state, offering diplomatic and economic incentives in 
exchange for cooperation on its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang's latest actions indicate that tactic may have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn said Pyongyang faces three alternatives -- and three different responses: 
</P>
<P>
 First, cooperation, which would be rewarded with membership in the family of 
nations through "trade and intercourse." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, resisting nuclear weapons monitoring, which would cause "a very 
serious financial situation, which could lead to their own disintegration." 
</P>
<P>
 And third, aggression, which would bring military defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The North Koreans are playing brinkmanship -- this is their historical 
pattern -- but playing this game has very dangerous consequences," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying there are still methods of avoiding military confrontation, Sen. Bill 
Bradley (D-N.J.) suggested that the Clinton Administration exert pressure 
through Japan's economic ties and China's energy links. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you have two vises right there that can begin to squeeze, that might 
indeed take place if there were ever economic sanctions voted at the U.N. 
against North Korea," he said, also on "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Security Council members met Friday to discuss the standoff, and more 
talks are scheduled at the United Nations on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the holiday weekend, the Clinton Administration is expected to have to 
rethink its tactics on North Korea's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the crisis appeared to take on new urgency when the IAEA, the U.N. 
nuclear monitoring agency, notified the Security Council that North Korea was 
removing the reactor's fuel rods so quickly that evidence of diverting fuel to 
a weapons program could be erased "within days." 
</P>
<P>
 International concern mounted further over the weekend with reports out of 
Japan that North Korea may soon test an advanced version of the Rodong 1 
missile, which could reach most of western Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Military analysts believe that the missile would be capable of carrying a 
nuclear warhead if it were refitted for that purpose.

ERICH HONECKER, MASTERMIND OF BERLIN WALL, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL and WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erich Honecker, the former East German Communist leader who built the Cold 
War's most chilling monument, the infamous Berlin Wall, died of liver cancer 
Sunday at his home in exile here. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Honecker, who ruled for 18 years before the collapse of communism, had lived 
in Chile with his wife and his daughter's family since January, 1993, when 
Berlin judges ruled he was too ill to stand trial in connection with shootings 
at the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 He lived his final days in sickness and bitterness, according to Chilean 
friends, still a committed Communist who fretted about the "social 
deterioration" of a unified Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Honecker led the Communist East German state between 1971 and 1989, 
he will be remembered most for what he did long before -- building the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the structure served as a metaphor for the uncompromising, 
neo-Stalinist views Honecker held throughout his rule. 
</P>
<P>
 His regime fostered the most pervasive secret police organization in Communist 
Europe, penned in its people and shot those who tried to flee to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Honecker's successor as head of the East German state, Egon Krenz, pleaded 
Sunday for "a fair judgment" of Honecker's life, saying, "He wanted to realize 
the dream of humanism." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that Honecker had 
failed in his political goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "His policies brought harm to countless people," government spokesman Dieter 
Vogel said. "Erich Honecker failed. Perhaps he didn't recognize it, but history 
gave proof of his failure." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, news of Honecker's death drew shrugs of indifference in his 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I couldn't care less about Honecker, and I'm sure the same 
goes for most east Germans," said Klaus Sternberg, a teacher in Schwerin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in heaven now, and he can sit down with Marx, Engels and Lenin and think 
over what went wrong," said Lutz Wagner, a salesman in eastern Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early part of his years in power, Honecker enjoyed success. But later, 
poor health, advanced age and political isolation left him increasingly 
vulnerable to the winds of change sweeping the region. 
</P>
<P>
 An unbending hard-liner, he disliked the Soviet Union's reform-minded leader, 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and was deeply suspicious of the liberalization under way 
in other parts of Moscow's empire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Honecker was toppled by massive anti-government street 
demonstrations that marked the decisive phase of the 1989 East German 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 His control over the East German state had been so complete, and his fall so 
sudden, that Politburo colleagues who witnessed his political demise said 
Honecker was incapable of grasping what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Krenz has said that when he informed the ousted leader of his expulsion from 
the Communist Party, Honecker "had not understood at all" the contents of the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1980 memoirs, "About My Life," Honecker described proudly how, as the 
Politburo member responsible for state security, he organized the operation 
that in a matter of a few pre-dawn hours on Aug. 13, 1961, cut one of Europe's 
largest cities in two, closed the last remaining hole in the Iron Curtain and 
stunned the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "At midnight the alarm was sounded and the action began," he wrote. "With it 
began an operation that . . . would make the world take notice. Later we 
determined with satisfaction that we had forgotten nothing essential (in the 
preparations)." 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-mile-long, heavily fortified wall through and around West Berlin 
endured for 28 years as the most compelling symbol of an ideologically divided 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost 10 years after supervising the Wall's construction that Honecker 
succeeded Walter Ulbricht as Communist Party boss and de facto East German 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Honecker was driven from power three weeks before the Wall's collapse in 
November, 1989, in a series of events that heralded the fall of Soviet Bloc 
communism itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The concrete barrier that he and other members of the East German hierarchy 
called the "anti-fascist protection wall" had effectively halted the westward 
flight of skilled manpower that threatened to bleed the Communist state to 
economic death. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its horror, Western economic and political analysts subsequently 
admitted that the Wall enabled East Germany to survive as a poorer neighbor of 
a highly successful West German state. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Aug. 25, 1912, in the western town of Neunkirchen as the third of six 
children of a coal miner, Honecker began his political career at age 10 by 
joining a Communist youth group. At 18, he became a full party member, quickly 
taking on responsibility in the Saarland region for stirring the party's youth 
into street actions during the tumultuous final days of Germany's Weimar 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Spotted by the party's leadership as a future talent, Honecker was sent to 
Moscow's Communist Youth International School for a year and returned to become 
youth propaganda chief for his home region at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
 After Adolf Hitler's Nazis seized power in 1933, Honecker worked 
surreptitiously to stir resistance among factory workers in several parts of 
Germany, including the industrial Ruhr Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 He was finally arrested in Berlin by the Nazi secret police, the Gestapo, 
convicted in 1936 of treason and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He remained 
there until advancing Allied forces reached his prison, 30 miles west of 
Berlin, and freed him in the fading days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 His comparatively light sentence and preferential treatment during his 
imprisonment led to persistent rumors that he had cooperated with his Nazi 
captors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rumors continued virtually to the end, with reports that at the crucial 
1989 Politburo meeting where Honecker was toppled, East German secret police 
chief Erich Mielke finally forced a reluctant Honecker to give up power by 
threatening to publicize apparently damning evidence relating to his actions in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 After his release from prison in the Soviet-controlled occupation zone, 
Honecker, then 33, joined the newly formed Communist hierarchy that would 
eventually lead the East German state. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially responsible for the reconstituted Communist youth organization, the 
Free German Youth, he joined the Politburo as security chief in 1958, later 
planning the Berlin Wall operation and emerging as Ulbricht's heir apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 During this period, he divorced his first wife and married Margot Feist, a 
youth group functionary, who eventually became his education minister. Also an 
unbending hard-liner, she was believed by many East Germans to reinforce his 
allergy to reform. She remained with him to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign affairs, Honecker concluded a treaty with West Germany in 1972 that 
formalized relations between the two states but avoided full mutual diplomatic 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord eased travel restrictions on westerners visiting East Germany and 
permitted East German pensioners to visit the West. 
</P>
<P>
 It also paved the way for East Germany's longed-for acceptance in the global 
community, giving it a U.N. seat and relations with key Western countries, 
including the United States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Honecker received Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the first 
head of government from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to visit East 
Berlin, and three years later he crowned his achievements with an official trip 
to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Honecker signed the Helsinki Final Act on security and human rights 
along with other European leaders in 1975, he kept East Germany among the 
Soviet Bloc's most hard-line states. 
</P>
<P>
 He also refined East Germany's cynical policy of "selling" political prisoners 
for badly needed Western goods and hard currency needed for economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the mid-1960s and the fall of the Berlin Wall, West Germany is 
believed to have paid about $2 billion for the freedom of a quarter-million 
East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent information has revealed that East German judges were given quotas of 
people to sentence so that the supply of political prisoners remained high 
enough to guarantee the needed hard-currency income. 
</P>
<P>
 In his later years, the small, feisty Honecker became increasingly remote even 
from his own people, frequently delivering dry, uninspiring speeches in his 
strange, high-pitched lilt at such speed that he invariably swallowed his 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 One party member invited to the inner sanctum of his government offices for a 
reception in the mid-1980s was shocked that even in this safe, closed circle, 
Honecker remained distant and stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He marched in, sat down, picked a paper from his pocket, read it and then 
left," the party member said. "It was as if an invisible wall were between him 
and the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 In a visit to East Berlin in early October, 1989, Gorbachev urged Honecker to 
liberalize, warning him that "history punishes those who delay." 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks, Gorbachev's prediction became fact and Honecker was ousted 
by a panicky Politburo trying to save itself from being overwhelmed by the 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Mentally out of touch and suffering from liver cancer, Honecker was briefly 
arrested in January, 1990, and charged with treason but was released 36 hours 
later for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Following German unification, the Bonn government issued its own arrest 
warrant for Honecker, this time on Wall-related manslaughter charges. But by 
then, Honecker had been moved to a Soviet military hospital south of Berlin and 
the warrant could not be served. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently out of a sense of loyalty to a former fellow Communist leader, 
Gorbachev personally approved Honecker's secret flight to Moscow in March, 
1991, where he remained out of reach of German authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 With the failure of the August, 1991, coup in Moscow and the collapse of 
hard-line Soviet power, Honecker fled to the Chilean Embassy, where his friend, 
Clodomiro Almeyda, was ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 Honecker was eventually returned to Berlin in July, 1992, to face up to 75 
criminal charges -- most of them linked to shooting deaths that occurred at the 
Berlin Wall during his rule. 
</P>
<P>
 He was put on trial a few months later with Mielke and other members of the 
East German regime in proceedings that some likened to the post-World War II 
trials of Nazi leaders at Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
 But suffering from depression and advanced cancer, he was released for health 
reasons in January, 1993, and allowed to fly to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Long reported from Santiago, Chile, and Marshall reported from Berlin.

EX-AIDE TO FARRAKHAN SHOT IN LEGS; VIOLENCE: FORMER NATION OF ISLAM SPOKESMAN, 
THREE OTHERS ARE WOUNDED AFTER SPEECH IN RIVERSIDE. A SUSPECT IS BEATEN BY 
CROWD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A gunman identified as a former Nation of Islam minister shot and wounded 
controversial former Nation of Islam spokesman Khallid Abdul Muhammad here 
Sunday on the steps outside a university auditorium where Muhammad had just 
spoken, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, 43, was hit in the left leg by at least one of five or six shots 
from a 9-millimeter handgun, officials said. He also suffered a graze wound to 
the right leg. He was in satisfactory condition after surgery at Riverside 
Community Hospital, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Nation of Islam bodyguards were also wounded. Caliph Sadig, 33, of Upland 
was in satisfactory condition with a wound in the upper right back. Another 
guard, Varnado Puckett, 34, of Pomona was shot three times. He was in serious 
condition, undergoing surgery at Riverside General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth victim, evidently a bystander, was identified by authorities as 
Terrell D. Strait, 20, of Pomona. He was shot in the left shoulder and stomach 
and was in good condition at Riverside Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman -- wearing a dark suit, dress shirt and tie "characteristic of what 
(Muhammad's) security people were wearing," said UC Riverside spokesman Jack 
Chappell -- stepped from a crowd of about 50 people outside the auditorium 
where Muhammad had just spoken and fired from five to 10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman was severely beaten by the crowd, some of whom reportedly shouted, 
"He works for the Jews." (Muhammad was fired as a top aide to Nation of Islam 
leader Louis Farrakhan after making harshly anti-Semitic remarks last year.) 
Police plucked the bloodied man from the angry crowd and put him in a police 
car until he could be taken away by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 Police late Sunday identified the suspect as James Edward Bess, 49, of 
Seattle, a former Nation of Islam minister who had been expelled from the 
ministry, according to Chappell. No motive for the shooting has been discussed 
by officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahromuz, a longtime Muhammad friend who was standing on the auditorium steps 
next to Muhammad when he was shot, said someone had just asked him to compare 
the struggle of Latinos with those of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing I remember him saying was, 'The same dog that bit you, bit 
me,' " said Ahromuz. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, just pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. It was so close. I just took my 
daughter and hit the ground," he said. "I heard a bullet echo in my ear and I 
could smell gunpowder." 
</P>
<P>
 In the chaos after the 6:09 p.m. shooting, Ahromuz said, several young African 
American men attacked some white people who had rushed to the scene, but others 
who had been at the speech intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Fruit of Islam, the Nation of Islam's security contingent, 
carried the wounded Muhammad back through the building to a waiting white 
Lincoln Continental and hurried him to Riverside Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Press photographer William Lewis said angry supporters descended on 
the gunman and pummeled him as police attempted to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just kicking and stomping him in the head. That's where the 
pandemonium was. They dragged the shooter out by the nape of his neck, blood 
dripping," he said. "People were still trying to get their kicks in. The police 
were trying to protect him. And the people wouldn't let him get out." 
</P>
<P>
 UC Riverside senior Mark Thaler, who attended the speech, saw the suspect 
later, "a bloodied head, and (he was) propped up" in the back of the police 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad's son, 9-year-old Farrakhan Khallid Muhammad, was carried away by 
aides as he screamed, "Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!" The boy, who frequently appears on 
stage with Muhammad, did not appear to be injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Under intense security that included pat-downs and bag searches and a hefty 
presence of Riverside police, campus security as well as Fruit of Islam, nearly 
450 people had entered the Student Recreation Center to hear Muhammad, who was 
sponsored by the African Student Alliance at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 During the speech, about 70 protesters picketed silently outside, among them 
Jewish and Roman Catholic students. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, three people were thrown out of the building after they began heckling 
Muhammad. Campus officials identified one of them as Irv Rubin, a member of the 
Jewish Defense League. 
</P>
<P>
 After the speech, Muhammad stepped outside, where 50 or 60 people were 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a speech, he likes to deal with the people, which irritates his 
security," a friend of Muhammad's told The Times. "Security is more worried 
about Khallid than Khallid himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's speech had given the university pause, said Chappell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The administration was very concerned that there would be protesters, but the 
student group followed all the processes," Chappell said. "For us to deny them 
the opportunity for him to speak would have been a denial of free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 The friend said that on Saturday night, Muhammad had stayed two hours after 
the end of his Los Angeles speech to talk to people in the Crenshaw district 
theatre where he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early-morning hours Sunday, after his Los Angeles speech, Muhammad had 
gone with friends to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, a restaurant at Pico 
Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, where he ate dinner without incident, surrounded 
by his security escort. 
</P>
<P>
 That Muhammad arouses strong passions has been evident since his controversial 
remarks in November at a New Jersey college about Jews, comments that got 
Muhammad fired from his job as senior aide to Nation of Islam head Louis 
Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad said that Jews and Arabs were "the bloodsuckers of the black nation 
and the black community," and suggested that Jews brought the Holocaust upon 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 After his speech was denounced by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Congressional 
Black Caucus and President Clinton, Farrakhan was forced to reprimand Muhammad 
and suspend him from his role as top aide and spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Farrakhan said he agreed with Muhammad's remarks, he disagreed with 
how he said it. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, however, said he was told his speech was "repugnant, malicious, 
mean-spirited. . . . I feel very hurt over those words, to be honest." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges the raw nerves his speeches touch, saying again and again, 
"I'm a truth terrorist, I'm a knowledge gangster." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, Steven Windmueller, community relations director of the 
Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, said, "The Jewish community 
certainly finds the politics of hate of Khallid Muhammad to be problematic, and 
we certainly reject many of the views he puts forth. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we separate out his politics of hate from the violence of the street, 
which occurred earlier this evening." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech Saturday night before about 1,000 people in a Crenshaw district 
theatre, Muhammad returned to the name-calling themes that made him so 
controversial: he denounced Jews as "bagel-eating" and "hook-nosed," named 
prominent Jewish entertainment and news media figures he claimed promoted 
negative images of blacks, and contended that "the black Holocaust is one 
hundred times worse than any other holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 To the furious applause and screams of agreement from his audience, Muhammad 
declared that "the worst crime that can be committed is to be robbed of 
self-knowledge."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: DEBATING IN SHORT, SIMPLE SENTENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson will need to sharpen his debate game before facing Kathleen 
Brown -- or John Garamendi, or Tom Hayden or even Ron Unz again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the only debate of the Republican gubernatorial primary, Wilson on Friday 
was too long-winded, too testy and too humdrum. There was no attempt to tell 
voters why a second Wilson term might be better than the first. 
</P>
<P>
 The novice Unz, a young rags-to-riches computer nerd, projected even less 
warmth than the governor. But he was succinct in arguing his conservative 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, this was a failed format from the start. Wilson sat in a Phoenix 
hotel room with a telephone receiver pressed to his face -- his staff didn't 
even get him earphones -- while Unz and talk radio's Michael Jackson 
commiserated and collaborated in a Los Angeles studio. Wilson miscalculated by 
not ducking out of a governors' conference and flying to Los Angeles for the 
hourlong KABC debate. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, Wilson was the odd man out. He was ganged up on by Unz and 
Jackson, both impatient at what the host disrespectfully called the governor's 
"droning on." Wilson had trouble hearing. He and Unz talked over each other. 
Jackson couldn't control the debate. And many listeners probably got a 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
 There seemed to be as much debating between Wilson and Jackson as between the 
governor and Unz. "I'm perfectly happy to cover whatever (issues) you want," 
Wilson told Jackson at one touchy point. "No you're not," the host replied. 
Another time, Jackson advised Wilson there was a danger "we'll all yawn to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson frequently shook his head in frustration, sometimes signaling Unz to 
interrupt the governor, not that Unz needed any such prod. He interrogated 
Wilson as much as the host did. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the air, during a commercial break, Jackson commented: "I won't say who, 
but somebody had a charisma bypass." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson clearly meant Wilson and after the show said: "I was more than a 
little frustrated. I don't like being rude, but I wanted to get to as many 
issues as possible and avoid the droning on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson experienced a governor all too familiar to reporters. Ask Wilson a 
question and often you get a rambling and repetitive speech. But even the best 
of politicians -- Ronald Reagan included -- tend to suffer from meander mouth. 
And the malady worsens the longer they are exposed to high office. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always figured this is because senior aides are afraid to tell their 
bosses the truth -- that they talk too much and don't listen enough and often 
aren't very interesting. Also, the politicians believe their records will be 
"understood" if only they can "educate" the press and the public on every 
minute detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters may tolerate this, but the public won't -- not in an era of channel 
surfing through TV sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Wilson is at his best when parrying with reporters at a news 
conference. He usually is precise and concise. It's when he becomes bent on 
"educating" that he stumbles into a verbal quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the age of brevity," Jackson noted to reporters. And he praised the 
three Democratic candidates -- Treasurer Brown, Insurance Commissioner 
Garamendi and Sen. Hayden -- for being brief, "strong and decisive" in a radio 
debate he had moderated two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics said the Democrats' answers were "canned," a reporter noted. 
"Well, if your 'canned' is an honest canned, be canned," the radio veteran 
advised. "Be candid and canned." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The debate was manna for Unz, who says he is out of money for TV ads after 
having spent $1 million of his own savings for commercials in April. He has 
never before run for office, but still was getting 29% of the Republican vote 
-- against Wilson's 52% -- in the latest Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Friday, the political neophyte was being treated as a coequal of 
California's governor in a debate carried live by radio stations throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Wilson allow this to happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his advisers had cautioned against it. "I'm not wild about this," 
campaign manager George Gorton had said before the debate. "If I had my 
druthers, I'd ignore Unz." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson quickly accepted the offer, aides insist, because he always has debated 
his opponents. They deny being worried about Unz's vote, although there's 
obviously some anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 They indicate the main reason for accepting is that Wilson anticipates 
challenging Brown -- the presumed Democratic nominee -- to a series of fall 
debates and doesn't want to be criticized for refusing to debate his GOP 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 But before his next debate, Wilson should take a refresher course in framing 
compact responses.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PRIMARY BATTLES TAKE A HOLIDAY OF SORTS ON MEMORIAL DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of California's most disengaged primary election campaigns in memory heads 
into its final week this Memorial Day, barely noticed by most Californians -- 
even when a candidate for secretary of state battered his foe with nice words. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contest for governor, five candidates, including incumbent Republican 
Gov. Pete Wilson, maintained a generally relaxed schedule Sunday and today, 
compared to past elections when candidates battled for every last possible 
voter at holiday rallies and in television ad blitzes. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical flurry of faxed press releases -- usually the desperation vehicles 
for negative attacks at this stage of the campaign -- dribbled to a trickle 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, two of them were a bit out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller confessed that he had found it 
extremely difficult to run against an old friend, former Los Angeles City 
Councilman Michael Woo, as they battled for the Democratic nomination for 
secretary of state, along with Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any case," Miller added in his public letter to Woo, "I do want to commend 
you for honoring your commitment you made when you announced to avoid running a 
negative campaign. . . . I think we have set a good example thus far on how 
campaigns should be run and I think Californians appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller concluded: "Talk with you after this is over." 
</P>
<P>
 The other fax was a news release from the state Republican Party erroneously 
condemning Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer of California -- who is not 
running for anything this year -- for "wasting taxpayers' money on a White 
House wedding for her daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Boxer is a classic perk-oholic," intoned state GOP Chairman Tirso del 
Junco, a Los Angeles surgeon. "Once again she has shown contempt for the 
taxpayers of California." 
</P>
<P>
 The release alleged that Boxer's daughter, Nicole, had been married Saturday 
to Tony Rodham, brother of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, "at an elaborate 
ceremony in the White House despite the extraordinary expense to the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Clinton and Boxer families said they paid for the private 
ceremony and there was no cost to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 This Memorial Day was different from most campaign years, in that the primary 
election comes on the last day possible, June 7. Usually, the holiday is the 
final weekend of the campaign. This year, there is one more weekend to struggle 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there was little sense that the campaigns were engaged head to head, 
as is traditional at this point in a California primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend was also something of a letdown after a hectic week in which the 
three Democratic candidates for governor held three debates on consecutive 
days, Monday through Wednesday. And on Friday, Wilson and his conservative GOP 
challenger, Ron Unz, held a quickly arranged one-hour debate on radio from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate with the most active holiday schedule was Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown, the front-runner in the polls for the Democratic nomination for 
governor. Brown took a two-day bus run up the Central Valley, including 
Memorial Day talks to American Legion groups in Turlock and Modesto and a 
parade in Hughson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's final stop today was to be a picnic and kite-flying contest at a 
regional park in Lodi, south of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's major foe, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, visited black 
churches in South-Central Los Angeles Sunday and met with community leaders 
assembled by Rep. Maxine Waters, a key black supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters indirectly criticized Brown's campaign for taking the support of the 
black community for granted. She commended Garamendi for listening to her in 
contrast to "people who will not take me seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Garamendi went to Bakersfield to attend the National Basque 
Festival. Today, he scheduled a "Memorial Day news conference" in the city of 
Orange to "talk about victims of urban war." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's long-awaited television advertising campaign was expected to start 
by the middle of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, the third major Democratic candidate, 
attended a black church Sunday and embarked on a walking and driving tour of 
Westside holiday gatherings to greet potential voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP campaign, Unz used radio talk shows to claim victory over Wilson in 
their radio debate Friday. Unz planned news conferences in Sacramento and 
Burbank for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was off Sunday. Today, he is scheduled to attend the dedication of 
Veterans Parkway at the corner of Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards on the 
Westside.

2 LIVES SNARED IN WEB OF MONEY, POLITICS; CAPITOL: PROSECUTORS SAY BOTH AIDES 
'PLAYED THE MIDDLE' BETWEEN DONORS AND LAWMAKERS. NOW ONE IS THE OTHER'S 
ACCUSER IN A CORRUPTION TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Karin L. Watson's self-proclaimed goal was to make lots of money. Building on 
her experience as a political fund-raiser and special consultant to 
then-Republican Assembly Leader Pat Nolan, Watson dreamed about joining the 
ranks of the Capitol's most elite and high-priced lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Her counterpart was Terry E. Frost, whose political roots instead extended to 
Democrats and environmentalists. Frost worked his way up the Capitol ladder, 
from lawmakers' chauffeur to adviser to powerful members such as former Senate 
Majority Leader Barry Keene (D-Benicia). Frost, too, hoped to emerge from 
behind the scenes, possibly as a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988 both won the attention they craved but certainly not in a way either 
could have envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, whose lives intersected in the boisterous back rooms and watering 
holes of Sacramento, unwittingly helped the FBI in an investigation of public 
corruption that has engulfed the Capitol for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 47, Watson become the star prosecution witness against Frost, her onetime 
friend, and state Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who was once her boss. The 
corruption trial is unfolding at the federal courthouse a few blocks from the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony and secretly recorded tapes of Watson and Frost provide insight 
into the Capitol's venal underbelly in which groups with vested economic 
interests lavish aides with liquor and expensive meals and gifts such as 
Giorgio perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the 12 earlier cases springing from the undercover probe, the Hill trial, 
which began May 9, shows how fund raising fuels the political system and how 
lawmakers are constantly tiptoeing along the line of illegality. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson and Frost formed an unlikely twosome. Watson worked for Nolan, one of 
the Assembly's most right-wing members, with a reputation as a hard taskmaster, 
who pleaded guilty to corruption charges earlier this year. Frost was more 
mild-mannered and focused on the legislative process while advising liberal 
Democrat Keene, whose reputation as a tough boss paralleled Nolan's. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, they had a similar role, however. They were "to play 
the middle" between lawmakers and donors. While on the public payroll, they 
raised money any way they could as long as their bosses had "deniability," the 
ability to say they did not know money was tied to their action on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not . . . force people to give contributions," Frost told an FBI 
informant who was secretly taping a February, 1988, lunch conversation. "I will 
explain political realities. And then if they say no, that's fine . . . (but) 
when they come to ask a favor, they can understand why I say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said her job was to raise money, cozy up to high-rollers who could help 
Nolan and trade favors with other legislative staffers such as Frost. Her 
duties, she said, included "doing the circuit" of Sacramento nightspots as a 
way to befriend lobbyists and contributors with deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole world revolves around making money for myself and others," Watson 
said during a June 16, 1988, lunch secretly taped by Senate Democratic aide 
John A. Shahabian, who was the FBI undercover informant pressing for passage of 
a bill to help a shrimp processing plant locate near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost's lawyer concedes that his client "messed up" in some of the taped 
conversations but says Frost did nothing illegal. Watson admitted she broke the 
law, pleading guilty to extortion and agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 In one secretly taped conversation, Watson warned undercover informant 
Shahabian that a businessman who was really an FBI agent should be careful when 
discussing money and legislation. The agent had given then-Assemblyman Hill a 
$2,500 honorarium, allegedly for his help on the shrimp bill, and then called 
the next day offering "more money." Hill complained to Watson, who worried that 
the money-for-votes scenario was becoming too transparent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members (legislators) will not talk about money and legislation in the 
same breath," Watson told Shahabian. "Don't ever try it. And explain why. Tell 
him (the businessman) it is against the law. Tell him we go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, now 44, got his first taste of the Capitol when he monitored the 
progress of legislation for the Planning and Conservation League as part of a 
community college class. Frost, who says he holds no grudge against Watson, 
recently left a job as a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1988, he was on Sen. Keene's payroll and was turning into an 
influential Capitol insider when he had lunch with Shahabian. During the lunch 
he bragged that he had snagged a $5,000 contribution tied to oil company 
legislation. It was supposed to be given to Senate President Pro Tem David A. 
Roberti at a San Francisco event. Roberti, who stepped aside earlier this year 
as Senate leader, denies receiving such a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost's boast "just strikes me as . . . one staffer trying to be a bigger 
hotshot than the other staffer," said Roberti, now running for state treasurer. 
"Those kinds of things do happen around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing herself as a devoted admirer of Ronald Reagan, Watson gained 
experience as a fund-raiser for agricultural interests and manager of political 
action committees. The Phoenix native left politics in the early 1980s to raise 
her young son but returned in 1985 to join Nolan's staff. She was earning 
$57,000 a year when she was fired in 1989, three days after she admitted 
extorting $12,500 for her GOP bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, Watson sought a retail job from a friend, Janet K. Russo of 
Sacramento. Russo, a former lobbyist, testified that Watson confided that she 
wasn't really guilty but went along with authorities to avoid a lengthy prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had to cooperate or she would be going away for a long, long time . . . 
away from her family, particularly her son," said Russo, called by Hill's 
lawyer to cast doubt on Watson's truthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who was hustled in and out of the courtroom by FBI agents, declined a 
request for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trial, Watson said she wanted to use her position as an aide to launch 
herself into the more lucrative world of lobbying. At one point, she approached 
top lobbyist Clayton R. Jackson, who last year was convicted in another 
corruption-related case, about a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, charged with conspiracy, and Hill, facing charges of extortion, 
conspiracy and money laundering, are seeking to cast doubt on Watson's 
credibility. Hill's lawyers contend that Watson's memory was clouded by 
numerous glasses of champagne she sipped while dealing with FBI undercover 
agents. Watson admits she was drinking but maintains she was sober. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia turned down Hill's bid to 
dismiss the case because of insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Garcia warned: "I believe that the jury could reasonably and properly 
find beyond a doubt that Hill joined a conspiracy to take money for express 
official action, and that's what he is charged with." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is expected to take the stand Tuesday when the trial resumes.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; CITY THAWS OUT FROM CITRUS FREEZE; THE 1990 DISASTER SET BACK 
PORTERVILLE. BUT SMALL-TOWN INGENUITY, CHARITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SLOWLY 
REVIVE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in the citrus belt of the San Joaquin Valley, they call it nature's 
invisible disaster -- a December, 1990, freeze that devastated the orange and 
lemon harvest and brought the farming communities of Porterville and Lindsay to 
their knees. 
</P>
<P>
 The already high unemployment rate jumped to 23%. Out-of-work pickers, packers 
and truck drivers couldn't buy groceries, much less pay utility bills swollen 
by 14 days of subfreezing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Silently, the freeze exacted a $1.5-billion toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't make the national news. We didn't have a fire or flood or 
earthquake or hurricane," Mayor Judi Gibbons said. "People were suffering, but 
the nation didn't understand. It wasn't something you could make pictures out 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the young navel orange trees left for dead that winter but budding new 
shoots each year since, this community of 34,000 has slowly come back. Through 
small-town ingenuity and charity and aggressive economic development, 
Porterville has managed to stave off a deeper crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Its resiliency has not gone unnoticed. For the second straight year, the 
National Civic League has named Porterville a finalist in the All-America City 
Award competition. Winners will be announced in Oakland next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a symbolic award. No cash or anything like that," said Manny Azevedo, 
who will give a three-minute presentation to judges on a food bank run entirely 
by senior citizens. "But it would mean a lot to people who have given a lot 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the record cold snap, this Tulare County town knew it was living 
dangerously. With an economy driven by the single engine of citrus farming, 
Porterville was always one drought or one hailstorm away from catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversification began in the 1950s with the opening of a state hospital, which 
remains the area's biggest non-agricultural employer. Then came several 
attempts to exploit the community's location -- 158 miles northeast of Los 
Angeles at the base of the Sierra Nevada. But the slogan "Gateway to the 
Sequoias" only seemed to underscore that Porterville was a restroom on the road 
to mountain bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Wal-Mart located its West Coast distribution center here in 
1991 -- 25 acres of warehouse under one roof -- that retailers began to take 
heed. In quick succession came a Mervyn's and Target and Big 5 Sporting Goods 
and Wal-Mart store. 
</P>
<P>
 The ribbon cuttings, while a source of great pride, were little salve in the 
midst of a freeze-related depression. Crop loss alone was $300 million. Fifty 
citrus packing plants employing more than 5,000 full-time and seasonal workers 
had shut down. In a region where wealth has always concentrated in a few grower 
hands and the unemployment rate hovered at 16%, the effect was immediate, if 
not always visible. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30,000 weeks of unemployment were claimed in the three months after 
the freeze, compared to 1,600 weeks in the same period a year before. Food 
lines quadrupled. Hardest hit were Latino farm workers, who account for a 
quarter of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the farm workers were too proud for handouts," said Jim Vagim, a car 
dealer who converted his warehouse into a food distribution center that served 
more than 5,000 meals. "They'd park their cars a block or two away and send in 
their children to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping Hand, another volunteer group, served nearly 90,000 meals that first 
year. Churches raised $76,000 to help laid off workers pay their utilities. 
Dozens of seniors calling themselves the Porterville Gleaners marched into the 
fields with ladders and gleaned what they could from the blackened trees. 
Bartering with food banks around the state, they traded oranges and lemons for 
25-pound bags of groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Gibbons, who owns Brides 'n Belles on Main Street, began outfitting 
weddings on credit. "People get married, crisis or not, so we fronted the 
money, sometimes $500 and $600," she said. "And all of them paid. I never lost 
5 cents to any one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, sales tax revenues hit a new high: $3 million. Vagim is selling 
more used cars than ever. The Gutierrez family opened a fancy new Mexican 
restaurant on Main Street called The Mission. Sears has returned. Wal-Mart's 
1.2-million-square-foot warehouse now employs more than 1,000 people. And huge 
houses continue to be built here, some by Southern California dairy farmers who 
have moved operations to this side of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 But times remain lean. A large market and Chevy dealership have closed. Not 
everyone loves the new Wal-Mart store, which has snatched away business from 
Porterville Hardware, a downtown mainstay, for one. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Tulare County Lemon Assn. packing and shipping plant, manager Alex 
Teague says it will take another five good seasons before the grower 
cooperative rebounds completely from the "lost year" of the freeze. And 
$5-an-hour jobs continue to be lost to mechanization. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, as testimony to the freeze's far reach, the Porterville 
Gleaners opened a new food bank warehouse built with $115,000 in local funds. 
The program has grown each year since 1991 and now handles 2.5 million tons of 
culled fruits and vegetables that it barters with food banks in Oakland and 
Santa Maria and Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a Mickey Mouse operation anymore," said the 76-year-old Azevedo. 
"We take care of a lot of people, about 1,200 families a week. I guess that's 
the thing about the freeze. We've always been a tightknit community. Now we're 
even tighter."

3RD TEEN-AGER HELD IN ATTACK ON TOURISTS; CRIME: ALLEGED TRIGGERMAN IN THE 
FATAL SHOOTING NEAR IDYLLWILD IS ARRESTED IN SALT LAKE CITY. ALL THREE SUSPECTS 
ARE FROM BANNING. 
</P>

<P>
 A third teen-ager was arrested Sunday in the slaying of a German tourist and 
the wounding of her husband earlier this month on a mountain highway near the 
Riverside County community of Idyllwild, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, a 17-year-old whose name was not released because of his age, is 
believed to have been the triggerman in the May 16 robbery and shooting, said 
Riverside County Sheriff Cois Byrd. He was arrested early Sunday in a suburb of 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd said he is hoping the teen-ager will be prosecuted as an adult. He lives 
in the same area of Banning as two suspects who were arrested Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Xou Yang and Khamchan (Brett) Ketsouvannasane, both 19, of Banning were booked 
Wednesday in connection with the shooting. Authorities described the teen-agers 
as associates of an Asian street gang, but investigators said gang activity was 
not believed to have played a role in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 All three suspects were born in Laos and are legal U.S. residents, deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The handgun believed to have been used in the shooting and the suspected 
getaway car were seized by detectives who searched four homes in the Banning 
area last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery and shooting left Gisela Pfleger, 62, dead from gunshot wounds to 
her head. Her husband, Klaus, 64, was critically wounded by gunshots to his 
face and shoulder. His wife died at the scene, but he struggled to his car and 
drove a half-mile to a parking lot, where a passerby summoned help. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfleger was listed in fair condition Sunday at Desert Hospital in Palm 
Springs, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, from Emmerich in western Germany, were shot three days after 
arriving in Southern California to sightsee and visit their daughter in Redondo 
Beach. They were attacked at a scenic lookout point along California 243, 
overlooking Hemet in the San Jacinto Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 They had driven an unmarked rental car up the winding, two-lane mountain 
highway from Banning. They stopped about eight miles from Idyllwild to see the 
view at the Indian Vista viewpoint. Authorities said they did not believe the 
pair were singled out because they were tourists, but were the victims of 
random violence.

1 IN 4 HOMELESS A VETERAN, STUDY SAYS

<P>
 One-fourth of the single homeless people in Britain have served in the armed 
forces, and defense cuts could send the numbers soaring higher, according to a 
charity's study. 
</P>
<P>
 In its study, the housing charity Crisis concluded that former servicemen are 
more disadvantaged than other homeless people because of the culture shock of 
leaving behind a regimented life. 
</P>
<P>
 The charity's director, Mark Scothern, predicted that the numbers would grow 
as the government's planned defense layoffs for up to 17,000 personnel are 
carried through.

MAJOR UNDER FIRE FOR CALLING PANHANDLERS AN 'EYESORE'; BRITAIN: THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S COMMENTS PROVOKE AN OUTCRY FROM POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS AND CIVIC 
LEADERS. HE STANDS BY HIS REMARKS.

<P>
 Prime Minister John Major's public criticism of beggars drew fire from 
political, religious and civic leaders Sunday in what is becoming another row 
for the British government. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview with a Bristol newspaper, Major described panhandling as 
"offensive and unjustified" and called beggars an "eyesore" who should be 
reported to police. The comments, published Friday, gained wide publicity over 
the weekend and provoked an outcry from many quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Blair, the Labor Party domestic affairs spokesman who is favored to be 
the party's next leader, called the statement petty. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said Major is trying to deflect attention away from bigger problems, 
such as "education, a million people under 25 out of work, major problems of 
putting this country back on its feet." 
</P>
<P>
 "The real criticism of what the prime minister has done is not only its 
vindictiveness against some who will be genuinely destitute, it is the notion 
that this is what we should be concentrating on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt. Rev. David Sheppard, said there is no 
justification for attacking society's most "vulnerable elements." 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it a very unlovely feature of public life when people in power pick on 
the most despised groups in society rather than asking what the causes are." 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers were equally forceful in their condemnation of Major, who came 
to power in 1990 saying he wanted to be the leader of a classless, caring 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is passing the buck. He is having a go at homeless people because they 
would appear to be defenseless," said Stan Burridge, one of the organizers of a 
Sunday rally by homeless protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The London rally, planned before Major made his comments, was intended to 
commemorate the 600 people estimated to die on Britain's streets every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Major was unrepentant during a campaign stop Saturday, saying: "I stand by 
what I said. There is no need for begging." 
</P>
<P>
 And his remarks seemed to strike a responsive chord with many in the public. 
The Conservative Party headquarters reported that telephone calls were running 
2 to 1 in favor of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, newspapers have printed accounts of organized gangs of 
beggars who aggressively accost passersby. One gang operating on the London 
subway was reported to be posing as refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina and making 
up to $30,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In England, beggars have no official status. Police treat them as vagrants or 
confidence tricksters, and they are subject to ancient laws with penalties of 
up to $1,500. Each year about 1,000 panhandlers are held for questioning by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard, on BBC Radio, said: "If there are aggressive tramps frightening 
people, yes, they should be reported to the police and there should be firm 
action. But that is a tiny handful of cases."

AMERICAN ALBUM: TRAVELING PEDDLERS: FREEDOM, MODEST DREAMS; THOUSANDS TAKE TO 
THE ROAD SEASONALLY, CONVINCED THAT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD A BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime next month, Walt and Sandy Lamkin will hit the road again, fleeing 
Florida's summer with their trailer full of wares for the fairgrounds and 
festivals of New England -- and the hope of bigger crowds, more money and a 
little middle-age security. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll head north in their live-in van, the dog, Brandy, stretched out by the 
stove and the Amazon parrot, Envy, perched on a bunk bed, offering an 
acceptable version of "Zip-a-dee Doo-Dah." The trailer they tow will be so 
jammed with goods -- everything from contour pillows to jewelry to disposable 
rain jackets (two for $1) -- that Lamkin will have to shoulder the door to 
secure the lock. 
</P>
<P>
 In another life, the Lamkins were worth several million dollars. Then in the 
early '80s, the bottom fell out of the egg-and-poultry business in Maine and 
they lost their 1,500-acre farm. They moved to Florida to start over -- after a 
couple of false starts -- as members of the growing class of entrepreneurs who 
peddle wares from town to town and consider storefronts, leases and 800-phone 
numbers an unseemly symbol of settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 From California to Florida, thousands of Americans are on the road like the 
Lamkins these days, moving with the seasons, plying their trade at flea markets 
and trade shows. They may sell fine silverware or antiques, T-shirts or gadgets 
that slice, dice and cut in a single swipe. But each is united by his or her 
disdain of having to punch a time clock or answer to a boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the drummers of the Old West -- the salesmen who traveled from town to 
town, hawking medicines and housewares from the backs of their wagons -- 
today's itinerant vendors play to the most basic American instinct: Every home 
can afford a bargain. They are survivors, possessed of modest dreams, content 
to pursue a decent living and the freedom to move on when business is lean. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7:30 a.m. the other Friday, the Lamkins had set up four tables in the space 
they rent for $60 a weekend at Fleamaster's flea market in Ft. Myers. The 
covered, open-air market -- one of more than 150 that operate year-round in 
Florida -- attracts 800 vendors and 30,000 customers on a busy weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what I sell," said Walt Lamkin, 54. "All I want is a good 
product that no one else has. That's the magic, finding the product. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Battery-operated talking parrots are big this year, and I never would have 
guessed that. Take the nice cooler with a two-quart jug I found. I said 
everybody's going to want that. I bought 72 of them for $8 each. I marked them 
up to $14.95. They didn't sell and I kept dropping the price because you can't 
let your money sit around. I just sold the last one the other day, for $5." 
</P>
<P>
 The early crowds were sparse on this morning. The sellers were middle-aged and 
many had come to this line of work because they had failed at some earlier 
business or had retired and didn't want to be idle. With Florida emptying as 
summer approached, most had plotted their escape to points north and west. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight years ago, I came down to Florida as a commercial fisherman," said 
George Nichol, standing among tables stocked with jellies, greeting cards, 
cotton ear swabs, chamois clothes, men's dress belts, billy clubs and rolls of 
rope. "It was a lot of work for no money. Pulling 70-pound traps of stone crabs 
300 times a day, out from dawn to dusk, getting eaten by a brutal sun -- that's 
a job for young people, and I was lucky enough to realize it. You got to have a 
lot of luck to be old these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Norm and Cathy Bricker had parked the 40-foot motor home they live in 
next to their Rising Sun Traders jewelry counter. Their 11-year-old son, Aaron, 
whose schooling is done by correspondence courses, was organizing the baseball 
cards that he will sell and swap when the family leaves for Arizona, 
California, Alaska and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Norm wanted to sell off the farm and go on the road . . . about 10 years 
ago, I was dead set against it," Cathy Bricker said. "But now I wouldn't be 
caught dead living in the same place. I feel antsy just visiting my parents in 
Maryland." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Lamkins lost their Maine farm in 1982 and their Florida tire shop to 
fire in 1990, their net worth was down to $500. They bought $300 worth of 
canned food, figuring that would sustain them for a couple of months, and spent 
the final $200 on cashews and pecans. They sold them at a flea market and have 
been among the modern-day drummers ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get a regular job," Walt said, "but hell, I was 50 years old with 
a degree in agriculture. No one was going to hire me. So you do what you got to 
do to survive. Actually, I've got no complaints. The egg business was good to 
me for 20 years. We raised two boys we're proud of. We're paying our bills now. 
Hell, I'm as happy as if I had brains." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the flea market closed, the Lamkins' receipts totaled $205, less 
than half what they had taken in the previous Friday. "That's why it's time to 
get out of Florida," Walt mumbled. "You can't live on that."

ISRAEL TELLS PLO TO REMOVE ITS OFFICES FROM JERUSALEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel has told the PLO that offices controlling self-rule government will 
have to move out of Jerusalem, and police have been ordered to keep new offices 
from being opened, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughened stand by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin comes amid escalating 
rhetoric between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization over the 
future status of Jerusalem, which both claim as their capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Israel-PLO autonomy accord, which provided for self-rule in the Gaza 
Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, the two sides agreed to postpone 
negotiations on Jerusalem for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials claim that the mushrooming PLO offices in Jerusalem violate 
the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the agreement, all institutions must be in Gaza or Jericho," 
said Obed Ben-Ami, spokesman for Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaacov Tsur, the Israeli agriculture minister, said after a Cabinet meeting 
Sunday that the government will take "all the necessary steps" to ensure the 
provisions of the accord are met. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Israel can allow any hint or process that gives the impression 
that Jerusalem is going to be the capital of the Palestinians," he said. "This 
is against the agreement that we signed." 
</P>
<P>
 An official who requested anonymity said the government will try to avoid 
direct confrontation and instead use pressure tactics -- such as cutting off 
telephones, water and electricity -- if the PLO does not comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem police spokesman Eric Bar-Chen quoted Police Minister Moshe Shahal 
as saying police will prevent "the setting up of any Palestinian authorities in 
Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials, however, say Israel is trying to get a jump on negotiations by 
building neighborhoods in the Arab sector of the city, which Israel captured 
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to reinforce their status in Jerusalem before they start 
negotiations," PLO spokesman Hatem Abdul Qader said.

RWANDA'S GOVERNMENT FLEES IN FEAR OF REBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of Rwanda's government has fled its refuge south of the capital, fearing 
a rebel advance, diplomats said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kigali itself, an offensive by the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front prompted 
the United Nations to suspend convoys taking trapped civilians to safety across 
the city's front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said most government ministers and senior officials left their 
headquarters, a former civil servants' college, near Gitarama, 25 miles south 
of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministers and officials fled Saturday by road and helicopter to the 
government-held western city of Kibuye on the shores of Lake Kivu facing 
eastern Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the government has gone to Kibuye, and others are already abroad," a 
diplomat said, adding that the main rebel thrust appeared to be moving on 
Gitarama to force the rest of the government out. 
</P>
<P>
 A rebel officer said taking the largely deserted capital of Kigali was no 
longer a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would we have if we took the rest of the city? Just a few monuments, 
buildings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-declared government -- set up after the death of President Juvenal 
Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart in a mysterious plane crash April 6 
-- fled from Kigali to Gitarama about a week later to escape the massacres and 
war ignited by Habyarimana's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is entirely from the majority Hutu tribe, which dominates the 
army and started an orgy of slaughter of the Tutsi minority and opponents by 
troops, militias and mobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials estimate between 200,000 and 500,000 people have been killed. 
More than 1.5 million people have fled across the small central African 
country's borders, and hundreds of thousands more are homeless inside Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rebels' gains in Kigali and the south, U.N. officials said peace 
talks between rebel and army commanders were still scheduled to start at U.N. 
headquarters today. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda called in representatives of both sides 
Sunday for talks on allowing its convoys to resume evacuating some of the 
40,000 refugees in Kigali.

TOP TWO CANDIDATES SPLIT COLOMBIA PRESIDENTIAL VOTE; LATIN AMERICA: CLOSEST 
RACE IN NATION'S HISTORY FORCES A RUNOFF. ELECTION IS PEACEFUL THOUGH MARKED BY 
APATHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two presidential candidates representing the political parties that have 
dominated government here for nearly six decades were headed for a runoff after 
splitting the vote in closely fought elections Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost 96% of the ballots counted, Ernesto Samper of the ruling Liberal 
Party held a negligible lead over Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana. 
The elections were unusually peaceful though marked by widespread apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper, an economist and lawyer who favors adjusting government economic 
policies to help the poor, had 45.1% of the vote; 44.9% went to Pastrana, a 
former mayor of Bogota, television newscaster and enthusiastic champion of 
free-market economics. The results represented the closest election in 
Colombian history. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnout, however, was low, with 67% of Colombia's 17 million eligible voters 
staying away from the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Colombia's 1991 constitution requires the winner to receive an 
absolute majority, Samper and Pastrana will face off in a second round June 19, 
a matchup seen as a contest more of traditional party loyalties and 
personalities than of policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am voting for Pastrana, because he plans to help young people, because he 
was a great mayor of Bogota and because I like the way he speaks," Adriana 
Reina, 23, said as she voted in Bogota's 16th-Century Plaza Bolivar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although turnout was light, die-hard party loyalists turned out en masse, 
their bodies plastered with stickers of their candidates, as hawkers of fruit 
and sodas rolled their pushcarts through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of troops stood ready for possible violence. Leftist guerrillas and 
Colombian armed forces clashed in the rural states of Caldas and Huila, but no 
other major incidents were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say the campaign has been the most peaceful in 
recent memory. During the 1990 elections, three presidential candidates were 
assassinated by Pablo Escobar's Medellin cocaine cartel, and dozens of other 
people were killed by car bombs set off by drug terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper and Pastrana have both been victims of the violence. Samper survived an 
assassination attempt in 1989 and carries four bullets in his body, while 
Pastrana survived a 1988 kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar was shot and killed by police in December, and drug war violence has 
dropped off considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elections have begun in total peace," President Cesar Gaviria said Sunday 
after he cast his vote. The president, barred by the constitution from running 
for reelection, urged Colombians to turn out to "defeat violence and 
consolidate democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 But in contrast to the 1990 elections, when controversy raged over how to deal 
with drug trafficking and violence, this election has stirred little passion 
among the majority of Colombia's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Samper nor Pastrana has offered concrete solutions to the chronic 
problems of narcotics and guerrilla warfare. Neither is seen as a particularly 
forceful leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Samper and Pastrana favor continuing the current government's policy of 
plea-bargaining with drug traffickers who turn themselves in, a policy attacked 
by Washington because many of the sentences have seemed overly lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Gaviria government scored a victory in killing Escobar, the Cali 
cartel has since emerged as the world's biggest supplier of cocaine. The Cali 
cartel is less confrontational in its violence than the Medellin traffickers, 
but it has been adept at infiltrating many levels of Colombian government, 
according to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The main differences between Samper and Pastrana are economic: They disagree 
about how much the state should intervene to help the poor and disadvantaged in 
one of the hemisphere's most unequal nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastrana, 39, has promised to continue with Gaviria's free-market program 
without major changes, while Samper, 43, has proposed some adjustments, such as 
selective tariffs and subsidies to protect sectors vulnerable to foreign 
competition. He would slow privatization of state industries and increase 
spending for the poor and those most hurt by the free-market policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the lack of enthusiasm in Sunday's election, many voters expressed 
their dissatisfaction by leaving blanks on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "These candidates all say the same garbage, only in a different way," said 
university student Constanza Garcia, who was preparing to cast a blank ballot 
in the middle-class neighborhood of Alcazares. "This is my protest against the 
system and the lack of choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Castillo, a producer of television commercials, added: "I'm not happy 
with either candidate, but I'm going to pick the least bad, which is Samper. 
I'm worried that if Pastrana wins, the country will be run by his father, who 
was a very bad president." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastrana's father, Misael Pastrana, was an unpopular Conservative president 
who held office from 1970 to 1974.

WHITE HOUSE AIDES OFFER DIFFERING STATEMENTS ON HELICOPTER RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House insisted again Sunday that last week's golf trip using a 
presidential helicopter was an isolated incident, but aides gave contradictory 
statements about releasing the records to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to quell the latest outrage over perquisites and privileges in 
Washington, White House senior adviser George Stephanopoulos said: "This is an 
exception.We've gone through all the records. There's no other instances of 
this happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos appeared on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley" to answer 
questions about White House administrator David Watkins, who took a helicopter 
Tuesday on a 55-mile trip to Camp David, Md., and Holly Hills Country Club near 
New Market, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans seized on the junket, and some sought access to flight manifests 
and other records to determine if there have been other abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos said he did not know about the request, but he seemed to 
suggest that the White House was willing to release pertinent documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone back through the records. There's no other incident of this kind 
and we'd be happy to show it," he said on the ABC program. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview afterward, Stephanopoulos said he did not mean to imply 
that the records would be released. "I don't know what that entails. But I 
stand by the statement that there were no other instances of this kind," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had trouble explaining his comment on ABC, saying he meant only that "we 
can have people who've done the review talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed later on C-SPAN, Communications Director Mark D. Gearan seemed to 
say the White House would turn over pertinent records to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll certainly comply with any congressional requests," he said. He did not 
say whether records would be released to the public and media.

CROWDS HONOR KENNEDYS ON J.F.K.'S 77TH BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a sparkling noontime sun, U.S. military officers and a larger-than-usual 
crowd of spectators Sunday commemorated what would have been President John F. 
Kennedy's 77th birthday with ceremonies at his hillside grave site at Arlington 
National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we remember an important birthday, and we recall here that the torch 
has been passed on to us," Army Lt. Col. Albert Isler said in a brief ceremony 
atop the marble steps leading to Kennedy's grave and to the eternal flame 
lighted by his widow 31 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at the ceremony, which is held every year, swelled to about 300 
people, in part because of the recent death of former First Lady Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis; several Memorial Day visitors placed flowers on her week-old 
grave earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd looked on, Army officers set a red-, white- and blue-flowered 
wreath from President Clinton in front of the stone grave site where Kennedy's 
body rests alongside his widow, their infant son and a stillborn daughter. A 
bugler and drummer from the Army Band played taps. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the cemetery said no members of the Kennedy family were 
expected to come to the grave site, but Kennedy's former personal secretary, 
Evelyn Lincoln, visited early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators, some from the Washington area and others visiting from distant 
parts of the country, said they came to pay their respects to the former First 
Lady and to remember the promise and optimism she and her husband represented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to pay tribute to him and Jacqueline and say a prayer for our 
country," said Kathy Withowski, a child-care worker from Arlington, Va. "There 
was so much truth in what he said." 
</P>
<P>
 Withowski said she was only 5 when Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, 
but "as I get older, I feel even closer to his life. If only he didn't go to 
Dallas." She held a small U.S. flag, which she placed on Kennedy's grave.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON FACES LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE ON EUROPEAN TRIP; DIPLOMACY: 
HE HOPES TO ESTABLISH HIS CREDIBILITY AMONG ALLIES AND AT HOME. HIS FOREIGN 
POLICY GAFFES AND VIETNAM WAR POSITION POSE OBSTACLES.

<P>
 As President Clinton prepares to depart for Europe this week to commemorate 
the 50th anniversary of D-day, he faces the challenge of asserting America's -- 
and his own -- leadership in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking across a generational chasm and addressing himself to veterans of a 
military whose later mission in Vietnam he and others vehemently opposed, 
Clinton confronts an important test of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the 47-year-old Clinton convince a skeptical world that he and his fellow 
postwar baby boomers are ready to assume the mantle of leadership? Can he 
summon a nation and its allies to deal with a world whose threats are far more 
diffuse and ambivalent than the unvarnished evils of Nazism and fascism? 
</P>
<P>
 And can he present a coherent view of American engagement in the world despite 
a foreign policy record marked by vacillation on Bosnia, retreat in Somalia and 
Haiti and reversal on human rights in China? 
</P>
<P>
 The way the world and the American public come to answer those questions will 
have a lasting effect on how much Clinton will accomplish in his presidency. 
Clinton hopes that by proving himself a strong spokesman for America's ideals 
abroad, he can boost his credibility at home despite questions about his 
character and competence. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides say the key themes of the European trip will be homage to the heroes of 
the "Great Crusade" of World War II and a vision of the future based on the 
triumph of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton speaks against the backdrop of American military cemeteries in 
Italy, Britain and France, he and millions of television viewers will be 
reminded of the painful legacy of the bloodiest century in human history. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who was born after the war ended, will be shadowed not only by his 
own draft-avoiding past but also by the specter of former President Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan, who spent World War II in Hollywood making training and propaganda 
films for the Army, staged what many consider the most effective piece of 
political theater of his presidency on the cliffs above the Normandy beaches 
during the 1984 ceremonies celebrating the 40th anniversary of the D-day 
landings. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides say they know that comparisons with Reagan's stirring 
performance are inevitable, but they contend they are irrelevant. In 1984, they 
say, the United States was still engaged in a great moral struggle against 
communism and Reagan's words about the heroes of Normandy carried a resonance 
that cannot be reproduced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will instead try to summon up the valor of the struggle against 
fascism and make it apply to the effort to consolidate democracy in the nations 
of the former Soviet empire and elsewhere around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides involved in planning the trip and polishing the keynote speeches said 
there will be no chest-thumping over the Allied military triumph of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me emphasize this: This should not be seen as a victory over Germany and 
over Italy," said National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. "I think the 
President will be trying to make it clear that we are not celebrating the 
defeat of certain nations; we are celebrating the victory of an idea, a 
liberating idea, of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake said Clinton intends to honor not only the veterans of the war but also 
those political and military leaders who shaped the postwar world, rebuilt the 
shattered economies of Europe and Japan and led the West in its costly victory 
in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 With fascism and communism vanquished, Western leaders must now find another 
organizing idea, Lake said, and that will be a recurring theme on Clinton's 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our challenge today, unlike the generation of World War II, and really unlike 
the generations that prevailed during the Cold War, is to somehow find the same 
unity of purpose, the same spirit in time of peace to accomplish two very 
important tasks," Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is the political and economic renewal of America; the second is 
continued American engagement on the world stage, sometimes acting alone, at 
other times in concert with the United Nations or other alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to marking the anniversary of the liberation of Europe, Clinton 
will meet with French and British leaders as well as officials of the new 
government of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions will touch on economic issues and on the continuing disputes 
over Bosnia and the future membership of Russia and other former Soviet states 
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the trip, Clinton has been studying World War II history 
and meeting with staff advisers and outside experts. On Wednesday, he hosted a 
dinner for historians and D-day veterans to get a feel for the momentous event. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen E. Ambrose, whose recent book on D-day has been Clinton's bedside 
reading for the last two weeks, was among those who attended the dinner, which 
was preceded by a formal briefing from military historians in the White House 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a copy of my book and it was well-thumbed and all marked up," Ambrose 
said. "He's taking this with great seriousness and asked good questions. He 
wanted to know how they kept the secrets so well. He wanted to know what World 
War II would have been like if CNN had been there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He recognizes he has a great opportunity here. Unstated was that there is 
some risk (for him personally). There's a delicacy that went unspoken," Ambrose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another participant in last week's dinner, Brig. Gen. Harold W. Nelson, the 
Army's chief of military history, said the subject of Clinton's own avoidance 
of military service during the Vietnam War didn't come up. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nelson, who served as an adviser to the South Vietnamese army in 1965, 
said Clinton should have little trouble relating to World War II veterans at 
the observances at Normandy and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's a problem," he said. "Franklin Roosevelt didn't serve in 
uniform; our wartime presidents have not had to prove themselves by military 
service."

HIRING MORE POLICE IN HOUSTON PAYS OFF AS OVERALL CRIME RATE IN CITY PLUMMETS; 
LAW ENFORCEMENT: MAYOR, OFFICERS CLAIM COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACH WASN'T WORKING. 
THEY SAY MORE COPS ON THE STREETS MEAN MORE ARRESTS. 
</P>

<P>
 These days, Mayor Bob Lanier sits comfortably in his City Hall office, his 
black Western-style boots plopped on his desk and a stack of charts and graphs 
in his lap. He likes to talk statistics; he revels in numbers, and he can spin 
off facts about Houston as fast as a Texas tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one statistic he cherishes most: The city's overall crime rate 
has plummeted more than 30% since he was elected three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanier credits the sharp decline not to "new-fangled ideas" such as 
community-based policing but to hundreds of newly hired police officers whose 
sole purpose is to go out in uniform every day and make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look on police officers as social workers," he said, espousing ideas 
that run counter to what other big cities, such as Los Angeles, are trying to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect a police officer to go to a neighborhood and figure out a 
drainage problem or a ditch problem. I expect him to do police work." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street at police headquarters, Police Chief Sam Nuchia is equally 
plain-spoken. "When I took over," he said, "we quit using the terminology 
'neighborhood-oriented policing.' Instead I declared that we were going to make 
it as tough on the criminals as we possibly could." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, before Lanier and Nuchia moved into their jobs, Houston 
was considered a model for community policing -- a concept that has caught on 
in other big cities looking to rebuild public trust in their police 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 While Los Angeles is only slowly implementing the program as recommended by 
the Christopher Commission after the 1991 beating of Rodney G. King, Houston 
officials claim to have learned the hard way that the effort never really paid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception here is that instead of reducing crime, community policing 
fueled a deep resentment among officers, did little to boost the public's trust 
of the police and ultimately cost the two biggest champions of the policy -- 
the police chief and the mayor -- their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston never had an episode as divisive in police-community relations as the 
King case. But there were past controversies nevertheless. A Latino man drowned 
after he was handcuffed by police and forced to swim in the bayou. A 
"throw-down" weapon was planted on a suspect after he was shot by police. 
</P>
<P>
 To turn the tide, Houston in 1982 brought in its first outside police chief, 
who also happened to be its first minority chief, just as Los Angeles did in 
hiring Willie L. Williams from Philadelphia in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee P. Brown, who served as Houston's chief until 1990, made 
neighborhood-oriented policing a hallmark of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
 It was designed to make police officers more aware of community concerns, to 
get them out of the patrol cars and into neighborhood meetings and other civic 
ventures. Proponents say it works best when officers walk their beats, meet 
residents and business owners and enlist the public in crime-prevention 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was followed by Chief Elizabeth Watson, a 20-year veteran who stayed 
until 1992. She embraced many of Brown's programs, but her tenure was troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the oil bust in eastern Texas and the subsequent economic downturn 
here, the city under then-Mayor Kathryn J. Whitmire put a freeze on the hiring 
of officers, closed the police academy and did not grant police pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 The police, in turn, began ridiculing neighborhood-oriented policing, saying 
that its initials actually stood for "Nobody On Patrol." Morale sunk and senior 
officers began leaving for other cities where old-fashioned police work was 
still practiced. When Whitmire lost to Lanier in the fall of 1991, police 
officers unfurled a banner downtown proclaiming: "Ding, Dong. The Witch Is 
Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "The previous administration was penny-wise and pound-foolish," Nuchia said. 
"They saved money on the budget, but they also allowed the strength of the 
department to go down at a time when we needed it most." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who now preaches community policing as chief of police in nearby 
Austin, Tex., said her administration did not fail rank-and-file police 
officers. She said she was only trying to inject new ideas that would enhance 
the city's crime-fighting efforts until the economy recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community policing makes us all better crime solvers," she said. "We develop 
information in the community. We develop technology and communication with the 
public. We can do more things in the long run so that we don't have to keep 
going back to the same crime scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanier, a wealthy businessman, ran for mayor on a promise to beef up the 
police ranks. "That was the only campaign issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected in November, 1991, and one of his first appointments was 
Nuchia, then an assistant U.S. attorney who earlier had worked as a junior 
police administrator in Houston. Almost immediately they froze their 
predecessors' plans to expand community policing, such as putting officers in 
"storefront" substations around the city where they would be more accessible to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanier, in order to reopen the police academy and start hiring officers, 
scuttled a proposed downtown monorail system and saved $50 million. "That was a 
goddamn Tinkertoy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he picked up another $50 million by restructuring the city's debt and 
saved $50 million more by improving its revenue-collection system. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the department has grown from 3,900 sworn officers to 4,800. Now 
Lanier is seeking a four-cent sales tax to boost the force to 5,200 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1991 to today, murder and rape each dropped 15%, according to Police 
Department statistics. Robbery was down 22.5%; theft down 25%; burglary down 
41.2%, and auto theft down 42.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with aggravated assaults up 12.5% (the only category to see a rise), the 
total crime rate dropped 30.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, police response times to crime scenes shortened, from 6.1 minutes 
on major calls to 4.4 minutes. Police morale, meantime, went up, particularly 
when Lanier and Nuchia found two small pay raises for officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief and the mayor suggested that Los Angeles, which appears to be going 
in the opposite direction, also might be better served by increasing its police 
force before embarking on new community programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to tell them their business," Lanier said, "but I think they 
have a big problem. They don't have enough police. That's going to strain any 
additional duties. It's going to strain things." 
</P>
<P>
 In last year's campaign, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan pledged to add 
3,000 police officers in four years, a promise he has since trimmed to 2,855 in 
five years. So far, however, attrition has canceled out much of the new hiring. 
Nevertheless, Riordan's LAPD expansion plan calls for the bulk of the buildup 
to occur in the last three years of the five-year program. Recently, the City 
Council approved the addition of 450 officers as part of Riordan's proposed 
1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in Houston, not everyone credits the team of Lanier and Nuchia with 
reducing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen L. Klineberg, a sociologist at Rice University here, said other 
factors, such as the turnaround in the local economy, can do more to halt crime 
than just adding police officers. He added that the public's fear of crime 
rises when cadres of officers are seen on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no evidence that more police automatically reduces crime," he said. 
"If you have more police, you report more crime and so arrests go up. And if 
you target one area of the city with more police, crime just moves to another 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, he said, a community working with its police can bring about an 
overall sense of security that cold crime statistics cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community police makes a lot of sense," he said. "If you know you have a 
police officer . . . in your neighborhood working to reduce crime, that goes a 
long way to satisfying your fears." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Virgadamo and Tiny Allison, both active in a neighborhood association in 
the historic Houston Heights area, said they believe that adding police 
officers is actually the best community policing available, simply because more 
police can answer more calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgadamo said she moved from the suburbs back to the inner city because she 
believes that the added police presence makes the city safer. And Allison, who 
coordinates a citizens patrol to support the police, said she is amazed at how 
much faster the police cars respond. "We used to have to wait hours," she said. 
"Once, I waited four hours for a police officer after a car was stolen. They 
were all too busy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the North Loop area of the city, the Rev. Robert Jefferson, a school board 
member and chairman of COMAC (Coalition of Ministers Against Crime), recently 
called a meeting to discuss the last day of the school year next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, numerous fights and stabbings, even drive-by shootings, had 
broken out when school let out for the summer. Police found themselves 
overwhelmed with problems. Tensions are again high this year, especially since 
a 14-year-old Latino gang member was stabbed to death and another youth was 
shot in a gang fight at a Houston theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven uniformed officers and an assistant police chief participated in 
Jefferson's meeting, mapping out strategy on how to protect the schools this 
year. They promised an impressive show of force, and the ministers were clearly 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more blue we have," Jefferson said, pointing to the uniformed officers, 
"the stronger we will be." 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, as a crowd of gang members and other mourners attended the 
wake for the youth who was stabbed, a phalanx of patrol officers and undercover 
detectives kept watch across the street. The officers said they believed that 
it was their presence that kept a rival gang from driving by and shooting the 
mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are pretty good right now," said Officer Damian Garcia, a young 
patrolman who came on the force three years ago, just when Lanier and Nuchia 
were beginning to reinvent the Houston Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are not out of control. We're not running to shooting after shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 His colleague, Officer Robert (Bobbie) King, who works the police gang detail, 
agreed. He said he was a young patrolman here when community-based police was 
all the rage, and he didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor wants us out now writing tickets and patrolling the city," King 
said. "And that beats neighborhood policing. That didn't work. Not here in 
Houston. Not as long as we didn't have enough officers to get our crime down 
first."

 Lawmakers say the Clinton Administration is exceeding the intentions of 
Congress in the way it is implementing legislation to ensure all children are 
vaccinated, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration plans to obtain most of the childhood vaccine used in the 
United States and set up a warehouse to store and distribute it, The New York 
Times reported. Such a far-reaching plan would create "a new entitlement, 
unrelated to all financial need," Sens. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) and John C. 
Danforth (R-Mo.) complained in a letter to the Administration last month. 
</P>
<P>
 They said "high- and middle-income families would be eligible for free vaccine 
. . . as long as the benefit was not included in their insurance coverage."

BIKERS PROTEST VIETNAM TIES IN RIDE PAST WHITE HOUSE

<P>
 Thousands of demonstrators rode roaring motorcycles past the White House on 
Sunday to loudly make their argument that warming relations with Vietnam 
amounts to a sellout to business and a betrayal of MIA families. 
</P>
<P>
 With exhausts growling, fists upraised and shouts of "Bring 'Em Home," bikers 
from many parts of the country rolled past the White House for more than 90 
minutes on their way to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh annual "Rolling Thunder" rally protesting lack of a 
complete accounting of those listed as missing in action during the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Park Police estimated the number in the rally at 40,000. The 
participants' own estimates of the number of bikers ranged from 5,000 to 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycles flew U.S. flags, many at half-staff, along with black banners 
of the POW-MIA movement and slogans and messages lettered on placards, 
vehicles, clothing and skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton lifted a trade embargo against Vietnam earlier this year and the two 
countries have agreed on a framework for establishing diplomatic missions, 
considered a step toward full diplomatic recognition.

DEMOCRATS DOWNPLAY ROSTENKOWSKI ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With skepticism mounting about the fate of the health care reform initiative, 
key Democrats tried Sunday to minimize the damage from House Ways and Means 
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski's looming legal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee "is going to get a bill out no matter what happens, and we're 
going to have it on the floor in July," House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) predicted. "The committee has already done a lot on health 
care. We're going to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt and others, appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," 
said that there are many forces working to ensure passage of a health care 
reform bill this congressional session and that the legislation's future does 
not depend solely on the chairman of the powerful House panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care reform "is bigger than any one person," said White House senior 
adviser George Stephanopoulos, adding: "There is great momentum right now to 
make sure we get health care reform. . . . We're confident we will be able to 
work with whoever is chairman of the committee. . . . We're going to get this 
done this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) has a Tuesday deadline for accepting a plea bargain that 
would require his resignation and a probable jail term. The alternative would 
be an indictment and potential trial on corruption charges. There are 
allegations that he has taken illegal payments from the House post office and 
listed employees on his payroll who did not do any work. 
</P>
<P>
 He has denied any wrongdoing and, according to sources, is now inclined to 
fight the charges. Under Democratic caucus rules, he would have to abandon his 
chairmanship if indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the third-ranking Democrat on the Ways and 
Means Committee, said on the ABC program that Rostenkowski's skill was in 
"being able to fully understand the needs of the different regions, the needs 
of members who had to vote for (health care reform). . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Rangel insisted that "with the presumption of innocence still going," he 
expected Rostenkowski to continue to work to ensure passage of a health care 
measure "because he is really committed to this piece of legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 But House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), speaking on CBS-TV's "Face the 
Nation," said that recent Republican House victories, particularly in Kentucky 
and Oklahoma, signal more problems for passage of President Clinton's reform 
bill than the potential loss of the influential chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Republicans ran against Clinton's policies, including his plan for 
overhauling the nation's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said he was concerned that Rostenkowski might get a lenient plea 
bargain through Democratic influence. He cited "the weird situation where the 
President's lawyer is negotiating with the President's Justice Department on 
behalf of the President's health care leader in the House." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. Bennett, who is Rostenkowski's lawyer, is also representing Clinton 
in a sexual-harassment lawsuit filed by a former Arkansas state employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said he was worried that the result would be "some kind of rigged 
deal where 15 or 20 felony counts magically get reduced to a misdemeanor to 
allow him to stay in charge of health care."

 Paramedics rescued a man mauled by a herd of cows. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hine was crossing a field while walking his two golden retrievers Sunday 
near Tetsworth, 40 miles northwest of London, when the Jersey cows spotted him. 
</P>
<P>
 The cows knocked him to the ground, breaking his leg and badly bruising his 
chest. He was reported in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hine was unable to move after he was knocked down and called for help on his 
cellular phone. His dogs barked to help paramedics locate their owner.

 "There were calves in the field, so I think the cows were being protective," a 
paramedic said. "We called in the police helicopter, and when it arrived all 
the cows came over to see what was going on."

FROM FLAMES TO FREEDOM, VICTIMS FINALLY FIND PEACE; RECOVERY: EX-VALLEY COUPLE 
MIXES ENVIRONMENTALISM WITH SURVIVALISM IN THEIR ESCAPE FROM FIRES AND 
TEMBLORS.

 There are no mini-malls here. No drive-by shootings, no graffiti, no obvious 
social unrest. More importantly, brush fires are unheard of, seismic activity 
appears dormant and any disasters in this trendy artists' haven are the 
exception, not the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the place for Jonathan and Alison Traister, a young Topanga Canyon couple 
left homeless by the Malibu blaze. They sought refuge in a Santa Monica 
apartment house, only to have it shift off its foundation during the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless again and badly frightened, the Traisters fled Los Angeles four days 
later. With their baby, Monty, and Labrador retriever, Dexter, their herbal 
tinctures and artists' brushes, they set out on a journey east in search of 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 They lived in their van, at a Sikh ashram in Phoenix and on an organic farm so 
far up a treacherous mountain road that "by the time we got there," Jonathan 
quipped, "we had to buy their herbs 'cause we were so stressed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it came to them during weeks of wandering: Build an Earthship. With 
walls of recycled tires and a thick stucco skin, relying on solar energy and 
its foundation sunk deep within the ground, the bunker-like Earthship would 
seem impervious to fire and quake. The concept cried out to their post-1960s 
environmentalism and post-Los Angeles survivalism. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the Traisters made their way to Taos, the remote village at the tail of 
the Rocky Mountains where a hippie architect invented the Earthship 25 years 
ago and where, today, a whole tract of them is being planned on a sagebrush 
plain just west of the Rio Grande Gorge. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Alison: "We are rectified pioneers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Traisters were among the fire victims profiled in The Times last December 
who had lost their homes and belongings in the Nov. 2 Topanga-Malibu blaze. The 
others were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jim Clements, an easygoing sales manager for a pharmaceutical company. He 
continues to rent a luxurious ranch house in Pacific Palisades while he 
rebuilds his own home on Saddle Peak Road, savoring the process of designing 
and decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carla Formica, a film editor, who had to be rescued from a post-fire flash 
flood last winter but has otherwise settled into a new guest house in 
Calabasas, not far from where she used to live. 
</P>
<P>
 * Doug and Rhonda Ware, who are trying to refinance their six-acre lot on 
Saddle Peak Road, where they had once planned a large home. But even before the 
fire, they came to regret the burdensome mortgage for the land. They have 
decided not to return there and have been struggling with the recent deaths of 
close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But none, it seems, were as buffeted by disaster as the Traisters. 
</P>
<P>
 After the deadly, $375-million brush fire razed their rented cabin off Old 
Topanga Road, the family drifted from one friend's house to another, boxes of 
secondhand clothes and housewares in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan, 25, had been waiting tables while he studied to become a teacher. 
Alison, 30, hand-painted T-shirts and wall-hangings. Between their modest 
income, their big dog and their baby, now 8 1/2 months old, they could not find 
a place to live that approached the rustic beauty they had enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan after another fell through, including pitching a yurt -- a large, 
animal-skin tent -- on their former Topanga landlord's property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was trapped in a place not meant for me," said Alison, a native 
of England with long, dark brown hair and a poetic sense of language. 
</P>
<P>
 "And nothing was opening for us," added Jonathan, an affectionate young father 
with a sandy-blond ponytail and lively blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 16, the day before the earthquake, they moved to a friend's apartment 
in Santa Monica. When the 6.8-magnitude temblor struck, glass windows shattered 
on one side of them and a brick wall crumbled on the other as they clung to 
each other in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights were out. Sirens wailed. They smelled gas, and the building was 
making cracking sounds like crushed paper or glass. As they made their way by 
flashlight down sagging stairs, a nearby building exploded. "It felt like a 
war," Alison recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 It took them four days to pack what few belongings they had left -- or had 
bought with Red Cross vouchers after the fire -- and shove them into their Jeep 
and van. Then, without saying goodby to friends or co-workers, they embarked on 
the adventure of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jonathan and I didn't have a clue what we were going to do but we had to 
leave California," Alison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first night on the road, in the border town of Blythe, the big rigs 
rumbling past their motel sent them leaping out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Phoenix, where Alison had two art shows coming up, they persuaded a 
community of Sikhs to let them stay on their ashram, where they soon became 
known as "the earthquake victims from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 They traded their Jeep and van for a camper van and pressed deeper into the 
Southwest. They went to an Indian sweat. They spent two days at a place called 
Reevis Mountain Farm, a community of organic gardeners connected to the world 
by a steep, 17-mile dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
 They reached Snowflake, Ariz., where some people they know are building an 
Earthship. By then, the Traisters knew they wanted the same kind of home, but 
not in Arizona. "Too close to California," Jonathan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Devised by Taos architect Michael Reynolds and inspired by the region's native 
adobes, Earthships are designed to recycle non-biodegradable materials such 
used tires and aluminum cans and to work as self-sufficient, solar-powered 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 The tires are packed with plain dirt from the excavated building site -- no 
water, no concrete. Then they are stacked into heavily insulated walls with tin 
cans as filler, and slathered in thick coats of adobe mud. 
</P>
<P>
 All Earthships face south, their long walls of solar panels flooding cave-like 
interiors with bright light. Huge cisterns collect rain and snow, and the "gray 
water" byproduct of bathing and cooking irrigates lush planters at the solar 
windows' base. 
</P>
<P>
 Even human waste is recycled to a spreadable, ashen fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect is like living in a greenhouse whose smooth, sandcastle curves 
-- often decorated with colorful bits of tile and glass -- recall the work of 
Antonio Gaudi, the fanciful, early 20th-Century Spanish architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Reynolds' clients include actors Dennis Weaver and Keith Carradine, his 
populist vision calls for providing pleasant, affordable housing to anyone 
willing to buy his generic Earthship blueprints, find their own tires and build 
their homes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an idea tailor-made for the Traisters, hardly the first urban refugees 
to be charmed by Taos. The village's dramatic landscape, rich Native American 
culture and alleged spiritual hum similarly drew D. H. Lawrence and Georgia 
O'Keeffe. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, barely two weeks after arriving, the Traisters joined the first 
dozen or so homesteaders to buy into the Greater World, the 680-acre site 10 
miles outside Taos where Reynolds has planned 100 Earthships of varying size -- 
a sort of New Age Levittown. 
</P>
<P>
 For about $6,500 down (Jonathan's mother has loaned them some money), the 
Traisters are the proud owners of plans for Generic A, the smallest Earthship 
available with 1,000 square feet of livable space and 50-foot setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 They also get a plot of land with a million-dollar view of the Sangre de 
Christo Mountains and set among acres of silver-green sagebrush that scent the 
air with spice after a rain. If construction goes smoothly, the total cost 
should be about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a calling to come to Taos," said Jonathan, grinning as he and Alison 
measured out their lot. 
</P>
<P>
 He misses the Waldorf School in Santa Monica where he interned, and his 
friends at the health-food restaurant where he waited tables. She misses the 
beach. But so far, neither regrets leaving Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our survival thing, our hypervigilant thing," Alison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan plans to build most of the Earthship himself. Alison plans to support 
them by making and selling her T-shirts and wall-hangings. They'll take turns 
watching Monty, splurge occasionally at the Wild and Natural Cafe, and sleep in 
the recently bought camper they'll park on their land. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan figures they'll need 500 tires. So far, he's collected about a dozen, 
their meager pile not phasing him in the least. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only need 488 more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be farther from the Traisters' life than that of Clements, whose 
routine scarcely missed a beat after the fire razed his A-frame home and art 
collection in western Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance has covered his $5,000-a-month rent for a spacious house with a pool 
in Pacific Palisades, where the early-morning earthquake caused so little 
damage that the easygoing Clements showered, dressed and drove to Los Angeles 
airport for a business trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when he arrived at the closed airport did he turn on his car radio and 
realize that freeways had collapsed. At that point, he drove to his property on 
Saddle Peak Road and chopped wood for a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance also amply covers the cost of rebuilding a fancier version of his 
home. This month, his architect was putting finishing touches on plans that 
include stone floors and granite kitchen counters, cathedral ceilings and decks 
on both levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, a divorced and dapper 53-year-old, grew up poor and still mourns the 
sudden death of a beloved sister years ago. With that perspective of dark 
times, he has not wrung his hands in despair over his material losses. He has 
treated the fire as nothing more than a chance to get an even more impressive 
house that requires less maintenance. He appreciates fine things, but he can 
live without them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping leisurely for the perfect Persian rug, sifting through architecture 
books and taking a seminar on kitchen design have all been pleasurable pastimes 
for Clements, a gourmet cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I sold everything, in essence. That's how I think about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Clements, Formica experienced the earthquake from the safe distance of 
Calabasas, where she was house-sitting on a hill as she watched the lights go 
out in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But the emotional Formica had barely recovered from the fire when she was 
caught in a flash flood in Malibu Canyon, as the winter's first rain melted 
naked hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 She had begun wondering why the cars in front of her were making illegal 
U-turns when, before she could do the same, a tidal wave of rocks, mud and tree 
branches slammed into her Volkswagen Rabbit, locking it in gear. 
</P>
<P>
 She was saved by a passing county bulldozer whose driver pulled in front of 
her and held back the torrent, enabling three other men to lift her car and 
clear the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car still bears traces of the mud but Formica seems to have slowly shaken 
off that experience as well as the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 After a frustrating apartment hunt, Formica, 31, finally found a sunny guest 
house surrounded by rosebushes. It is near her parents' home in Monte Nido, her 
two sisters in Malibu, the burned Stunt Road cabin where she spent most of her 
adult life. It is where she sees herself remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything in her new home is secondhand because most of her belongings 
burned. Nothing matches, but she doesn't care. "That's kind of what gives it 
the charm." 
</P>
<P>
 She has taken a break from film editing for now, choosing to earn less and 
relax more. An avid fisher, she works several times a week on the Malibu 
fishing charter Aquarius. She also prepares and serves food for two catering 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm broke, but I'm happy," she said, adding that her plans include nothing 
more than to "catch some fish." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten really good at taking things as they come," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Wares are struggling to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fire, Doug's grandmother and several friends have died. During one 
particularly trying weekend, the couple attended two funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess old people are used to having their friends die all around them, but 
we're not," said Doug, who is 38. Rhonda is 34. 
</P>
<P>
 They are still renting a tiny guest house in Agoura, where daughters Lillian, 
5, and Melanie, 3 1/2, share its single bedroom. Doug and Rhonda sleep on a 
futon in the main room. 
</P>
<P>
 They have applied for a Small Business Administration loan with the hope of 
refinancing their burned Saddle Peak lot, vacant now but still costing them 17% 
in interest and $1,600 a month with property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug, a contractor, said he is working more than ever to make up for a slow 
economy. Their cramped living quarters make it impossible to get any 
administrative work done at home so that keeps him away longer, too. 
</P>
<P>
 They are thinking of seeing a marriage counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not sure where they'll end up living but it will be in or near Los 
Angeles, where they grew up. Before the fire, they had often talked about 
leaving for places with less crime and congestion. But Doug said that now, 
oddly, he likes Los Angeles more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had the realization that no matter where you go, you'll have something 
you don't like," he said. "The snow. No great little restaurants. Seattle has 
rain. Here we have the best of a lot of things, even with fires and earthquakes 
and stuff. I don't know. That just kind of makes it all the more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 What they are certain of is that they will not build the 8,500-square-foot, 
Spanish-style house once planned for the lot. Nor will they return to the 
isolated, if panoramic, setting -- living instead near family, friends and 
other people with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we learned a lesson," Doug said. "A community's not too bad."DISASTER

JACK SMITH: HOW THE DONATION THAT WASN'T STARTED THE GREAT BOOKCASE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If we could retain Perry Mason to investigate our story, he'd call it the Case 
of the Missing Bookcases. 
</P>
<P>
 It involves the usual number of suspicious characters: my wife, my French 
daughter-in-law, my grandson Chris, my granddaughter Adriana, my 
granddaughter's girlfriend and the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 My son Doug and my daughter-in-law, Jacqueline, have recently remodeled, and 
they had two four-shelf bookcases left over. They were bookcases that we had 
given them when we remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife is obsessed with bookcases. I have 3,000 books and she has 1,000 
cookbooks, which are in mint condition since they have rarely been consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 She has never recovered from the loss of two war-surplus bookcases that she 
had worked hard to rehabilitate. They were of sturdy oak and had glass doors 
and were painted Army green. She sanded and stained and varnished them until 
they were restored to their original elegance. However, they were damaged in 
one of our earthquakes years ago and, without asking her, I gave them to a 
young man who said he could repair them. She has never forgiven me. 
</P>
<P>
 So when she asked Jacqueline if we could have the two bookcases we had given 
them, I did not protest. Jacqueline said she had called the Salvation Army to 
pick up several things, but she would withhold the bookcases when the pick-up 
truck came. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the phone call from Jacqueline. She was distraught. The Salvation 
Army had come that morning after she had gone to work. Her son, home alone, did 
not know that she meant to keep the two bookcases and to not let the Salvation 
Army take them. 
</P>
<P>
 She was furious with him. He was furious with her for not telling him. When my 
granddaughter came home, she was furious because she had promised the bookcases 
to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline called my wife to tell her the bad news. By now my wife was 
adamant. She said she would go to the Salvation Army, find the bookcases and 
buy them back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army's Pasadena depot is on Del Mar. My wife and I drove there 
and went inside to look for the bookcases. The depot was full of clean, 
good-looking furniture and household goods of all kinds. I sank into an easy 
chair while my wife told her story to a clerk. Then I spotted a sign that said: 
"PLEASE Do Not Sit on Furniture." Feeling guilty, I eased myself out of the 
chair and stood waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk told my wife that the truck had not yet returned, and when it did, 
the articles it had picked up would be placed in an adjoining warehouse and 
distributed to one of the Army's several retail depots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's forget it," I told my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. "I'm coming back in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 By then I thought it was hopeless. The bookcases were beyond recall. Early the 
next morning, she went back to the depot. She looked through a nondescript 
inventory of castoffs, but our bookcases were not among them. Finally she saw a 
man wheeling in a load on a truck. There were our two bookcases. She told the 
man our story. She told him she wanted to buy them back -- but how? 
</P>
<P>
 He said we would have to wait until they were delivered to the retail depot 
and priced. Later that morning my wife went back. She found the bookcases. They 
were priced at $35 each. The clerk told her this situation often happened. It 
was the Salvation Army's policy not to charge for returning items when donors 
changed their minds. But we could make a donation if we liked. My wife made a 
donation of $50 and we got the bookcases back. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, my wife and I are remodeling again. She has no shower curtain in 
her bathroom and our kitchen sink is lying on the patio. She showers in the 
other bathroom, of course, but we are getting tired of washing dishes in it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are piles of books all over the house. Being a columnist for a newspaper 
of large circulation, I receive numerous promotional copies of books from their 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly they are books I will never read -- "how-to" books about how to have a 
better marriage and how to succeed in business without trying. My most recent 
batch includes "Finally Getting It Right: From Addictive Love to the Real 
Thing"; "Peer Marriage: How Love Between Equals Really Works"; "The Gift of 
Fatherhood," and "To the Golden Cities: Pursuing the American Jewish Dream in 
Miami and L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I think I'll go back to the depot and buy the easy chair I was 
sitting in when that sign shamed me out of it. It was very comfortable, and if 
we ever get our house back together, I'll put it in my bedroom to watch 
television from, or maybe I'll read "Finally Getting It Right" in it.

NY CROWD TRIES OUT WAY -WEST SIDE STORY 
</P>

 "Is this as loose a gate as I hear it is?" queried a late arriver at the New 
York set on the Paramount Studios lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. If you can walk, you're in," was the response. 
</P>
<P>
 Houghton Mifflin Co. had sent more than 1,000 invitations celebrating the book 
premiere of "Saturday Night Live: The First 20 Years" but had graciously 
conceded to the inevitable "Can I bring my friends?" calls and given up 
worrying about the invitation's printed request to "present your 
non-transferable ticket at the door." 
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty of room for all on the triangle block of faux New York 
avenues and plenty of food at the street stalls and booths -- from pretzels and 
popcorn to crab cakes and pasta. There was plenty to drink and plenty of music 
to dance to, provided by the Motown Rockets band. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Booksellers Assn. crowd, many still wearing their name tags -- 
because parties are business, too -- seemed happy wandering the streets (where 
windows were lit up with "Saturday Night Live" reruns), exchanging appropriate 
remarks with Wide End or Samauri Warrior impersonators in the crowd or watching 
Blues Brothers performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Real stars of either the book world or Hollywood were in short supply, 
however, though Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, co-authors of the upcoming 
"Pretty Boy Floyd" from Simon & Schuster, stopped briefly and someone claimed 
to have spotted Amy Tan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood-based A. Scott Berg, biographer of "Goldwyn" and now in the fourth 
year of research for a book on Charles Lindbergh, said: "I like these events 
because I have lots of friends in publishing and when they come here I get to 
see them all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Berg believes the chastening experience of going to the ABA convention site, 
where a writer's work is but one among a multitude, is good for authors. "It 
lets us know what we are up against," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg and McMurtry had both been at Friday night's New Yorker magazine party at 
Morton's -- a cocktail party for the in crowd (no name tags here), which could 
easily have occurred in Manhattan, though a few Hollywood faces did pop up amid 
such Establishment publishers as Stephen Rubin of Doubleday, Sonny Mehta of 
Knopf and Harold Evans of Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' wife, New Yorker editor Tina Brown, was "back home with the children," 
but the magazine's West Coast bureau chief Caroline Graham provided the 
stand-in glamour, hosting along with publisher Lawrence Burstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got invited because I guess I'm sympathetic," said actor Julian Sands, in 
town to begin work on a Paul Schrader movie -- working title "Witchhunt" -- 
about the blacklist era. An avid reader, Sands says he can't imagine reading a 
book on a computer because "I don't own one." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry, owner of three rare-book stores as well as being a best-selling 
author, still works on a manual typewriter so he seemed another unlikely 
candidate to be discussing the new technical age, one of the hot topics at the 
ABA convention. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Michael Viner and Deborah Raffin clearly understand that the sooner 
you step into the future the better you do: Their audio book company, Dove, is 
booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been asking stars to choose their favorite authors to read," said 
Raffin, explaining that Glenda Jackson has just recorded Jane Austen's 
"Persuasion" and that Ben Kingsley has taped several H.G. Wells classics. 
</P>
<P>
 By 8:30 p.m. the party had reached its peak, and the crowd was beginning to 
move on to other meeting-and-greeting spots. "I'm staying on the phone calling 
taxis," a New Yorker assistant announced, as those out-of-towners who hadn't 
rented themselves convertibles for the weekend needed to leave in traditional 
New York style.

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIRS; ONE ADDICT STANDS TALL AGAINST SYSTEM; SUNDANCE: THE

<P>
 On anyone's scale, a Skid Row wino has to be one of America's least powerful 
people. Next time you see one of those ragged figures sprawled on a sidewalk, 
consider the improbability of what Robert Sundance did in 1975: With an 
eighth-grade education and nearly 500 arrests on his rap sheet, he sued the 
city and county of Los Angeles to demand better treatment of street alcoholics 
by police and the courts. And won. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the "Sundance Case," a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in 1978 
ordered sweeping changes. Drunks who had been simply thrown in jail were given 
medical treatment and released much sooner. Arrests for public intoxication in 
L.A. declined from 50,000 in 1975 to 4,000 a decade later. Weingart Center 
detox program opened on Skid Row in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundance, who had been jailed an average of 226 days a year for the 14 years 
preceding his lawsuit, sought to have arrests of street drunks declared 
unconstitutional. He directed the Indian Alcoholism Commission of California, a 
lobbying and educational group, from a Skid Row hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sundance died last year without achieving his ultimate goal -- the 
state Supreme Court rejected his petition in 1987 -- he had improved the lot of 
his people and, as novelist Thomas McGuane writes in the introduction, "owned 
his own life." 
</P>
<P>
 How did he do it? In this memoir, which he began dictating to Marc Gaede in 
1990, Sundance describes his harrowing odyssey through bars, whorehouses, 
alleys and jails all over the West. He gives some clues to his redemption but, 
in the end, remains an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Rupert Sibley McLaughlin on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in 
Wakpala, S.D., in 1927, he was initiated into a demoralized, poverty-stricken 
culture in which alcohol, although forbidden by law, was the only balm. 
"Drinking became a status symbol among Indians," he writes. "Kids saw drinking 
as the main way to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, he lied about his age and joined the Navy so he could leave the 
reservation and buy booze legally. He was an antiaircraft gunner on the carrier 
Ticonderoga during World War II. Then he resumed what was to be, despite stints 
as a rodeo rider, ranch hand, construction worker and firefighter, his only 
real career: drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundance pulls no punches. He tells of the wino's life -- its casual violence, 
its ceaseless wandering, the terrors of delirium tremens -- in blunt, 
convincing terms. The only problem is that in reliving his years on the bottle 
-- the wild highs as well as the lows -- he sometimes slips back into attitudes 
that he claims to have outgrown. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I quit drinking . . . I understood the seriousness of rape," he assures 
us after a series of would-be comic anecdotes about unconscious women being 
gang-raped on barroom floors. "But I didn't know it was rape back then. I 
thought the broads were just playing hard to get." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, something happened. McLaughlin rediscovered his roots, taking 
the name Sundance in 1970. And he concluded that the same system that conspired 
to keep Native Americans drunk and dependent was using street alcoholics as 
slave labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundance began his lonely crusade, sending 80 petitions to judges before he 
got an encouraging answer and help from public interest lawyers. After he filed 
the suit, he writes, Los Angeles police tried to kill him. He persevered. 
</P>
<P>
 Here we confront the enigma of Sundance. With disconcerting ease, he blames 
his years of petty and not-so-petty crime on alcohol, and blames alcohol on the 
white man -- yet a more guilt-ridden person probably would have remained mired 
in booze. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many victims, he sees "the system" as more consciously malevolent than it 
is -- yet this gave him motivation to fight it. No saint, he showed that even 
an ordinary person can enlist his flaws in the service of an astonishing 
empowerment.

SPREADING THE GOSPEL; VAN NUYS: LUIS PALAU BRINGS HIS MASS EVANGELIST CRUSADE 
TO THE VALLEY, HOPING THAT QUAKE-JOLTED RESIDENTS WILL BE OPEN TO THE MESSAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first-ever mass evangelism crusade in the San Fernando Valley begins five 
nights of rallies Wednesday with organizers hoping that earthquake-awakened 
spiritual needs and broad church backing will offset the low name recognition 
of the featured evangelist. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Luis Palau posters, lawn signs and bumper stickers have been 
spread around the Valley with the zeal of a political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was a candidate for a long time," said one Valley resident. 
</P>
<P>
 But crusade leaders are not counting on the religiously unattached dropping by 
to hear Palau, an Argentine-born American respected in evangelical ranks. They 
don't expect the same curious crowds that might come to hear celebrity preacher 
Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, crusade managers hope to fill the 15,000-person capacity stadium at 
Birmingham High School in Van Nuys with members of more than 200 churches and 
religious ministries supporting the crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we hope to get church people who have been emboldened enough to 
bring family members, neighbors and co-workers to an event that will present 
Jesus Christ accurately, faithfully and persuasively," said the Rev. Scott 
Bauer, crusade ministerial chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest appearances of entertainers Pat Boone, Smokey Robinson and Dean Jones 
and a Saturday night Christian rock concert are included to lure additional 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau, 59, has preached to an estimated 10 million people in 60 countries, 
second only to Graham. He is increasingly invited to conduct crusades in U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 His organizers hope total attendance for this crusade will at least match the 
55,600 who came to see him in San Antonio in 1991, if not the 72,000 who heard 
him in 1992 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 A relative unknown outside evangelical churches, Palau has earned the 
confidence of pastors because he has steered clear of sexual scandal, religious 
right politics and unconventional teachings. Palau follows a crusade format 
established by the Graham organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparations for the Valley crusade slowed in January and February after the 
devastating Northridge earthquake. But the temblor and its aftershocks are seen 
by some church leaders as a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake heightens everybody's awareness of a need for an anchor that goes 
deeper than job and family," said Bauer, who is also senior associate pastor at 
Van Nuys' Church on the Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing of the crusade is providential," said the Rev. Scott Hilborn, 
pastor of Canoga Park Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilborn said that he does not believe God wrought a 6.8-magnitude quake on the 
Valley area as a judgment -- a view consistent with that of many other 
Christian clergy who do not portray the Deity as an ominous micromanager of all 
natural events. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it seems very clear to me that God has used this earthquake in very 
positive ways for the spiritual well-being of Los Angeles," Hilborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a variety of reasons, pew-level interest in the crusade has exceeded hopes 
of both local organizers and staff officials from the Luis Palau Evangelistic 
Assn., based in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've trained twice as many people as counselors than we have for any other 
crusade," said crusade Director Colin James, of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,800 people turned out for classes to learn how to assist and encourage 
crusade attendees to commit themselves as Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most people we ever had come to training sessions before was 1,400," 
James said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the evangelical association apparently won the large audiences by 
conducting live training sessions instead of videotaped lessons as in previous 
crusades. Of the 2,800 churchgoers who attended classes, about 1,800 became 
counselors, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Queenie Walcott, a member of Lake View Terrace Baptist Church, is typical of 
the kind of person the crusade wants to attend the rallies. "I need more 
spiritual growth to learn about relying on Scripture to deal with different 
situations," Walcott said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also planned to bring a couple of friends along with her -- people 
that she said have intermittently gone to church or Bible studies but have yet 
to make strong commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Crusade organizers say that scenario is common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighty percent of the people who accept Christ at the crusades are brought by 
a friend," said James, the crusade director. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest criticisms of mass evangelism is that faith decisions at 
crusades tend to be emotional moments with meager or insensitive follow-up 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Left to themselves, they are going to drop away," said Pastor Hilborn, who 
chairs the crusade's counseling committee. "We are doing everything we possibly 
can to see that people who make decisions are assimilated into local churches." 
The plans call for contacts up to a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Another long-term effect anticipated by Valley-area clergy who have supported 
the crusade is a cross-denominational camaraderie that has formed from a year 
of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the single most enjoyable thing I've been a part of since I was ordained 
10 years ago," Hilborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most participating pastors and churches fall into the charismatic/Pentecostal 
and evangelical range of the Christian spectrum. Although three United 
Methodist congregations, three Episcopal parishes and two Lutheran churches -- 
affiliated with liberal-to-moderate denominations -- are among crusade backers, 
they are mostly theologically conservative congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, as more than one pastor noted, even among the many socially and 
religiously conservative churches taking part, there are conflicting views on 
women's ordination, baptism and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have churches that have put aside differences for the sake of unity," 
James said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty percent of the churches and ministries involved are located within the 
San Fernando Valley and Glendale. Fifteen churches in eastern Ventura County 
are supporters, as are scattered evangelical congregations to the north and 
south of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 One conspicuous non-supporter is Pastor John MacArthur's Grace Community 
Church of Sun Valley, which averages 8,000 people at its three Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
 MacArthur is a fundamentalist in doctrine who has been critical of 
charismatic/Pentecostal churches because of their supernatural claims of 
healing and speaking in tongues, but the Rev. Lance Quinn, senior associate 
pastor, said that Grace Community elders decided not to become involved in the 
crusade because of their own effective ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 100 to 150 visitors each Sunday who have never been to our church 
before," Quinn said. "We are not discouraging anyone from participating as 
individuals," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by church elders forced the Rev. Daniel Lozano, pastor of a 
400-member Spanish-speaking congregation meeting at Grace Community, to 
withdraw from the Latino committee for the Palau crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Luis Palau back in Argentina some 30 years ago," said the Lozano, 
pastor of Grace Community's Spanish Department. "We preached in each other's 
churches in Cordoba." 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano and some other Latino Protestant leaders in the Valley have been 
disappointed that the crusade did not include bigger plans for Palau to preach 
in Spanish. All five evenings of the crusade are in English with simultaneous 
translation in Spanish for those who bring radios and earphones. 
</P>
<P>
 The one Spanish service linked to the crusade was held Saturday night at 
Church on the Way and attracted 2,500 people. Organizers limited the Spanish 
outreach because they were worried, they said, that holding rallies in Spanish 
and English on consecutive nights would be confusing to people. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley has no professional sports arena or major stadium, so 
the Palau organization had to be content with an unusual venue for one of their 
crusades -- the bleachers and temporary field-level seating at Birmingham High 
School's football field at the corner of Balboa and Victory boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Palau was invited to lead the Valley crusade by 50 pastors, the 
8,000-member Church on the Way took the lead in crusade organization, providing 
office space for a year and the crusade's honorary co-chairmen, church members 
Pat Boone and car dealer-philanthropist Bert Boeckmann. 
</P>
<P>
 The top administrator for the local crusade committee is also a Church on the 
Way member -- the executive chairman, Lawrence Hoke, a vice president for 
finance of Litton Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoke said last week that he expected the crusade budget to stay below 
$400,000. The expenses include stadium rental and salaries for the temporary 
staff, but were mostly for promotional materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the expectation, based on previous Palau crusades in U.S. cities, that 
most people going to the rallies are churchgoers and their friends, crusade 
director James said that posters, bumper stickers and advertisements are 
necessary expenses for credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in America," James said, "you don't have an event unless you have 
advertising to validate it."

AFTER THE IMPACT, A LIFE ON HOLD; DISFIGURING INJURIES CLOUD GREGORY MOORE'S 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gregory Moore knows that people stare at him. He can't help staring himself. 
</P>
<P>
 When he looks in the mirror, the 33-year-old music student, who many said had 
movie-star looks, now sees a large indent in his face, scars on his throat and 
an eye horribly sunken into its socket. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a head-on auto collision with an alleged drunk driver 10 months ago, the 
Saugus resident has watched his life become an endless cycle of hospital visits 
and physical-therapy sessions. The stares, the aspiring composer said, pain 
him. And physical problems such as double vision limit his ability to move 
about or play the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 But what hurts most of all, he said, is that he does not recognize the person 
in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with how good or how bad I look," he said, sitting in 
the living room of the house where he rents a room. "When you look in the 
mirror you're used to seeing yourself, and that's what I've lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Connors, a 20-year-old former Hart High School football star who has been 
charged with felony drunk driving stemming from the collision of July 24, 1993, 
is scheduled to go on trial Wednesday in Van Nuys Superior Court, although the 
proceedings may be delayed a month because of scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Connors, who has also been charged with reckless driving, a 
misdemeanor, was drag racing on San Fernando Road near Circle J Ranch Road in 
Newhall when the accident occurred just before midnight. He faces up to four 
years in prison if convicted on the felony charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors plans to argue that it cannot be proven he was under the influence at 
the time of the accident, said his attorney, Thomas Kascoutas. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kascoutas said, Connors "feels great remorse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who attends the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, slurs as 
he talks about his recovery. He is missing several teeth; reconstructed sinuses 
have altered his vocal control -- ruining his singing voice; and his rebuilt 
jaw opens about half as wide as it did before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, Moore underwent a 12-hour operation to reconstruct his skull. 
Shocking as his appearance may be today, he said it was much worse before the 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "My right eye had been knocked inward in my skull and down by about 
three-quarters of an inch or so, and my forehead was caved in and my 
upper-level jaw had been obliterated and my nose was gone," he said. "So they 
took bone from both my ribs and the back of my skull and used it to rebuild the 
bones in my forehead, nose, eye sockets and jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 He spends three hours a day in physical therapy, lifting weights and doing 
aerobics to try to regain full use of his limbs -- his hip, left arm, both legs 
and right knee were broken or seriously injured in the crash. Much of his 
remaining time is consumed by visits to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandmother has come down from the Sea Ranch area in Northern California, 
where he is from, to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 In his spare time, he works on an independent studies course, composing music 
on a computer because he cannot sing or play the piano. Graduation is two years 
away, but Moore said he has no idea what his plans will be afterward, because 
he must still undergo several major surgeries. He has already endured at least 
half a dozen, and doctors say he will never regain his normal appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can't decide until all the work is done," he said. "Will I have two 
eyes? Will I be in a wheelchair? It's difficult to make plans." 
</P>
<P>
 But he is certain of one thing: He will work to make people aware of the 
hazards of drinking and driving. Moore plans to help Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving, but he does not wish to speak about the case in great detail until 
after Connors' criminal trial and the resolution of a civil suit he has filed 
against him seeking unspecified compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said that until his accident he never realized the consequences of 
driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not have understood before the crash how quickly this can happen from 
out of the blue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moore graduated from UC Berkeley in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in 
linguistics. He spent five years doing computer work for a private investor in 
San Francisco before enrolling as a graduate student at CalArts in the fall of 
1992. He gave up a well-paying job to study music composition, a longtime 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a huge risk leaving a good career because I believed I had the talent 
and I was getting old. And the risk was paying off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So well, in fact, that he was accepted to a prestigious electronic music 
program in Nice, France, an "unbelievable opportunity," Moore said. And it was 
after having coffee with a friend to celebrate that turn in his life that the 
accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore was driving home in his 1981 Toyota northbound on San Fernando Road when 
Connors, driving southbound at about 70 m.p.h., police said, lost control of a 
relative's 1986 Mercedes convertible. He was allegedly drag racing. Moore said 
he had no chance to avoid the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember seeing a car coming at me, but it was going so fast it was just a 
blip in my memory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore was hospitalized for nearly two months with life-threatening injuries. 
He said he didn't realize how bad the damage was until six weeks after the 
accident, when doctors asked him to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to take my first step and I didn't know how to do it," he said. "I 
didn't have the strength or the muscle coordination. I thought I was going to 
pass out." 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Moore got the first look at his face when his family brought him 
home from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," he said. "I had them push the wheelchair closer and 
closer, and it kept getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore can walk now but such activities as running and driving remain beyond 
his ability. And just about everything else he does is in some way affected by 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his dental problems, he said, "I have two teeth that come together 
and that's how I chew, so it takes forever to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Connors, Moore said the only apology he has received from him was 
contained in a letter received seven months after the accident. It said he was 
"sorry the whole thing had happened," without admitting guilt. Moore said he 
understands Connors' caution because of the impending trial and civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, "A long time after the court case is over, I'm going to have a 
deformed face and a partially crippled body, and I'm still going to be 
expecting an apology from Ryan Connors."

CRIME HAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They don't have any superpowers, catchy code names or even wear spandex 
tights. But this team of high-flying crime fighters has proven themselves to be 
real men -- and women -- of steel. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the Sylmar Hang Gliding Assn. arson and crime watch, what you might 
call an aerial neighborhood watch -- or eye in the sky -- protecting the 
Angeles National Forest above Sylmar. And all they need to launch themselves 
into action is a convenient mountaintop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being Superman," said Larry Walton, 52, a West Hollywood lawyer who 
joined the squad when it was formed 3 1/2 years ago. "It's really easy to spot 
things going on from the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, seven days a week, members of the dedicated corps of about 200 hang 
gliders drive up the winding road to the top of 3,500-foot Kagel Mountain, 
shoulder their kites and leap into space with the zest Clark Kent used to leap 
tall buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But these crime fighters do not patrol some sprawling metropolis, nor do they 
seek solutions with their fists. Instead, they keep their eyes, and disposable 
cameras, trained on the Angeles National Forest for illegal dumping, abandoned 
cars and brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 When they see a problem, the aerial crime fighters get on the radio to a 
spotter on the ground at the gliders' "landing field," an open grassy area near 
El Cariso Park in Sylmar. The spotter then alerts firefighters or U.S. Forest 
Service rangers.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're good informants," said Wolfgang Tamm, district law enforcement 
officer for the Tujunga ranger district. "They're like a bird floating over 
your head. You never know they're there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials have not made any arrests as a result of the watch program, 
Tamm said the gliders' daily flights have helped discourage potential 
troublemakers. At times, the fliers have also kept small problems from becoming 
big ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Don DeYoung remembers one afternoon in June, 
1992, when a single-engine aircraft slammed into a fog-shrouded hillside above 
the Pacoima Dam, killing the pilot. Gliders flying above the fog spotted the 
crash and led air-rescue crews to the scene, where firefighters extinguished a 
small blaze.  
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while to find it, but they helped on that one," DeYoung said. "They 
do what they can to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, another member of the air patrol prevented a blaze from 
spreading when he alerted officials to a car that went off a mountain road in 
Dillon Divide, setting a brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
 With fierce Santa Ana winds, blistering summers and overgrown vegetation, the 
Angeles National Forest is a tinderbox. In 1993 alone, there were 172 fires in 
the huge forest.  
</P>
<P>
 As bad as that tally was, the watch program's founder, Rome Dodson of Sylmar, 
believes some of those fires could have gone out of control without the glider 
patrol. "We've nipped a number of them in the bud," said Dodson, a robust age 
64, who counts seven fires spotted by the watch program since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Most days are pretty uneventful, though. Suspended beneath 65-pound wings made 
of aluminum tubing and Dacron sailcloth, the gliders soar high above the trees, 
catching warm air currents that rush up the face of Kagel Mountain from the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The fliers often circle for hours, dividing their time between searching for 
trouble and soaring with the hawks. On a recent flight, Walton spent nearly an 
hour making the 2,150-foot descent to the tundra-like landing field, a relaxing 
flight with very little to report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spotted a dog," Walton said as he extricated himself from his cocoon-like 
harness. "I don't know if he's a criminal or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Tamm discourages the air jockeys from trying to catch troublemakers, who may 
be armed. But that's fine with most of these gliders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to apprehend somebody," said Fred Ballard, 48, an antique-car 
restorer who lives in Santa Clarita. "You can't just land and chase after 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, "it's a great program," Ranger Tamm said. "Other national forests 
and agencies could benefit from this."

VALLEY CHRONICLE: HIKE TO THE SEA NO EASY TASK -- BUT THEY'RE USED TO 
CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a pleasant Saturday outing, with about 75 nature lovers hiking from the 
Danielson Ranch down to Sycamore Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 At the cove there was a barbecue, sponsored by the Thousand Oaks Kiwanis Club. 
The hike itself was under the aegis of the Wilderness Institute of Agoura 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 What made this particular adventure notable was that some of the hikers were 
in wheelchairs, some blind or otherwise physically challenged, all negotiating 
the bumpy, twisty fire road from the ranch down to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in chairs were pushed by volunteers who turn up year after year to share 
in this outing. Some propelled their chairs themselves, with such brio that the 
Wilderness folks and volunteers held their collective breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like 39-year-old Sid Luther of Glendale, who came with his 12-year-old 
daughter, looked like a drunken sailor as he joyfully journeyed down the fire 
road. He has Frederick's ataxia, which degenerates the muscles. But it didn't 
stop his fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hike gives people like me a chance to get out in the open and enjoy the 
wonders of what God has made for us all to enjoy," said Chris Honicky. 
</P>
<P>
 Honicky, a Van Nuys resident who gives his age as "ageless," was born with 
cerebral palsy. He is confined to a wheelchair and speaks with the use of a 
voice-projecting computer for phone calls and a letter board in person. On both 
he taps out messages to the world with his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Honicky, who has been on all 12 semiannual Wheels to the Sea hikes, was among 
those encouraging nervous first-timers to get on with it. He may not be able to 
speak clearly without the use of his computer, but he knows how to make himself 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Husband and wife Brad and Bonnie Childs are the event coordinators -- and the 
nonprofit Wilderness Institute's mainstays. Although they coordinate many 
nature hikes and outings each year, they both say this is one of their 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much exuberance and sense of high adventure when we go out with 
this particular group that it would be impossible not to get caught up in it," 
said Bonnie. "And this is one event we never have trouble getting funded or 
finding volunteers for." 
</P>
<P>
 The outing is free to the hikers who may hear about it through one of the many 
organizations, such as Easter Seals, that serve the physically challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses to transport the hikers from Kaiser Permanente hospital in Woodland 
Hills and Rancho Sierra Vista in Newbury Park are paid for by the contributions 
of the Golden Eagles, a charitable group that helps support the institute's 
philanthropic events. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a lot of ribbing and teasing from the hikers when one of the buses 
got stuck temporarily in soft ground near the Danielson Ranch and the 
volunteers had to push it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Nofer, 36, of Woodland Hills, is another regular on the hike. Because she 
has multiple sclerosis and tires easily, she asked a volunteer to push her down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't make it sound like I am shut in or helpless or something," cautioned 
Nofer. "I go lots of places and sing in the Woodland Hills Community Church 
choir. But I look forward to the hike each year because it gives me a chance to 
get outdoors and meet new people. And this year the weather was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 After she went home and took a shower, Nofer said, she had to laugh because 
her new "tan" all washed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess what I'm saying is that I don't get a lot of opportunities to get 
dirty. That's part of the fun," she said. Local Group May Perform Dance of 
Sugar Plum Fairies 
</P>
<P>
 It was your typical Valley wedding, with the bride in white and a state of 
grace and the groom in his suit and a state of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that when the betrothed couple reached the Reseda Buddhist Temple, the 
door to the inner chamber was locked. So the wedding party was forced to use 
another room. 
</P>
<P>
 Then bride Ellen Rand, a Buddhist, and husband-to-be Dan Krause, an atheist, 
thought their troubles were over until they learned the officiate had lost his 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never been to a Buddhist wedding," said guest Kurtis Bedford, of 
Reseda, "so I was somewhat startled when the monk started the ceremony by 
apologizing for not being able to speak out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had lost his voice the night before and that it had only come back 
a little during the morning so if everyone would bear with him, he would get on 
with the ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
 After that there was, as Bedford told it, about 30 minutes of chanting, then 
the ceremony that united Rand, a computer operator, and Krause, who runs a 
movie house in Westwood, followed by a reception at the Knollwood Country Club 
in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The florist was late and the band canceled at the last minute," bridegroom 
Krause remembered. "Our party got the food from another party and the other 
party got ours," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was your typical wedding and reception," said Krause. "People throwing 
cake at each other. That sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what would you expect from a wedding given by two members of the 
improvisational comedy troupe called Witness Protection Theater, with a guest 
list augmented by other members of the troupe, including Krause. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has been performing every Friday night at the 50-seat NY/LA Theater 
at 6006 Laurel Canyon Blvd., in North Hollywood, for almost a year. According 
to Krause, the ticket sales pay for the use of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't about to give up our day jobs, but all of us really like the 
opportunity to be on stage," Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group includes, in addition to the computer operator and theater manager, 
a couple of actors, a carpenter, a musician, a television production assistant 
and a couple of people who produce studio special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the offshoot of another improv group in the Valley, which, according 
to Krause and Bedford, was headed by a person with many interesting qualities, 
none of which either wants to mention because of prevailing libel laws. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago the group was invited to appear at the Comedy Store, which jazzed 
troupe members some. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we were in the big room, and there were fewer people in the 
audience than come to our theater," said Krause, adding that his favorite 
improv did not prove as challenging as it usually is at their home base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do an improvisation called 'Dance of the -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ' in 
which the audience is invited to fill in the blank. In North Hollywood, people 
have us doing things like the 'Dance of the Bumblebees' and the 'Dance of the 
Kangaroos.' Boy, those kangaroo dances are tough on the thighs." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hollywood folks asked the group to do the "Dance of the Cats," so the 
ensemble felt as if it had wandered into the 10th year of a way-off-Broadway 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't have been too bad because they have been asked to appear at the 
Comedy Store again tonight at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how they got the name Witness Protection Theater, Bedford said, "It made 
us laugh, so we used it. But we're not so sure now. We get a lot of people on 
our answering machine at the theater who grunt a couple of times and hang up." 
</P>
<P>
 Krause says that the group is nonpolitical and most respectful of federal 
agents and their programs, adding that if any of those agents want to catch 
their show tonight at the Comedy Store, they are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Just please don't ask them to do the "Dance of the Cats." Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '60s I thought I got over crying over the Kennedys. I thought the same 
thing in the '70s and '80s, but here we are in the '90s and the crying never 
seems to stop. All they have to do is show those assassination pictures and I 
start all over. I'm beginning to feel like one of Pavlov's dogs."

MISSING SCHIZOPHRENIC FOUND WITH RELATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old retarded and schizophrenic man who wandered away from a school 
for the developmentally disabled was found in his grandmother's care Saturday 
night, about 30 hours after he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Police began searching for Willie Jonal Allen on Friday afternoon after he 
walked out of the Vista Day Treatment Center in the 14200 block of Roscoe 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's disappearance prompted additional police patrols and door-to-door 
inquiries Saturday night. His caretakers were concerned because Allen did not 
have his medication to control bouts of schizophrenia and epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen walked to the nearby home of his grandmother, who was unaware of the 
ongoing search. She took him to the Van Nuys Psychiatric Hospital for 
treatment, said Sgt. Jim Bilodeau of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was with his grandmother," Bilodeau said. "He was never in danger."

INFANT THROWN FROM CAR IN CRASH DIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-month-old boy died Sunday after the vehicle in which he was riding stopped 
for a traffic light and was struck from behind by a drunk driver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Millan of Tujunga was thrown from the car at 7:46 p.m. Saturday at the 
intersection of Fernando Road and Paxton Street.He was transported by ambulance 
to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills and later airlifted to Childrens 
Hospital in Los Angeles, said a spokeswoman there. He died Sunday evening, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Gamez, 25, of North Hollywood, was arrested and booked on suspicion of 
felony drunken driving, said Officer Norman Nagengast of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Valley Traffic Division. Gamez was being held Sunday night at Van 
Nuys Jail in lieu of $30,000 bail, said Officer Gary Weller. Weller said the 
booking was expected to be upgraded to manslaughter. There was an infant car 
seat in the vehicle, Nagengast said, but it was unclear whether the child was 
strapped into it at the time of the accident. The boy's father, Jose Millan 
Sr., was driving the car, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported that the car with the child was stopped at an intersection 
when the vehicle driven by Gamez rammed it from behind. The impact set off a 
chain reaction that involved two more vehicles, Nagengast said. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupants of the other cars complained of injuries, according to officials, 
but only the child was transported to a hospital. ERIC SLATER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FORMER MULE RANCH TO HOUSE HORSE SANCTUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles-area volunteer group that diverts injured and neglected horses 
from slaughter plans to consolidate its scattered operations next month and 
move to a former mule ranch in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Equus Horse Rescue and Sanctuary, which has been operating for 
four years under various names, will move to a site near the Golden State 
Freeway. The sanctuary will be the first of its kind in a valley with scores of 
horse lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it wonderful?" said Ann Irvine, a member of the Newhall Trail Riders, a 
Santa Clarita equestrian club with about 40 members. "It goes with this valley. 
It goes here." 
</P>
<P>
 Equus, said Director Linda Moss, is "basically a no-kill animal shelter, 
except the animals we take are horses rather than dogs and cats." 
</P>
<P>
 The group of eight volunteers has saved dozens of horses neglected by owners 
or injured in charreadas, traditional Mexican rodeos that include an event in 
which horses are deliberately tripped. The event, the mangana, involves 
repeatedly roping a galloping horse by its front legs, a practice that often 
breaks the animal's bones or tears its tendons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to rescue the ones that are least likely to survive the long drive to 
the Texas slaughterhouse," said Moss, whose group concentrates on Southern 
California rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Equus' horses are purchased from stockyards in Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties, the animals' last stop before being delivered to 
slaughterhouses, mainly in Texas. The price of a horse depends on its size and 
training, with most costing between $500 and $600. It costs Equus about $125 
per horse per month for upkeep, not including veterinarian bills. 
</P>
<P>
 About 85 horses are now cared for at the group's four sites: two in Shadow 
Hills, one in nearby Sun Valley and one in Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more room," Moss said. "We're tearing our hair out going from place 
to place." 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative agreement has been reached for the group to rent a barn and 
25-acre pasture, previously used as a mule ranch, east of the Golden State 
Freeway and north of Calgrove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The property can accommodate up to 150 horses. Equus leaders say they've 
negotiated a good offer from landowner Sam Smiser -- $2,500 per month for the 
ranch -- but donations are needed to cover the rent and feed for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the property is near the freeway, it will be easily accessible for 
visitors, who will be allowed to view the horses on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse sanctuary is expected to appeal to residents who moved to Santa 
Clarita for its rural atmosphere. With the Castaic Animal Shelter facing 
closure because of county budget cuts, it will be the only valley site to treat 
abused horses, Irvine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to have at least some moral support from the community of animal 
lovers out there," Moss said.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials have estimated that the Santa Clarita Valley is home to about 
10,000 horses.

Q&A WITH WOODY HARRELSON; HE'S DOING IT HIS 'WAY' -- CHEERFULLY 
</P>

 Woody Harrelson has spent the last few years both perfecting his "Cheers" 
goofy yokel image -- as in "White Men Can't Jump" -- and busting out of the 
stereotype -- as a struggling yuppie husband in "Indecent Proposal." This 
summer, he'll do much to cement both career paths, first as a lusty hayseed 
rodeo rider in "The Cowboy Way," co-starring Kiefer Sutherland and opening 
Friday, and then, in the biggest challenge of his career so far, as a hardened 
mass murderer in Oliver Stone's chilling "Natural Born Killers," which opens in 
August.  
</P>
<P>
 A native of Midland, Texas, the actor, 32, moved in January with his 
girlfriend, Laura Louie, and their baby daughter, Deni, to a two-room house in 
Costa Rica where, he says, he mainly surfs. He was recently back in the States, 
accepting visitors at acquaintance Jackson Browne's rustic retreat above Santa 
Barbara.  
</P>
<P>
 Barefoot in tie-dyed pants and a hooded sweat shirt and sporting a week's 
growth of beard, Harrelson soaked up the spring weather in a lounge chair 
beneath 100-year-old oaks, speaking in his slow, charmingly sun-baked fashion 
of subjects silly and serious. * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How much of the riffing that you do in "The Cowboy Way" -- the 
pranks in the bars, the double-entendres -- was your creation? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Oh, all that stuff. If not me, then Kiefer. That whole thing with the 
"shiver shots" (in the film, he drinks a shot of tequila from a woman's 
cleavage, licks salt from her neck and takes a lime wedge from her mouth) was 
not in the script. Some girl in New York did that to me. She was a total 
stranger -- she put the lime in my mouth, I was sitting on a stool, she put the 
shot between my legs, salt on my neck, did this whole thing. I was like, I'll 
remember this and use it someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was this before or after "Cheers"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Girls only did that to me after (I started) "Cheers." Me trying to win 
girls over with my personality was all I had before. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You had a reputation in those early years at "Cheers" as a brawler. What 
changed that? A: My last few fights were pretty ugly. I quit during the filming 
of "Doc Hollywood." I was playing hoops down in Florida, there's this big guy 
on the court. He was in my face yelling at me and I shoved him. He just picked 
me up and spun me around so my head was upside down. I was like holding onto 
his thigh, and it was while I was holding on to that tree trunk of a thigh, 
knowing that I was about to take a few lumps, that I said, "I am done with 
this. I'm never fighting again." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've given up a wild lifestyle, too. 
</P>
<P>
 A: When I was 28 I went to Machu Picchu with a friend. I was a nocturnal 
animal who liked to party. My life was shallow. As soon as I got there I just 
felt, "Wow, I've definitely dog-paddled into the deep here." I'd had every 
helper I'd wanted, from 'shrooms to Ecstasy to weed, to everything to boost my 
spiritual experience, but found that I didn't really need them. Right after I 
came back from that, I was a vegetarian. Got rid of my Corvette. Started doing 
yoga.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why, after proving you can move from television to major film roles, are 
you taking off to surf in Costa Rica? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In Hollywood, whatever you have, it is never enough. I was on "Cheers," 
doing as well as some people can ever hope. Yet I wanted more -- wanted to do 
movies. Then maybe I want to direct movies, succeed in music, as a playwright. 
It's all about this self-destructive desire, self-destructive in the sense it 
never allows you to be comfortable hanging out having a conversation.  
</P>
<P>
 So my decision was, at the end of "Cheers," I was doing all that press and I 
was doing a play that I wrote and directed and acted in that nearly killed me, 
"Furthest From the Sun" (which played in Los Angeles at the Tiffany Theatre 
last spring). And then went right into doing "Natural Born Killers" with 
Oliver, then doing "Cowboy Way" right after that. I was ready to be done with 
it. I moved down to Costa Rica and I haven't really worked since. I decided I 
was taking '94 off. Past that I don't have any plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your character in "The Cowboy Way," Pepper, is a simple guy, like Woody 
Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, he's kind of a bon vivant. He's got a rough side to him that Woody 
never had. Woody had that simple childlike, loving thing. Pepper Lewis is 
definitely more of that ribald go-out-and-drink-some-mescal, take-no-prisoners 
attitude. I don't mind playing dumb if I can figure out 15 different ways of 
playing dumb. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But in "Natural Born Killers," you're playing a mass murderer? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's pretty heavy. But even that character has a sense of humor. And the 
movie has a great sense of humor. It's really black comedy. Sometimes you don't 
know whether it's appropriate to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did the role force you to explore your darker side? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most assuredly. I had all these books on different serial killers, tapes, 
interviews. My mind was saturated with it. The movie has humor in it, but 
there's some pretty intense stuff. That movie brought up a lot of my shadow 
elements, my anger, my rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How so? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Man, there was a while I was driven by my rage after doing this movie. I 
had so much anger. I got so angry at the wardrobe person in "Cowboy Way" that I 
slammed my fist into a wall. Little petty things were sending me off. It came 
from this re-emergence of my shadow. I found that my temper was just a lot more 
volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will people see this dark side of you in "Natural Born Killers"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You could probably still argue that the character's kind of engaging, 
charming in a way. A lot of the scariest characters I've seen have some charm 
to them. You check out tapes of Ted Bundy. What scares people the most is he's 
charming -- very articulate. I don't know what people's reaction will be (to 
the movie). I can only speculate that it's going to be an extreme reaction.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: People may wonder if there's any relationship to the character you play and 
that of your father, Charles, who is serving a life sentence in federal prison 
in Marion, Ill., for the 1979 contract murder of federal Judge John Wood. What 
is your relationship now with your dad? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We talk almost every day. I can't call him, but he can call me. We have an 
extremely great relationship. He's a great guy. Hysterical. Loves to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said you don't think he got a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm intent on eventually seeing he gets another trial. I'm not going to run 
around proclaiming his innocence, but I will steadfastly and intently claim 
that he did not get a fair trial. And if after a fair trial he is convicted, 
well, I'd be OK with that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That sounds as if you think he might well have killed a federal judge.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I think my dad has done a lot of things that he regrets. But I don't 
necessarily feel that he's killed anyone. I know he's done things that he 
regrets because I know he used to be with the CIA. All I know is if you sit 
down with him, spend an hour with him, you're going to walk away saying this is 
one hell of an interesting, charming fellow. You can't help but like him. I'm 
not convinced he's ever been a hit man as he's purported to be. But I'm also 
open-minded enough to say I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 I accept him 100%. I love the guy. I don't know that he was the best of 
fathers. But when I go in there and I hang out with him, I'm not grading him on 
his past record. I'm just spending time with a really interesting person. We 
have a connection.

FX AFFECTS C-SPAN'S VIEWERSHIP; CABLE TELEVISION: SOME OPERATORS ARE DROPPING 
THE PUBLIC-AFFAIRS NETWORK TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE NEW FOX CHANNEL WEDNESDAY. IT'S 
THE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When fX, the new cable network from Fox, begins programming Wednesday, it will 
be available in 18 million U.S. households, said to be the largest launch of a 
cable channel in history. But fX's gain will be C-SPAN's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some 1.1-million cable subscribers will lose C-SPAN entirely or see us part 
time due to cable systems picking up fX," said Brian Lamb, chairman of C-SPAN, 
the 15-year-old cable channel that televises congressional proceedings and 
other public-affairs events. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb blames provisions in the 1992 Cable TV Act for this development, which he 
says gave Fox and the other broadcast networks an unfair advantage in rolling 
out new cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is government meddling in communications of the highest order," Lamb 
said angrily. "I have nothing against fX, but the government has given the 
broadcast networks a powerful jump-start with their new cable networks, an 
advantage that no one else has." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Lamb complained, the same law earlier led to another 2.5 million 
subscribers -- including some in Anaheim, Pasadena and Alhambra -- losing all 
or part of their access to C-SPAN programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cable TV Act prohibited cable companies from carrying a broadcast signal 
without the consent of the station. If a station wanted to provide the signal 
for free, cable operators in the immediate area were obligated to carry it, 
even if they hadn't done so in the past -- the so-called "must-carry" rule that 
meant dropping or cutting back on existing channels.  
</P>
<P>
 If a station didn't want to give away its signal, it could negotiate for 
"retransmission consent." This is the route the networks took with the stations 
they own, but most cable operators balked at paying cash to the broadcasters, 
so many of them struck deals instead that guaranteed space for network-owned 
cable channels in exchange for the right to continue carrying their 
over-the-air programming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ABC quickly brought forth ESPN-2, now available in 14 million homes; Fox 
developed fX and NBC will launch America's Talking, an all-talk channel, on 
July 4, with an initial reach of more than 10 million homes. (CBS chose not to 
go forward with a cable enterprise.) 
</P>
<P>
 fX's weekday lineup will mix reruns of "Dynasty," "Hart to Hart," "Fantasy 
Island," "Wonder Woman," "In Living Color," "Batman" and "Greatest American 
Hero" with seven hours a day of original programming, ranging from a 6:30-9 
a.m. information show along the lines of "Good Morning America," to a pet show 
at 2:30 p.m., an issue-of-the-day show hosted by Jane Wallace at 8 p.m., a 
music video program at 11 p.m. and a viewer call-in show at 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, dozens of other new cable channels are struggling to find an outlet 
in the crowded cable universe. Most cable systems simply don't have the channel 
capacity to handle anywhere near the volume of programming that is being 
offered. If they decide to take something new, it often means dropping 
something else or forcing two services to share time on one channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the 'law of unintended consequences' run amok," said Lawrence Grossman, 
president of Horizons Network, a proposed cable channel that would be a 
"cultural C-SPAN," offering lectures, readings and other symposiums featuring 
authors, scientists and artists. "The government has given the broadcast 
networks a preferred seat on the bus for their new cable channels, while all 
the new independent services have been pushed to the back of the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 And with cable companies chafing under new rate cuts ordered by the Federal 
Communications Commission, new channels such as Grossman's may not get a better 
seat anytime soon. The cable operators say that the government has severely 
restricted their ability to generate the revenue needed to upgrade and expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC clearly intended to create incentives for new networks, but the most 
recent rules have had the opposite effect," Grossman said. "They've helped to 
create a situation that discourages new and innovative program services." 
</P>
<P>
 Horizons Network and Ovation Network, a proposed fine-arts network whose 
executives include former National Gallery of Art curator Carter Brown, 
recently asked the FCC to look at the impact of its regulations on smaller 
networks. Kathleen Waldman, deputy chief of the FCC's cable services bureau, 
said that the agency may do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are open to hearing arguments about whether we've provided adequate 
incentives to add new programming and maintain investment in public-interest 
programming like C-SPAN," Waldman said. "We obviously didn't intend for the 
rules to discourage diversity in programming." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry also has challenged the constitutionality of the 
"must-carry" rule, arguing that, under the First Amendment, the government may 
not dictate the programming that cable operators offer. A decision by the U.S. 
Supreme Court is expected soon. If it votes to overturn the law, C-SPAN could 
win back some of the channel space it has lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Some C-SPAN fans aren't waiting for the government to act, however. They've 
mounted local campaigns to protest the replacement of C-SPAN with fX. "People 
are outraged that we are going to go off and they are going to get reruns of 
'Dynasty' instead," Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
 In McAllen, Tex., the announcement that TCI Cablevision planned to drop C-SPAN 
in favor of fX prompted citizens to demand a meeting with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting beat up by my customers, but I don't have a lot of options," said 
TCI General Manager Neil Hamen. "We have contract obligations to take fX, we 
have to take broadcast signals, we're channel-locked -- the people in 
Washington who passed the regulations are reaping what they've sown."

STREET MUSICIAN REJUVENATED BY SACRED HEARTS; POP MUSIC: KEYBOARDIST DANNY 
FEDERECI WAS HURT BY THE BREAKUP OF THE E STREET BAND, BUT HE'S HIS OWN BOSS 
NOW AND HAPPY WITH A NEW BAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The phone rang, and it was Bruce. That probably meant it was time for the band 
to tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not what it meant. This time, in late 1989, Bruce Springsteen told 
Danny Federeci he was breaking up the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised," Federeci recalled. "I was very hurt. It was the only life I 
had known for 22 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, Federeci, 44, isn't completely healed. He says he is still 
"working through all that stuff," but he is happy. For the first time since the 
E Street Band hit the road, for good, its ex-keyboardist is excited about his 
work. He plays Monday nights for the house band -- the Sacred Hearts -- at one 
of the hottest clubs in town, the new House of Blues in WestHollywood. He is 
his own Boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a bit of the fun that I used to have," he said. "I had forgotten 
why I became a musician." 
</P>
<P>
 He can see his audience again. After Springsteen became a superstar during the 
mid-1980s, Federeci said, the band lost that once-magical intimacy with its 
fans. "You could see maybe the first 10 rows of the crowd, and that was it," 
Federeci said. "Now, I play for people I can hear, people I can see." 
</P>
<P>
 Federeci envisions himself as an "R&B kind of guy," which matches his group's 
blend of contemporary and old-fashioned blues. The band plays Muddy Waters, Al 
Green and Albert King. These are the songs Federeci loves, not just the ones 
Springsteen preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's no fool. He understands the climb back to success is very steep, and 
so he calmly accepts his band's secondary role. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not there to be the stars," Federeci said. "We're there to make others 
look good." 
</P>
<P>
 That means he'll pull out his rock 'n' roll Rolodex, and bring in the best 
names possible. So far, Gregg Allman, Johnny Rivers and Paul Shaffer have 
stopped by to jam. Federeci said there will be more guests. "We want to give 
people a sense," he said, "that anything can happen on Monday nights." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The band is moving slowly with its music as well. Eventually, members plan to 
introduce original songs into their repertoire, but for the immediate future, 
covers will suffice. The group also includes guitarist Steve Chrismar, who 
played with George Thorogood; lead vocalist Jimmie Wood, who recorded with 
Bruce Hornsby, and drummer Tony Braunagel, who has toured with Ricki Lee Jones, 
Bette Midler and Bonnie Raitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Braunagel said Federeci has had the perfect attitude for a new band. "He 
doesn't walk around with his ego," Braunagel said. "He's very open to musical 
suggestions, and quite full of his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, while Federeci says the breakup of the E Street Band has liberated him, 
both musically and emotionally, he still misses the good life. He puts "room 
service" at the top of that list. "I walked into the lobby of this hotel 
recently after a Billy Joel concert," he said, "and I saw someone with a room 
service tray. I don't miss the music, but I do miss the hotels." 
</P>
<P>
 He also misses the dedication of the Springsteen days. When the band needed to 
rehearse, the band rehearsed. That wasn't always the case when Sacred Hearts 
first got together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came from a different scene," he said, "and either you're committed or 
you're not. I wasn't used to that. But I understand these guys have to hustle 
to make it in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes himself. Since moving out here in 1992, his resume has gotten 
him into meetings, but it hasn't clinched the deal. He had hoped to write music 
for films or television but so f1634869358good," he admits, "if I had just been 
a bit more famous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Federeci's only regret may be that he didn't leave it all sooner. "I 
wasted a lot of good time," he said. "That's what happens when you make too 
much money." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was Springsteen who made him realize it was time to move to Los 
Angeles. One day, he visited Federeci's New Jersey farm and told him there was 
nobody left in New York. Everyone had moved west. "It was true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wouldn't be a total shock if Springsteen pops up soon at the House of 
Blues to play with his ex-keyboardist. The two saw each other a few weeks ago, 
and have remained good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "He digs the club," Federeci said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Sacred Hearts play two sets every Monday night, starting at 10:30, at 
the House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. Cover charge is $10.

FAMILY; 'MIDSUMMER NIGHT': SHAKESPEARE FOR ALL; "LORD, WHAT FOOLS THESE MORTALS 
BE... . "  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Mortal and magical foolishness abound in Shakespeare's comedy "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream," and Theatricum Botanicum, the outdoor venue in rustic Topanga 
Canyon that specializes in classic theater, hopes that family audiences will 
come see for themselves how accessible the Bard can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it every year for schools," said the company's artistic director Ellen 
Geer, who is directing the show. "And the production is so lovely we wanted to 
extend it to families." This play of mismatched lovers, noblemen, a magic spell 
gone awry, a comic band of lowly actors, and a mischievous sprite named Puck, 
all in the forest realm of a jealous Fairy King, is a natural for her theater, 
Geer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just the place for it. A wonderful fairy world appears out of the 
(real) forest, actors swing out of trees, and we even have a wonderful running 
brook." 
</P>
<P>
 The staging will stay true to the original. "There's something in there for 
everybody. We don't make it bawdy at all, there's no need to. It's a sweet 
comedy." And, Geer stressed, children and parents will have no trouble with the 
language of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had the complaint 'I didn't understand Shakespeare' " when 
performing for children as young as the third grade, Geer said. "You'd be 
surprised at how they get it. They're fascinated by the play's three worlds: 
the comic world, the duke's world and the wonderful world of the fairies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shakespeare's plays are so strong and beautifully written," she added, "if 
you just do them honestly and simply, you bring them to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences are encouraged to tote cushions for comfort on the railroad-tie 
seats and to come early with a pre-show picnic. As far as the age range goes, 
"babes in arms" are fine with Geer. "We love any age here. We want it to be a 
family experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's 12th annual summer repertory season also includes "Macbeth" 
(June 12-Sept. 18), Moliere's "Educated Women" (July 2-Aug. 21) and Tennessee 
Williams' "The Glass Menagerie" (Aug. 13-Sept. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga Canyon 
Blvd., Topanga, Saturdays, 3 p.m., June 11-July 16. Adults, $12; ages 6 to 12, 
$4; age 5 and under, free. (310) 455-3723.  
</P>
<P>
 It Was Their Idea: Members of Kids on Stage, a children's theater arts program 
for ages 3 to 16, chose peace as the theme for their series of one-act plays, 
"Imagining Peace," beginning today at the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble under the 
direction of Elaine Hall Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 The plays, conceived, written and performed by children, are about family 
peace, global peace and yes, even peace in outer space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Today - Thursday and June 6, 4 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. Admission: Donation 
of clothing or canned food for the Red Cross. Reservations: (310) 473-4088.

OFFSPRING: FAVORITE SON IN PUNK WORLD; POP MUSIC: IT WAS JUST ANOTHER PUNK BAND 
-- UNTIL A RARE BREAK FROM THE SONG 'COME OUT AND PLAY' GOT THE BAND'S MOTOR 
RUNNING.

 As 1994 began, the Offspring was just another obscure punk band hoping it 
could make it to the next gig without its bus breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
 The motor would seize up on the road to Bakersfield. The transmission would 
give out en route to Arizona. When they finally got the engine rebuilt, the 
four band members drove across country on a winter tour, shivering all the way 
because they couldn't get the heater to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awful, but it would cost too much to fix it," recalled drummer Ron 
Welty, 23. "We were punk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 With its school bus body still bearing the green paint job and Holiday Inn 
logo from its previous incarnation as a hotel shuttle, the Offspring's chariot 
now sits ready in a cul-de-sac in a peaceful Orange County subdivision. This 
time it has to be in good working order: Suddenly, the Offspring appears to be 
going places.

 In April, KROQ, the alternative-rock station, put the band's song "Come Out 
and Play" into regular rotation, playing it every three or four hours. It's a 
rare break for a punk band on a small, independent label, but the song is a 
rare combination of punk rawness and pop savvy -- an insinuating, deftly 
constructed track that grabs a listener's interest and holds it with a 
succession of catchy, diverse musical hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring's fortunes had been on the rise even before "Come Out and Play" 
started generating numerous request calls from KROQ listeners. While band 
members Welty, Bryan Holland, Greg Kriesel and Kevin Wasserman were trying to 
stay warm on their bus last winter, sales of their 1992 release, "Ignition," 
were heating up. The Offspring's label, Epitaph Records, had managed to place 
several songs from the album with producers who make action videos for fans of 
surfing, snowboarding and skateboarding. The payoff was almost immediate. 
According to Holland, the band's singer and songwriter, in a matter of four 
months sales shot from 16,000 to 46,000 -- an impressive total for an 
independent punk release. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Smash," the Offspring's third album, came out in mid-April, there was a 
substantial corps of new fans waiting for it. Andy Kaulkin, Epitaph's marketing 
director, says 75,000 copies have been shipped to stores. Now the label, which 
has been hailed for its ability to top the 100,000 sales mark with hard-core 
faves Bad Religion and Pennywise, smells the possibility of a hit that could 
cross over to the much larger alternative crowd (as always, MTV will be the 
final arbiter of that). 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring's members don't seem to be letting any of this go to their 
heads. Sitting around a table in the pleasant, walled-in back yard of the home 
where bassist Kriesel grew up, they came off as a relaxed, down-to-earth, 
good-natured bunch who are eager to see what happens next, but have no great 
hankering for rock stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing in obscurity for most of their 10-year existence, the Offspring, 
whose members range in age from 23 to 31, see a touch of absurdity in their 
suddenly unfolding success. Wasserman was nonplussed after Holland finished 
quoting the band's KROQ airplay statistics: "A tinny little punk band from OC"? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The band began in 1984, inspired by such local precursors as the Adolescents, 
Agent Orange and T.S.O.L. By 1992, Holland had learned to write catchy, 
sing-along chorus melodies for songs that typically offer acerbic but alert 
commentaries on everything from geopolitics to relationship pitfalls to the 
difficulty of remaining an individual in a world that rewards conformism.  
</P>
<P>
 With "Smash," the Offspring has come into its own, crafting a full album of 
solid songs. Many of the tracks feature not just one good musical hook, but 
several. Holland, who clones viruses in his parallel life as a Ph.D candidate 
at USC, fronts the band with an interesting voice, part reedy and part chesty, 
that calls to mind a less bleating Ozzy Osbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to do both," Holland said of possible conflicts between punk rock 
and microbiology. "If it comes down to it, I'm going to quit school, because I 
don't want to pass up what's happening now." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Offspring is on the bill for the KROQ "Weenie Roast," June 11 at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre.

'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND' RESURFACES IN A SAN DIEGO MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been 30 years since the S.S. Minnow ran aground on a piece of Pacific 
landscape known as "Gilligan's Island." And in many ways it and its followers 
are still stuck there.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1964-67 television series created by Sherwood Schwartz has outlived 30 
years of critical abuse to become a pop-culture icon of sorts , a classic study 
of life and profits after prime time.  
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz says he never envisioned anything more than a season or two when he 
developed the show as an escape from writing "The Red Skelton Show." Yet 
"Gilligan's Island" has had as many reincarnations as "The Brady Bunch," 
another creation from Schwartz (who was also the producer of two television 
forgettables, "Big John, Little John" and "Dusty's Trail").  
</P>
<P>
 "Gilligan" has been in nonstop syndication since 1967, is in home video, has 
been the subject of several books. Its story will soon become a feature movie 
and is the basis of a new musical play.  
</P>
<P>
 "There might even be a laser disc of 'Gilligan' somewhere," Schwartz said from 
San Diego where he is overseeing production of "Gilligan's Island, the 
Musical," now at The Theatre in Old Town.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How many "Gilligans" have you had? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Your guess is as good as mine. Originally there were 99 episodes over 
three years, and as soon as the show was off the network they went into 
syndication. Then we had two cartoons. There were also three two-hour TV 
specials. "Rescue From Gilligan's Island" was the first of the so-called 
reunion shows on the networks, getting a 54 share. With numbers like that 
everybody else started to have reunion shows. Five books have come out about 
the show. And the entire three years are on home video. 
</P>
<P>
 Then coming up is a movie for Turner Pictures and a stage musical. It's been a 
cottage industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A musical "Gilligan's Island"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, at The Theatre in Old Town in San Diego. I wrote the book with my son 
Lloyd. My daughter Hope and her husband, Laurence Juber, who was guitarist with 
Paul McCartney and Wings, wrote the lyrics and music for our musical. Like I 
said, it's a cottage industry. In my cottage. We are doing the first original 
stage musical based on a television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Wasn't the "Brady Bunch" also a play? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I was creator and executive producer of "The Brady Bunch" on TV. The 
stage version was done by others, but it was a repeat of the old scripts. The 
"Gilligan" musical is a completely original work with all seven characters and 
18 original songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your "Gilligan" movie had been making the studio rounds for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 A: We could have been the first one out with a movie based upon a television 
series if things had run smoothly. My original script was written 4 1/2 years 
ago. The copyright belongs to the Phil Silvers estate and to Ted Turner. First 
we had to sell them and since Ted Turner didn't have a film operation, then we 
went first to Disney. Disney finally decided against it. Then we almost had a 
deal at Columbia. Then Paramount got interested, but Columbia threatened to sue 
so Paramount bowed out. Then Columbia bowed out. The script traveled so much I 
almost put wheels on it.  
</P>
<P>
 Now with the new Turner Pictures company we have the best of all worlds. He 
owns the studio and half the copyright. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You don't own "Gilligan"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I own all the characters I created, thanks to the Writers Guild, so nobody 
can do anything without me. The way it works is: If the copyright owners 
instigate a project, like the movie, then I get a fee as creator. If I 
instigate a project, like the musical, I pay a percentage to the copyright 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Gilligan's Island" has never been a favorite of critics. But interest in 
the show is still around. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know about the critics, but the show is a family show, which is 
important to me. Family values mean something, just like they do on my other 
show, "The Brady Bunch." That's what I do, family entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 If you study both "Gilligan" and "Brady," you will see they are based on a 
similar philosophy: that it's possible for different kinds of people to learn 
to live together, either in a family or stuck on an island with no escape. 
</P>
<P>
 I took seven radically different people, a captain, his first mate, a movie 
star, a farm girl, a scientist, a billionaire and his wife and put them on an 
island where they could learn to compromise and live together. It's like the 
world, with its poor nations and rich nations learning to live together. It's 
the same in families where people have to learn how to live together. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did it all start? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was Red Skelton's head writer for seven years, and I was tired of doing 
Freddie the Freeloader and Clem Kadiddlehopper, so I decided in 1963 to develop 
my own property. When I did my agent made one phone call to CBS. We made a 
presentation and the network bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS wanted Phil Silvers to do another series after "Sergeant Bilko" ("You'll 
Never Get Rich") and gave him a deal to form his own production company, which 
took on my show, "Gilligan's Island." United Artists was a partner with 
Silvers. When Turner bought MGM and United Artists he got half of "Gilligan's 
Island," and he held onto it when he sold UA. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was "The Brady Bunch" as easy to sell as "Gilligan"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I wrote the pilot five years after "Gilligan." Then it took 3 1/2 years 
to sell it to ABC. I own that show's characters too.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did the musical "Gilligan" come about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've been working on it for the past 16 years after I saw "Annie" on 
Broadway. Why, I wondered, did that show run so long? The answer was easy: 
three generations of kids growing up with the comic strip. The same thing was 
happening with "Gilligan" through syndication. So I decided to do a musical and 
started working on it with my son, Lloyd. Five years ago we did a stage reading 
of our script in North Hollywood with just a piano and the actors. A director 
friend of mine saw it and said I should take it to a theater in the South that 
was looking for new musicals. So about two years ago we staged it at the Flat 
Rock State Theater in North Carolina. Then we took it to Chicago for four 
months. The Theatre in Old Town approached us, and I went there to see what was 
being done there. It's scheduled for a month and then we'll decide if it stays 
or moves on. We have some interest from two New York producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Beside the musical, you have some movie projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Two movies. My son, Lloyd, and I have written and will produce "Gilligan's 
Island" for Turner. And we'll do the same with the feature version of "The 
Brady Bunch" for Paramount. "Brady" is more advanced than "Gilligan." It starts 
production in July. The script is finished, and it's in rewrite. This will be a 
different "Brady." It will show the Bradys with all of their traditional values 
but in the '90s. They remain staunch to their beliefs, even if everyone else 
thinks they're freaks. Guess who wins. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Gilligan" movie will be different from the TV series because of the size 
of the production, and it will have seven major stars. But that won't be ready 
until next year. I also have a reissued book out now from St. Martin's Press, 
"Inside Gilligan's Island," on how the series developed. It brings everything 
up to date. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gilligan's Island: the Musical," $17-$24, runs through June 12 at The 
Theatre in Old Town, 4040 Twiggs St., San Diego. (619) 688-2494.

ANN CONWAY: BETH BURNS STEPS INTO LIVES OF CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mugging for a picture with two of her prize dancers, St. Joseph Ballet founder 
Beth Burns, a former nun, gets the giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers have executed graceful arabesques in the garden of Le Meridien 
Hotel, and, holding their poses, they stare worshipfully at their 
choreographer. "No, no!" Burns howls, scooping them up in a hug, "that's too 
adoring!" 
</P>
<P>
 Another hug. Click. "Much better," she says, smiling for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns came last week to Le Meridien to receive the prestigious Amelia Earhart 
Award from the Women's Opportunity Center of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is bestowed annually upon a woman who has provided growth 
opportunity for others. In 1983, Burns founded the St. Joseph Ballet Company of 
Santa Ana. Since then, 20,000 children from low-income families have learned 
the discipline of the dance in a loving environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Does she always have this much fun? "I use a lot of humor in my work," Burns 
says, taking a breather before she flies into a ballroom packed with 650 
people. (The paparazzi have been keeping her busy for about an hour now.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We love her because she has childlike qualities," teases dancer Flor de Liz 
Alzate, 18. "But we also know the look ," Alzate says, grinning at Burns. "It's 
her smile that says, 'It's not funny anymore; time to get to work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Picture a child," Burns says softly to the men and women who have dined on 
chicken Nicoise salad in the hotel ballroom. "One that's dear to you. Now, 
imagine that child alone . . . Mom and Dad at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child has given thought to joining a gang. He or she doesn't want to be 
alone. The child is afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the St. Joseph Ballet, "where that fear is turned into the free use of 
one's gifts," Burns says. "When Flor de Liz joined the ballet eight years ago, 
I was worried about her. She wore clothes that were reminiscent of Madonna's 
first incarnation, and I'm not talking about the Holy Virgin. She wore too much 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 "After about a year, she began to dress in little cotton shorts, with no 
makeup. I asked her if she knew why. She told me, 'I got happy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Applause fills the room. It is a golden moment for Burns. A crowd that lives 
far from the inner city has understood her mission. 
</P>
<P>
 After the festivities, Burns talks about her work and why she left the Sisters 
of St. Joseph of Orange: "When I was a sister of St. Joseph, I knew I wanted to 
use my gifts to help the poor," she says. Burns has danced the ballet since 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the sense that artistic expression and a loving environment could 
foster the three building blocks of success -- self-esteem, self-discipline and 
a sense of accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 But she was teaching high school in a suburban area, she says. She wanted a 
greater challenge. "I had the feeling I wanted to make a bigger difference in 
the world. I needed a little bit more room in my own life personally to grow 
spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983 Burns wrote a grant proposal, hoping she might be able to teach dance 
to impoverished children. The Ahmanson Foundation responded, agreeing to fund a 
five-week summer pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want your children to be able to dance, have fun, feel proud of 
themselves?" were the words Sister Beth printed on the posters she distributed 
that summer in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't afraid to walk the hot, dusty streets where gangs and drug dealers 
held court. "For what I want to do and be in life, it doesn't make any sense to 
put much energy toward something bad that might happen," she says. "Gosh, you 
could be in Corona del Mar and get hit by a truck." 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 children responded. The first lessons were held in the basement of 
the Episcopal Church of the Messiah in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1989, the company was well established and Burns, who left the order the 
same year, was able to move to its present location, a 4,000-square-foot studio 
in Fiesta Marketplace. "It's well lit and maintained and respected by the 
community," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And she is grateful. "I believe passionately in these children. Their hearts 
have touched me deeply."

THIS WOMAN'S PLACE; FRESHMAN REPRESENTATIVE MAJORIE MARGOLIES-MEZVINSKY IS NO 
'THREE M GIRL.' AND AFTER CASTING SOME CONTROVERSIAL VOTES ON KEY ISSUES, SHE'S 
SHOWN SHE CAN HANG WITH THE BIG BOYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky arrived at her office for an interview 
carrying a carton of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apologizing for being late, she explained that she had stopped by a 
Congressional "omelet do" in hopes of getting a fast lunch, but the cooking had 
just ended. "So they gave me a dozen eggs instead." 
</P>
<P>
 As the freshman Democrat who cast the vote that saved the first Clinton 
budget, Margolies-Mezvinsky is not about to refuse a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected in 1992 by a scant 1,300 votes in a wealthy suburban Philadelphia 
district that is 2-to-1 registered Republican, she is running hard to convince 
constituents that, despite breaking her promise not to increase taxes when she 
voted for that budget, she deserves a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will always, always have a very, very tough district," she said during the 
interview, conducted literally on the run as she sprinted between her office 
and the House floor. "There are certain people who will never vote for me and 
the budget vote gave them a real platform." 
</P>
<P>
 Media-savvy from a prior career as a television reporter, Margolies-Mezvinsky 
has crafted a platform of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by a former Washington Post researcher, Barbara Feinman, she has written 
a book about her experiences and those of 23 other women first sent to the 
House of Representatives in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, "A Woman's Place: The Freshmen Women Who Changed the Face of 
Congress" (Crown, 1994) is full of anecdotes about chauvinist slings and arrows 
in an institution that, despite a rise in female representation from 29 to 48, 
is still 90% male. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while congressmen invariably refer to each other as "my 
distinguished colleague" from such and such a state, they often call women 
members by their first names, she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rep. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) publicly called Margolies-Mezvinsky "that 
three M girl," she was irked not so much by the shorthand for her 
tongue-twisting moniker -- her own campaign T-shirts say "MMM" -- as by the 
noun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Referring to me at age 51 as a 'girl' is inaccurate, demeaning and 
pathetically behind the times," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The slight pales next to one experienced by another freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 During a debate over the Hyde amendment restricting the use of federal funds 
for abortions, veteran Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.) told Rep. Corinne Brown 
(D-Fla.) to "shut up" when she objected to his request to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyde amendment easily passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting here is only half the magic act; the task at hand is to carve out our 
own place," Margolies-Mezvinsky wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, her task is to remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling her climactic Aug. 5 action, she wrote: "I knew at the time that 
changing my vote at the 11th hour may have been tantamount to political 
suicide. . . . (But) the vote would resolve itself into one simple question: 
Was my political future more important than the agenda that the President had 
laid out for America?" 
</P>
<P>
 Political opponents, not surprisingly, view her choice in less heroic terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want someone who's gonna lie to you, reelect Marjorie," said Frank 
Bartle, GOP chairman of Pennsylvania's Montgomery County, most of which is 
within Margolies-Mezvinsky's 13th congressional district along the famed 
Philadelphia Main Line. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which before her election had not sent a Democrat to Congress 
since 1916, is one of only three in the nation where more people had their 
taxes raised by the Clinton budget than had them cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went from having no record to having the worst record you could possibly 
have in this district," Bartle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Margolies-Mezvinsky's extreme political vulnerability may actually 
prove to be her salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling both grateful and guilty about putting a freshman Democrat from a 
historically Republican district in such a predicament, her supporters have 
been pulling out their checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Federal Election Commission, Margolies-Mezvinsky led the 110 
House freshmen in contributions last year, both from individuals and political 
action committees, and ranked seventh in fund raising for all House members, 
just behind Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to $520,000 raised in 1993, she has attracted $154,000 in the 
first quarter of this year, said her campaign manager, Amy Walter. Half of that 
money also came from PACs, Walter said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Margolies-Mezvinsky defended accepting PAC money despite 
running as a "reform candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of 11 Democrats who voted to eliminate PACs, but I have a very 
difficult district. I have to be very aggressive with fund raising and will be 
within the rules," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter said contributions came from labor unions, insurance companies, 
pharmaceutical firms and feminist organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter are among her staunchest supporters, not surprising given her 
backing of abortion rights and greater funding for women's health. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wrote her a $2,500 check," said Peg Yorkin, the Los Angeles activist 
who chairs the Feminist Majority and who was encountered in a House anteroom as 
the congresswoman ran in to vote. "I think hers is a very key race." 
</P>
<P>
 Since her fateful budget ballot, Margolies-Mezvinsky has joked that "God 
protects people who vote at 218," the tiebreaking number in the 435-member 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular day in May, the fates certainly seem to be conspiring in 
her favor: A divisive Republican Party primary in her district has just been 
won by the man she defeated in 1992 -- Montgomery County Commissioner Jon D. 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Margolies-Mezvinsky insisted that she was "not taking anything for 
granted," political observers said she would have had a far tougher time 
against Ellen Harley, a moderate, pro-choice Republican, who came in second in 
the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 A perennial candidate for office, Fox is "not particularly dynamic," a 
Pennsylvania state official said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one comment that would be hard to make about Margolies-Mezvinsky. 
Indeed, she seems constitutionally unable to do fewer than three things at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster growing up in Philadelphia, she was a star athlete, head 
cheerleader and honor student who "never sat at her desk to do her homework," 
her mother, Mildred Margolies, said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, at age 28, she was so moved by a story she covered about Korean 
orphans that she became the first single woman in America to adopt a foreign 
child. Four years later, she adopted another girl, from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, she married former Iowa Rep. Edward Mezvinsky, who had four children 
from a previous marriage. The Mezvinskys had two sons together and are legal 
guardians for three Vietnamese boys, for a grand total of 11 kids -- five of 
whom still live at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolies-Mezvinsky, who commutes back to Philadelphia on weekends, 
acknowledged that the pace of life for herself and many other members of 
Congress is crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 She recounted that after the usual 18-hour day, she literally ran into a 
plate-glass door when she went back to a reception to retrieve her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolies-Mezvinsky downplayed the incident, but Nancy Chasen, her best friend 
of 20 years and host while in Washington, remembered it graphically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was standing there and watched her walk into that door. I've never seen so 
much blood in my life. There were buckets of it. But Margie in typical fashion 
said, 'I'll drive to the hospital.' 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a quality she gets from her (late) dad of always saying, 'It's no 
problem. I'm bleeding to death but don't let me bother you.' 
</P>

 "She has really remarkable energy," Chasen continued. "The key to her 
personality is that she doesn't get dragged down by irrelevant activities like 
whether the shirts are folded in the drawer. She often says, 'If it doesn't 
matter in 100 years, it doesn't matter.' If you apply that rule, you have a lot 
left to apply to other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Chasen said her friend had "really matured" in her job this year after 
climbing the typical freshman's "steep learning curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from her headline-grabbing budget vote, a Hill staffer said 
Margolies-Mezvinsky had not been "tremendously active on the floor" of the 
House. "She doesn't speak a lot. She tends not to be the first one out to 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's more show pony than workhorse," a former congressional staffer said. 
"But then I can't say there are 434 great congressmen and then there's 
Marjorie. She's probably in the top 50%." 
</P>
<P>
 Another staffer attributed some criticism to envy at Margolies-Mezvinsky's 
ability to attract publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been a TV persona and knows how to phrase things quickly and in a way 
people can understand," said Steven Goldstein, a lawyer on the House 
subcommittee on criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolies-Mezvinsky worked hard on the recently passed bill banning 
intimidation of women seeking access to abortion clinics and "gave some of the 
most impassioned speeches," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wild about her. A lot of people around Capitol Hill are pulling for her 
to win and would be heartbroken if she loses." 
</P>
<P>
 That group appeared to include a woman attendant at the House ladies' lounge, 
who said as the congresswoman walked in: "I'm so happy about your primary." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing still for a moment in the lounge, Margolies-Mezvinsky wryly pointed 
to a plaque on the wall noting that the room -- chosen for the women by the 
House male leadership -- was the one in which former President John Quincy 
Adams died. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died on this couch," she said as she sat briefly on the peach satin settee 
to be photographed. "At least it's been re-covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides so-called women's issues, Margolies-Mezvinsky said she was working to 
help produce a rational compromise on health care and has introduced bills to 
link cost-of-living increases for Social Security to one's means and to raise 
the retirement age to 70 by the year 2012. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the voters decide to end her congressional career just as she's getting 
the hang of it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have another life," she said. "I've never had problems figuring out what I 
was going to do. Win or lose, I've won. It's been an extraordinary experience." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the eggs, she took them home on the train to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the unflappable Margolies-Mezvinsky, "they arrived uncrushed," she said.

ORIGIN OF A COLLECTOR; IT STARTED WHEN HE WAS 10. FROM THEN ON, WARREN DAVID 
MOHR'S OBSESSION WITH ALL THINGS DARWIN GREW. THEN HE GAVE IT ALL AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He calls him Charlie. Sometimes just Chuck. Once, in Corsica, he called him 
Carlos -- as in, " Prego, senor . Would you have any books by Carlos Darwin?" 
</P>
<P>
 Had time been kinder, Warren David Mohr -- perhaps the greatest private Darwin 
collector of all time -- and Charles Robert Darwin, perhaps the greatest 
zoologist of all time, would have been contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call them 'The Odd Couple.' One of them is living and one of them is dead," 
says Mohr's wife, Betty. "Still, they are absolutely inseparable." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 After six decades of feverish browsing and careful buying, of crisscrossing 
continents to track down every Darwin work from "Origin of the Species" to "The 
Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms," Mohr has given it 
all away. 
</P>
<P>
 And with it, his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't think for a moment there haven't been tears," Mohr says with a pout. "I 
can't help it. I miss him. I miss my Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tear-soaked ceremony last month at the Huntington Library in San Marino, 
the 71-year-old collector dedicated to posterity about 1,600 Darwin books, 
caricatures, engravings and photographs. According to rare books curator Alan 
Jutzi, their value is inestimable, particularly to science historians. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are volumes signed by the author for special friends, privately 
printed books for family members, and one book bound with an imposing gold 
crest and dedicated to a member of the British royal family. Indeed, when it 
comes to Darwin collecting, Mohr's single greatest rival is a woman Mohr calls 
"Lizzie." And the Queen of England isn't about to let him buy her three Darwin 
manuscripts. He knows. He's tried. 
</P>
<P>
 If Darwin was, in the words of his biographers, "a man of enlarged curiosity," 
Mohr is a man of enlarged energy. That's not to say he is incurious. But how 
else does one explain a lifetime of global and often solitary sleuthing with 
just one goal -- understanding Darwin? 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie only wrote 16 books, you know. But that never stopped me," Mohr 
boasts. "Oh, how I loved to present my books at Customs and the Customs man 
would say, 'But, sir, you have bought 20 copies of the very same book!' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Of course, I have. Of course, I have,' I'd laugh. Aha! Little did they know 
that each of the books was different -- some quite subtly, others quite grandly 
because Darwin wrote and rewrote with each edition -- new forewords, new 
introductions, new opinions to show the terrible controversy that followed each 
new discovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Mohr -- who is, by most accounts, including his own, one of the 
happiest men on earth -- Darwin was among the most troubled. Apparently as a 
result of a bug bite on his historic voyage as naturalist for the HMS Beagle, 
Darwin suffered a debilitating stomachache for the last 30 years of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 When he wasn't at some spa or sanitarium seeking a cure or at home with his 
eight children, Darwin was dodging angry crowds of creationists and the entire 
Church of England, who wanted his head for crimes against society. His chief 
crime, of course, was to suggest that plants and animals had evolved from a few 
common ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Victorian era, Darwin's ideas -- and therefore, his books -- were 
intellectual dynamite. They shocked and distressed the people of his day, most 
of whom believed each species had been created by a separate divine act. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, even Darwin felt badly about his work. "It is like confessing to a 
murder," Darwin said when he was forced by colleagues to reveal what he knew: 
that humans were indeed descended from headless, hermaphrodite squids. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't squids or even monkeys that attracted Mohr to Darwin. It was 
Mohr's desire at the innocent age of 10 to produce "the best darn orchids in 
San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to get the books he needed in the United States, young Mohr started 
corresponding with a London dealer who offered him a book by another great 
lover of orchids. 
</P>
<P>
 The book turned out to be a rare first edition of "On the Origin of the 
Species," Darwin's seminal tome on how we all began. The dealer wanted $45 for 
it, far too much for a 10-year-old -- even this one, a fourth-generation San 
Franciscan whose mother was a library commissioner and philanthropist and whose 
father helped build the Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I appealed to my father for a loan," Mohr recalls. "He refused. So I went 
to my grandmother for an advance against my Christmas present. She gave me the 
money and since it was mid-year, by the time Christmas came round, she forgot." 
</P>
<P>
 The book, bound in the traditional green leather of Darwin's 19th-Century 
publisher and now worth tens of thousands of dollars, stands as "the pinnacle 
of the collection," Mohr says. 
</P>
<P>
 But one sunny spring morning, Mohr's book from childhood joined hundreds of 
others for one last voyage. A rose-colored van from the Pink Transfer Company 
pulled up in front of the Mohr home to carry his collection 400 miles south to 
its new quarters behind glass in an environmentally controlled chamber of the 
Huntington Library. A few of the works, including Darwin volumes illustrated 
with William Blake drawings, will go on display June 6 for library members. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the home Mohr bought years ago to accommodate his Darwin obsession, 
the collection-less collector solemnly guides visitors to a spacious sky-lit 
hall on the third floor. "Here, look here. You can still see the impressions in 
the rug where Charlie's bookcases used to stand. Couldn't bear to see them 
empty. Had to have them all torn out. Can't begin to describe the trauma of it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mohr's wife, whom he dramatically calls Lady Elizabeth, is recovering 
nicely, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trauma? What trauma? I've had 32 years looking at dusty books and cooling my 
heels outside shops in London, France, Corsica and who-knows-where, waiting for 
Warren to lug another stack of books back to the hotel, where he'll stay up all 
night reading and fussing over them," she says. "At least we can get on with 
our life now." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the couple will begin with a long-overdue vacation in France. Or maybe 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 With Betty off packing their bags, Mohr whispers: "Lady Elizabeth, she'll kill 
me, but I must tell you, once we get to France, I'm going off to Prague. 
Briefly, very, very briefly. I must, you see. There is an edition I really must 
have. It's in Russian, you understand. . . ."

LOCAL HERO: KIDS GET A KICK OUT OF HER LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1989, when soccer enthusiast Toni Grooms was trying to launch the Watts 
Friendship Sports League, the director of a recreation center in the area told 
her, "You can do what you want, but you'll never have soccer in my center." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Sports League opened later in the year, its first soccer game was 
played there. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the power of Grooms' persuasion. She had become involved with soccer 
years earlier when her children played. She volunteered as a coach and later 
served as deputy commissioner of the American Youth Soccer Organization region 
encompassing Granada Hills, where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 When she took a job as a youth and community services officer for the City 
Housing Authority Police Department about eight years ago, she brought her 
passion for soccer to South-Central Los Angeles. The game was the inaugural 
activity of the Watts Friendship Sports League, a program sponsored by several 
corporations and city and county organizations to provide a constructive outlet 
for youths and bring together the community's African American and Latino 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,500 children and teen-agers 4 to 18 participated in the league last 
year; in addition to sports, activities include motivational classes to 
encourage students to attend college and the Sister-to-Sister program, which 
promotes self-esteem for girls and young women. 
</P>
<P>
 It is soccer, though, that remains closest to Grooms' heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer sets up discipline," she says. "You can get kids to exercise and have 
camaraderie. And you don't have to be that good a player. You can be small, be 
slow, and still have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Her family shares Grooms' devotion. Several of her seven sons and five 
daughters serve as Sports League coaches and referees. Grooms is the league's 
deputy commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently she has enlisted the interest of Legacy Tour '94, the community 
outreach program of World Cup Soccer. At her suggestion, the Legacy Tour 
installed a $100,000 sports floor for soccer at the Nickerson Gardens housing 
project in Watts. The project's old field will be reseeded with grass and 
lights added. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms also is taking advantage of the high-profile tour to promote parental 
participation in soccer at school assemblies and by distributing flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents don't know they're supposed to be involved," Grooms says. 
"They think you have to be a brain surgeon to coach. You say, 'No, put the ball 
down. They'll kick it.' Kids want to have fun. You don't have to have a killer 
instinct to have fun. You'll grow with the program, as your child will." 
</P>

COMMITMENTS; SNAPPING BACK; WHEN PLAYING 'THE DOZENS,' NOTHING'S OFF LIMITS -- 
NOT EVEN YOUR MOTHER. ALL YOU NEED IS A QUICK WIT, A SHARP TONGUE AND A COOL 
HEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCES GRANDY TAYLOR, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It could be in the locker room, the park, the schoolyard, or on the front 
steps on a summer night. A small group of friends are gathered, and somebody 
starts it: 
</P>
<P>
 "Your mother is so generous, she would give you the hair off her back." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah? Your mother is so old, she was the waitress at the Last Supper." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your mother is so fat, she stepped on a dollar and got change." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the dozens, as this little game is called, could end with everyone 
laughing, or the loser stomping away in anger, vowing to have better comebacks 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
 Among African Americans, the dozens -- also known as snapping, capping, 
ranking or busting -- is a verbal tradition that dates back to slavery. It's a 
game of quick wit and sharp tongue, and must always be performed in front of an 
audience. While just about anything can be a topic, "your mother" is a 
standard, probably because mothers are so dear to most people. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, playing the dozens was confined to the community from which it 
came, but no more. Thanks to such television shows as "In Living Color" and 
"Def Comedy Jam," the dozens has gone mainstream, and its main purpose is 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes a book called "Snaps" (William Morrow, 1994), containing 450 "snaps" 
collected from a range of sources, from celebrities such as Montel Williams and 
Robert Townsend to those heard on the street. The book cover bears one from 
Quincy Jones: "If ugliness were bricks, your mother would be a housing 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 It's believed that the term the dozens comes from the practice of grouping 
together slaves who were infirm and selling them as a group at a bargain rate. 
Being sold in this way was the ultimate insult. As time went on, the game was 
used as a way to learn to control anger that could not be expressed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foreword, producer Jones writes that "Playing the dozens is a 
sociological condition transformed into an art form. . . . It's a style of 
humor that enables us to deal with the pain in our lives. It's a serious art 
tradition. It's part of our folklore." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, "the dozens is still about maintaining your cool," Jones writes. "It's 
a skill that requires verbal creativity, memory, humor and chops to deliver 
your lines. Playing the dozens requires a sophisticated mind. It's not like 
expressing yourself with a gun, which requires no wit, no strength, no power." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your family is so poor they go to Kentucky Fried Chicken to lick other 
people's fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your shoes are so old, when you step on gum, you know the flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the book are "2 Bros. & a White Guy," James Percelay, Stephan 
Dweck and Monteria Ivey. Percelay learned about the dozens firsthand when he 
found himself the only white person in the audience at a comedy club in New 
York. Ivey, the comedian onstage, mercilessly snapped on Percelay, a television 
executive out scouting for new talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never experienced this well-practiced ritual game of insults," Percelay 
recalls. Sitting next to him was Stephan Dweck, an entertainment lawyer and 
friend of Ivey's. "He said, 'Be cool, we do this all the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, the three got together and talked. They became friends and 
decided to write the book. They formed a production company, 2 Bros. & a White 
Guy Inc., based in New York. "We want to identify and bring these cultural 
traditions no one knows about to a broad audience," Percelay says. A new book, 
called "Double Snaps," will be out by Christmas. An HBO television special 
based on the first book will start taping in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snaps" was published in February, sold 70,000 copies in eight weeks and is 
now in its fifth printing. "We were prepared for a strong negative reaction 
from people who would take the jokes as being literally against someone's 
mother," Percelay said. "We were surprised that we got calls thanking us for 
keeping the book raw and honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Watts, associate professor of American studies at Hartford's Trinity 
College, says the game has strict rules that must be adhered to. "It's a 
ritual. Everybody has to understand the rules, including the people watching. 
Even the person who is the brunt of it will laugh," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 To be done right, the snap is often crude, but not objectively true. Timing, 
delivery and creativity are also important. And it's best to know who you're 
dealing with before you start snapping, he adds: "You have to know what the 
boundaries are. You can't snap on a gangster; he might step out of the role." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Miller, an English professor and director of American studies at Trinity, 
questioned whether the essence of such folk tradition can ever really be 
captured in book form. "What happens in oral tradition is that by the time it's 
discovered by the mainstream, it's moved on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says he recalls the dozens from his childhood in Providence. "I can 
still can get some pretty good ones off. Having been raised in that tradition 
prepared me for academic life."

COMMITMENTS; CAN THIS MARRIAGE BY SAVED?; 'WHAT ABOUT ME?' ASKS HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By the Editors of Ladies' Home Journal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Rick is like a little boy, constantly demanding my time and attention," sighs 
Brenda, 35, a third-grade teacher and mother of a 6-month-old. "He berates me 
for being distant and insincere. To be honest, I don't know what's gone wrong 
with a marriage that seemed so perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 When they first met, Brenda was enchanted by Rick's enthusiasm and eagerness 
to talk about how he felt or to discuss things that intrigued him. That kind of 
intimate sharing was something she had never experienced as the only child of 
self-absorbed, uncaring parents. In fact, Brenda remembers spending most 
evenings eating alone at the kitchen table with only a book for company. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, Brenda feels swamped by the demands of her new baby, her job and 
her husband. "I find myself with twice as much to do and half the time to do it 
in," Brenda says. "I'm running around like a chicken without a head, and he 
gets hurt and angry if I don't jump into his arms and smother him with kisses 
the minute he walks in." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick thinks nothing of interrupting her, she claims, as soon as she sits down 
to work on a lesson plan. Brenda believes that her husband is oblivious to her 
needs and is furious that he rarely takes any responsibility for even routine 
chores around the house. "How can he be so selfish?" she asks. "Aren't I 
entitled to time alone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rick, 36, doesn't think he's being selfish at all: "I'm delighted that Brenda 
is so devoted to her work and to our son. She's always there for Jeremy." But, 
he adds: "What about me?" 
</P>
<P>
 As far as he's concerned, his once-loving, sweet-tempered wife -- the woman 
who used to listen so attentively when he spoke -- is now cold and 
disconnected. "I've tried everything, from being affectionate to teasing her 
out of her moods, but she clams up and sulks silently." 
</P>
<P>
 He's tired of Brenda's excuses and insulted by her reactions. "Whenever I ask 
what's wrong, she tells me she's just busy or tired, or she sighs in this 
long-suffering kind of way that makes me feel stupid and unloved," he says. 
After a while, those explanations wear thin. If she has enough time to grade 
papers, why doesn't she have enough time for him? he wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brenda has so much to be happy about, I can't figure out for the life of me 
why she's always angry and uptight," Rick says. 
</P>
<P>
 These two haven't a clue why their marriage has derailed, and their constant 
arguing is tearing them both apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the very qualities that attract people to each other in the 
beginning become a problem as the relationship matures," says Cora Freedman, a 
family therapist in Scarsdale, N.Y. That's what's happening to Rick and Brenda. 
And while it's a common scenario, it can be avoided if couples remember that 
what they don't say to each other is often as powerful as what they do say. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Brenda is unable to admit to herself, let alone to Rick, that 
she is exhausted and simply doesn't have the mental or physical energy to 
devote so much time either to him or to herself. Instead, she expects Rick to 
miraculously know how she's feeling and pitch in with the baby or the grocery 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 From Rick's point of view, he's acting the same way he always did but getting 
a different reaction. He doesn't know the script has changed -- and Brenda 
hasn't bothered to tell him the new ending. No wonder he's upset. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time you and your partner seem to be at loggerheads, ask yourself if 
you are expecting too much of your partner. Take the time to think through what 
may be troubling you. Then, spell out for your partner what you need, suggest a 
possible solution and ask for his advice or help. 
</P>
<P>
 Be specific. Brenda might say: "Look, I know you want to talk, and I 
appreciate the way you want to stay close. But right now it would be really 
helpful if you could just give me half an hour to be by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you clearly state what you need, your spouse will understandably feel 
unappreciated -- and you will both continue to be frustrated.

WELLNESS COMMUNITY TAKES GILDA RADNER'S SPIRIT TO HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early in 1987, as Gilda Radner battled cancer, she and the Wellness Community 
found each other. She was to become a regular at the semiannual joke-fests that 
are part of the community's therapy for cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In her autobiography, "It's Always Something," Radner compared these support 
group gatherings in Santa Monica to "Saturday Night Live" in its early days -- 
"when we had our innocence and we believed in making comedy and making each 
other laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, five years after her death, "Gilda and her humor are very often 
topics of conversation around the Wellness Community," founder Harold Benjamin 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 So, on a recent Friday evening, the community came together to share jokes -- 
good, bad and inexcusable -- and to remember Radner. During her illness, she 
once told Benjamin, she spent some of her happiest times here. 
</P>
<P>
 She missed show business, he says, but here, "making other people laugh, she 
was home again. Gilda was always funny about cancer. She was funny about 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The joke-fests are a celebration of life, a stress-reducer and just plain fun. 
Says Benjamin: "Laughter a la Norman Cousins is not the answer to cancer, by 
any means. But pleasant emotions help enhance the immune system." 
</P>
<P>
 This night, emcee Allen Rabinowitz, a psychotherapist and husband of a 
community staffer, states the rules right off: "There will be no death jokes." 
And no dirty words. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, it's apparent that we have a roomful of rule-breakers -- to the dismay 
of Benjamin, who begs everyone to keep it clean. (Arts and Entertainment 
network is also there, filming a Radner bio.) 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Hearst's joke is about the doctor who tells a patient he has six months 
to live. How can he possibly pay off his bill in such a short time? the patient 
asks? "OK," says the doctor, "I'll give you another six months." 
</P>
<P>
 There are truly tasteless jokes and wince-evoking jokes. Carol Bennett shares 
the one about the horse that walks into a bar. "So why the long face?" asks the 
bartender. 
</P>
<P>
 There are prizes -- a rubber chicken, a whoopee cushion, a set of chattering 
teeth -- and lots of pizza and cake. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ethel Gullette, who has been cancer-free for seven years, there are 
poignant memories of Radner, with whom she shared so much: They were the same 
age (40) when both were found to have ovarian cancer the same month (October, 
1986). 
</P>
<P>
 Gullette recalls that Radner declined to compete for joke-fest prizes because 
she thought it unfair because she was a comedian: "The one time she did, she 
won." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Gullette said, "She was inspirational to everyone. She brightened the 
room."
