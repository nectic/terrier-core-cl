 BANKRUPTCY FALLOUT: As Orange County reels from the repercussions of 
bankruptcy, Ventura County officials are concerned that brokers across the 
country will cast doubtful eyes on the portfolios of other California 
municipalities -- including ours (B1). . . . With building projects still on 
the drawing board at stake, such a domino effect could cost the state untold 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG-SCREEN DEBUT: Witnessing Camarillo's grandiose new movie theater spring 
from a vacant field was like a bit of Hollywood magic close to home. . . . 
Workers toiled day and night to speed construction of Edwards Cinemas' 
12-screen Camarillo Movie Palace. A select crowd will get a first peek tonight 
at the building's interior, which boasts Italian marble floors and a soaring 
ceiling (B1). . . . Crews were still hustling to put on the final touches in 
time for this weekend's big opening. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR ART'S SAKE: The observant Ventura County gadabout has doubtless seen it 
around -- public art, adorning everything from shopping centers to business 
parks (Ventura County Life, Page 10). . . . Three local cities -- Oxnard, 
Thousand Oaks and Ventura -- have programs in place to encourage developers to 
incorporate art in their projects. In Ventura, the high-profile "Wavespout," an 
undulating copper creation, serves as a focal point for the renovated pier. . . 
. But the success of some of the county's public artwork seems to be up for 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 TO THE CORE: He's not a punk rocker in the vein of Johnny Rotten -- despite 
the name. . . . Dr. Rot has loftier intentions -- teaching students about the 
environment. In reality, Rot is an environmental educator who this week will 
cart worms to Santa Paula's Bedell School to teach students in a magnet program 
on environmental studies about the creatures' talent for converting trash to 
humus. . . . Like a rock star, Rot is in demand on the local school touring 
circuit. "We were lucky to get him," Bedell Principal Glenn Deines said.

SANTA IS A FOODIE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Why give a boring old sweater when the stores are full of delicious things to 
sate the appetite of even the finickiest person on your shopping list? A few of 
our favorite ideas follow. The numbered items are pictured on the cover. 1) 
BOTTLED PLEASURES 
</P>
<P>
 Francesco Ferretti's family was pressing olives long before he was born. Now 
Ferretti is following in the family tradition, harvesting the mature olives 
grown on his family's 500-acre farm in Cori, Italy, then cold-pressing the crop 
within five to six hours. Previously, the imported Pietra Pinta olive oil was 
only sold wholesale to top Italian restaurants (Valentino and Rex among them), 
but now you can pick up a three-quarter-liter bottle for less than $15 at 
Bristol Farms in South Pasadena, Rolling Hills Estates or Manhattan Beach, and 
at Broadway Deli in Santa Monica. It's a pretty impressive present. 2) GO FISH 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of forking out big bucks for so-so smoked salmon? At American Fish & 
Seafood (550 Ceres Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 612-0350), a wholesaler, processor 
and distributor of fish from all over the world, you get smoked farm-raised 
Norwegian salmon -- the kind that top restaurants use -- for $11.95 a pound. At 
most other places, this salmon, hot-smoked in the traditional European manner, 
sells for more than twice that. 3) YULE LOG 
</P>
<P>
 In France, it isn't Christmas without buche de Noe l , a rich concoction of 
sponge cake rolled into the shape of a log, frosted with chocolate butter cream 
and decorated with meringue mushrooms and marzipan elves. At Xiomara (69 N. 
Raymond, Pasadena, (818) 796-2520), chef Patrick Healy is baking the festive 
cakes for the holidays. Order Healy's chocolate-hazelnut creation with vanilla 
custard sauce in small ($24, serves 6) or large ($35, serves 10). 4) SWEETENED 
GREETINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Three cousins from Louisiana -- Norwood Clark, Ronald Washington and Darryl 
Banks -- run Uncle Darrow's Eatery (5301 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 
938-4293) where they've been dishing up jambalaya, catfish and file gumbo for 
the past six years. Their real specialty, however, is Cajun "pa-cawn" candy 
made from an old family recipe; it tastes like a cross between fudge and a 
praline. The candy comes in three sizes; a large packet of the candy costs $10 
and can be mail-ordered. The cousins also make excellent, buttery "karamel" 
popcorn ($1.50) and individual sweet "tater" pies ($1.50). 5) JAMMIN' 
</P>
<P>
 Marmalade lovers have three terrific reasons to celebrate this holiday season: 
lemon, orange and grapefruit. At Sunny Springs Ranch in Fontana, Phil and April 
Valvo and daughter Shannon make low-sugar marmalades and jams using natural 
pectin and the organic fruit grown on their five-acre ranch. The whole property 
is fed by two natural springs. "The more fruit I can put in," says April, "the 
better." The marmalades and jams are available in three sizes (four ounces, $3; 
eight ounces, $5; 16 ounces, $8) and are sold at local farmers markets 
(Torrance, Hollywood, Calabasas, Encino, Westchester) or by mail. For 
information, call (909) 822-5417. 6) SMALL PACKAGES 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas without tamales? Not in Mexico. And not in Culver City, either. 
That's where Belgian-trained Pascal Dropsy (by night the chef at St. Mark's in 
Venice) makes tamales with his wife, Shirley Coriz, an American Indian who has 
been making traditional tamales since she was a little girl growing up on the 
Santo Domingo Pueblo in New Mexico. Of course, these aren't ordinary tamales. 
With his chef's training and her family expertise, they've come up with some 
unique combinations -- and they've managed it without using lard. Green chile 
and smoked Gouda; chicken and mango-habanero; black tiger shrimp with pineapple 
and chipotle sauce; beef carnitas; and Belgian chocolate with raspberries and 
pecans are a few of the 16 choices. "I came up with the different fillings," 
says Dropsy, "but Shirley taught me the traditional method and how to tie 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Their Corn Maiden Co. tamales (12102 Summertime Lane, Culver City, (310) 
202-6180) run between $22 and $33 a dozen. They are available for take-out or 
by mail order. And with two days' notice, the tamales will be delivered to your 
door with steaming and microwave instructions. 7) BETTER THAN MISTLETOE 
</P>
<P>
 A wreath to whet the appetite. And it only takes a few minutes to whip up. 
Braids of locally grown garlic ($14 and $20) are available from Lori's Herbs at 
local farmers markets (Thousand Oaks, Santa Monica, Encino); the chiles and 
rosemary can be bought at any farmers market or nursery. Tie on a red bow and 
hang it in your kitchen for Christmas. When the holidays are over, use the 
rosemary branches to flavor your favorite dishes: Dried chiles arbol make great 
salsa; the garlic is a year's supply of goodness. 8) THE GIFT OF GAB 
</P>
<P>
 Cucina magazine was intended for the restaurant trade to promote Italian food 
and wine culture in America. But the glossy bimonthly color magazine has become 
so newsy and gossipy that it's worth subscribing to if you love Italian food. 
Try out chefs' recipes, listen to them gripe, and be up on their events. A 
one-year subscription is $18. Write Datatex Corp., 120 E. 41st St., New York, 
N.Y. 10164-2263. Or call (212) 338-0362. SAY GORGONZOLA 
</P>
<P>
 What could be more versatile than a hunk of creamy, blue-veined Gorgonzola? It 
makes a good sauce on pasta, works well in salad dressings, melts nicely in hot 
potato skins and is a fine topping for grilled steak. Best of all, it makes a 
lovely end to a meal, served with pears and walnuts. Some of the best ($6.25 
for a half pound) can be found at Say Cheese (2800 Hyperion Ave., Los Angeles, 
(213) 665-0545), an upscale food boutique crammed with imported cheeses, La 
Brea Bakery breads, coffee beans, flavored oils and vinegars, crackers and 
imported chocolates. MERRY MEAT 
</P>
<P>
 After Christmas Eve services in Germany, families often return home and drink 
tall flutes of Weissbier and feast on soft pretzels and Munchener Weisswurst -- 
fat, fluffy sausages that are simmered and then slathered with sweet 
whole-grain mustard. At Atlas Sausage Kitchen (10626 Burbank Blvd., North 
Hollywood, (818) 763-2692), sausage maker Michael Obermayer makes Munchener 
Weisswurst ($4.69 per pound) the old-fashioned way, using carefully 
hand-trimmed veal flavored with cream, parsley, mace and other spices. You'll 
also find other delicious hand-crafted sausages, cold cuts and smoked meat at 
this 50-year-old shop. Just don't ask the Santa look-alike wurst maker for 
apple sausage or other gourmet-types. "I'm in the meat business," huffs 
Obermayer, "not the produce business." GARDEN GROOMING 
</P>
<P>
 It was the contents of the walk-in refrigerator at Abiquiu, chef John Sedlar's 
Santa Monica restaurant, that inspired Sedlar and former hairdresser Philip 
Berkovitz to create the Philip B. line of hair and skin-care products available 
exclusively at Neiman Marcus nationwide. All the products contain high 
concentrations of food and plant extracts. The white truffle shampoo ($42.50 
for eight ounces) was developed in Sedlar's kitchen using an infusion of 
Italian white truffle oil, fresh lemon rind and fresh thyme. The carrot 
conditioning creme ($44.50 for eight ounces), which contains 25% carrot extract 
(most plant-based hair products contain up to 4%), really does make the hair 
smell like fresh-picked carrots. Carrots never cost so much, but hair may never 
have smelled so good. COOKIE CRUNCH 
</P>
<P>
 From the man who does great things with the lowly potato, now comes biscotti. 
You can pick up a small sack of these twice-baked cookies at Patinette (250 S. 
Grand Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 626-1178), Joachim Splichal's upscale snack bar 
at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Choose from chocolate, cinnamon and 
pistachio, and baklava. Six of the crunchy cookies are packed in a cellophane 
bag tied with a sprig of pine and a holiday ribbon. They're buttery, rich -- 
and only $3. STOCKING STUFFER 
</P>
<P>
 Garlic tastes great and is good for you too. On the other hand, peeling cloves 
by hand can be monotonous if you're cooking for a crowd. Now there is a tool to 
do the yucky part of the job: the E-Z-Rol garlic peeler, a simple, flexible 
tube, originally designed to aid the handicapped and made from an FDA-approved 
material that looks and feels like something between neoprene and a vintage 
rubber girdle. Insert a clove or two in the tube, press down firmly and roll it 
back and forth with the palm of your hand until you hear a crinkly sound. Best 
of all, the tool also peels roasted chestnuts, easing what may be among the 
most painful kitchen jobs during the holidays. The peeler costs about $6.25 and 
is available at Christopher Ranch (2208 Glendale Galleria, Glendale, (818) 
637-2813). MORNING JOLTS 
</P>
<P>
 See Dick roast coffee. See Jane blend tea. Dick and Jane Healy own the Coffee 
Roaster (13567 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 905-9719), a mecca for coffee 
and tea fanatics. For the beverage connoisseurs on your gift list, try a pound 
or two of espresso blend (half Sumatra Mandheling and half Ethiopian Harrar), 
or some of Jane's Welsh breakfast blend of smoky Keemun with long-leaf Assam. 
Espresso roast is $9 a pound; the Welsh breakfast blend, $14 a pound.

 Don't be surprised if you get a busy signal the next time you try ordering 
from your favorite mail-order source. More and more people now shop by phone. 
One in two American adults, or 97.7 million people, shopped at home by phone or 
mail last year, according to the Direct Marketing Association, a New York-based 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordering by telephone is everything you want it to be: convenient, time-saving 
(you can do comparison shopping without leaving your chair), and without the 
wear and tear on your nerves from jammed parking lots and long check-out lines. 
Besides, some gifts just can't be bought at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 While not all of the following come with fancy gift wrap, they make wonderful 
presents and can be delivered in time for Christmas -- if you order now.  
</P>
<P>
 * You may not be able to cook like a chef, but you can look like one, thanks 
to Chefwear ((800) 568-2433), a Chicago company run by two former L.A. pastry 
chefs, Rochelle Huppin-Flack (formerly of Granita) and Kathleen Magee (formerly 
of Eureka). Order the same 100% cotton unisex pants, jackets and toques that 
trendy chefs wear in some of the country's top restaurant kitchens. Chef pants, 
available in 19 designs, including the traditional black-and-white houndstooth, 
start at $33; classic white jackets (including embroidered name) cost $50 
apiece; toques and baseball-type hats cost $15. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Fortuna's Deli in Greenville, Rhode Island, ((800) 427-6879), owner Paul 
Stannard makes dense, flavorful sausages much the way some people make wine: by 
hand, in small batches, using only the very best ingredients. And like fine 
wine, he ages his product slowly, dry-curing it. Stannard's pepperoni, abruzze 
, caciatorini and capicola are all wonderful. But the smooth-textured 
soppressata , made from extra-lean pork and spices and then cured for months, 
is the deli's signature sausage. It comes in three degrees of spiciness and 
costs $12.95 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's the secret of the fabulous plump roasted peanuts from Nuts Devine 
((800) 334-0492), and why do they smell so incredibly good when you open the 
package? Simple. They're fresh. All peanuts from this Edenton, North Carolina, 
company are shipped within a week of being roasted. For $25.75, plus $2.95 
shipping and handling, you can get a 10-pound bushel basket of the goobers 
(salted or unsalted) delivered to any door in the country. Mail never smelled 
so good. 
</P>
<P>
 * A perfect cup of espresso is hazel brown with a reddish tinge, has a strong 
rich aroma and very thick crema. Anyone who makes espresso knows that, in order 
to achieve this, the grounds need to be tightly packed into the filter holder. 
The tamper, a knobbed gadget that resembles a chess piece, makes the job of 
compressing the beans a lot easier. For $25 you can own one invented by Mark 
Romano for Illy Espresso, a 60-year-old family-owned business based in Trieste, 
Italy, and the world's leading espresso producer. The perfectly weighted tamper 
is sleek, available in five colors and -- best of all -- comes with a book on 
espresso and a can of Illycaffe. Call (800) USA-ILLY. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anderson's Candy Shop in Richmond, Ill., ((815) 678-6000), run by the 
founder's grandsons, Lars and Leif Anderson, is famous for its chocolate butter 
creams. The brothers are so picky about their product, none of their candy is 
more than two weeks old. And they even make their own cream: They buy the milk 
from a local farm and separate it. The result is cream that contains as much as 
50% to 60% butterfat (the whipping cream in most supermarkets contains about 
30%). A pound of chocolates runs between $8 and $12, plus shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stollen has been the traditional Christmas bread of Germany since about 
1400. Rich in butter, almonds and rum-soaked fruit, the loaf is dusted with 
powdered sugar and shaped into an oval that symbolizes the manger in Bethlehem. 
For the real thing, try the loaf at Ye Olde Sweet Shoppe Bakery in 
Sheperdstown, W.Va., ((800) 922-5379). A 2 1/2-pound loaf costs $18.95, plus 
shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 * Schwartz Candies' ((800) 522-2462) chocolate-covered marshmallows are truly 
incredible. Each light and pillow-y square is doused in a special blend of dark 
chocolate and then packed in a distinctive red-and-white checkered chocolate 
box. Besides the original vanilla version, the New Hyde Park, N.Y., candy shop 
makes several other flavors to choose from, including chocolate, strawberry and 
maple. A one-pound, two-ounce box of all vanilla or assorted flavors costs 
$27.50, including shipping.  
</P>
<P>
 * Cole Porter was so crazy about the fudge from Arnold's Candies in his 
hometown of Peru, Ind., ((317) 473-5363), that he ordered 12 pounds a month 
until his death in 1964. The fudge is hand-mixed, hand-poured and made from 
real butter and cream. A pound of the rich, creamy concoction costs $5.60 plus 
shipping. You may want to order an extra box or two. As Porter put it, possibly 
about Arnold's fudge: "It's the tops." 
</P>
<P>
 * A good baking powder biscuit should double in height while it's in the oven. 
It should emerge light and tender and have a golden-brown crust. In the South, 
where biscuits are an important part of life, White Lily in Knoxville, Tenn., 
((615) 546-5511) has been the flour of choice for more than 100 years. It's the 
stuff of tender biscuits. The low-gluten flour is sold only in the South, but 
the company will ship five-pound bags of flour anywhere in the country. The 
cost is $4 per bag west of the Mississippi, postage paid.  
</P>
<P>
 * Cheesemakers Letty and Bob Kilmoyer ((508) 928-5110), have a herd of 65 
goats on their 20-acre farm in Hubbardston, Mass., and they inoculate the 
surface of their fresh goat cheese with blue mold. Westfield Farm's fresh blue 
Classic ($4.08 for seven ounces) is tangy with good blue flavor. Milder, with a 
soft texture almost like Brie, is the aged Hubbardston ($2.79 for five ounces). 
Shipping is extra.

 A non-reactive pan is one made from metal that will not react with acidic 
ingredients. Non-stick, stainless steel, lined or anodized aluminum, lined 
copper and enameled cast iron are the most common types. Avoid unlined

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: REVIEWING THE MARRIAGE OF ART AND GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The alliance between artist and bureaucrat has, historically, created some of 
the best and worst of civilization's offerings. The public art of ancient 
Greece includes temples and public buildings that serve as monumental 
sculptures. Romans, inspired and challenged by the Greeks, took the notion of 
an open-air amphitheater to a new level. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the national socialist movements in Germany and Italy this 
century repressed modern art and individual expression, forcing on artists a 
sterile and retrograde form of neoclassicism. 
</P>
<P>
 With the possible exception of some oeuvres of the Works Progress 
Administration in the 1930s, American public art has generally avoided both the 
highs and lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Here and now, in Ventura County, three cities have public arts programs that 
prove that the union of art and government or art and commerce can, at times, 
be better than a marriage of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great news about public art is that life is often made better by it," 
said staff writer Leonard Reed, who wrote this week's Centerpiece. "It's about 
beauty, about place, about seeing things a new way." 
</P>
<P>
 But now the bad news: Public art is just that -- it's public -- and, as such, 
it is also in-your-face art. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you happen to pass by it or must commute by it daily, you have no choice 
about seeing it or dealing with it. That's not fun if the piece is ugly or 
stupid or out of place or somehow violates your tastes," Reed said. "I've 
always been intrigued by public art for those two reasons. It's a social as 
well as aesthetic experience, and it represents some kind of civic yearning to 
reach beyond the daily grind." 
</P>
<P>
 In looking at some of the more timid, uninspired -- and, therefore, less 
successful -- examples of public art, it is easy to hear the sound of public 
outrage ringing in the heads of bureaucrats who ultimately decide to play it 
safe. What we don't hear much is a discussion of what will or won't stand the 
test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about all the fountains in Rome, all the sculpture inspired for 
placement within those fountains, all the relationships parsed, clipped and 
bonded in the spray of those fountains," Reed said. "The fountains are public 
art, and they have much to do with why Rome is Rome. But nobody thought of it 
as public art 200 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe they did. The classic orders were obeyed as well, and had been since 
antiquity. Public art, after all, serves a greater function than as flavor du 
jour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mural on Terminal Freezers in Oxnard is hip, inspired, about community as 
well as beauty," Reed said. "The faux water tower on the 101 at Oxnard's 
Factory Outlet Center is a ridiculous joke, a perversely Disneyesque 
estimation."

SIGHTS; EXHIBIT DISPLAYS PROCESS, PRODUCT; SHOW OF CORNELIUS BOTKE'S WORK, AND 
THE TOOLS HE USED TO CREATE IT, DOES JUSTICE TO ART AND HISTORY AT COUNTY 
MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the modest, but certainly notable ranks of Ventura County artists who have 
seized acclaim outside the region, the name Botke looms large. Cornelius and 
Jessie Botke, man and wife, decamped in Santa Paula in 1929 and built up 
artistic reputations over the next few decades that continue to thrive, 
posthumously. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch-born Botke had met Jessie Arms in Chicago and they married in 1915. 
Together, they worked on murals, including local examples at mortuaries in 
Santa Paula and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart, they veered in separate directions. Jessie's extravagant and popular 
aviary paintings, bedecked in gold leaf and created from an iridescent palette, 
teem with sensuality and flourish. In contrast, Cornelius' work is of a more 
austere, muted sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Etching was Cornelius' primary medium. His fastidious craftsmanship and 
attention to detail, along with a romantic appreciation of landscape, are 
invitingly explored in "The Etchings of Cornelius Botke," at the Ventura County 
Museum of History and Art through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Curated by the museum's Tim Schiffer, the show celebrates product and process, 
including preliminary drawings, photographs and a display of tools of the 
etching trade. A bold presentation consisting of 86 works -- the first time all 
these pieces have been gathered in one public showing -- this exhibition 
dignifies the museum's often fragile, dual mandate of celebrating both history 
and art. 
</P>
<P>
 While the images here represent Botke's various travels in Europe as well as 
in Carmel and other corners of Northern California, a sizable number of pieces 
hit home. Home for the Botkes was the rural enclave of Wheeler Canyon in Santa 
Paula. There, they lived, worked and raised a family on ranch land that was 
also home to fruit trees, poultry and peacocks -- in-house models for Jessie's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the gallery, we see Cornelius, bespectacled and intent at his etching 
press, in a '30s-era photograph taken by another Ventura County-connected 
luminary, Horace Bristol. Bristol, who spent early years in Ventura County and 
now lives in Ojai, became well-known for his evocative Depression-era 
photojournalism, including a project on migrant farm workers, which reportedly 
inspired John Steinbeck to write "Grapes of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
 Botke, too, shows an agrarian instinct and a WPA-like pictorial sensibility in 
many of these works. In "Haybalers," theme and muscle are provided by the 
artist's son William, whose pitchfork is at the vortex of visual energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plow Team," dating from 1936, is a heroic, yeoman image of Clarence Marshall 
tilling the soil, with bowing lines reminiscent of Thomas Hart Benton's prewar 
romanticism. The sinewy heave of human labor and the rhythms of the earth are 
in accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes of local note abound here. "Ferndale Ranch" depicts the sprawling plot 
of land that is now Thomas Aquinas College, outside of Santa Paula. An image of 
the Santa Paula depot celebrates it as a landmark of relative antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artist's Barn" commemorates the influential Fillmore gallery and gathering 
place for the resident art community. But, via Botke's eye, the point of focus 
is not so much the gallery itself, but the pepper tree outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees were an obvious subject of interest for Botke, almost to the point of 
obsession. No doubt, for an artist of Botke's exacting eye and hand, trees 
presented a challenge of depicting both formal sweep and detailed leafage. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Grandma's Backyard," for instance, the yard in question is viewed from a 
bird's-eye, treetop perspective. His Carmel images often played up the gnarled, 
weeping forms of Monterey pines. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seen here are images of old mining towns, in which the isolated clutches 
of buildings against bleak surrounding terrain make for ripe studies in 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 Botke, who died in 1954, left a strong body of work that rewards close-up 
attention. If detached from the conceptual flow and restless fashion of 
modernism, his art now basks in a wistful glow and has the appeal of a 
well-crafted medium. ART WALKABOUT 
</P>
<P>
 Although last Friday's Ventura Artwalk didn't draw the kindly hordes of last 
summer's event, it was nonetheless another successful celebration of the 
diversity to be found in the artistic outlets downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the Botke show at the museum, potter's guild wares at the Buenaventura 
Gallery and works by patients at the Turning Point Foundation (that 
organization's first involvement in an Artwalk), art took on many faces and 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding forth dauntlessly on the literal and figurative fringes is the 
marginal-but-mighty Art City II, now celebrating its tenth anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 The current show of mostly 3-D works in its gallery ranges from Dan Cayman's 
rusty metal menagerie of apocryphal creatures to Art City "mayor" Paul 
Lindhard's sleeker marble inventions, and M.B. Hanrahan's ironic assemblage, 
"Trophies" -- re: the art object as trophy. Alexandra Morosco's "Vision Within 
the Yucca" is a crucifixion of an intriguingly unorthodox sort, evoking 
Christ's body with shards of alabaster on a wooden cross and a bronze crown of 
thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Random Artwalk notes: K.R. Martindale's had the best spread of food and drink, 
not to mention some eye-catching works by Michael Kelly. . . . Best 
Romanticized Vision of Domesticity award goes to watercolorist Jennie Snyder 
for her elliptically cropped home scenes, fittingly hung in Danica House. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaf and blind sculptor Chris Cook demonstrated his work in the window of the 
Ventura Bookstore, earning the best window display award at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Another standout among the window display entries was Paul Benavidez's 
ambitious installation at the Performance Studio. "The Changing Paradigm" is a 
huge blue egg in a distorted stage-like setting, exerting a surreal, mutating 
presence. This is the kind of work that gives public art a good name. Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: DEEJAYS, MARINES LOOKING FOR A FEW -- NO, A LOT OF -- GOOD 
TOYS; SOME K-HAY LISTENERS RESPOND TO TAYLOR'S INVITATION TO DROP IN AT THE 
STATION BY BRINGING DONATIONS.

 What do hair curlers, Teddy Bears and Marines have in common? Just keep 
readin' to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 The K-HAY country radio early-bird audience is familiar with the perpetual 
Burns-and-Allen shtick between on-air personality Ray Taylor and his sidekick, 
Charlye Parker. On weekdays Taylor delights listeners with remarks about 
Parker's personal life, erratic arrival times and her latest penchant -- 
wearing hair curlers to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But until last week he never invited listeners to drop by the station to 
experience the sight for themselves. It's radio, don't forget, so they can show 
up in in their PJ's and we wouldn't know the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But all bets are off since the deejays kicked off K-HAY's sixth annual Toys 
for Tots drive last week. And Heckle and Jeckle have added a new, interactive 
twist to the popular morning drive time format. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the generosity of our country listening audience, we are the only 
people in the U.S. that exceeded the need-for-toys figure set for the Ventura 
County community," said Taylor, who spearheads the annual campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And they don't plan to fall short this year. So don't be surprised if you hear 
your name on the radio thanks to a well-intentioned brother-in-law's challenge 
pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call in a pledge and challenge others in their line of work to match 
or beat it," said Parker. "For example, (local country musician) Darlene 
O'Connell made a pledge and challenged all entertainers to meet it. And Troy 
Robinson of Caught Red Handed called in and exceeded it." 
</P>
<P>
 But back to Parker's hair curlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Taylor's 5 a.m. inducement to visit, listeners have been coming by with 
toy or cash donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a family that brings in a new boy's and a new girl's bike every 
year," said Parker. "And in another household, the kids make their wish lists. 
And then each child picks one thing from the list to donate to instead of 
getting it for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The toys must be new and unwrapped so they can be properly directed to a 
child. And, of course, the jocks welcome cash, checks or money orders for their 
annual toy shopping spree. So get your toys or cash to K-HAY by 5 p.m. on Dec. 
23 to allow time to buy and transport the toys. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the Marines come in. But they can use volunteers to help at the 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't wait 'til the last minute if you'd like to participate. Just come by the 
station between noon and 3 p.m. on Dec. 17 for the annual K-HAY toy drive 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers will entertain with great country tunes. 
While the Marines load the trucks, the kids can climb all over the Humvees that 
will be on display. All the K-HAY jocks will be there, including the new guy, 
Dave Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 And who knows? While fiddler Tom Ricardo plays his hot version of "Devil Went 
Down to Georgia," maybe someone will teach Bradley the ten-step. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Toys for Tots Collection Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHO: Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers, K-HAY deejays and the U.S. 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: noon to 3 p.m., Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: K-HAY radio station parking lot, 3897 Market St., Ventura.

 A curious dichotomy is occurring within the American psyche. While voters 
became cranky and bitter about social welfare programs and embraced negative 
political campaigns, they also were scooping up books about angels, soul 
awareness, after-death "I-saw-a-heavenly-light" experiences and spiritual 
aphorisms. According to local booksellers, these titles are "flying out the 
door," and customers flock to meet authors who have attained celebrity status. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara resident Marianne Williamson is one of those authors. She will 
sign her new book "Illuminata," subtitled "Thoughts, Prayers, Rites of 
Passage," at 3 p.m. Sunday at the Ventura Bookstore, 522 E. Main St. Her first 
book, "A Return to Love," was on the bestseller list for 35 weeks in 1992 and 
with over 2 million copies in print was the fifth best-selling book in America 
that year. Her second title, "A Woman's Worth," remained on bestseller lists 
for five months this year. Williamson has been lecturing professionally on 
spirituality and metaphysics since 1983.

and features 50 experts who reveal their secrets. Contributors include Arnold 
Schwarzenegger on building biceps, Sergio Aragones on cartooning and a National 
Geographic photographer on how to take great vacation pictures.

STRUCTURES; FILLMORE THEATER RESTORATION BUILT ON COMMUNITY SUPPORT; THE TOWNE, 
OPENED FOR VAUDEVILLE IN 1915, WAS INCAPACITATED BY THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE. PLANS 
ARE TO REOPEN IT FOR MOVIES BY AUGUST.

<P>
 "The Best Town Ever" reads the marquee of the Towne Theater, smack dab in the 
middle of downtown Fillmore. This is no idle boast, but a sign of 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look behind the plywood barricades and chain-link fence separating 
citizens from the theater reveals an edifice shaken from its moorings. The 
marquee itself, once free-standing and held fast by cables connected to the 
facade, is now propped up on makeshift pillars. One corner of the exterior has 
crumbled away, exposing framing and a rusty I-beam. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of hope adorns the barrier outside the theater, reading "SAVE THE 
TOWNE THEATER! We need your help. Please donate. Call: 524-3701." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the problem, you'll recall, was the devastating Northridge 
earthquake last Jan. 17. Much of Fillmore's historic Central Avenue area, with 
buildings dating to the early part of the century, was badly damaged by the 
quake. The dreaded red tags, declaring a building unsafe for occupancy, lined 
the trail of deconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unfolding saga of the Towne Theater is one of the most heartening 
emblems of a will to survive here. Across the street, a large vacant lot looks 
like a gaping hole in the downtown's once-impressive fabric, much like the 
vacant lots still speckling downtown Santa Cruz subsequent to its 1989 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for a time, it looked as though the theater property, too, would wind up 
a patch of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, the theater's previous owner, Dale Larson, decided he 
couldn't afford to repair the damaged structure and planned to demolish it. But 
the city came to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Fillmore's Redevelopment Agency used funds to acquire the 
property and applied for state grant funds to save the building. A $450,000 
grant from the State Historic Restoration Office assured continuation of the 
current reconstruction project. 
</P>
<P>
 As City Manager Roy Payne explained, "There were some other buildings that 
were demolished as a result of earthquake damage, but they were not considered 
community structures and didn't have the same kind of emotional appeal as the 
theater did. Beyond that, we have a very limited amount of resources, so we had 
to prioritize what we would try to save." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the theater has been at the heart of this small town, literally 
and figuratively, for much of its official existence. In an era of strip malls, 
franchises and multiplexes, Fillmore's downtown area and its central theater, 
in particular, have remained symbols of an earlier time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, Small Town USA is not around much anymore, especially within 
driving distance of Los Angeles," said Fillmore's Fire Chief Pat Askren. Askren 
led a hard-hat tour through the old theater, which still looks as though a 
storm recently hit it. 
</P>
<P>
 An eerie stillness and confusion hangs over the darkened facility. Debris on 
the lobby floor includes stray pieces of film stock. A very stale batch of 
popcorn still sits in the popper, made the night before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 We went downstairs below the stage, where small dressing rooms, long unused, 
once housed vaudeville performers. 
</P>
<P>
 A small-town movie house can play a sentimental role in the life of its 
citizens. Askren, who grew up in Fillmore, waxed nostalgic as we rummaged 
through old theater-chair parts and arc lights stored below. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to come here as a kid in the '50s. Then, it was a quarter to get in, 
and you saw two movies and a cartoon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, a contractor is going through a process of stabilizing and 
weather-protecting the building, and an architect is doing historical research 
to determine in which stylistic direction to proceed. According to Payne, 
"That's the first step, and then they'll come up with a retrofit and 
restoration plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the state grant, Payne said, "we think will get the building retrofitted 
and safe for occupancy again. But of all the improvements, getting it back in 
operation as a movie theater is the objective that the committee has." 
</P>
<P>
 That committee is the local citizen group called "Save the Towne Theater," 
which is planning fund-raising projects. Part of the plan involves appealing to 
Hollywood, which has often capitalized on Fillmore's charms as a location. 
There will be an auction early next year of movie memorabilia autographed by 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne hopes the theater will be open and screening movies by August. Beyond 
that, there are plans to use the theater for other artistic and community uses. 
Local theater productions, concerts and community meetings could be 
accommodated here. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it initially opened in 1915, it was a vaudeville theater," Payne 
commented. "There is a stage in there; it's been used for many years simply as 
a movie house. Now that it's in public ownership, we have plans to make it more 
of a community-use facility rather than just a movie house." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a slow recovery, but Fillmore is very much on the mend. Bricks 
from demolished buildings have been saved and offered free to those involved in 
restorations. Zoning ordinances will require new buildings to adapt to 
established parameters of vintage architectural style. 
</P>
<P>
 There, at last, lies a positive side effect of January's disaster. An act of 
God changed the face of Fillmore, but now acts of locals are engaged in 
rebuilding and reshaping their town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is bound and determined to come back," Askren said. Nowhere is that 
spirit more evident than at the Towne.

CENTERPIECE: WE KNOW WHAT WE LIKE; IN VENTURA, THOUSAND OAKS AND OXNARD, A 
GROWING USE OF PUBLIC ART BRINGS INTO FOCUS THE WAY EACH COMMUNITY SEES ITSELF.

<P>
 Anyone who has walked the full length of the Ventura Pier has bumped into it: 
the giant copper tube running up from the decking and twisting around like a 
pretzel, shooting sprays of water sometimes 10 feet straight up into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an industrial turbine, which it seems to evoke. Neither is it a 
length of exhaust pipe from a grand old ship, even though it could have been 
pulled straight from the deck of a 50-year-old steamer. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's art. Conceptual art. Site-specific art. And whether you like it or 
not, it's public art. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers spent $80,000 on this piece, titled "Wavespout," to cap off a 
massive restoration of the pier. It was designed by San Francisco artist Ned 
Kahn to "blue-sky" specifications set by the city of Ventura: Simply create 
something that would engage passersby in the maritime environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The water bursts are in sync with ocean waves below. The copper medium is of a 
maritime age that put Ventura on the map. The thing itself is an enticement to 
people to make use of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wavespout" is the premier artwork in a young program to create public art in 
Ventura. Its daring defines the city's view of what constitutes public art. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura is but one of three cities in Ventura County to recently join a 
national trend toward fostering public art, which began in America's urban 
centers in the 1970s with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. Yet 
the city is singular in its approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks and Oxnard have programs in place, but their approaches to 
creating public art are different, from each other's as well as Ventura's. 
</P>
<P>
 Art seems to do that. It divides opinion, brings into focus the way a 
community sees itself and calls into question why art is needed in the first 
place. In Ventura, Thousand Oaks and Oxnard, the artwork and the method of 
creating it reveal the distinctly different communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Thousand Oaks. Anyone who has visited the Goebel Senior Center there has 
bumped into the "people," seated on the bench to the left of the front door. An 
elderly man reads to a young girl while a teen-age boy, baseball cap in place, 
beams happily at them. The people don't move, however. They're cast in bronze, 
right down to wrinkles on the nose. 
</P>
<P>
 The replication of life and relationship is so convincing as to make this a 
3-D Norman Rockwell, an intergenerational feel-good installation if there ever 
was one. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's how Thousand Oaks wanted it. No provocations. No scratching of 
heads. Nobody thinking, we spent how much on this? (Taxpayers shelled out 
$40,000). Without the abstracted challenges of "Wavespout," this piece, by 
Colorado artist Ann LaRose, seems to please everyone instantly. Then again, it 
might be forgotten much faster than "Wavespout." It depends on how you like 
your art. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy for Thousand Oaks to get it so "right." The artist submissions 
for the piece in the first round were entirely abstract -- a phenomenon that 
sent an apoplectic City Council back to chambers to start over by sending out 
more conservative specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the second round, which brought in realistic and figurative 
sculptures, small-scale models by finalists were placed on display at the 
Thousand Oaks Public Library for a popular vote. You offend the fewest people 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, finally, Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has entered the Oxnard Town Center off Ventura Boulevard near the 
Ventura Freeway has bumped into "Flight of Fish." It's a field of flying fish 
made from metal cutouts and mounted on poles rising above a shallow water pool. 
The fish are coated with reflective "scales" and as they spin in the wind they 
change color wildly and take on depth, as if moving in a school. 
</P>
<P>
 Also consider that Oxnard, which leads Ventura County hands-down in the 
quantity of public art, didn't charge taxpayers one cent for this highly 
successful installation by artist Sally Weber. Instead it got the developer of 
Oxnard Town Center to pay the estimated $30,000 cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's view is that government is stretched too thin already to be paying 
for art, nice as it is. So it has a resolution in place urging private 
developers of projects exceeding 100,000 square feet to contribute 1% of costs 
to the placement of suitable public art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suitable" means that a committee appointed by the council must review and 
approve any art offered for placement -- a developer can't just go do anything 
because he or she is spending money on it. 
</P>
<P>
 This came into play recently along 3rd Street in La Colonia. There, a major 
industrial taxpayer, Terminal Freezers, sought to meet its art obligation by 
painting a wall outside its new warehouse with abstract depictions of freezer 
compressors. Sanely, the city said no. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the proddings of cultural arts director Andrew Voth, Terminal 
commissioned Philadelphia artist Frank Hyder to conceive and install a symbolic 
and storytelling mural. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural, mounted in six 4-by-8-foot painted tile panels, is a lush narrative 
view of the ethnicities and natural resources of this historically agrarian 
community. It is easily among the finest and most compelling pieces of public 
art in Ventura County, but has hardly been seen. Whether it is entirely 
successful in its placement is another story (see below). INDIVIDUAL TASTES 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of public art has always confounded cultures. Some medieval Romans 
thought fountains got in the way of city commerce; others thought Christian 
frescoes were intrusive, even fascistic. 
</P>
<P>
 New Yorkers still reel when the subject turns to Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc," 
a wall of rusted steel that, upon installation in the 1980s, bifurcated the 
courtyard behind a downtown Manhattan federal building and had to be removed in 
the face of protest. It seems the arc looked great from the 15th floor but 
otherwise blocked office workers from getting to their favored lunch and 
coffee-break perches. Aesthetics has always taken a back seat to hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 And only this fall, Culver City was in heated debate about whether its 
ordinance requiring developers to pay a percentage for public art could be 
altered to allow the architectural design of the building to satisfy public art 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 In fancier projects, this would make the building itself into the artwork -- 
raising the question of whether architecture can actually be art. 
</P>
<P>
 Things in Ventura County, by contrast, have been far less fractious, though 
some did challenge the propriety of paying art subsidy funds to architect 
Antoine Predock. (Thousand Oaks allowed its 1%-for-art on the new Civic Arts 
Plaza to go to Predock for a building that features a pictograph wall.) For the 
most part, city programs creating art have been cautious, slow to evolve and 
true to local turf. If the city of Ventura is at times a maverick and bold in 
its approach, Thousand Oaks is unwaveringly pragmatic and Oxnard 
unapologetically opportunistic. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that no matter the method, art -- along with spiritual 
matters, the thing that dignifies life -- is being created for a public 
burdened by the grind of modern life. Individual tastes are just that, but what 
follows is a city-by-city review of major pieces of public art under way and in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley declines to require developers or the city to produce public art. 
Camarillo, too, is without a program, but a planner there makes clear that the 
city is so highly regulated in its land-use and architectural stylings that 
officials prefer that any money earmarked for art go into quality buildings and 
extensive landscaping. OXNARD 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is jammed with art that developers have installed. That's good because 
it dresses up and brings human scale to some large properties, both commercial 
and industrial. But that winsome quality is sometimes lost in the 
industrial-park setting, since people have no reason to visit unless they work 
there. That is a limiting factor inherent in privately funded public art. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the work is successful. Most baffling of all is a series of 
light-refracting columns titled "Connections," by Robert Behrens, in Told 
Corp.'s Channel Islands Business Center. These tall black poles along Channel 
Islands Boulevard lose what coherence and relevance they might have had from 
the competing nearby telephone poles and recent construction of buildings 
around them. They simply stick up from the ground, begging the question: What 
on earth are these things? 
</P>
<P>
 And some works by famous artists are, if you will, from their Grade B 
collections. Hal Pastorius' geometric sculpture "Cube Root," situated within 
the Sares/Regis Business Center off Rice Avenue at Gonzales Road, plainly lacks 
the play of dimension and engagement of his other work, and fails to speak to 
the building it fronts. Simply plopped in place, it can only be called "plop 
art." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Oxnard's public art, however, is rich, vivid and engaging. Frank 
Hyder's mural outside Terminal Freezers Inc. on 3rd Street in La Colonia is 
truly first-rate: Painted and fired ceramic tile panels form a "canvas" that 
features startling fish, boats and human hands of varying hues. The colors are 
luminous, the strokes bold and raw and in places impressionistic. 
</P>
<P>
 The indigenous narrative content is reverential without becoming Hallmark-card 
sentimental. Sadly, it's tough to take stock of this beauty while doing 40 
m.p.h. on busy 3rd Street, and the only people on foot in these parts are 
schoolchildren heading home (not one looked up on a recent weekday.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Weber's holographic "Flight of Fish" at the Oxnard Town Center, 1000 
Town Center Drive, is at first glance a shameless, decorative crowd pleaser. 
But its ability to manipulate space -- get the viewer to feel as if he is 
snorkeling -- is testimony to its transformative power. (If a few fish are 
missing, it's because they're becoming popular among nighttime vandals.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rafe Affleck's fountain sculpture at the entrance of Oxnard Financial Plaza at 
Vineyard Avenue and Oxnard Boulevard is a winner: Simple bold curls of 
stainless steel continue their shape in flowing water, all on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Silverman's "Sails," a brushed aluminum sculpture at Vineyard Plaza 
Shopping Center at Vineyard Avenue and Oxnard Boulevard, might be considered 
nautical kitsch by some but is instead a smartly done thematic sailboat 
sculpture -- if you can see it through all the cars in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 A kinetic aluminum sculpture "Flight," by Lin Emery at the Chevron building in 
Sares/Regis Business Center, is as bracing as it is engaging, offering one 
instance in which an industrial park setting seems just right. 
</P>
<P>
 Art City sculptor Paul Lindhard is busy with Oxnard commissions, striking 
among them "Venus of Oxnard," a travertine marble sculpture at the McGrath 
Industrial Park near Gonzales Road and Rose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent commercial developments in Oxnard show a new realism and accessibility 
in the public art that gets placed. This owes in part to the developers but 
even more to the panel that chooses the work. The Rose shopping center on Rose 
Avenue near the Ventura Freeway is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the developer wanted to install a series of 30-foot-tall steel 
cutouts along the main entrance corridor. It was plain to Oxnard officials that 
such an approach was conceived as a way to get the most bang for the art buck; 
cutouts are easy to do, especially if you have the steel in a storage yard. 
Efficiencies are fine, but there seemed no particular point of reference in the 
work, no level of engagement that was of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 So Andrew Voth and others were dispatched to prod. The result is probably the 
most popular and most-seen artwork in Oxnard: Mario Nardini's "Ocean 
Serendipity," a group of bronze leaping dolphins at the center's entrance, 
coupled with three life-size human sculptures by Gary Alsum near store 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 These human sculptures -- a boy on stilts, children leapfrogging one another 
and children in a running race -- are modern culture's most common images, yet 
never fail to attract a disbelieving and affectionate crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The one shopping center that is an unqualified artistic flop is the new Oxnard 
Factory Outlet Center, at the Ventura Freeway between Rose and Rice avenues. 
Oxnard had competed with Camarillo for the stores, and whichever city could 
accommodate the developers fastest landed the big fish, as it were. Oxnard won, 
and in its zeal for victory made its art requirements so relaxed as to be 
virtually waived -- that is, unless you consider a faux water tower and faux 
windmill to be somehow related to art. Aesthetics not only bow to hunger but to 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, art seeks a broadened base here. An ordinance is being drafted for the 
just-elected City Council to consider in the new year. It would require that 
public building projects -- not just private developers -- budget 1% of their 
expenditures for public art. THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what Thousand Oaks does -- require 1% of public project 
expenditures be set aside for art. Private sector executives in this 
master-planned city made it clear at a mayor's business round-table earlier 
this year they wanted no resolutions or ordinances that required private 
developers to commission and site public art. This stems in part from a 
previous legal challenge here to any such requirement and also a difficult 
economy in a highly regulated city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the city's noted businesses and institutions -- GTE, Exxon and Cal 
Lutheran University -- feature prominent displays of art and do so without 
prompting by the city. But public art in this town is really that which is 
created by the city for city buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 It is slow going. The first piece commissioned under the 1% rule -- Ann 
LaRose's lifelike bronze figures in front of the Goebel Senior Center on Janss 
Road near the Moorpark Freeway -- took two years in the selection, 
commissioning and placement. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Williams, who coordinates the art-in-public places projects for Thousand 
Oaks, says: "It was universally felt that we needed a first piece that 
everybody could learn to love. We never hear anything negative about it. 
Because this one is so successful, we may branch out more. And we won't have 
that many more chances, because we're not going to build so many more 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 And the projects that will come up -- and with them the artwork that dignifies 
them -- will be ever smaller. Next on the docket is a $10,000 commission for 
the city's new maintenance facility off Rancho Conejo. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRose's bronze people on the bench are worth seeing as part of an American 
art movement in the last 15 years that seeks to engage at a neo-realistic, 
theatrical level. The pieces play on perception (the figures are hauntingly 
real) and a sense of dramatic encounter (although still, the figures relate to 
one another). 
</P>
<P>
 Their trick is that they are utterly familiar yet alien. It is a pleasing art, 
certainly, but slim on challenge; its Norman Rockwellism confirms the way we 
hope for things to be, rather than jiggle our belief and sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 More diverting is a nearby mural, in the public library's children's section. 
While not part of the city's program, this 1987 creation by Bradley W. Schenk 
certainly is a dominant piece of public art for Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Large (nearly 14 feet high at one point and over 20 feet long) and powerful 
(its images are beautifully wrought and powerfully arranged in juxtaposition), 
it is narrative and delightfully propagandist in that it promotes reading. 
Miriam from I. B. Singer's "The Golem" sits near Water Rat, Toad, Mole and 
Badger from Kenneth Grahame's "The Wind in the Willows" -- and they join a 
surreal cast of perhaps a dozen more. It's an adult fantasia as well as a kid's 
-- a terrifically engaging piece. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Thousand Oaks sculpture and mural do best of all, however, is bear 
up, with fearful symmetry, to coordinator Williams' explanation of why art is 
necessary in the first place: "It states who we are and where we're coming 
from." VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner did Ventura get Ned Kahn's "Wavespout" installed at the end of its 
refurbished pier than it went off commissioning yet another noted artist to 
again engage people about sense of place. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the city, which charges itself a hefty 2% on public projects and 
requires nothing of private developers, is focusing on oceanfront/downtown 
redevelopment. An open plaza at the base of California street between the 
Holiday Inn and a city parking garage is being torn up and redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles sculptor Mark Lere won the $15,000-plus job of consulting with the 
project architect and designing a suitable artwork for placement at the base of 
the plaza overlooking the sea. But Lere found that mandate inappropriate, 
deciding that sight lines to the sea needed to be unimpeded and fearing a "plop 
art" result. Ventura's reflex to keep all possibilities open gave Lere room to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: He is designing back-lit steel panels that will be built into the 
walkways of the plaza and feature word blocks within giant symbols of the 
senses -- an ear, eye, nose. The idea, he says, is to involve people with 
written and visual messages to have them think of the sea and the city through 
the senses that are enlivened by that specific beachside site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public art is not designing a necklace for a done project," he says. "It has 
to be connected. In this case, you'll smell the ocean and see City Hall, but in 
doing so it must be fun. You've gotta have a catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia Tower, Ventura's cultural arts director, is even more plain on the 
point. She cites the sameness of America's cities that, in a great wave of 
compulsion in the 1970s and early 1980s, purchased Alexander Calder mobiles and 
Henry Moore sculptures for their public art. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not us," she says with a broad smile. "We seek something unique, 
something that provides an interpretation of the actual space and place you're 
in. 'Wavespout' does that, though some have complained. Mark (Lere) will do 
that on California Street. Real art is thought-provoking." 
</P>
<P>
 While the California Street plaza takes shape, consider the one piece of 
public art in Ventura that predates all city efforts at nurturing culture -- 
and the one that, ironically, may meet the goals of public art as well or 
better than anything yet displayed in these parts: the wraparound mural at the 
U.S. Post Office on Santa Clara Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A classic of the Works Progress Administration style, this soft-hued depiction 
of rural agrarian, coastal living is at once naif in its two-dimensional, 
primitive execution and profoundly complete in its emotional range. Few works 
of public art can be so accessible and resonant at the same time, so warmly 
evocative yet thought-provoking. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems certain from the range of it that the artist, Gordon Grant, had 
sufficiently free reign in 1936 to tell his story without having to bow to 
panel or commission. Of course, those public art days are pretty much over, and 
we are in a new age of confirming belief or challenging perception. 
</P>
<P>
 It all depends upon where you are.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; CREWS TRYING TO BEAT THE CLOCK AT NEW CINEPLEX; 
THE 56,000-SQUARE-FOOT FACILITY IN CAMARILLO WILL BOAST 12 SCREENS WHEN IT 
DEBUTS FOR THE PUBLIC FRIDAY. THE VIP OPENING IS TODAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Building a movie theater is a lot like producing a film. There are swarms of 
people involved, it costs an unimaginable amount of money, and the product is 
finished just in the nick of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadlines have been very much on the minds of the people working at the 
county's newest movie theater, the Edwards Camarillo Palace 12. 
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty to do within the 12-screen multiplex. One week ago the seats 
weren't even installed in any of the theaters. The 80-foot-long concession 
stand was a dissembled jumble of stainless steel, and the enormous lobby that 
owner Edwards Cinemas is so proud of looked like a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the deadline for the VIP opening today and the public opening Friday, 
crews have been working around the clock all week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a race, but every opening I worked on was like this," said Kurt 
Macfarlane, director of engineering for Edwards. "We always make it in time." 
</P>
<P>
 The huge 56,000-square-foot facility located on the south side of the Ventura 
Freeway between Las Posas Road and Carmen Drive looks good even half assembled. 
Large curved vinyl screens stretch from wall to wall in each theater, and 
projection units have big burly sound systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one of these booths cost $560,000," Macfarlane said. "That's just for 
projection and sound. Every one has a couple kinds of digital stereo, DTS and 
SRD. That's the Dolby system. We're negotiating with Sony to include their 
digital system also." 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of films the cinema will show is something the bookers for 
Edwards are going to experiment with, according to Michael Tiemeyer, director 
of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we're going to have the first runs and regular releases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's up to the community as to what they want. If they support art films, 
we'll do it. We've got a theater in Orange County that shows only art films." 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of films should be pretty orthodox through the holiday and into 
the summer season. That's when the United Artist theater is scheduled to open, 
also in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Two theaters in the same town means they will be competing for prints of the 
dozen or so major motion pictures Hollywood has in release at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When UA opens, it will become more of a horse race," Tiemeyer said. The 
offerings might become a little more non-traditional. "Until then we'll have 
mostly major releases."

FASHION; FEELING STRESSED OVER ISSUES RAISED BY GETTING DRESSED; WHY CAN'T 
DESIGNERS GET WITH THE PROGRAM? IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF THEY ARE IN TOUCH WITH 
THE DECADE.

 Don't need no copy of Vogue magazine;  
</P>
<P>
 Don't need to dress like no beauty queen  
</P>
<P>
 -- from My Baby Loves Me, by Martina McBride 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hardest things about choosing a wardrobe in the '90s is trying to 
keep clothing PC and FC at the same time. Politically correct and fashionably 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 We've put a lot of effort into this matter and, frankly, we are having a hard 
time getting dressed. Why can't designers get with the program, so shopping can 
be a little bit simpler? It makes you wonder if they are in touch with the 
decade. I mean, are they checking out the eco mags, or do they just stick with 
Womens Wear Daily? 
</P>
<P>
 Like, makeup is FC. The wholesome look, with hair mousse only? It's history. 
The glam syndrome is back in spades -- or, diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 So we dropped over to the mall to lay in some electric lipstick, charcoal 
shadow, iridescent mascara and those new gold face stick-ons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But we started flashing on those confounded bunnies, you know? It's not PC to 
wear rabbit-tested stuff. There are all these rabbits out there who are acting 
-- excuse the expression -- as guinea pigs. Cosmetics are checked for toxins by 
putting them in their eyes. If the rabbit can't take it, they wipe out the 
mascara formula. And possibly the rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, someone's got to do it. I mean, Gov. Pete Wilson was real firm on the 
issue. There was this bill to keep rabbits from involuntary servitude, because 
they probably wouldn't choose to give their lives to science, let alone vanity. 
But the governor said, in essence, that better a bunny than us, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it turns out that there are all these rabbit fans who watch the news. 
They said rabbits can't speak for themselves, which, when you think about it, 
is hard to dispute. They started marching around in regiments until a lot of 
makeup manufacturers figured that the jig was up. 
</P>
<P>
 So they gave up their hostages, uh, rabbits and are using test-tube proteins 
or something. And now, to be PC, we have to carry a list of manufacturers' 
names around when we shop. And when we find a lipstick to match a nail enamel, 
we should refer to the list! I mean, is that a practical use of our lunch 
hours? It's a long list. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's only the tip of the steamer trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Like, what are the going (FC) colors this season? Are they easy-on-the-planet 
vegetable dyes, which we have been alerted to watch for? Or the 
unbleached-fiber look an eco-hipster would flaunt? Hardly; the big news is 
jewel tones. Like magenta, deep emerald and royal blue, colors that no 
self-respecting vegetable ever thought to come in. 
</P>
<P>
 And, how about fur? What could be less PC than wearing fur from forest friends 
who have spent the night in a steel trap -- or a lifetime in a maximum-security 
cage, after which they are, well, electrocuted? 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, we've seen those Wild Kingdom films. 
</P>
<P>
 But how can we pass up those rad coats that are flooding the fashion scene? 
There's more fur in the mall this season than in Los Padres. And it's not faux; 
it's real fur, like foxes wear. In fact, they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosh, we're torn here. After all, we've been told that thinning out forest 
friends keeps the rest healthy. And the caged critters were raised to be pelts. 
Like Christmas trees. They wouldn't be there if it they weren't planned for, 
uh, harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, fur is not being flaunted here. It's just trims. Think of all the 
foxes that will save compared to a whole coat of them. Besides, it's natural. 
Making faux fur pollutes streams. 
</P>
<P>
 A coat without either kind of fur? That would be boring -- and so would we. 
</P>
<P>
 But, while we're at it, let's check out a subtler issue. There's something a 
lot more rampant than fur in the shops. It's the '90s answer to synthetics, 
from underwear to ski wear, from the office to the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 It's silk! Nubby, slubby or shiny -- it's out there in force. It's real hard 
to get more fashionably correct than silk. And it, too, owns that happy 
adjective: natural.  
</P>
<P>
 So, we're ready to load up on it. After all, those are worms , you know? It's 
pretty hard to relate to a worm. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, they're put to death. But they're not electrocuted -- they're 
simply steamed over the great divide. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you set them loose, just what would they do with their freedom, being 
caterpillars and all? They'd turn into moths, fly around for a couple of weeks 
and cash out as decrepit oldster moths, that's what. And leave enough eggs to 
wipe out acres of mulberries. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what do you say we get out there and support the silk industry? I mean, if 
you can't exploit worms, just whom can you exploit?

EARTHWATCH: UNWISE WATER USE MAY PUT A FISH OUT OF WATER; STEELHEAD TROUT OF 
THE SANTA CLARA AND VENTURA RIVERS ARE THREATENED BY POLLUTION AND LOWER STREAM 
LEVELS. WITH HELP, THEY CAN MAKE A COMEBACK.

 This fall, a local equivalent of the spotted owl controversy came to public 
notice in Ventura County. But in this case, the endangered animal is the 
steelhead trout, a relative of the salmon. And the threatened habitat is not 
the woods but the rivers -- the Santa Clara and the Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The local argument is about our water-use habits. And many of the people 
involved are joining a common cause. Folks who want to save the endangered fish 
have gotten together with folks who want someday to eat the endangered fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Connor Everts, a director of the Casitas Water District and the Ojai 
Sanitation District, is a fishing enthusiast. He also advocates conservation 
and recycling, rather than dams, as the best ways to manage the local water 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salmon and steelhead used to run (in the Ventura River) through downtown 
Ojai," Everts said. "My grandfather used to catch them. When I was 8, I could 
still catch them near the Matilija Dam." 
</P>
<P>
 Everts is one of many local officials who believe that the presence or absence 
of the steelhead trout in our local rivers is a sign of the health -- or ill 
health -- of the environment. "It's like the canary singing in the mine -- a 
sign that the atmosphere is good for the people working there," he said. "If it 
dies, the situation is going bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials such as Everts have choices when providing water for showers 
and sprinklers. They can take water out of rivers or catch water behind dams. 
Or, as they sometimes have in this county, they can promote conservation. They 
can also build facilities to enable the reuse of waste water for outdoor 
purposes, as Thousand Oaks is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservation and recycling allow more water to be left in rivers for nature's 
purpose -- such as a habitat for fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Adams, a manager with the California Department of Fish and Game in 
Fillmore, has been monitoring developments in our county from the perspective 
of a game warden. According to Adams, providing ways for the steelhead to get 
around local dams as well as moderating the amount of freshwater drawn from 
local underground and surface rivers have produced "some very good news. The 
steelhead have always been here, but the run was declining. In the spring of 
'94, we've sighted adults and juvenile fish where they haven't been for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis McEwen, the department's steelhead expert in Sacramento, cites urban 
sprawl, drought, damming and the toxics used on yards and business properties 
as enemies of the species. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you build with little consideration for the environment, habitat is lost 
and you're on the brink of extinction," he said. "That goes for people too." 
</P>
<P>
 McEwen is the author of a forthcoming report, "The Steelhead Management Plan 
For California," which links the health of our local rivers with the fate of 
this fish. Groups -- including members of sportfishing clubs -- worried about 
water quality and supply have lobbied Sacramento since the '70s to create a 
statewide plan to restore the animal's habitat in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 California Trout, a statewide organization affiliated with local clubs like 
the Conejo Valley Fly Fishers, Camarillo Fishing Club and the Sespe Fly 
Fishers, is a booster of the idea. Nowadays, steelhead can legally be caught 
from June to November -- but you have to drive north of Monterey to find any. 
</P>
<P>
 As trout-fishing fans, these folks are cousins of bird watchers. But instead 
of jotting down sightings, they catch and then release the fish. They also want 
the species to be brought back from near-extinction in sufficient numbers that 
they can, eventually, eat some. 
</P>
<P>
 McEwen's report, due out next month, will indicate that this won't happen for 
years. But the place where fishing enthusiasts and game wardens are united is 
bigger than just a belly full of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rivers have many uses," McEwen said. "We need a new ethic of rivers." 
</P>
<P>
 California Trout spokesman Jim Edmondson put it this way: "The dream is to 
restore trout and steelhead resources to what they were in early California. 
Conservation makes it all possible." Details

recreation are Friends of the Santa Clara River (498-4323), Friends of the

SHOP TALK; DECK THE HOUSE WITH THOSE BARGAIN FOLLIES; DON'T SPEND A FORTUNE ON 
SEASONAL NOVELTIES. A VARIETY OF SANTAS AND SNOWMEN WILL SNORE OR DANCE FOR A 
SONG.

 So many people go around saying things like "Ho, ho, ho," and "Merrrrry 
Christmas." Easy enough sentiments to express verbally, but do these folks 
really mean what they say? 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday season can be so high-pressure, high-stress, and high-cost that 
sometimes things tend to turn tense and serious. The "joy of Christmas" can 
become the "oh boy of Christmas" really fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of helping everyone stay festive, we chose to stick with the lighter 
side of the holidays, and last week went shopping for offbeat Christmas items. 
We visited a couple of shops at The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks, the It's a 
Party store in Oakview and Connie's Hallmark in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're really into goofy, we might save you some time by suggesting that 
your first stop be the Dapy outlet at The Oaks. Just about everything in the 
place is a little warped or wacky. For our money, it would be tough to beat the 
plush Santa hat with reindeer antlers for $15, or the Santa hat with dreadlocks 
for $22. 
</P>
<P>
 Dapy also had several items in the "Rompin' Xmas" line of products. The 
dancing Santa Clauses, Christmas trees and snowmen move by magnetic force to 
upbeat Christmas tunes emanating from the battery-operated base of the 
contraption. These items were selling for $19.95. The store also had a 
battery-operated "Snoring Santa" (with a really quality snore, by the way, 
complete with tummy moving up and down) for $24.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, don't be misled. Just because we fell in love with the Dapy merchandise, 
doesn't mean they have a monopoly on the holiday weirdness. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Joys store, also at The Oaks, we discovered a whole collection of 
nutcrackers -- one of the more timeless gifts of the season. True, the 
traditional, uniformed Nutcracker depicted in many a Suite doesn't exactly make 
one chuckle, but how about a nutcracker that looks like Uncle Sam. Maybe that's 
not funny either, but it is a little odd. The Nutcracker Sam had red and white 
pants, a blue military-style coat, and a white hat with a blue stripe and white 
stars. Cost $10.88, marked down from $21.99. All of the nutcrackers were priced 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Joys also had a ceramic, hand-painted Santa Claus-head salt and pepper shaker 
set for $25.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Ventura, at the renovated and significantly larger Connie's Hallmark 
store, our favorite fun items, were the "Glowing Melody" musical candles priced 
at $7.95. These candles, shaped like Christmas trees, Santa Clauses, and 
snowmen, are equipped with light-activated musical chips. When the candle is 
lit, the chip plays Christmas carols. 
</P>
<P>
 The store also had a series of "Squeeze Pals" in stock. Our favorite was the 
reindeer in jumpsuit and holiday sweater. When you poke its stomach it says, 
"Merry Christmas and a happy New Year," followed by a chorus of voices singing 
the line "Santa Claus is coming to town." The reindeer (or Santa, or elf) was 
priced at $10.95, batteries included. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, how lighthearted can a Christmas really be without a troll? Trolls 
are still hot items, so you can find them in any number of locations. We 
particularly liked one we saw at It's a Party. The green-haired guy is dressed 
in traditional Dickens Christmas style, down to the red scarf and black hat, 
and is cradling a book of Christmas carols. Price: $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Now wouldn't some green hair help stamp out the holiday blues? 
</P>
<P>

 On an unrelated note, an Office Depot outlet opened last week at 4371 
Telephone Road in Ventura. The stock of office supplies looked comprehensive, 
as expected, and the store even had a few gift baskets and tins in stock for 
the holidays.Photo illustration by STEVE OSMAN / Los Angeles Times

JAUNTS; VICTORIAN HOMES OPEN FOR TOUR; FIVE ELEGANT, TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY 
RESIDENCES AT HERITAGE SQUARE ARE FEATURED IN A SPECIAL HOLIDAY EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you want a Victorian dose of Christmas, visit Heritage Square in downtown 
Oxnard this weekend. The restored turn-of-the-century village is all spruced up 
for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Guides in period costumes are leading tours through five of the decorated 
homes, once lived in by pioneering Oxnard families. It's a chance to see the 
interior of these finely crafted homes, which throughout the year are closed 
during weekend walking tours of the quaint village. 
</P>
<P>
 The special tours this weekend are not free, though, like the others. Advance 
tickets are $10 for adults; $12 at the door. For seniors it's $2 less, and 
children 6 to 12 can take the tour for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-minute tours are scheduled Thursday and Friday, 6 to 9 p.m.; and 
Saturday and Sunday, 3 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a look at the houses, you can sample a dessert buffet. Actors from 
the Elite Theatre Co., Heritage Square's resident theater group, will tell 
Christmas stories and perform songs. "Scrooge" will also put in an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've never strolled through Heritage Square, it's a collection of 11 
homes, a church, water tower and pump house -- all restored, landscaped and 
neatly laid out with Disneyland-like flair. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't built there to begin with, however. They are some of the more 
elegant examples of Oxnard architecture, rounded up from all over the city and 
moved to the square's downtown location at 7th Street, between South A and B 
streets. The farthest was six miles away, and the closest, only six blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage Square officially opened in 1991, concluding a six year effort by the 
city, private investors and the original families to preserve the buildings as 
a remnant of early Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally restored on the inside too, the homes are occupied by an assortment of 
businesses, agencies and groups -- everything from the Oxnard Chamber of 
Commerce to the Christian Science Reading Room. 
</P>
<P>
 For the tours this weekend, the homes-turned-offices have been decked out with 
lights, Christmas trees, decorative boughs and wreaths, and stockings on the 
fireplaces. In the Justin Petit Ranch House, a 13-room Queen Anne-style house 
that serves as the square's centerpiece, a vintage miniature train runs around 
the Christmas tree. Nearby are turn-of-the-century toys, like a small rocking 
horse. Stockings, fashioned like elegant boots of the period, hang from the 
mantel. 
</P>
<P>
 Those on the tour will learn about the Petit family and the house, built in 
1896 at 1980 E. Wooley Road. The French-born Petit and his wife, Francis 
Kaufman, raised seven children there. The 7,000-square-foot house has two 
staircases, seven entrances, seven bedrooms, two parlors, and two maids' 
quarters. It also holds the distinction of being the first farmhouse in the 
county to have electricity installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put everything on this house," said Gary Blum, a Petit descendant who 
restored the house. It has curved glass windows, ornate detailing, and a paint 
job involving seven colors. 
</P>
<P>
 The other houses on the tour include the Gordon House, a two-story 
Craftsman-style house built in 1910; the Fry/Puntenney House, a 1903 Queen Anne 
design with a rounded two-story tower; the Scarlett House, built in 1903, with 
the best preserved staircase at the square; and the Perkins/Clayberg House, 
built in 1887 with ornate gables and spindle work. 
</P>
<P>
 The walking tours will run every 15 minutes and will include about 25 people. 
Proceeds will benefit programs at Heritage Square. Details

FOR THE KIDS; SHOW SHEDS SOME LIGHT ON HOLIDAY TRADITIONS; PRODUCTION IN 
NEWBURY PARK TELLS HOW DIFFERENT FESTIVITIES ARE CELEBRATED BY DIFFERENT 
PEOPLE.

 With Santas beckoning from the malls and stenciled all over store windows, try 
telling kids that the season means more than Christmas to many people. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the point of "Season of Lights," a production for children that 
will be staged Monday night at the Newbury Park branch of the Thousand Oaks 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 It's for children 5 years and older. Best of all, it's free. Two performances 
are scheduled for 5 and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is an offering from the Los Angeles-based Imagination Company 
Traveling Children's Theater. They've been around 11 years and have performed 
at the library and other spots in the county before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Season of Lights" is one of many programs the group puts on for 
schoolchildren during the year. According to the troupe's director, Tom 
Provenzano, the idea behind the show is to tune youngsters into the cultural 
diversity of the United States, especially California. 
</P>
<P>
 The show gets its name because the winter months are loaded with celebrations 
of one sort or another, many of them using candles and bright lights to fight 
the darkness and cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Using three adult actors, the production focuses on four celebrations, using a 
mix of singing, dancing and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, they tell the story of the Maccabees who 
fought for religious freedom long ago and how that evolved into lighting the 
candles on the menorah. Christmas is shown in traditional Mexican style, with 
luminarias and marionettes. Kwanzaa, the African American tradition started in 
1966, is presented through a singing game. 
</P>
<P>
 The last holiday during the 40-minute show is the Chinese New Year. That 
arrives, complete with dragon, which the actors use to bring children from the 
audience into the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa is not only at the malls, he's at the Ventura Harbor. Children can chat 
with him over breakfast Saturday at Hornblower's Restaurant. Then they can see 
"Christmas Under the Sea," an underwater version of Christmas performed by 
Stroud's Puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids pancake breakfast from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. is $1.95 and includes 
treats, a clown show and a treasure hunt. Tickets for the puppet show at 11:30 
a.m. are $2. Call 658-2202 for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa will be chatting with kids in Moorpark too. For the second year, the 
city is sponsoring home visits by Santa. He'll be knocking on doors Dec. 17 
through Dec. 23. Visiting hours are 5:30 to 9:30 on weekdays, and 8 a.m. to 
9:30 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The real McCoy may be free, but this one isn't. This drop-in Santa charges $20 
for a 20-minute visit. For information, call the city, 529-6864 Ext. 231. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a break from all the holiday mania, budding young actors in 
Thousand Oaks and Santa Paula are presenting productions that put a comical 
spin on fairy tales. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, the Young Artists Ensemble is doing "Into the Woods," a 
mangled version of Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Rapunzel and others. The 
musical, which opened Friday, is running on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays 
through Dec. 17 at the Conejo Valley Adult School, 1025 Old Farm Road, Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $6.50. For information and show times, call 499-4355. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, Hundred Hats Youth Theater is taking some comical liberties 
with "The Princess and the Pea." It opens Friday and runs on Fridays, Saturdays 
and Sundays through Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $5. The theater is located at 125 S. 7th St. For show times and 
information, call 525-4645. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Here's something for the artist in your child. Adventures for Kids bookstore 
in Ventura is holding a Family Art Day Saturday beginning at 11 a.m. Kids can 
whip up some art projects that have a cultural favor. It's all under the 
direction of Ventura and Oxnard college students studying early childhood 
development. Girl Scouts also will be on hand for storytelling. The event runs 
until 2 p.m., and it's free. Details 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC; MESSAGE IS LOUD AND FAST WHEN REVEREND HEAT TAKES THE PULPIT; THE 
LONG-TOURING ROCKABILLY BAND BRINGS IT'S HARD-DRIVING BRAND OF MUSIC TO SANTA 
BARBARA ON FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Play a Carl Perkins album at 78 r.p.m. on-board an SST, then set the plane on 
fire. That pretty much describes the Reverend Horton Heat's approach to 
rockabilly music. Survivors will be handing out elbows for Christmas presents 
in the mosh pit at the Friday night show at the Underground in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The band started off as a pure rockabilly outfit in 1987, but soon began 
picking up speed like a tornado roaring across East Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The band tours relentlessly, doing over 200 gigs per year, including side 
trips to Europe, Australia and anywhere else that will have them. The band is: 
Jim Heath (the Reverend) playing fast guitar, Jimbo Wallace keeping up on bass, 
and Patrick (Taz) Bailey backing it up on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 The band released a couple of albums on Seattle's Sub Pop label, but the new 
one, "Liquor in the Front," is on Interscope. The songs touch upon the usual 
topics -- sin, sex, substance abuse and surf. "I Can't Surf" croons the 
Reverend, not a surprising confession for a Texan. The Reverend made further 
revelations during a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 You could've been an admiral, a senator, even the Pope, but why a Reverend? 
</P>
<P>
 There used to be this club owner who used to give everybody nicknames, and he 
started calling me "Horton." At the time, I lived in this old place with a 
bunch of big old rats. So one night this guy tells me I can have a gig at his 
place if he can call me "Horton Heat." My name is Heath, so he just dropped the 
"h," but I would've done anything -- I was living with a bunch of rats. Hey 
man, I would've gotten "Horton Heat" tattooed on my forehead; besides, he 
already had the posters printed up with "Rev. Horton Heat" on them. After that, 
I started getting wild on stage, sermonizing and all that. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the difference going from a small label to a big label? 
</P>
<P>
 To us, it doesn't really matter. We play a lot, we tour a lot, but they can 
handle things and it seems like there's a Warner Bros. person in every town on 
the planet. I'm doing a lot more interviews now, like this one for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Is rockabilly about as popular as it was in the '50s? 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting bigger -- maybe because of us -- I don't know. Rockabilly was the 
first punk rock music. There was nothing crazier and more punk rock than Jerry 
Lee Lewis in the mid- and late-'50s. It's just loud and fast. It goes. That's 
what people want -- they want to be entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the punkers and the country-Western crowd get along in the pit? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they do; sometimes they don't. At one of our gigs at Bogart's in 
Long Beach, they didn't. First, about 40 couples started line dancing, then all 
these sweaty guys started crashing into these girls wearing red petticoats, and 
at least three unrelated fights broke out immediately. But like I said, 
rockabilly was the original punk rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 So you've been everywhere, even to Russia -- what was that like? 
</P>
<P>
 We were playing in Norway and they took us across the border to Russia, way up 
there in the Arctic Circle. There were a bunch of English bands there, too, but 
there wasn't a hotel in the town, so they put us up in the local sanitarium. 
The staff was all these big Russian women wearing white uniforms saying stuff 
to us we couldn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 What did you listen to growing up in Texas? 
</P>
<P>
 I listened to a whole lot of different stuff. I've played in a lot of 
different bands -- heavy metal bands, punk rock bands and rockabilly bands. 
What got me started was this record store guy who turned me onto '50s music. My 
first gig was with a '50s band, and I'll always love that music. We have a '50s 
point-of-view, but we're not a '50s band. Rockabilly fans tell me we're the 
only speed metal band they can listen to. Then punk rockers tell me I'm the 
best rockabilly band around. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps you sane on those endless road trips? 
</P>
<P>
 Clean socks. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Jim, thanks for talking. I look forward to seeing you in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara? I thought this was for the L.A. Times? 
</P>
<P>
 It is. We're like Warner Bros., man. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Reverend Horton Heat, Useless Playboys, Dave & Deke Combo. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday, 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Underground, 110 Santa Barbara St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $12. 
</P>
<P>
 * CALL: 965-5050.

THEATER REVIEW; IDEALISM GETS REALITY CHECK IN 'TRAGEDY'; A YOUNG TEACHER 
ENCOUNTERS CYNICISM AND FRUSTRATION AS HE TRIES TO REVERSE THE CYCLE OF POVERTY

<P>
 A hard-hitting dynamo of a play, "Stand-Up Tragedy" ricochets around the PCPA 
Theaterfest stage with the same electricity powering the high-tension 
activities of its New York barrio setting -- rap music, basketball and street 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A minimal set adorned with graffiti, break dancing and, on occasion, spilled 
blood, is all the backdrop the talented 12-member ensemble needs to evoke Bill 
Cain's harrowing portrait of inner-city youth trapped in an endless cycle of 
poverty, crime and premature death. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere in the midst of all the squandered possibilities, hopes Tom 
Griffin (Ron Heneghan), an idealistic young teacher newly arrived at a Catholic 
all-boy's high school, there's still a chance to make a difference by turning 
some lives around. 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely, counters the school principal, a cynical priest (Charlie Bachmann) 
who's lost much of his faith struggling with problems that stubbornly resist 
solutions. Father Larkin has learned the hard way not to tamper with the local 
ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lesson Griffin sets out to disprove, by taking a personal interest in 
Lee Cortez (Gendell Hernandez), a gifted young artist trapped in a squalid 
family setting. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the familiar plot territory of many a stirring humanistic drama -- 
from "The Blackboard Jungle" to "Stand and Deliver" -- but Cain's version, 
steeped in his personal experience as a teacher in New York's Lower East Side, 
lacks the self-congratulatory tone and upbeat assurance of an inevitable happy 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, this play insists, attempts to intervene only makes things 
infinitely worse. Griffin's offer of sanctuary to the troubled Lee proves 
disastrous because it's only temporary: For the boy, being sent back to the 
suffocating embrace of an abusive, alcoholic mother and a heroin addict brother 
is cruel punishment after he's had a taste of healthier family life. 
</P>
<P>
 In a chilling reprisal that embodies his sense of betrayal, Lee destroys a 
painting he's just given Griffin, saying, "I wanted to give you something 
beautiful and then take it away." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many such moments in this well-constructed piece, exchanges that 
crystallize the inner processes that perpetuate the sense of hopelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The strikingly original presentational style filters out extraneous details -- 
ironic touches such as the national anthem abbreviated to just its first and 
last lines -- that are perfectly calibrated to a generation of channel surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Paul Barnes retains the abstract confrontational format that 
distinguished the piece in its 1989 staging at the Mark Taper Forum, with an 
abundance of raucous energy, outrageous humor and frank vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, some of the strongest language comes from the anguished Father 
Larkin, whose clear-sighted commentary sustains the play's theological 
underpinnings as he confronts the abject failure of well-intentioned social 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 For these desperate youths, the only thing worse than the status quo would be 
to turn our backs on them. Yet that's precisely the direction in which we seem 
headed. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE ROYAL TREATMENT: BOLD, SIMPLE LUNCH; BAKERY IN VENTURA, 
WHICH HAS EXPERIENCED STRONG POPULARITY IN THE MONTHS SINCE IT OPENED, OFFERS A 
MEAL AT AN ATTRACTIVE PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Finding the simple and good at lunch is often an arduous and bad experience. 
</P>
<P>
 So many lunch menus are nothing more than dumbed-down dinner menus -- a 
cop-out when you consider that lunch is its own culinary genre, designed around 
the great sandwich and the great bowl of soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some restaurants still post true lunch menus, they mar their 
offerings with bogus, insipid ingredients -- my favorite among the deceptions 
being sliced processed loaf turkey instead of the carved real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly, the good lunch spot is hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Royal Bakery, modestly situated at the corner of a mall on Telephone 
Road in Ventura. The Royal is doing it right: It treats lunch with simplicity, 
boldness and authenticity in the ingredients. The result, taken in spare white 
surroundings on cafe tables indoors and out, is altogether restorative. And the 
Royal, despite a recent downsizing of some portions owing to feverish 
popularity in the first honeymoon months of its being open, does lunch for an 
attractive price. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with one of the soups ($2.95), which change daily. Always they are 
dense, milled to a coarse texture, fragrant with fresh herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cream of tomato, so debased in its form as perhaps the most popular canned 
soup in American supermarkets, recovers its essence: Pink, lustrous 
cream-and-fresh-tomato broth is buoyed by black pepper and the sweet pungency 
of basil. Corn chowder is thick, heavy on the freshly peeled mashed potatoes 
and whole kernel corn -- a rendering so rustic as to be straight from Iowa. 
Only cream of mushroom lacks oomph, but then the mushrooms are fresh and firm, 
the broth silken and faintly woodsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiches are accompanied by a salad of mixed, supermarket-style greens, but 
the leaves are sparkling fresh and spiked with crumbled feta cheese and toasted 
pine nuts. Caesar salad is available for $3.95, and it is quite presentable: 
fresh in the romaine with real bite in the dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The turkey club sandwich ($5), simply named and fabulously constructed, is the 
real article: freshly carved breast meat of roasted bird topped by crisp bacon, 
lettuce or mayonnaise on bakery French bread or whole wheat. (This is the 
outsize sandwich, I believe, that drew in the initial throngs and now has been 
cut back in scale and weight. Still, it remains a fine sandwich and a fair 
deal.) 
</P>
<P>
 A frequent sandwich special is curried chicken ($4.75), a humdrum name that 
fails to communicate a terrific freshness and complexity achieved by the 
incorporation into the mix of crisp green apples and raisins. Yes, the chicken 
is the real thing: carved from birds, not sliced from processed rolls. Tuna 
salad ($4.50) is a bit more run-of-the-mill but perfectly adequate, as 
over-the-counter tuna goes, if you can abide the incorporation of chopped sweet 
pickle. 
</P>
<P>
 A worthy soup-and-salad deal is the $4 combination, featuring a bowl of soup 
and a half sandwich of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal expands its lunch menu by offering fresh individual pizzas and a 
variety of quiches. Both can be excellent, and both can be lackluster -- so 
you're more on your own here. A recent sun-dried tomato pizza with three 
cheeses, goat among them, was quite good: firm, yeasty crust, pungent cheeses, 
generous slices of sun-dried fruit. But a barbecued chicken pizza -- dried out, 
lacking flavor -- wasn't nearly as successful. 
</P>
<P>
 A mushroom and fresh-herb quiche was stunning in its joining of rich egg 
filling with light, fragrant mushrooms in a frothy mix. A sausage quiche, while 
adequate, was sodden and without such magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in awhile, the Royal's kitchen stretches even further, crossing the line 
into dinner-style entrees. On a recent visit, one such dish, listed as a 
blackboard special, was linguine with cream, sherry, Dijon mustard, capers, 
sweet red peppers and seared chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news: For $5.95, you can get a mammoth portion of properly cooked 
pasta with a rich, flavorsome sauce. The bad news: It's actually too flavorful 
(too concentrated in the sharp combination of mustard and capers), too rich, 
too heavy, too, too, too. For the person who wants a large lunch, though, it 
may be worth a go. In any event, it's clear that real talent lurks about this 
humble bakery kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts here form a universe far larger than the usual: The Royal was and is 
first a bakery, and so pastries, cookies and cakes of every stripe abound. The 
results are of uniformly high quality. Of course, if a simple lunch is your 
mission, you might instead prefer an espresso or cappuccino, each brewed 
competently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal continues to adjust to its newfound popularity, and it will be 
critical in the coming months that the place find stability in portions and 
prices. So much works well now -- the delightful staff bears mention here -- 
that it would be a shame to falter under the crush of people grateful for the 
simple, good lunch. Details

 La Terraza restaurant at the Hyatt Westlake Plaza has changed executive chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 New on the scene is Don Catlin, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of 
America, who most recently was executive chef at the Hyatt hotel in Cherry 
Hill, N. J. Catlin took over his new position when former head chef Randy Saito 
was transferred to the Hyatt at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Jackson, food and beverage director at Hyatt Westlake, said not to expect 
any menu changes to accompany the chef changes just yet. Don't, however, be 
surprised to see a whole new restaurant format soon. The hotel is at 880 S. 
Westlake Blvd.

 For those who hadn't noticed, Ventura's Golden China Restaurant has moved,

 Christmas party hosts who have grown tired of the old eggnog routine may want 
to consider what a couple of local schoolteachers have to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Elena Lattarulo, a Spanish instructor at Hueneme High School and Ventura 
College, and her colleague Miguel Gutierrez, who teaches science and math at 
Rio Mesa High School, have recently begun carting around their a Rent-A-Rita 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Rita as in marga-rita. With the push of a handle the bartender-in-a-box 
dispenses the drinks in the manner of a soft-serve ice cream machine. All the 
host need supply is the alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always the token margarita person at all the parties I went too," 
Lattarulo said. "I have a reputation for making killer margaritas, but I always 
ended up stuck in the kitchen with the blender." So she found an alternative 
for herself and others with the same high-demand skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Lattarulo said the machines are popular in Texas, but California has been slow 
to catch on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The machines are really easy to operate. We just deliver them, make sure 
everything's OK, and then we leave." She said the machine is suitable for large 
or small gatherings. "We did a party for between 300 and 400 people, and we've 
done one as small as 25." The Rita has been invited to a few upcoming Christmas 
parties, and already has been reserved for the Fourth of July. Information: 
647-7200.

QUESTIONS STRETCH ACROSS THE NATION; BROAD IMPACT OF ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the dust settles on Orange County's breathless passage from a worried 
community to a bankrupt one, what the public still does not know looms large. 
To date, officials at the center of the storm have done little to clarify 
matters or provide perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the day after Orange County filed for protection under Chapter 9 
of the federal Bankruptcy Code, county officials still were trying to come to 
grips with the consequences of the risky investment strategies employed by 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A SHAKEN MARKET: It is understood that officials are caught up in a struggle 
to cope with the crisis, but the fact remains that this financial disaster has 
its roots in a lack of public explanation and understanding. Addressing the 
public's need to know the extent of the problem, and how it happened, is 
paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration of bankruptcy has undermined the confidence of the entire bond 
market. Meanwhile, government workers in Orange County are wondering whether 
they will be paid, and the municipal and school agencies that employ them are 
scrambling to figure out what all this means for them. It is imperative that 
the county government come completely clean if it means to fully address the 
problem and enlist community and national support in moving forward.  
</P>
<P>
 Information has been harder to find than an eager new investor in a county 
bond. Orange County has been dispensing it in dribs and drabs, much as office 
gossip might leak out around the water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street, a continent away, has turned out to be the only real source of 
information on the county's earlier efforts to liquidate its holdings and 
possibly avoid bankruptcy. With Wall Street sources reporting that losses may 
be even greater than the $1.5-billion figure given last week, there still has 
been no full accounting from Orange County. And it remains unclear what the 
actual value is now for the investment-pool fund that Citron operated. 
</P>
<P>
 SOONER THE BETTER: And there are more questions: 
</P>
<P>
 On what basis, and on whose advice, did Orange County become the largest 
municipality in U.S. history ever to file for bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 People on the street, investors and school and other public officials wonder 
whether less drastic action was considered. If so, why was it rejected? 
</P>
<P>
 And how was Citron was able to operate without oversight? The Board of 
Supervisors must answer that one. 
</P>
<P>
 All these questions have national implications. One of the attractions of 
bonds has been their relative stability, based on support by the taxing power 
of local governments. If governments suddenly and unexpectedly can declare 
bankruptcy, this important economic assumption may vanish for all municipal 
bond investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials must understand that their fiscal affairs are now a 
matter of national importance, perhaps even urgency. The sooner all the facts 
are public, the better.

ELIZABETH GLASER'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elizabeth Glaser, who died Saturday of complications from AIDS, was best known 
for the speech she gave at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. However, 
she was equally eloquent when she told graduates of the UCLA Medical School: "I 
will not win all of my battles, and neither will you. But if we do our best 
with intelligence, compassion and love, that will be enough -- it has to be 
enough. And that way, though each outcome may not be what we had wanted or 
hoped for, at least each day we can be proud of who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Her message to the Democrats, and the nation, in 1992 bears repeating: "This 
(fight against AIDS) is not about being a Republican or an independent or a 
Democrat. It's about the future -- for each and every one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before her death, David Satcher, director of the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, declared AIDS to be the leading cause of death 
among Americans 25 to 44. "In the history of epidemics, AIDS is among the worst 
in the world," Satcher said. At the time of Glaser's convention speech, 200,000 
Americans had died from AIDS; when she died, the list contained 50,000 more 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 It's said that half of those who learn that they are infected with HIV try to 
go on with their lives and that the other half simply wait to die. Glaser, who 
was infected by a blood transfusion, co-founded a group devoted to pediatric 
AIDS research. She raised millions of dollars to finance research and to pay 
for the care and treatment of young AIDS patients. Though she lost a child to 
AIDS, she never succumbed to discouragement and she totally rejected the view 
this is a disease that strikes those who do not deserve our compassion, our 
help and our tax dollars. Her legacy is large.

JEWS IN THE MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Bustany makes several misleading statements in his letter (Nov. 29). He 
asserts that prior to the early 1900s, Jews "in Arab societies did not 
experience persecution."The truth is that conditions for Jews in Arab lands, as 
in Christian Europe, were a mixture of good and bad. As a subjugated minority 
in both Islamic and Christian societies, Jews suffered chronic discrimination 
and recurring periods of active or even violent persecution. Indeed, Zionism 
developed as a modern movement in direct response to these dependent conditions 
and their resulting social, cultural and political problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustany wants Jews to recognize that Palestinians occupied the Holy Land 
(Israel/Palestine) "first." But we Jews define "first" as a much earlier point 
in time, and maintain our own prior and uninterrupted claim to that same land. 
Having engaged Bustany and other Arab partisans in dialogue over the past 15 
years, I do not expect either side to be convinced of the other's philosophical 
stance.  
</P>
<P>
 What does hold some hope are the Israeli-Palestinian accords and the desire of 
both parties to find a practical way to live peacefully next to each other, 
despite our ideological divisions. I can only pray that both sides work toward 
this shared goal.

<P>
 Old nuclear bomb waste ("Losing the Nuclear Waste War," Nov. 27) will not, as 
your writer suggests, pose a "risk to health and safety for more than 10,000 
years."That's wishful thinking. Plutonium 239, with a half-life of 24,400 
years, will remain deadly for the next 300,000 years. And to think we won the 
Cold War.

'SMOKE A JOINT, LOSE LICENSE' LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re " 'Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License' Law in Effect," Dec. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 Drunk drivers win again! Convicted drunk drivers will continue to kill and 
injure by driving on our streets after consuming the "legal" drug, alcohol. The 
new law will prevent people from driving and getting to work for merely 
possessing or smoking a "joint." What about possession of an open container of 
alcohol in the car? What about the consumption of any alcohol and driving? Over 
50% of the traffic fatalities are caused by drinking drivers, not people with 
less than an ounce of marijuana in their possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Our obsession with blaming "illicit" drugs as the cause of all the problems in 
the country is ridiculous. We must take responsibility for our actions. The 
problem is not drugs, it is us and our inability to face reality. 
</P>

 * Someone, oh someone, please explain to me in non-religious terms how, under 
our newly effective law, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana 
(automatic penalty: loss of driver's license for six months) constitutes a more 
serious transgression than running a red light (citation and $100 fine). 
Translating my question into less legalistic language: What real-life danger 
does that small amount of marijuana pose to outweigh the great danger to life, 
limb and property posed by him or her who runneth that red traffic light? 
</P>
<P>
 My use of the word "non-religious" arises from my firm belief that the 
so-called "war on drugs" is, in large part, little more than an expanded 
version of our old-time religiously based prohibition of alcoholic beverages; 
and, from all available information, seems to be working just about as well as 
its illustrious predecessor.

 * Your article stated that in the next 12 months, 131,000 drivers in 
California will lose their licenses for drug-related offenses whether or not 
they were operating a motor vehicle. Maybe this sounds like a good idea to 
some; in actuality we all know that the revocation of a license seldom (if 
ever) stops a person from driving. Especially in a city like Los Angeles with 
its unworkable mass-transit system. So all this ridiculous new law will do is 
create 131,000 new illegal drivers this year. Most will be uninsured, as well 
as apprehensive of being stopped by the cops. That's just what we need -- 
thousands of more paranoid people behind the wheel on our freeways on top of 
the millions we already have. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of yet one more "drug law" is actually pretty depressing when you 
figure it will just create a whole new set of problems for a state that can 
hardly cope with the ones we're faced with now. It seems that California is 
taking one more giant step backward. Is this 1964 or 1994?

RIGHTS WATCH; THE 'JOKE' FALLS FLAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Humorous"? Surely he jests. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how one Los Angeles Fire Department captain defended a videotape that 
depicts female recruits in an offensive way.One can only wonder whether he 
would have said the same thing if the hourlong "bloopers" tape had featured 
only African American firefighters tripping while their white counter-parts 
performed smoothly? Or only Latino recruits? 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Donald O. Manning has acquitted himself no better in the latest 
embarrassment to the Fire Department. Incredibly, Manning said that an internal 
probe he called for after he had viewed a portion of the tape found no 
wrongdoing. Still, the chief ordered that the tape no longer be played-it 
reported was shown at a number of fire stations-because it might be 
"misinterpreted" as being demeaning to women. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department brass apparently cannot fathom how the tape, also shown on 
some TV newscasts this week, would be seen as humiliating to women; yet it 
depicts women exclusively as bunglers, dropping ladders on themselves, even 
injuring themselves during training drills. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is already under sharp scrutiny in the area of human rights; a 
city audit found that women and minorities had been harassed and unfairly 
evaluated by supervisors in an effort to run them off the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning's response to discovery of the videotape only lends credibility to 
these charges. It also raises the uncomfortable question of whether the 
department's problems begin in the chief's office.

VICTIMS' FAMILIES IN SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Bill Boyarsky's column, "Victims' Families Should Be Heard," Dec. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 Hear! Hear! Mr. Boyarsky, for putting into words what so many of us out here 
believe to be an outrage regarding the defense of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 What is puzzling to me, and to everyone I have talked to about this case, is 
why this very costly (to the taxpayers) charade is being allowed to unfold. Our 
tax dollars should go to educating our children, feeding our elderly, keeping 
our streets clean and safe -- just about anything but this! Robert Shapiro and 
Johnnie Cochran are living examples of megalomaniacs, and it amazes me that 
they are allowed to treat the families of the victims and potential jurors as 
though they were the criminals. I have never seen a more brazen attempt to 
"stack the deck" in terms of jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Be a man, O.J. -- take your chances for a fair trial like everybody else, save 
your money for your four children and ailing mother, and send those high-priced 
roosters packing! Aside from looking very guilty to the public at large -- even 
sadder -- you look like a puppet and a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 ELAYNE SHAFFER 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes 
</P>
<P>
 * The Simpson defense team, aided in part by Judge Lance Ito's somewhat 
misplaced awe at the media attention to the case, has managed to promote the 
idea that anyone who thinks O.J. Simpson might be guilty is somehow 
compromising his right to a fair trial. This is nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Under our system of law, the presumption of innocence is just that, a 
presumption -- a postulation, a hypothesis -- which jurors are bound to make 
when considering evidence in a trial. It is possible to presume Simpson 
innocent even if common sense tells us he is guilty, just as it is possible for 
a scientist to fairly test a hypothesis he may suspect or believe to be false. 
</P>
<P>
 Our system of law, in its abstract majesty, recognizes its own limitations. It 
never presumes to judge whether or not a defendant is absolutely guilty or 
innocent, in the eyes of God, for example, beyond all doubt. It only presumes 
to say that 12 reasonable people, presented with all the reasonably admissible 
evidence, have or have not been convinced of a defendant's guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt.

PERSPECTIVES ON 187

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "The Nightmare Is Coming True," Commentary, Nov. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Martinez should remove his self-righteous blinders. His own hate-filled 
column attempts to justify the irresponsibility of illegals by blaming white 
homeowners.He may like teaching poetry to illegals, but that hardly justifies 
California citizens being held responsible, instead of their home countries, 
for the multimillion-dollar costs of providing schooling and medical care as 
well as the costs of welfare and voting fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on Martinez, lift your eyes up and turn your name-calling on the 
irresponsibilities of both the home countries and the illegals themselves. They 
need to accept their personal responsibility for controlling and educating the 
large families they choose to have, rather than trying to shift blame for their 
problems to conjured-up images of evil white homeowners.

<P>
 * It is refreshing to read Jorge G. Castaneda's commentary, "Reality Bites 
'Sending' Countries" (Nov. 25). To learn that Mexico treats undocumented 
Salvadorans equal to or worse than our treatment of Mexicans is an eye-opener. 
And to read that Latin American governments will have to negotiate the numbers 
of their countrymen who wish to leave means that the "If you don't like it 
here, go north" attitude may change. 
</P>
<P>
 And the article, "Leaders Worry: After Prop. 187, the Deluge" (Nov. 26), which 
refers to a massive return of their citizens from the United States: This may 
force these governments to improve conditions for their citizens rather than 
ignoring their economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 If this happens, Proposition 187 will have sent a message to Washington to 
secure our borders and one to Latin American governments to improve their 
citizens' lives rather than letting the United States do it.

MANACLES ON 'CLEAN HANDS'?; MAGISTRATE'S RESIGNATION COULD SET BACK ITALIAN 
CORRUPTION INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antonio di Pietro, the Milan magistrate who has set the pace in Italy's 
long-running "clean hands" investigation into government corruption, abruptly 
announced his resignation Tuesday. He claimed he was being abused both by those 
who wished to interfere with his investigation and those who wished to use it 
for their own political ends. It was time, he said, to "depersonalize" the 
investigation by ending his association with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Pietro has undeniably personified the "clean hands" investigation for 
millions of Italians, inspiring a country in which political corruption has 
been regarded as inevitable with his own bold conviction that there need be 
nothing inevitable about it. 
</P>
<P>
 After Di Pietro's announcement, newspapers in Italy were reportedly deluged 
with faxes urging him to reconsider. The popular fear, and we share it, is that 
a deeply salutary development in Italian political life may now be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Pietro and his colleagues seemed on the point of truly changing the course 
of Italian history. A politician may defeat another politician, but this 
magistrate and the many for whom he was the leader and symbol defeated an 
entire political party and overthrew a political regime. The Christian 
Democratic Party, dominant in Italy since the end of World War II, was so 
ruined by exposure of its pervasive corruption that the path was clear for a 
fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the biggest beneficiary of "clean hands" may now have become its 
worst enemy. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's newly formed party, Forza 
Italia (the name means, roughly, "Go, Italy!"), came to power by promising an 
end to the politics-as-usual that "clean hands" had exposed. However, as the 
continuing investigation has brought Berlusconi's giant Fininvest company and, 
finally, the prime minister himself under scrutiny, he has suddenly discovered 
the virtues of "normality . . . in the administration of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 If Di Pietro is quitting, has Berlusconi won? Like so many Italians, we hope 
not. Italy has celebrated Di Pietro because his investigation did not shrink 
from indicting even Bettino Craxi, formerly prime minister, now a fugitive from 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi may well have done nothing wrong, but Di Pietro's departure must 
not be allowed to mean that the old Italy has defeated the new, or that the 
prime minister is above the law.

A NOBEL IS NOT A PRECURSOR TO SAINTHOOD; PEACE PRIZE: IT'S POLITICS, OFTEN 
INTENDED TO NUDGE NASCENT RECONCILIATION EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER A. ZHEUTLIN, Peter A. Zheutlin, a communications and editorial 
consultant in Needham, Mass., was director of public affairs for the Nobel 
laureate physicians' group from 1985 to 1993. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres are awarded the Nobel Peace 
Prize in Oslo this weekend, it won't be the first time the prize has been the 
center of a storm of controversy. Of all the Nobel prizes, the peace prize has 
the potential to generate the greatest debate because it is, invariably, linked 
to politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Nobel Peace Prizes of our time stirred extraordinary passion. Henry 
Kissinger and Le Duc Tho of North Vietnam shared the prize in 1973 for 
negotiating an end to a war both had prosecuted with some vigor. In 1985, the 
selection of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War drew 
furious protest because the group's co-president, Yevgeny Chazov, was a 
high-ranking Soviet doctor who in 1972 had signed a letter critical of Andrei 
Sakharov, who was awarded the peace prize in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's choice stirred controversy even before its formal announcement, 
and was followed by a series of events proving just how fragile the Middle East 
peace process is. Within hours of the announcement, an Israeli soldier who had 
been kidnaped by the anti-Arafat Hamas was executed. Within days, the 
Israeli-Jordanian peace accord was signed, a terrorist bomb exploded on a Tel 
Aviv bus killing dozens of civilians, and Syria's President Hafez Assad, 
meeting with President Clinton, appeared to be making small steps toward peace 
with Israel. At the very least, critics said, the choice of Arafat, Rabin and 
Peres was premature.  
</P>
<P>
 While one might quarrel with this year's selection, much of the debate flows 
from misconceptions about the prize itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The first misconception is that the Nobel Peace Prize is a secular form of 
sainthood. There is an implicit expectation that every recipient will be like 
Mother Teresa, a selfless servant without blemishes, contradictions or apparent 
ego. But these characteristics, no matter how appealing, are not prerequisites 
to peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The second misconception is that the peace prize is a reward for good deeds. 
The prize is often a stick, not a carrot, used by the Nobel committee to send 
signals to governments, to rouse public opinion or to give momentum and 
recognition to fledgling efforts at reconciliation.  
</P>
<P>
 In citing the anti-nuclear physicians in 1985, for example, the Nobel 
committee explicitly linked the prize to ongoing disarmament negotiations in 
Geneva, hoping that the recognition of a Soviet-American organization would 
give new urgency to those talks and to an upcoming Reagan/Gorbachev summit.  
</P>
<P>
 With this year's recipients, the committee is recognizing the first fragile 
steps taken by former adversaries. But, more important, the committee is 
encouraging the floundering Middle East peace process forward. The committee's 
decision is, ultimately, a political one, not a moral one.  
</P>
<P>
 A third misconception about the prize involves the selection process itself. 
Though its ultimate choice is usually a closely guarded secret, the Nobel 
committee does not work in hermetic secrecy. It works year-round gathering 
information on nominees and surveying the global political landscape.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee is frequently the target of well-organized campaigns on behalf 
of some nominees. Any member of a national legislature, any previous recipient, 
any professor in the liberal arts and sciences can, with a simple letter, add a 
name to the list. What often lifts names to the top of the list is an 
orchestrated effort to garner the support of luminaries whose opinions may 
carry weight with the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, to be sure, profound moral dimensions to the issues of war and 
peace, but analysis of the peace prize must recognize what it is. It is the 
world's highest political honor, not a free pass through the pearly gates.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE COURTS; QUALIFIED JURISTS OR SAVVY POLITICOS?; TO PRESERVE 
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, ALL JUDGES SHOULD BE APPOINTED; NONE SHOULD HAVE TO RUN 
FOR 'REELECTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM I. ROTHBARD, William I. Rothbard, a Los Angeles lawyer, has served 
as counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and was a candidate for the 
State Assembly this past June. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simpson trial and other sensational Court TV crime cases have focused 
attention as never before on our state court judges. The intense spotlight 
creates an opportunity to raise anew a question: Should judges have to endure 
political-style campaigns to become judges? Many legal and judicial experts 
think not. I share this view, and a recent professional experience confirms it. 
</P>
<P>
 While most judges are appointed by the governor, a quirk in the law requires 
judicial vacancies in gubernatorial election years to be filled by election. 
This finds them running for office countywide, seeking support from millions of 
voters who know virtually nothing about them. In addition, judges who are 
initially appointed must stand for election at the end of their terms. 
</P>
<P>
 I was the election-law attorney for a successful Los Angeles Superior Court 
candidate, a retiring legislator, in litigation with his opponent over the 
accuracy of their ballot statements and ballot titles. Since voters get nearly 
all of their information about judicial candidates from ballot descriptions, 
their accuracy can become the principal battleground in any contested judicial 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 My client will be an outstanding judge. But the fact that his election could 
have hinged on the appeal of a three-word ballot title is precisely what is 
wrong with a system that elects judges by popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining the dignity of our judges is vital to preserving their legitimacy 
and ability to command public respect. Campaigns in which judges must run for 
office like ordinary politicians demean their stature and diminish the 
credibility of our judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 As candidates, for example, judges must raise campaign funds. Most, being 
lawyers, obtain funds from other lawyers. Some of these campaign contributors 
will later appear in the judges' courtrooms seeking relief for their clients. 
The possibility that elected judges could choose to hear contributors' cases 
and rule in favor of their clients without proper disclosure of the 
relationship places them in potentially compromising positions.  
</P>
<P>
 Like ordinary politicians, judicial candidates will use litigation as a weapon 
to gain an advantage over their opponent. Such tactics inevitably draw the 
courts into partisan politics and require them to rule for and against 
competing judicial candidates, one of whom will soon become a colleague. This 
ability to affect the outcome of a judicial election places sitting judges in 
an uncomfortable position, yet it is one into which they are thrust by the 
current system. 
</P>
<P>
 Such litigation also can produce court findings that one or both of the 
candidates have been "guilty" of misleading the public. Judges must be above 
suspicion. A victorious judicial candidate who was found to have misled the 
voters during the campaign -- even if the court's ruling was wrong or 
questionable -- would take the bench with a permanent stain on his record.  
</P>
<P>
 Like ordinary politicians, judicial candidates and their campaign handlers 
also must work the media, exploiting and putting the best possible spin on 
campaign issues, including election-related court rulings. In short, judicial 
candidates must lower themselves and endure the indignities of an ordinary 
political campaign to achieve a position in society that should be above 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to change the laws that require our state court judges to run for 
office. All judges should be appointed by the governor on a bipartisan basis. 
The appointments would be recommended by a panel appointed by the governor, 
Assembly Speaker, Senate president and state Supreme Court chief justice. 
Judges should not be required to run for "reelection." They should serve fixed 
terms of sufficiently long duration to ensure adequate independence and 
opportunity for professional growth and service. At the end of their terms, 
their qualifications for further service would be examined by the independent 
review panel. The governor then would have the option of reappointing a judge 
or naming another person from the independent candidate pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring public faith in government can only be helped by removing our judges 
from politics and placing them above the fray. Judge Lance Ito, who is 
presiding over the O.J. Simpson murder trial, was appointed. Let's guarantee 
that the judges who try the big cases of the future also will be picked for 
their qualifications, not for their popular three-word ballot titles.

O.C. THEATER REVIEWS; YOUNG CAST VENTURES ENTHUSIASTICALLY INTO 'TOYLAND' 
</P>

 Victor Herbert's "Babes in Toyland" is such a classic that some of its 
melodies seem a part of everyone's youth. The charming nursery-rhyme characters 
bring back memories of childhood's first picture books and the discovery of 
what an adventure reading can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Perry and Ann Smit's adaptation for youth theater retains all that 
wonder, and Newport Theatre Arts Center's staging, directed by Terri Miller 
Schmidt, gives the classic that fresh look that only the enthusiasm of its 
young performers can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are the usual hesitancies of the very youngest cast members, 
some of whom watch the audience watching them -- but their reactions add to the 
sense of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest laugh of the show -- and it's a big one -- when Bo Peep's (an 
adorable Jessica Stewart) tiny lost sheep finally turn up, is worth all of 
Schmidt's patience and inventiveness. It's an irresistible surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The older teen-age members of the company, who play the leads and other 
central figures, all give good performances, but some stand out. Corrine Hart 
is delightful as Jane, the girl whose parakeet has flown away and leads her and 
her friends on their greatest adventure away from the toy factory. But it is 
Stephen Garber as Tom Tom who is most notable for his very believable 
characterization and a fine singing voice, particularly in his solo "Jane." He 
and Hart lead everyone vocally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good vocal turns also are well-handled by Leslie Holland as the beleaguered 
Widow Piper, Maureen Marks as the moth Queen Luna (who is be-webbed in the 
Valley of Spiders), and David Rivera as Roderigo, a henchman of Uncle Barnaby, 
who runs the toy factory and has lured three of the Widow's children away to 
sell as toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Young, wearing too much makeup, doesn't need that help. He's the perfect 
Toyland villain, whose sneers and grimaces effectively disguise his youth.

O.C. THEATER REVIEWS; 'CAROL' AN INVESTMENT YULE NOT REGRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dickens Lite comes nicely packaged in South Coast Repertory's 15th annual 
production of "A Christmas Carol." The show has all the Yuletide trimmings: 
radiant party scenes, sentimental warmth, holiday music and, of course, a 
glowing tale of moral transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Landon Jr. is back for his perennial star turn as Ebenezer Scrooge, 
playing the world's nastiest penny pincher with the ease of a practiced meanie. 
His bony face, minus last year's grizzly white beard, conveys with a single 
frown all we need to know about this hardhearted "miser's miser." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Scrooge's conversion to Christmas benefactor strains credulity in this 
production, there is a generous dramatic payoff for audiences willing to 
suspend their disbelief. Cynics may also take pleasure from the show, even if 
they're left cold by his discovery that charity and kindness are not "Bah! 
Humbug!" after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Under John-David Keller's sharp direction, a large cast in full Victorian 
regalia fills out the stage with spirited performances. The magical set, 
abetted by atmospheric lighting and a vivid sound design, offers special 
effects guaranteed to entertain adults while scaring the daylights out of small 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern California institution by now, SCR's "A Christmas Carol" ranks as a 
cultural rite of passage as surely as grad night at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Landon, a polished contingent of SCR veterans is back to reprise their 
roles: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ron Boussom nearly steals the show with his theatrical ebullience as the 
prankish Spirit of Christmas Present; Don Took plays Marley's Ghost like a 
tormented creature from the bottom of the sea; and Richard Doyle personifies 
foppish elegance as the Spirit of Christmas Past. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Ellington portrays Bob Cratchit with adept comic whimsy; Art Koustik 
doubles as the cunning street merchant Joe and the jovial party host Mr. 
Fezziwig; Howard Shangraw depicts Scrooge's nephew Fred with a friendly air of 
refinement; Devon Raymond sketches in the attractive Belle with a few deft 
strokes; and director Keller pulls his weight on stage as a solicitor, 
portrayed with his usual elan. 
</P>
<P>
 But please take note: It is far better to see this show surrounded by an 
audience full of unruly kids than circumspect adults. Whatever the distractions 
caused by wailing toddlers or youngsters who giggle at every line, they are 
nothing compared to the deathly silence of a corporate audience. 
</P>
<P>
 On opening night, when the house looked like a sea of suits and sequins, the 
evening seemed oddly low-key -- as though energy was being drained off by 
playgoers, who needed a cattle prod to wake them up. 
</P>

SERVING SOME SENTIMENT, STRAIGHT UP OR WITH A TWIST; 'HOME FIRE': THE OTHER 
SIDE OF FAMILY GATHERING 
</P>

 Some Christmas plays are heartwarming. Others are rib-tickling. Still others 
are time-wasting. Here are reviews of just a few of the holiday-themed 
theatrical offerings in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you're sick of "Jingle Bells" and can't bear to see another "Christmas 
Carol" for as long as you live, Marion Gallo's "Home Fire" is the perfect play 
for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Jingle Bells" -- merrily sung by Rosemary Clooney, Jose Carreras and 
Bing Crosby -- serves as crazed counterpoint to scenes that get loonier and 
darker and funnier, as every possible buried family secret surfaces at one 
Christmas get-together in Brooklyn. The confessions come fast and furious once 
Rocco (John Gallucci), a fed-up son, takes a gun to his own extended family, 
forcing a confrontation between his coddled brother Danny (James DiStefano) and 
his overbearing, nasty mother Mary (Vera Lockwood).  
</P>
<P>
 Just the anticipation of seeing his family for the holidays throws poor 
Danny's back out. "They know how to push every button!" he tells his wife, 
Laura (Mary VanArsdel, also played by Nanci Christopher), who is an object of 
fascination for the family because she sees a therapist. "And they know where 
they are too," she answers, "because they installed them!" 
</P>
<P>
 While Danny, a photographer, is still carrying the burden of being Mama's 
favorite, his brother Rocco relishes his bad-boy role despite a wife and two 
constantly-fighting-because-they're-sexually-attracted-to-each-other teen-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the play at Theatre West opens with Rocco delivering a monologue 
actually in flagrante with one of his several mistresses. A sense of 
riotousness begins there and grows throughout the evening, which, though a bit 
long, is refreshingly honest about just how sick families can be. 
</P>
<P>
 In his black leather jacket, Gallucci (also the show's producer) fairly drips 
testosterone as the unrepentant male who likes to remind all his lovers, 
including his wife (Barbara Goodson), that he needs to be free. DiStefano is 
completely believable as Rocco's completely different brother, and his reactive 
comic timing is wonderful (sometimes reminiscent of Joe Pesci's) in such 
interesting situations as listening to Rocco's dream in which Farrah Fawcett 
urinates on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo directs with an eye for truthfulness as merciless as her pen, and with 
great energy. Her cast, some of which changes from night to night, bites into 
its assorted venalities with healthy appetites. "Home Fire" is a go-for-broke 
evening of dysfunctionality that, because of its candor, manages to be more 
revivifying than the load of pious family fare we will no doubt be served up 
this year, as ever. God Bless America.

THEATER REVIEWS; IN DICKENS LEDGER, 'SCROOGE' HAS DEBITS, CREDITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

 There are so many adaptations of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" today, including 
ones with Muppets and Mickey Mouse, that a purist has no choice but to accept 
the changes by writers who think they can do the job better than the original 
author. 
</P>
<P>
 But let your rewrites be consistent. Leslie Bricusse's musical version of 
"Scrooge," by Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera, correctly has Christmas Present (a 
fine, robust Pat Ikerd) answer Scrooge's question about the spirit's family by 
explaining that he has 1,854 brothers. Yet one of them in this production is 
played by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring Dickens' explicit description of Christmas Past as a muscular young 
man with very long white hair, Michelle Darrah plays the role delightfully with 
a tinkling voice and feather-light movement. She's one of the bright holiday 
lights in the production. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hampered by Bricusse's rather dull score, which at moments seems as 
though it's trying to be by Lionel Bart, director Tim Kashani's staging is 
vigorous and pulls the heartstrings at all the right moments. Joshua Carr's 
musical direction almost brings a few of the tunes to life, but sometimes vocal 
shyness in the singers defeats him. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment when all the ingredients come together is in the show's best 
number, "The Beautiful Day," conducted with great heart and sung impeccably and 
assuredly by John Haworth, one of the most effective Tiny Tims we've seen in a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fine Scrooge of Chris Sands is kinetic and has a slight sense of 
sensitivity beneath a crusty exterior that works just fine. He also dances and 
sings with energy and aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Silva's Bob Cratchit has the proper obstinate cheerfulness and optimism, 
and Ron Lipp's soup peddler Tom Jenkins is Dickensian enough for a dozen 
rewritten "Carols." Lipp's powerful voice and understanding of the period look 
and vocal feel of his "Thank You Very Much" is one of the highlights of the 
staging. 
</P>
<P>
 Kashani's use of Kabuki-like Coachmen in black tricorns and Inverness coats is 
very effective and gives the production style, which, sadly, some of the 
supporting cast is not able to do. 
</P>

 GARDEN GROVE -- For the fourth consecutive year (at the Gem Theatre this 
time), Sal and Amanda Gecko, lounge lizards extraordinaire, are inviting you 
into their tinseled living room to celebrate the season. 
</P>
<P>
 As they eagerly await an invitation to play Vegas on New Year's Eve, the 
Geckos share their dreams, their disappointments and their nightclub act with 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't share any of their well-stocked bar, but "Jack Daniels nipping at 
the nose" aptly describes the state of mind and humor of our over-the-top 
holiday host and hostess. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it purports to be a sendup of maudlin specials and bad nightclub acts, 
"Christmas With Sal and Amanda Gecko" is too toothless to be satirical and, try 
as one might, it's hard to outdo the originals, which have become parodies of 
themselves over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sal and Amanda, George Quick and Beth Hansen camp it up in outrageous wigs 
and costumes that go Dolly Parton and your weird Uncle Bob one better. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed up by Terry Alaric on piano and Randy Woltz on drums, they do an 
accomplished job of singing badly, sliding around those pitches like sledders 
on freshly fallen snow. Hansen embellishes her longer notes with a vibrato like 
a jackhammer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both performers display considerable musical talent and charisma. But even 
their generous performances cannot beef up the thinness of the material, which 
might constitute a cute skit but stretches to the breaking point over an hour 
and 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience seemed to enjoy the Geckos even though there were no new jokes 
after the first couple of songs. For that matter, there are no "new" jokes at 
all -- just a familiar foolishness and a sloppy sentimentality that probably 
would be enhanced by a couple of stiff eggnogs before the show.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you can still get a warm, gooey feeling from "A Christmas Carol" or the 
Grinch, "Christmas With Sal and Amanda Gecko" may not be your cup of wassail. A 
certain adult jadedness is prerequisite for appreciating Sal and Amanda. My 
young companion just didn't get any of it and finally gave up and fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEWS; AT HOME ALL OVER THE MAP; LA HABRA DEPOT'S SONGFEST HAS A 
COZY, SMALL-TOWN FEEL DESPITE MEANDERING IN TIME AND FROM PLACE TO PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The very site of the La Habra Depot Theatre -- the town's former train station 
-- tells you that the style here is quintessential small-town America, and the 
company's Yuletide show, "Christmas at the Depot," fits right in. But even 
small-town America can get a bit loopy at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the hand of director-choreographer Larry Watts, various ensembles from 
adults to kids regale us with an eclectic program of Christmas songs. But this 
isn't just a show of chorales and solos-in-place (though there is a lot of 
that). It seems to be taking place in someone's home, cheerily designed by 
Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose home is not clear. At first it seems to belong to the extended family of 
adults and kids, but then it is taken over by Santa and Mrs. Claus (played, 
we're told, by themselves) and the elves. Even odder, after a 20-minute Act I 
and a 15-minute intermission, Act II has a teen ensemble dressed in Victorian 
garb singing such pop standards as "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" 
to musical director Patrick Copeland's pre-taped, jazz-based arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacing problems jingle along with the anachronisms: We have to jump, for 
instance, right from a medley of sacred songs into "Reindeer Rap," with Santa 
in shades. Timed differently and placed elsewhere, it could have been funny. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is still cute, especially with the toddlers (as young as 3) gamely 
singing "The Little Drummer Boy." On the other end of the spectrum, singers 
Nicki Peek and Lynette Deveraux seduce Mr. Claus amusingly with "Santa Baby," 
while Denise Hadland brings all the kitsch and small-town mood to a halt with a 
serious, moving rendition of the "Carol of the Bells." 
</P>

CLUB REVIEW; 50 BUCKS OFFERS MUSIC AND AN ART SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some clubs want to be underground, but it takes more than an unlisted phone 
number to qualify. Downtown's 50 Bucks, a performance space/art gallery 
connected to a Latino pool hall, is the genuine article.Not only does it carry 
on the underground tradition of good music, questionable location and bathrooms 
bordering on the scary, but the performances are also unannounced. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Club-goers show up en masse each time Rolo, the artist who runs 50 
Bucks, puts on a show. 
</P>
<P>
 Thematically, 50 Bucks lies somewhere between "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate 
Factory" and "Brazil." Silver-wrapped air ducts wind across the room's ceiling, 
while colorful underground poster art hangs on the walls and decorates the 
stage area.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Rolo doesn't exactly advertise events, he designs a limited run of 
hand-printed flyers for each. Those who caught a recent $2 show at 50 Bucks 
were treated to L.A. alternative bands Bob Sled, TVTV$ and Red Five -- who 
signed with Interscope Records last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjacent pool hall, Licha's Santa Fe Grill, provides the bonus of bringing 
together different cultures. While pool hall regulars stop by the gallery to 
hear some of L.A.'s top young bands, Licha's jukebox offers a who's who of 
Latino music to scenesters taking a break from the gallery's happenings. The 
cultural show and tell isn't going unrecognized by 50 Bucks. While upcoming 
punk shows include Youth Brigade, Wool and Lutefisk, a night of Latino ska 
bands is also in the works. Figuring out when is up to you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 50 Bucks at Licha's Santa Fe Grill, 2059 E. 7th St . 18 and over, $2 cover.

JAZZ REVIEW; LLOYD'S RICH TENOR SAX IS BACK IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When personal reasons prompted tenor saxophonist Charles Lloyd to take a 
sudden, and lengthy, hiatus from the jazz scene in 1969, he was a bona fide 
star. In those days, he was known to both jazz and pop fans as a dynamic 
improviser and composer who was one of the most expressive and interesting 
disciples of the great John Coltrane. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd is now clearly back -- he re-emerged in the early '80s, but it's only in 
the last five years that he's been steadily active. And, while he may not yet 
be the major figure he once was, he is decidedly a masterful, and important, 
musician, one who plays in a unique and distinctive manner that still sometimes 
shows echoes of Coltrane. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing billing with Cedar Walton's first-rate trio, Lloyd opened his first 
Los Angeles club date in more than 20 years Tuesday at Catalina Bar & Grill and 
was in complete command of his milieu. With his tone alternately rich and 
powerful then delicate and wispy, he wooed a sparse yet enthusiastic crowd with 
music that was often compelling and thrilling, delivering riveting solos that 
regularly built to dramatic peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was a sterling example of acoustic jazz that straddles the 
fence between freedom and structure, where melody is king but is now and then 
deposed by chaos. The audience was mostly with Lloyd, often reacting gustily 
with laughs, shouts of joy and plain head-bobbing. But occasionally listeners 
appeared distracted when the saxman played long passages that lacked center. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd, 56, and his cohorts -- the estimable pianist Walton, drum master Billy 
Higgins and solid bassist David Williams -- offered a deftly balanced program 
of lyrical originals, drawn mainly from "Acoustic Masters I," an album the 
foursome made last year for Atlantic Records. On the softer tunes such as "Lady 
Day," Lloyd played tenderly, then suddenly dropped in volatile outbursts. On 
the up-tempo cooker "Hommage," he comprised his solo of swoops, shouts and 
lines with hard rhythmic punch. His classic "Forest Flower" was a highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton's threesome flawlessly supported Lloyd, and Higgins more than once 
anticipated a Lloyd ascent toward a climax, prodding and pushing the 
saxophonist, who responded with rapid sprays of colorful notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charles Lloyd, with Cedar Walton's trio, continues tonight through Sunday, 9 
and 11 p.m., at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood.

TV REVIEW; HANDSOME 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' BALLET ON A&E 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problems of creating a full-evening ballet from "A Christmas Carol" seem 
obvious, but Northern Ballet Theatre develops resourceful strategies in a 
handsome BBC production airing twice tonight on A&E cable. 
</P>
<P>
 With no significant ballerina role and a miserly leading character who feels 
like dancing only at the very end, Charles Dickens' tale doesn't lend itself to 
classical choreography -- and Massimo Moricone doesn't force the issue. 
Instead, he defines Scrooge through pantomime, then has him move through a 
world (and memories) of dancing: formal yet lively social dances as well as 
rowdy, musical comedy-style numbers, plus a few none-too-impressive ballet 
interludes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the cast keeps making good on the work's title by showing its 
prowess at choral singing, with the score by Carl Davis also incorporating 
plenty of familiar seasonal ditties in its instrumental passages. Tiny Tim 
(Ryan Ward) is a boy soprano in this version and Cratchit (William Walker) as 
adept at caroling as he is at high-flying batterie.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Jeremy Kerridge's portrayal of Scrooge remains way off base: 
crudely monstrous in the opening scenes, then dissolving immediately into 
mindless sentimentality after viewing the supernatural lessons conjured up for 
his benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The defective, incomplete review tape supplied by A&E contained only a 
fragment of the Christmas Future sequence, but enough remained of the final 
scene to display Kerridge's prowess at twitchy, eccentric character dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a stage production that boasted an atmospheric, revolving, two-level 
set by Lez Brotherston, the ballet has been adapted for television with an 
emphasis on spectral effects. Director Kriss Rusmanis often uses close-ups to 
enlarge performances that would look over-the-top even if you were sitting in 
the third balcony and the flow of the dancing is frequently lost as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 But the British company always looks spirited and well-schooled, and Rusmanis 
does preserve the staging's emphasis on the plight of the poor, a problem not 
to be resolved by just one miser's conversion. 
</P>
<P>

A&E cable.

ART REVIEWS; CHICKENS, POLLO-DOH IN OLIVERI'S TENDERHEARTED ANARCHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't often that a visitor is greeted at the gallery door by two dozen 
squawking chickens -- much less chickens whose feathers have been colored 
lavender, baby pink, soft green and lemon sherbet. Welcome to Michael Oliveri's 
be-fowled sensorium at Crossing Gallery, full of edible pastels, rustling 
sawdust and pungent odors wafting indelicately through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Less interested in making a spectacle of the chickens than of himself, Oliveri 
uses them as instruments of an elaborately infantile spoof. Under his wild-eyed 
supervision, they go on a metaphorical journey from happy-go-lucky barnyard 
beasts into the absurd stuff of art, and live to tell the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 This mildly but determinedly psychotic installation/performance adheres to a 
strict scenario. Oliveri begins with packaged poultry purchased at the 
supermarket. He loads them into the "chicken cannon ejector," a gleaming 
apparatus located on the gallery's ground floor. The dead birds are then shot 
up to the laboratory-cum-factory on the second floor, where they are separated 
and loaded into the "ACME Pollo-Doh Converter," which pulverizes them into 
sculpting material: Pollo-Doh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pollo-Doh is stored in tanks and dispensed (quite like frozen yogurt) into 
cans, by day-laborers wearing official Pollo-Doh jumpsuits. After being sealed, 
the cans are sent back down a chute to the first floor, where they are 
displayed in the gallery window as pasteurized and homogenized art for the 
masses, at $60 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pollo-Doh is glop processed from chickens (and of course it really isn't; 
the hens are dumped upstairs, and replaced by a dry-wall compound), this 
project similarly grinds things up and reconceives them: Jeffrey Vallance's 
"Blinky the Friendly Hen," Piero Manzoni's signed and numbered cans of artist's 
excrement, Paul McCarthy by way of Jason Rhoades. 
</P>
<P>
 Like McCarthy, Oliveri seems to have a mean streak. But in the end, Oliveri's 
nastiness is all show: The chickens have been saved from the slaughterhouse, 
are colored with nontoxic food dye and are well cared for. This is 
tenderhearted anarchy, a relief, a contradiction in terms and provocative 
enough to pique an interest in this artist's still-nascent ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crossing Gallery, 1104 S. La Cienega, (310) 358-9359, through Dec. 17.

 Fostering Dialogue: An exhibition relating to a major public art program, 
"Cultural Explainers: Portals, Bridges and Gateways," is now on view at the 
Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC). The exhibition consists of 
architectural models, photographs and texts that elucidate the physical 
structures and the working philosophy of an ambitious work-in-progress, 
organized by SPARC and ADOBE L.A., a group of Latino artists, designers and 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural Explainers" was conceived in the aftermath of the 1992 riots, as a 
way to foster dialogue among L.A.'s disparate ethnic communities, specifically 
those hardest hit by the events: Korean Americans, African Americans and Latino 
Americans. Through workshops, the members of these communities have interacted 
with artists named by SPARC to collaborate on three large-scale public 
monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 The monuments will be exchanged among the communities they are designed to 
represent, before being installed in permanent sites (yet to be determined) in 
Koreatown, Pico-Union and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Cultural Explainers" monuments take very specific forms. The Koreatown 
structure, which is to be built first, will mimic a traditional pyong poong , 
or folding screen. The Pico-Union monument is inspired by the Pre-Columbian 
Mayan arches found in Southern Mexico and Central America. The South-Central 
L.A. monument will consist of 12 poles akin to the ancestral poles in Yoruba 
culture. All three will incorporate reliefs, panels or tiles bearing images 
relating to the history of the community in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiculturalism, as conceived here, is a highly romantic proposition, with 
its embrace of Otherness and emphasis on elective affinities. To refer to these 
monuments as portals, bridges and gateways is to promulgate yet another 
romantic metaphor -- this time, for cross-cultural understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the valuable collaborative processes undergone, this project begs the 
question of its own Utopianism. What kind of art object can explain one culture 
to another? Such an object, no matter how necessary, is likely an idealist 
fiction. 
</P>

<P>
 Over-the-Top: The title of Terri Friedman's new show at Sue Spaid Fine Art is 
like a tabloid headline from which you try to avert your eyes, but find -- 
horrified -- that you cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunny von Bulow is Still Alive!" Friedman fervently proclaims. At once Von 
Bulow's champion and a dazzlingly creative parasite, sucking what life remains 
out of this 14-year coma victim, Friedman displays a flair for exploitation 
matched only by a knack for finely festooned fussiness. Everything here is way, 
way over-the-top. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rubens chronicled the triumph of Maria de' Medici in his famous cycle of 
paintings, Friedman chronicles the tragi-comedy of this moribund heiress in a 
series of fantastic assemblages. These are gorgeous to the point of gagging, 
full of glitter, beads, gold leaf, mirrors and cut glass, with pink fluorescent 
light to perk up the gallery's ghastly pallor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagging isn't a problem, of course: These pieces come fully equipped, much 
like the room at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in which Von Bulow has long 
been ensconced. Life-sustaining substances are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 These include air blown from a black-and-white striped fan into a series of 
black-and-white striped shopping bags, affixed to the fan by a network of 
artfully twisted black-and-white striped wire (an homage to the salubrious 
effects of shopping at Henri Bendel's); and sparkling water, an essential fluid 
for those enamored of glitz, which flows through plastic tubes snaking across 
the floor into an oversized hospital beaker, bubbling with yet more of the 
glittering stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement that accompanies the show, Friedman describes Von Bulow as a 
"decorated living corpse," freshly dressed and made-up each morning. Friedman's 
fascination with the Von Bulow story is easily explained: It allows her an out 
for work that otherwise might be praised as meticulously crafted and exquisite, 
but rather vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 The gambit works, if you are willing to discount the tastelessness of it all. 
Certainly someone who could create "Sunny Sideways With Oxygen," which features 
an electrically induced sunrise, repeated rhythmically until the plug is 
pulled, is loath to consider anything so boring as good taste. Her 
shamelessness is embarrassingly seductive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sue Spaid Fine Art, 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd., (213) 935-6153, through Dec. 24.

 A Glance Back: "CoBrA Revisited," at Jack Rutberg Fine Arts, features 
paintings, drawings and prints produced over a 40-year span by artists once 
associated with this post-war European movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1948 as one of the many splinter groups of the international 
Surrealist movement, CoBrA (whose name is derived from Co penhagen, Br ussels 
and A msterdam) lasted a scant three years, before evolving into the Movement 
for an Imaginist Bauhaus, which itself eventually transmuted into the 
better-known (if equally doomed) Situationist International. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascinating historically -- especially when counter-posed to the monolithic 
"triumph of American painting," which occurred at the same moment -- this 
parade of overlapping, decomposing, European avant-gardes boasts very 
interesting work. The most important member of CoBrA, Asger Jorn, is an obscure 
figure in this country. His paintings conjure those of Jackson Pollock in terms 
of their masses of color and nervous doodling; his tendency toward a perverse 
ornamentalism, however, is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jorn, Corneille is rarely exhibited here, though he is currently enjoying 
a renaissance in Europe. His obsessively patterned surfaces and faux naivete 
suggest Dubuffet crossed with Peter Max. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more familiar are Karel Appel and Pierre Alechinsky. The former's 
exuberant canvases are remarkably consistent, whether paint is pulled over the 
surface, as thick and delicious as taffy, or whether the surface is composed of 
a patchwork of brightly colored pieces of felt. Alechinsky is amply 
represented, and offers the stand-out works: a series of antique stock 
certificates overlaid with calligraphic flourishes, which reconcile Conceptual 
art with unrepentant decoration and feel wonderfully, surprisingly new. 
</P>

 Some Christmas plays are heartwarming. Others are rib-tickling. Still others 
are time-wasting. Here are reviews of just a few of the holiday-themed 
theatrical offerings in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sal and Amanda Gecko, lounge lizards extraordinaire, invite you into their 
tinseled living room to celebrate the season. As they eagerly await an 
invitation to play Vegas on New Year's Eve, the Geckos share their dreams, 
their disappointments and their nightclub act with the audience at the Gem 
Theatre in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't share any of their well-stocked bar, but "Jack Daniels nipping at 
the nose" aptly describes the state of mind and humor of our over-the-top 
holiday hosts in "Christmas With Sal and Amanda Gecko." 
</P>
<P>
 As Sal and Amanda, George Quick and Beth Hansen camp it up in outrageous wigs 
and costumes that go Dolly Parton and your weird Uncle Bob one better. Backed 
up by Terry Alaric on piano and Randy Woltz on drums, they do an accomplished 
job of singing badly, sliding around those pitches like sledders on freshly 
fallen snow. Hansen embellishes her longer notes with a vibrato like a 
jackhammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the performers can't beef up the material, which might constitute a 
cute skit but stretches to the breaking point here. There are no new jokes 
after the first couple of songs. 
</P>

Grove. Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m.; Sunday matinees at 2:30. Ends Dec . 18.

 Pocket-sized, with a shoestring budget and an uneven cast, "Miracle on 34th 
Street" at the tiny Actors Workout Studio, won't make anyone forget that other 
"Miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 The adaptation of Valentine Davies' book, written by Tom Hall (who directs) 
and LL Young, is faithful enough, covering the high points -- the hiring of 
mysterious Kris Kringle (veteran actor Bennes Mardenn, who looks remarkably 
authentic) as Macy's Santa, the burgeoning romance between practical Doris 
(Laura Lynne Young) and idealistic lawyer Fred (Nick McGuire), Kris' 
confrontation with store psychologist Mr. Sawyer (Victor Nawrocki), the 
conversion of little Susan (Rachel Alice) from pragmatist to dreamer and the 
Santa sanity hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 With the actors at varying levels of experience, however, and not yet 
comfortable with the play's dialogue, the proceedings at a recent matinee were 
more earnest than involving. It wasn't until the courtroom climax, with its 
case-clinching mail delivery, that the cast rallied as an ensemble and worked 
up some true holiday cheer.

 Some Christmas plays are heartwarming. Others are rib-tickling. Still others 
are time-wasting. Here are reviews of just a few of the holiday-themed 
theatrical offerings in Southern California. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 "Yuletide Stories," a trio of one-acts at the Burbage Theatre, isn't likely to 
kindle much holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 While each of these playlets from Zeitgeist Theatre Company is based on a 
Christmas theme, only one could credibly be called a story. Perhaps "Seasonal 
Situations" didn't have the same ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The best by far is Elias Stimac's charming "Wonderful Life." Beth (Jill 
Greenwood) is a worldly novelist bumped from a holiday flight home, Timothy 
(Stimac) a nebbishy ticket agent who invites himself to her hotel room to cheer 
her up. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a corny and obvious setup. But Stimac's unassuming nature, as both writer 
and actor, is completely disarming. He gives Timothy a winning mix of innocence 
(he still gets excited by Christmas trees and eggnog) and shrewdness (he 
deliberately bumped Beth from that flight). Unfortunately, Jillian Twigger's 
direction lacks pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Stimac fares less well with his script for "A-Carolling," a vexingly pointless 
sketch about three young women who go caroling to meet eligible bachelors. 
Their jaunt is punctuated by lots of arguing and complaining, all in laborious 
preparation for a throwaway punch line. Dana Vitatoe directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to Stimac's contemporary work, Lucy Lee Flippin's "Three Ships" looks out 
of place -- a feminist comedy set in a medieval British castle. Three 
ladies-in-waiting celebrate Christmas with their wise and wisecracking mentor, 
Ute (Flippin). Flippin, who also directed, should have stuck to a simpler idea 
and a more familiar context. 
</P>

 Dickens Lite comes nicely packaged in South Coast Repertory's 15th annual 
production of "A Christmas Carol." The show has all the Yuletide trimmings: 
radiant party scenes, sentimental warmth, holiday music and, of course, a 
glowing tale of moral transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Landon Jr. is back for his perennial star turn as Ebenezer Scrooge, 
playing the world's nastiest penny-pincher with the ease of a practiced meanie. 
His bony face, minus last year's grizzly white beard, conveys with a single 
frown all we need to know about this hardhearted "miser's miser." 
</P>
<P>
 Under John-David Keller's sharp direction, a large cast in full Victorian 
regalia fills out the stage with spirited performances. The magical set, 
abetted by atmospheric lighting and a vivid sound design, offers special 
effects guaranteed to entertain adults while scaring the daylights out of small 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern California institution by now, SCR's "A Christmas Carol" ranks as a 
cultural rite of passage as surely as grad night at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Christmas Carol," South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa 
Mesa. Tuesdays-Fridays, 7:30 p.m., Saturdays, 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays, noon

 Some Christmas plays are heartwarming. Others are rib-tickling. Still others 
are time-wasting. Here are reviews of just a few of the holiday-themed 
theatrical offerings in Southern California. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Here's a Christmas comedy for the age of the daytime talk show: "The X-Mas 
Files," in which eight very articulate, anthropomorphized reindeer take the 
stage to discuss the terrible scandal that has so polarized opinions at the 
North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Children should not read this review, let alone see this show. Santa Claus has 
been more than naughty; he's accused of raping Vixen and molesting Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Goode's series of monologues is tasteless, of course, but it's also 
wickedly funny for those who can drop their defenses. And most of it is acted 
with such conviction in Allison Gendreau's staging at Hudson BackStage that you 
might start to take it seriously -- until you remember who we're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that the reindeer are such a varied lot -- as expressed in their 
costumes as well as their performances. It might help even more if the play 
were crowned with testimony from the Fat Boy (in Dasher's words) himself. 
Although Comet mounts a brief defense of Santa, generally this show will make 
you want to plug up your chimney on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The X-Mas Files," Hudson BackStage, 6539 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Dec. 20, 8 p.m. $7. (213) 851-4355. Running time: 1 
hour, 25 minutes. DON SHIRLEY

SPOTLIGHT; ALL THE TRIMMINGS; THE HOLIDAY ENTERTAINMENT LARDER IS LADEN WITH 
STAPLES, AND A FEW EXOTIC TREATS ADD SPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Edition staff.

<P>
 For most people, holidays equal tradition -- and that holds just as true for 
public events as it does for private rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 So if it's Yuletide in Orange County, that must mean boat parades and choral 
con certs, another round of "The Glory of Christmas" at the Crystal Cathedral 
and more productions of the "Nutcracker" than you can shake a toe shoe at. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few new choices this time around, however, most notably on the 
theater scene. So, not only is there the perennial "A Christmas Carol" at South 
Coast Repertory, with the wonderful Hal Landon Jr. returning as Scrooge, but 
there is also "Inspecting Carol" at Laguna Playhouse, in which a small 
theater's production of the Dickens classic devolves into a living illustration 
of chaos theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sampling of holiday treats around the county, with selections to 
satisfy the tastes of both the tradition-minded and those in search of 
something new. A broader list of upcoming shows can be found in the Holiday 
Events section of the 11-Day Calendar, beginning on page 32. Stage  
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Sullivan, head of the respected Seattle Repertory Theatre and chief 
author of "Inspecting Carol," claims he loves "A Christmas Carol" -- but 
there's no denying that his play pokes some fun at the venerable holiday 
chestnut, at least as performed by the fictitious Soapbox Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggling company is hoping its 13th offering of the play will bring back 
some of its dwindling audience, and is also counting on a sizable government 
grant. The plot thickens when a neophyte actor who auditions for the production 
is mistaken for an undercover NEA official come to check out the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Hedden plays the neophyte, Wayne Wellacre, in the Laguna Playhouse 
production of the play, which Times reviewer Jan Herman called "hands down the 
funniest show I've seen all year."  
</P>
<P>
 Hedden's experience with a variety of local theater groups helps him relate to 
the disastrous goings-on in "Inspecting Carol." "Some of the characters in the 
play are not too far from people I have worked with over the years," Hedden 
said. He recalls one children's theater group in particular "that was very, 
very similar to the Soapbox . . . (with) a lot of weird, demented people who 
make you wonder how they all got there at the same time. It's like a bad 
Fellini movie." 
</P>
<P>
 The play operates on several levels, he said, with sharply written farce that 
works for a general audience and lots of in-humor that works "if you're a 
theater person or have any theater involvement." It has been a big hit, he 
said: "Every night is just a rip, a sterling audience." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone wants the real thing, there is, of course, SCR's "Carol," a fixture 
that may trail only the Laguna Beach Pageant of the Masters as an Orange County 
performance tradition. This year, "Carol" (first produced at SCR in 1980) will 
be joined by something new, a musical play by Octavio Solis called "La Posada 
Magica" that will begin previews on the theater's Second Stage on Friday. The 
regular run is Wednesday through Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The world premiere -- which received $120,000 in grants from the Lila 
Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund -- is the second play by Solis to be produced on 
SCR's Second Stage. The first, "Man of the Flesh," was developed through the 
company's Hispanic Playwrights Project. His "Scrappers" has toured local 
schools as part of an SCR outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Posada Magica," which includes a dozen songs by Marcos Loya, tells the 
story of a rebellious teen-age girl who no longer feels the Christmas spirit 
but finds a surprising renewal of hope. The play is based loosely on the posada 
, a traditional Latin American neighborhood procession that re-creates the 
story of Mary and Joseph's search for an inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis told The Times that the play is "for people who feel they've been left 
behind by Christmas. . . . 'La Posada Magica' requires a childlike imagination 
to buy into it." SCR spokesman Cris Gross said that, in addition to the Second 
Stage production, the play will be performed at three locations in Orange 
County for community audiences. He said the plan is to make "La Posada" a 
perennial addition to the holiday slate. 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime holiday stage tradition was lost when GroveShakespeare bit the 
dust last year. However, "A Child's Christmas in Wales" has been resurrected in 
more modest form as "A Welsh Christmas," staged readings of the Dylan Thomas 
story along with songs, poems and stories, on Sunday and Monday. Many of the 
cast members from the GroveShakespeare production will take part, including 
Gary Bell, Marnie Crosson and Danny Oberbeck. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar vein is a Shakespeare Orange County production called "A 
Shakespearean Christmas," with sonnets and songs. It plays Dec. 15 through 22. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there's "The Glory of Christmas," Crystal Cathedral's 
high-tech pageant spectacle, which retells the story of Christ's birth with 
flying angels and live animals -- horses, camels and sheep, to be specific. It 
plays through Dec. 30.

</P>
<P>
 Holiday parades in Orange County often have an aquatic nature, as in the 
Newport Harbor Boat Parade -- now in its 86th year. The 2 1/2-hour parade 
features about 200 boats, from canoes to luxury yachts, festooned with lights 
and often elaborately decorated. This year, the parade (beginning nightly at 
6:30 p.m.) runs Dec. 17 through 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade is visible from many points on the harbor, but grandstand seating 
is available. Tickets are $5 to $7. 
</P>
<P>
 Other boat parades are set in Dana Point, Huntington Harbour and even in Yorba 
Linda's East Lake Village. On land, there's the Laguna Niguel Holiday Parade 
with gymnast Peter Vidmar as grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Niguel parade begins at 10 a.m. Saturday and travels Crown Valley 
Parkway from Nueva Vista to Crown Valley Community Park. Featured will be drill 
teams, equestrian units and more than 15 marching bands. A festival with game 
and food booths and entertainment runs Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. at the park, 29751 Crown Valley Parkway. Admission is free. For 
information, call (714) 550-4636, Ext. 426. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art will offer its version of La Posada on Dec. 
18 at 6:30 p.m., with music and storytelling. The museum is at 2002 N. Main 
St., Santa Ana, and admission to the event is free. Information: (714) 
567-3600. Music  
</P>
<P>
 What's Christmas without some old-fashioned choral concerts -- and at least 
one rendition of Handel's "Messiah"? The Orange County Performing Arts Center 
has a variety of offerings in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 First up, on Saturday at 8 p.m., is "Reflections of Christmas" with the Master 
Chorale, a children's chorus and the Master Chorale Brass Ensemble. The event 
features an audience sing-along, and there will be carolers in the lobby. 
Tickets are $15 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday tradition celebrated in the second center offering is a Mexican 
one. Fiesta Navidad, on Sunday at 3 p.m., features Mariachi Los Camperos de 
Nati Cano, Ballet Folklorico Olin and Ballet Folklorico de UCLA. $13 to $30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Symphony has several center events on Dec. 17. First, at 10 and 
11:30 a.m., is a holiday concert for young listeners, "Tinseltown: A Holiday at 
the Movies," which will include works celebrating both Christmas and Hanukkah. 
$8 to $10. At 3:30 p.m., the Pacific Symphony presents the "Messiah," with 
conductor Richard Westerfield, guest soloists and the Pacific Chorale. $14 to 
$63. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Chorale presents its holiday concert Dec. 18 at 7:30 p.m., with a 
preconcert lecture at 6:30 p.m. The program includes selections from around the 
world. $20 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Performing Arts Center is at 600 Town Center Drive, Costa 
Mesa. For information on center events, call (714) 556-2787. 
</P>
<P>
 Choral concerts and other musical events will be offered through the season at 
dozens of local churches (check the 11-Day Calendar for details). Other holiday 
musical events cover the spectrum, from classical to jazz: 
</P>
<P>
 * The UCI Chamber Singers present their annual Madrigal Dinner Friday through 
Dec. 18 on the Fine Arts Village Theatre stage at UC Irvine. $29.50-$41. (714) 
854-6616. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shirley Jones will sing a holiday program Saturday at 8 p.m. at Plummer 
Auditorium, 218 W. Commonwealth Ave., Fullerton. $20-$30. (714) 879-1732. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tony Guerrero will headline a jazzy Christmas program on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. 
at the Cafe Concerto Restaurant, Coffee Bar & Concert House, 2675 Irvine Ave., 
Costa Mesa. $10 (plus one canned food item, or new toys or clothing). (714) 
222-1616. Dance  
</P>
<P>
 As in seasons past, there are "Nutcrackers" galore, so it's possible for the 
diligent to make enough trips to Candyland to rack up frequent flyer miles. But 
there are no major touring companies in the county this season, as there have 
been in the past (American Ballet Theatre was last year's representative in 
Segerstrom Hall). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the top local offerings, Ballet Pacifica has done the holiday favorite 
for 28 years but has come up with a new production for this run, Dec. 16 
through 24 at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive. $13-$16. (714) 
824-5000. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Ballet Theatre presents its "Nutcracker" Dec. 15 through 18 in the 
McKinney Theatre at Saddleback College, 28000 Marguerite Parkway, Mission 
Viejo. $9-$11. (714) 582-4656.

 If Dan Quayle thinks he is presidential timber, maybe he should stop tilting 
at fictitious windmills like Murphy Brown and take on somebody who actually is 
somebody, and a pretty formidable somebody at that. 
</P>
<P>
 In a culture-wars tussle with Rosalie Sorrels, he surely would have all he 
could handle -- that is, if he didn't find himself so charmed and engaged by 
the sheer warmth and crusty strength of character of this veteran of the 
grass-roots traditional folk circuit that he conceded the podium to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrels, a great-grandmother at 61, will have the podium to herself when she 
performs one of her distinctive song-and-narrative concerts Saturday at Ball 
Junior High School in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Idaho woman's remarkable life story and her achievements as a singer and 
storytelling font of wisdom have led some highly placed people in the folk 
world to describe her in the most glowing terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Nanci Griffith called her a "living legend" in "Ford Econoline," a song 
chronicling Sorrels' decision in 1966 to get out of an untenable marriage, 
taking her five children with her as she forged a new life as a 
self-supporting, folk-singing single mom. Last month, Pete Seeger described 
Sorrels as a "national treasure" in a letter nominating her for a $10,000 folk 
heritage fellowship sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her love, her humor, her wisdom set a good example for all of us," Seeger 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Those qualities were evident in Sorrels' two previous Orange County concerts, 
in 1992 and 1993. They are deeply embedded in her performances, having been 
tested by hard experience. Sorrels' life never was the fairy tale implied in 
Griffith's breezy song. One of her sons committed suicide (Sorrels memorialized 
him in a moving song, "Sing Like the Rain (Last Song for David)"; the other did 
some jail time for burglary. She has been tested, not cloistered, and it gives 
her art all the more authority and poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrels' core concern on recent albums has been family values -- but she 
doesn't treat it as the rhetorical abstraction of the politician. She turns the 
concept into the knotty, ambiguous living thing that family is, drawing on 
memories of her grandparents and parents and working in the memorable writings 
of her mother, Nancy Stringfellow, a Boise, Ida., bookstore owner who died this 
year at 84. Children -- how they should be taught and the kind of world that 
adults are making for them -- figure greatly in such recent Sorrels albums as 
"Be Careful, There's a Baby in the House" (1991) and this year's "What Does It 
Mean to Love?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrels, who records for the small, traditional folk label Green Linnet, was 
scheduled to record a new album this week in San Francisco before coming to 
Southern California for a series of weekend shows. The album, said her manager 
(and daughter), Jacqueline Murray, will be a collection of songs, rather than 
the mixture of music and narrative heard on her recent albums. Sorrels also is 
still at work on a long-term project, a one-woman play she hopes to produce and 
perform, based on the life and music of Malvina Reynolds, the activist and folk 
singer known for "Turn Around" (the song that starts, "Where are you going my 
little one, little one?") and "What Have They Done to the Rain?" 
</P>
<P>
 When the time comes for somebody to do a film or play on Sorrels, there will 
be no lack of fascinating material. In the meantime, there's the chance to get 
a taste of this rare performer who can turn a concert into something 
approaching a heart-to-heart talk.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK

<P>
 Nick Lowe 
</P>
<P>
 "Labour of Lust" (1979) 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia  
</P>
<P>
 "I made an American squirm, and it felt so right . . ." may be a popular 
sentiment nowadays among North Korean nuclear negotiators and Serbian warlords, 
but Nick Lowe had something a little earthier in mind on this lighthearted 
album, the second of his solo career. Lyrically, Lowe spent the 11 tracks 
addressing sex, drugs, sex, madness and sex again with a delightfully carefree 
sense of humor. Musically, he and Rockpile, his steady band of the late '70s, 
confected an irresistibly hummable blend of country- and R&B-tinged roots music 
and Beatles-inspired guitar rock. Guitarists Dave Edmunds and Billy Bremner 
spun off solos that are effortless-sounding but cannily crafted models of pithy 
brilliance. The album's modes range from bright pop-anthem productions that 
ride along on chiming ranks of acoustic guitars and swelling harmonies 
(including "American Squirm" and "Cruel to Be Kind," the only Top 40 hit of 
Lowe's career) to the solo-acoustic strum of the mock-sincere, cheatin' heart 
ballad, "You Make Me." On that one, Lowe's excuse-making protagonist sounds 
seriously contrite until a deliberately ungrammatical rhyme in the final verse 
wryly undercuts his apologies: "See, I haven't losed my love/I'm just confused 
by love/You make me." 
</P>
<P>
 Every track is something to savor. Among the highlights are "Cracking Up," 
which sounds like a dryly English response to the Talking Heads' "Psycho 
Killer," delivered in the accent of a befuddled, working-class Brit who 
complains of all the pressures he's under and grouses, funnily, "I don't think 
it's funny no more." 
</P>
<P>
 "Skin Deep" ends Side One with a momentarily sobered, but still very clever, 
look at the prospects of relationships founded only on mutual attraction: "It's 
just belly to belly, but never eye to eye/A moment to treasure is just a matter 
of time." But Side Two finds Lowe rollicking along merrily with "Switch Board 
Susan" and "Love So Fine." These randy, high-spirited anthems are full of crass 
double-entendres and less veiled expressions of carnal appreciation that only 
those terminally-afflicted with political correctness could find offensive. 
This ain't the 2 Live Crew; it's boyish pop innocence with cheek. MIKE BOEHM

 Nick Lowe 
</P>
<P>
 "The Impossible Bird" 
</P>
<P>
 Upstart  
</P>
<P>
 Nick Lowe was instrumental in the birth of independent, anti-corporate rock. 
In 1976, the first single of his solo career, "So It Goes"/"Heart of the City," 
was the first release by Stiff Records, the British label that soon gave us the 
Lowe-produced Elvis Costello and presaged punk's rebellion against an excess of 
pomp and polish in '70s rock. Cycles of popularity having spun around, Lowe is 
back on an independent label -- the fledgling, Rounder-distributed Upstart 
Records -- for the first time since that era. "The Impossible Bird" (only his 
fourth solo album in the past 10 years) is a low-key affair that isn't seeking 
to ignite any new pop revolutions, but it continues the unassuming mastery that 
Lowe has displayed in such relatively recent work as "The Rose of England" 
(1985) and his previous outing, "Party of One" (1990). 
</P>
<P>
 On "The Impossible Bird," Lowe gets help from a band of unsung players expert 
enough to give the album a loose, easygoing, off-the-cuff feel without 
succumbing to sloppiness. Geraint Watkins sweetens the ballads with warm, 
gospel-soul organ, while guitarist Bill Kirchen, a former Commander Cody 
accomplice, plays in a stuttering, laid-back style reminiscent of J.J. Cale. 
Most of the songs gurgle or twang along in a Southern-roots groove that borrows 
simultaneously from soulful R&B sources and the rockin' side of country music. 
Lowe also strives on several songs for the stark, acoustic simplicity that 
marks "American Recordings," the recent record by Johnny Cash. He offers his 
own version of "The Beast in Me," a Lowe original that Cash covered on 
"American Recordings." But the Man in Black, who was Lowe's father-in-law when 
Lowe was married to Carlene Carter, was much more convincing in putting across 
the song's tormented introspection than its fundamentally amiable composer. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's Lowe who sports a fowl's foot on the album cover, the impossible 
bird he's talking about seems to be the human female: The album is mainly about 
his inability to keep one or more of them from breaking his heart. Realizing 
that you can't make love-gone-rotten sink in emotionally unless you've first 
allowed for a glimpse of love-so-fine, Lowe includes a couple of glowing 
ballads in the album's first half. "True Love Travels on a Gravel Road" is a 
winsome country/soul hybrid written by A.L. Owens and Dallas Frazier, and 
Lowe's own "Shelley My Love" is a sweetly crooned valentine that Paul McCartney 
should kick himself for not having thought it up first. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe keeps his characteristic wit about him as the mood darkens. In "Where's 
My Everything?" he shades a lamenting lyric with a humorous, hang-dog delivery. 
And "Drive-Thru Man" offsets wistful sentiments with lighthearted allusions to 
Cash's signature deep baritone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe is capable of edgier feelings, such as the roiling tension of "I Live on 
a Battlefield" and the bitter streak that finds its way into the mellow lament 
"14 Days." By the end, spirits revived, he moves on down the road to the brisk, 
twangy guitar rhythms of an affirmatively romantic Ray Price oldie, "I'll Be 
There." The only real impossibility on this album lies in trying to resist the 
gently seductive pop charms of the crafty old bird who made it. MIKE BOEHM

WANNA DANCE?: AT THE MAX, BIG BAND FANS CAN DOUBLE THEIR PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Big-band fans can now glamour it up twice a week at Club Max in Costa Mesa's 
Red Lion Hotel. With the success of Sundays, Tuesday nights have been added, 
featuring the John Henderson Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 This tuxedo-clad, 16-piece ensemble uses polished brass and a heavy backbeat 
to revive classic American pop tunes of the '30s and '40s. The band blends 
greener musicians with veteran players who jammed with the likes of Harry James 
and Stan Kenton as well as Red Nichols and the Five Pennies. On lead microphone 
are crooners Henderson, Warren Gayle and Leigh Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday regulars are probably familiar with Henderson's group, which alternates 
that day with the Tracy Wells Orchestra. Couples and singles dance and mingle 
in this intimate, chandelier-lit club and lounge. The dance parties, said 
big-band promoter Bud Morris, offer single seniors a chance to get acquainted. 
(In fact, he met his wife, Ginny, here.)  
</P>
<P>
 As on Sundays, Tuesdays primarily attract the senior set, but anyone who loves 
to dance is encouraged to cut the ballroom rug in a setting that recalls a more 
dazzling, romantic era.  
</P>
<P>
 And there's no need for first-timers to be intimidated by all of the fancy 
footwork on the crowded dance floor. Getting into the swing of things can be 
half the fun. Sunday afternoon group lessons with dance instructor Jan Mongrell 
can get you doing the fox trot, tango, rumba, waltz and other ballroom dances 
in no time. After an hour of lessons comes four hours of live entertainment, 
from 2 to 6 p.m. Sundays also offer a complimentary buffet of cheese, fruit and 
raw veggies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesdays offer no lessons or buffet but include a happy hour from 5 to 8 p.m. 
Prices include $2 for wine, $1.50 for drafts and $2.50 for well drinks. Regular 
prices are $4 for wine, $3 for drafts and $3.25 to $5.25 for well drinks. 
Mineral water, juice and sodas are $1.95 to $2.25. Three hours of live music 
begin at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers such as cheese-stuffed jalapeno peppers, buffalo shrimp and onion 
rings run $3.25 to $5.25 both days, and dinner is served in the hotel's two 
restaurants next to the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The room also includes two pool tables and televised sports, but among the 
soft-shoe crowd, such fare is overwhelmingly ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Footnote: A pre-New Year's Eve dance party to benefit the Alzheimer's Assn. of 
Orange County will be held Dec. 29 at the Red Lion Ballroom. Tickets are $14.50 
advance or $16.50 at the door. Call (714) 540-7000, Ext. 4980.

MUSIC / DANCE; DETOUR FOR ANOTHER 'NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Music lovers of a certain generation -- namely, mine -- discovered 
Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain" through the Disney film "Fantasia" 
(1940). 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's horrific image of the blind-eyed, bat-winged devil Chernobog towering 
over the mountain as Mussorgsky's music surges and whirls provides plenty of 
excitement (not to mention nightmare material) and captures the score 
wonderfully. 
</P>
<P>
 But the music isn't really what Mussorgsky wrote, says Daniel Lochrie, whose 
version of the piece will be heard for the first time tonight at Pacific 
Symphony's concert in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 As was usual with the innovative, erratic, dipsomaniacal genius, most of 
Mussorgsky's music became best known through the editions of others. Some of 
his innovations were considered too bold and were toned down; other works he 
left in fragmentary form. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fantasia" incorporates the traditional version of "Bald Mountain" edited by 
Rimsky-Korsakov, further arranged by Leopold Stokowski, who conducted it for 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rimsky changed notes and whole key areas," Lochrie says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He omitted two themes -- the devil's and also the church choir (at the end). 
He replaced development sections with added repetition. He toned down the 
orchestration in general. He toned down the harmonic language so there is less 
dissonance." 
</P>
<P>
 Lochrie wanted to get back to the composer's original ideas. In doing so, he 
found a complicated and tangled history, which emerged as his doctoral 
dissertation at Ohio State University in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't planned to finish my doctorate," says Lochrie, clarinetist with the 
Nashville Symphony. "I was buying time until I could get an orchestra job. But 
I was doing a paper on 'Bald Mountain.' I discovered these problems, which 
created questions in my mind. I got interested in the topic, and that gave me a 
reason to finish the degree." 
</P>
<P>
 It all began around 1867 when Mussorgsky wrote an orchestral tone poem called 
"St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain." The work, which disappeared until the 
score was published in 1968, had not been performed -- "a real sore spot for 
him," Lochrie says. "He spoke highly of his own work in this case, which he 
rarely did." 
</P>
<P>
 Mussorgsky revised it in 1874 for an opera project, "Mlada," which was 
abandoned, and revised it again in 1880 as an insert to what would be his final 
opera, "Sorochinsky Fair." 
</P>
<P>
 But he only got as far as writing a version for piano four-hands and chorus. 
(The chorus, which came into play because this was an opera, "really is pretty 
secondary," Lochrie says.) Mussorgsky died a year later. Rimsky-Korsakov 
orchestrated "Night," while other composers completed the opera from sketches 
Mussorgsky left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tended to take Rimsky-Korsakov's version of things, which was not 
always correct," Lochrie says. The difference between the first version and the 
"Fair" version is, Lochrie says, "extensive," but Rimsky didn't have the 
benefit of hearing the first version, which didn't surface until the late '60s. 
Lochrie did. 
</P>
<P>
 Lochrie decided to "orchestrate the last version, using the first version as a 
model. To me, that seems the most obvious part of the whole thing. I'm just 
amazed it didn't happen earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 There were places in the revision that were so different, however, that he 
couldn't rely on the earlier version. "In cases like that, I took similar 
passages from 'Boris (Gudunov),' . . . 'Sorochinsky Fair' and some similar 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rimsky has a lot more repetition in it, but he cut a couple of themes. (My 
version) has more themes and less repetition. They end up being about the same 
length. The first 72 measures are the closest. After that, (mine) really gets 
to be quite different." 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Modest Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain," played by the Pacific 
Symphony, conducted by Carl St.Clair. Works by Stravinsky, Shostakovich and 
Prokofiev also are on the program. Robert McDuffie will be the soloist.

 With four to five concerts a week and a full load of academics, the 26 members 
of the African Children's Choir don't have much time to veg out in front of the 
television. Not surprisingly, the group's organizers view that as a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't allow our kids to watch TV, primarily because of the violence on 
American television," explained Norm Schulz, director of choir operations for 
Friends of the West, the Christian relief organization that sponsors the 
choir's international tours. "Considering where these children come from, they 
can't understand why we would want to watch people killing each other (on TV), 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Hailing from villages across the east African republic of Uganda, the 6- to 
12-year-old choir members come from a country that has known more than its 
share of violence. According to the group's press materials, many of the 
children in the program have lost one or both parents to disease or political 
unrest; others have been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Choir members are selected from residents in group homes run by the nonprofit 
Friends of the West, a 20-year-old charitable organization with offices in the 
United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. There are two African Children's 
Choirs on the road. One, comprised of youths from Kenya, is touring on the East 
Coast; the Ugandan group is performing across the West Coast and has been in 
and around Orange County since Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerts will be Friday at South Coast Community Church in Irvine, Sunday at 
the Life Church in San Juan Capistrano, Dec. 19 at Disneyland in Anaheim, Jan. 
20 at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach and Jan. 22 in 
Fullerton's Eastside Christian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring a blend of African music and dance, along with American pop and 
gospel, the hourlong concerts are free and appropriate for all ages, Schulz 
said. Audience members may make contributions during a "free-will offering" at 
intermission. More than 80% of the funds raised through concert donations and 
the sale of choir recordings goes toward the Friends of the West projects, 
Schulz said. Since its inception, the group, which is supported by churches of 
several denominations, has also provided aid to children in Romania, Albania, 
southern Lebanon, Somalia, the south Sudan and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The first African Children's Choir toured in 1984. Choir members typically 
tour for about 11 months, adhering to a fairly demanding schedule of schooling 
and performances.  
</P>
<P>
 The youths, who have played more than 1,000 concert dates in churches and 
halls across the United States, Canada and Europe, have been featured 
extensively on Christian and network television programs, including "Good 
Morning America" and Robert Schuller's "Hour of Power." They've also shared 
concert billing with singer-songwriter Roger Whittaker and "Sesame Street's" 
Bob McGrath. In 1993, the African Children's Choir was nominated for a Grammy 
award in the category of best gospel choir. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Schulz, the program being performed for audiences on the West 
Coast is an energetic, visually exciting show.  
</P>
<P>
 "The kids start out with a variety of native songs," Schulz said. "There's 
some African drumming (and) a lot of dance and movement. Then they go into some 
gospel songs that are very high energy, followed by some popular (American) 
songs and medleys.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few things that are as good as people say they are," continued 
Schulz, "but I think I can honestly say that an African Children's Choir 
concert is one of the things that actually goes beyond people's expectations."

DO IT!: A WHOLE NEW WORLD OPENS UP SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of The Times Orange County 
Edition staff. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Saturday, the public will get its first glimpse of the county's newest 
regional park, a 475-acre slice of open space with rolling hills, oak-lined 
canyons and open sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of any new parkland is reason for celebration, and this is no 
exception; there will be a ribbon-cutting, live bluegrass music, food booths, 
wildlife displays and guided trail tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for the departing county supervisor, Gen. Thomas F. Riley Wilderness 
Park was dedicated to the county in 1983 by Coto de Caza Ltd., developers of 
the Coto de Caza planned community. The park is at the eastern end of Oso 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The views from the park are fantastic," said Tim Miller, operations manager 
for the regional park system. 
</P>
<P>
 It's open country everywhere, with Saddleback Mountain the main sight to the 
north and sections of Cleveland National Forest visible to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the park's abundant flora is the second-largest oak in the county park 
system, Miller said. The landscape was altered by years of cattle-grazing but 
still harbors a variety of wildlife: woodpeckers, raccoons, gray foxes, mule 
deer, bobcats, coyotes, hawks and owls. 
</P>
<P>
 Amenities at the park, which was originally going to be called Wagon Wheel 
Canyon Regional Park, are minimal and will remain that way, with picnic tables 
and portable toilets the extent of the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's opening starts with a ribbon-cutting at 10 a.m. The fun starts in 
earnest around 11 and continues to 3 p.m. For those who want to explore, there 
will be continuous guided tours of the six miles of trails for hikers, mountain 
bikers and equestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 A bluegrass band will play; food booths will offer hamburgers and other items 
(with proceeds benefiting local nonprofit groups), and there will be wildlife 
and environmental displays and prize giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 For the children, there will be a hayride, pony and llama rides and a petting 
zoo.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a celebration of the ribbon-cutting, but at the same time it's a fun 
time for everybody," said Tom Martin, vice president of marketing for Coto de 
Caza Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Rancho Santa Margarita Co. will donate 2,000 acres to be added 
to O'Neill Regional Park (just east of Mission Viejo) in late January or early 
February, by the latest reckoning. The gift encompasses the Arroyo Trabuco 
addition along with Harris Creek and other areas. Together, the new parkland 
adds 12 miles of multiuse trails. Watch for details. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Park opening. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Dec. 10, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Gen. Thomas F. Riley Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the San Diego (5) Freeway, take Oso Parkway east until it 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: FREE. (There is a charge for food). 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 728-0235.

SURFING: THE KING OF THE WAVES GETS A WAKEUP CALL FROM DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK FIGNETTI and DAVID REYES, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've got frigid waters off Orange County beaches, Rockin' Fig is back from 
the national amateur championships in Florida, and the big shootout between the 
Dana Hills and Huntington Beach high school surf teams is now history. 
</P>
<P>
 First, let's talk school contest. Dana Hills won, a major blow to Huntington 
Coach Andy Verdone. The defeat, at Huntington's pier on Nov. 21, stunned 
Verdone, who praised Dana Hills Coach Junji Nakamura. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Nakamura) came down with a well-organized team," Verdone said. "He 
outcoached me. He's a genius. He came better prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Yo, Figgy, did you hear that? Verdone called another coach a genius! Fig was a 
member of Huntington's 1974 championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 For Verdone to take a step back and say the guy outcoached him, that's pretty 
heavy . Actually, the defeat comes when Huntington Beach thought it had the 
team of teams. There were two recent transfers, Justin Harcharic from Seal 
Beach and Mikey Reilly from Los Alamitos, and HB thought it would have the best 
team ever. And here they go and are upset.  
</P>
<P>
 The victory marks the first time that Dana Hills has beaten Huntington Beach 
since 1980. In Nakamura's press release (yup, he sent one), he humbly called it 
"the best high school surf team contest of the CENTURY!" 
</P>
<P>
 Verdone said the showdown was the last heat. Huntington needed a sweep but 
came up short. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ended up winning by 5 points. How many points in all? Oh, don't make me 
look it up. I've been trying to forget this." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait until Jan. 24 for the rematch at Salt Creek . Both teams have been 
demolishing their opponents by 15 to 25 points. Huntington is unbeaten in the 
Sunset League, and Dana Hills remains undefeated in the South Coast league.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig, you think Dana Hills is going to win the national championship this year? 
</P>
<P>
 Naw. I'll say this: Dana Hills better watch out. Because from everything I've 
heard, Huntington still has a pretty killer team, and it's ready for revenge, 
despite the defeat. Watch HB take 'em at the nationals!  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know, Fig. They got a coach named Junji. That should be worth a few 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of contests, Fig, how did you do at the U.S. Surfing Federation 
Amateur Championships? (Fig, a former national title holder, surfed in the 
senior men's championships two weeks ago at Sebastian Inlet in Florida.) 
</P>
<P>
 Uhhh, I got sixth place.  
</P>
<P>
 Eeeeek! What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I was in the semifinals late in the day, and the wind was blowing 35 
mph. Major whitecaps. I tried to get a few waves, but they just, like, 
crumbled.  
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations, however, are in order for Kim Hamrock, 34, of Huntington 
Beach, who successfully defended her women's championship. Debbie Bradbury of 
Huntington Beach won first place in women's bodyboard; Geoff Moysa of San 
Clemente won the individual paddle race and was a member of the winning 
paddle-race team. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching gears to the world title races: Graham Cassidy, the Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals' executive director, said pro Lisa Andersen of Florida, who has 
been the points leader for women all year, will not compete in Hawaii this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said Andersen suffered a herniated disc in her lower back and will try 
to salvage a world title at the final contest of the season in Australia early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means the women's title race is now back on in earnest," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig's bummed by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 She's been tearing it up all year. I know her back went out in Brazil and that 
she could barely surf down there. Before she got injured and pulled out, it was 
looking like a U.S. sweep for men's and women's pros with Kelly Slater and Lia. 
 
</P>
<P>
 As for Slater, the men's event is the Pipeline Classic, going on through 
Friday. Slater won this event last year and has amassed so many contest points 
this season that if he makes the semifinals, Cassidy said, "it's in the bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Tell you the truth, the way Kelly's been surfing this year, he's got no 
problem. He's more focused. Last year, he had plenty of distractions, like a 
knee injury, breaking up with his girlfriend, and his starring role in 
"Baywatch." This year, he's quit the TV program and he's focused. Really a new 
character.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the cold: Water temperatures have been around an icy 55 to 56 degrees. 
I asked Fig how has he kept warm. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been wearing my fur-lined Speedos out there.  
</P>

fins rather than one.

<P>
 Protest: The Long Beach/North Orange County Surfrider Foundation chapter is 
urging friends of the coastline to bring surfboards and join in Saturday at a 
protest against development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. Meet at Warner Avenue 
and Pacific Coast Highway from 9 to 11 a.m. The plan is to line the shoulder of 
the highway with people and surfers holding on to their boards. For more 
information: (714) 492-8170.

SPECIAL SCREENING: AMERICA'S MARY PICKFORD -- SHORT, SWEET AND SAVVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
covers film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Pickford started out as "America's Sweetheart," then realized the power 
of her popularity and turned herself into a mogul. Her career, like that of 
others in Hollywood, could have worn the brand "Only in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana offers a look at the silent 
movie star tonight in a program featuring five of her early shorts, all made 
between 1909 and 1912. The mini-movies, each about 10 minutes, should give an 
idea of the range of Pickford's screen personality, said Bowers spokesman Brian 
Langston. 
</P>
<P>
 "The films are valuable, we think, as a way to introduce our patrons to (one 
of the) important people in cinema," he said. "Maybe from there, they'll go on 
to learn more and see more" of her work. 
</P>
<P>
 In "In Old Madrid" (1911), Pickford plays a feisty senorita determined to see 
her boyfriend despite a guardian's objections. Her character in "Sweet 
Memories" (also 1911) is an old woman who falls asleep, then dreams of her life 
from childhood to marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lonely Villa" (1909), directed by D.W. Griffith, gives us a Pickford who must 
be rescued from a forbidding house. Another Griffith-directed short is "Female 
of the Species" (1912), in which the actress goes out of character to play a 
villainess who tries to persuade her sister to commit murder. In "Her First 
Biscuit," a 1909 comedy, Pickford tries, badly, to make biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickford's film persona, which in major releases wavered little from picture 
to picture, clearly reflected the attitudes of the day -- Pickford was mostly 
purity and bliss, a make-believe darling for an emerging industry banking on 
the appeal of make-believe. She tended to be innocent on screen but a sharpie 
with good business sense off it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides helping launch film through her box-office appeal, she had impact on a 
handful of important directors -- including Griffith -- early in their careers. 
She helped Mack Sennett on his way to comedy and first brought Ernst Lubitsch 
over from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, she established United Artists in 1919 with fellow 
heavyweights Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickford, born in Toronto in 1892, was a stage actress before moving to film, 
eventually becoming one of Griffith's regulars.  
</P>
<P>
 Wanting more control of her projects, Pickford decided to out-studio the 
studios. She started in 1916 by forming the Mary Pickford Film corporation, 
which led to her becoming independent, unburdened by contracts, in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, she joined with Fairbanks (whom she married in 1920), Chaplin 
and Griffith, who were also sick of the dictatorial studio system, to form 
their own. United Artists immediately became a major player. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers sticks with history but moves away from Hollywood for its final 
screening of the year. On Dec. 15 it will present a series of newsreels from 
the '20s, documenting several events, including the play of the New York 
Giants, the speeches of Mussolini and the discovery of Pompeii. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Mary Pickford program, including five shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Tonight, Dec. 8, at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the Santa Ana (5) Freeway to 17th Street and head west to 
Main Street, then head north. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: Included with museum admission of $4.50 for adults, $3 for 
seniors and $1.50 for ages 12 and under.

KIDS ON FILM: BOOK FIGURES ARE AMPLE REASON NOT TO WRITE OFF 'PAGEMASTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Pagemaster," a nerdy hypochondriac (Macaulay Culkin) learns courage 
with the help of literature after he seeks refuge in a deserted library and 
embarks on fantastic adventures in the worlds of horror, adventure and fantasy. 
(Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because this widely hyped movie is one your mother clearly would want you to 
see, its aura is uncool. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, most kids gave it a solid B. Even older sophisticates who 
expected to find a red-lipped Macaulay Culkin kiddie flick were surprised by 
the acceptable action and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going to be stupid," said Ethan Phearson, 10. "There wasn't 
a lot of action and adventure in the commercials." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ethan laughed at Culkin's Richie Tyler, a statistic-spouting boy who's 
afraid of the dark and mercury levels in tuna. Ethan also liked Richie's 
adventures, which begin when he slips in the library, is knocked unconscious 
and enters a dream world he can escape only by passing three tests of courage. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Culkin vanishes and the movie shifts into a cartoon in which the 
plot and the action suspiciously resemble a future video or computer game. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to reach the library's exit, Richie must pass through three dangerous 
realms without losing his library card. Along the way, he meets and is helped 
by book friends: Adventure, a one-eyed, one-legged, one-handed swashbuckler; 
Horror, a frightened, plastic-faced goblin; and Fantasy, a lavender fairy 
godmother. When the going gets tough, a deep, mysterious voice advises Richie 
to "seize the courage" or "look to the books." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's apparent message -- that books are exciting and can actually help 
you -- was lost on some kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a message, I don't know what it is," Ethan said.  
</P>
<P>
 That's completely understandable. Who can appreciate the imagination in books 
when it's competing simultaneously with the imaginative animation of, say, a 
ceiling mural dissolving into a tidal wave of paint splashing through the 
library stacks? Or electric dancing fairies, or magic carpets, or a 
fire-breathing dragon?  
</P>
<P>
 If the message was lost in the medium, at least it was better than most 
Saturday morning cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was cool," concluded Danan Coleman, 11, who came with his sister Kendra, 
9, and brother Clint, 6. Their mother picked the show for them, they said, but 
none was disappointed. They agreed that the film's highlight was the animated 
book characters, particularly Horror, whose frightful distortions and whining, 
provided by the voice of Frank Welker, offered some laughs. "Star Trek's" 
Patrick Stewart played Adventure, and Whoopi Goldberg put her stamp on Fantasy. 
(She hails Mother Goose with "Hey, girl!" as she flies past in the fantasy 
realm.) 
</P>
<P>
 Culkin, now 14, still looks about 8 and continues to brandish his trademark 
"Yesss!" Though Culkin was off-screen for most of the movie, Kendra thought he 
still has what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's great," she said. "I really like him. He was actually cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids said filmmakers don't really have to sell them on books. For the most 
part, they said they prefer them to TV, CD-ROM, computer games and movies 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one game I like on the computer," Kendra said. "It's called 
Reading Blaster. You read on the computer."

NEWSBITES / BENJAMIN EPSTEIN: THREE NEW EATERIES WHET APPETITES FOR FRENCH, 
SCANDINAVIAN, MEXICAN

 Out with the old year, in with the new restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The yellow cottage suggests both Brittany and upstate Maine, but the cuisine 
at Aubergine, which opened Monday, is "modern French." Newlywed owners Liza and 
Tim Goodell come via Newport Beach's Four Seasons Hotel and Pascal, 
respectively; a third chef, Florent Marneau of Fontainebleau, also came from 
Pascal. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu at Aubergine changes daily. Entrees start at $9.50; tart tatin of 
pintade (guinea hen on puffed pastry) with braised turnips and sherry vinegar 
sauce, and sauteed veal sweetbreads with baby leeks and balsamic vinaigrette, 
are both $14. Desserts, $6, include a brown butter and vanilla bean blancmange 
with roasted figs and port essence. 
</P>
<P>
 Open Monday through Saturday for dinner from 5:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viking Cafe serves traditional Scandinavian dishes, desserts and coffees. 
Custard-filled cakes, kringles and other Danish pastries are baked daily 
in-house; open-face sandwiches include gravad lax (pickled salmon, $3.50). One 
wall features a mural dedicated to 8th-Century Vikings; another is dedicated to 
works of local artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Viking Cafe is open Monday through Thursday, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Friday, 6 a.m. 
to 11 p.m.; Saturday, 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Irvine, La Salsa recently launched its 43rd location nationwide, the 
fourth in Orange County. As part of the restaurant's grand opening fiesta, 
mariachi bands and 99-cent chicken tacos will be featured Tuesday through Dec. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 La Salsa in Irvine is open Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday 
and Saturday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
</P>

 Those wondering which bubbly to give this season were able to do a bit of 
comparison shopping at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa on Sunday; tasters at 
the two-part "Champagne and Sparkling Extravaganza" voted with both their pens 
and pocketbooks. Event organizer Michael Nguyen and guest speaker Peter Koff 
said the Bollinger 1982 R.D. ($99) edged Krug 1985 for the top spot among 
luxury cuvees including Dom Perignon; the public preferred Roederer 1988 
Cristal ($100). Among more affordable gift wines, Nguyen said, the public liked 
Mumm 1990 "DVX" Napa ($19). 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Khyber in Newport Beach now offers complete meals for takeout. A quarter 
tandoori chicken is $2.95 (half $4.25, whole $6.75), and that includes naan 
bread, sauteed onions and yogurt salad; for $1.50 more you can also have 
spinach, dal (lentils), eggplant or rice pilaf. Owner Arun Puri said it was his 
daughter's idea; Shalini Puri is a marketing major at USC, and the restaurant 
was her term project. She got an A on her paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundays and Mondays from 9:30 to 10:30 p.m., Carmelo's Ristorante in Corona 
del Mar offers samplings from its menu, gratis. Entertainment begins nightly at 
8:30, and the restaurant figures you might want to order a glass of wine, but 
you don't have to order anything to try such dishes as prosciutto pizza or 
rigatoni ai quattro fromaggi -- and no matter how you slice it, that's four 
cheeses at no charge.

RESTAURANTS; YANKEE TAVERN IN LAGUNA NIGUEL IS MOSTLY DANDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stand on this high bluff and take a deep breath of the crisp, clean air. If 
you squint, you can see the ocean in the far distance. You can also see why 
Laguna Niguel accounts for some of Orange County's most expensive real estate. 
Perhaps this powerful setting is what persuaded restaurateur Hans Prager to 
open a second Yankee Tavern here. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his original Yankee Tavern, Prager's new venture can't offer a view of 
the slips of Newport Harbor just beyond its windows (and you have to walk 
outside the restaurant to get that bluff-top view) or attract so many deeply 
tanned members of the boat crowd. Nevertheless, the place has been a 
rip-roaring success so far. There's a wait every night during peak hours, and 
the bar buzzes with an attractive clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The new restaurant is more handsome than the prototype. The vaulted ceiling 
sports bulbous chandeliers that spread an amber, lighthouse-type glow; the 
comfortable wooden captain's chairs have thick cushions to sink into.  
</P>
<P>
 Recall the basic Yankee Tavern theme: a dry-docked clipper with a larder full 
of dishes popular from Eastport to Block Island. This hearty sort of food is 
probably most enjoyable during the holiday season. Despite the Yankee elements, 
it has a lot in common with the hearty Continental cooking Prager built his 
reputation on at the Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip it is not, as you quickly notice. A featured cold appetizer is Blue Point 
oysters on the half shell. They're fine and plump, and if you insist on being a 
Yankee all the way down the line, you'll be happy to note that they come from 
the East Coast. But we have better, fresher and more varied oysters out here -- 
delicious Quilicene or Skookum oysters from the Northwest, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm also disappointed with the farmed Eastern mussels, though they are 
definitely a step up from those insipid New Zealand green-lip mussels we so 
often see. Yankee Tavern serves them in a delicious shallot, garlic and cream 
broth, reminiscent of moules mariniere .  
</P>
<P>
 Soups are a high spot. The Maine lobster bisque is delightful, a coral-colored 
bowl of rich lobster flavor with little pieces of white corn, like buried 
treasure, stuck at the bottom. Sometimes there is a thick lentil soup with a 
smoky taste from little bits of ham hock. The chowders, in the California 
manner, are more floury than they would be in New England, but satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the salads might be Boston bibb lettuce with bay shrimp, chives, 
watercress and chopped egg. The greens are tender, and the concept works. The 
traditional Caesar is good too, thanks to a light, subtle Caesar dressing, 
tasty sourdough croutons and the right amount of grated Parmesan. 
</P>
<P>
 But avoid the beefsteak tomato and sweet onion, accompanied by cruets of wine 
vinegar and olive oil. What you get are slices of bionic, flavorless tomato 
alternating with undistinguished red onion. Sure, it's hard to get good 
tomatoes this time of year. So why is this dish on the menu at all? 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas decorations are up at the moment in here, and they herald the best 
entree, roast Christmas goose. Richer, denser and gamier than duck, this goose 
has a crackling skin and comes on a large plate with red cabbage, stewed apples 
and good mixed vegetables. It's reason enough to visit the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Other good entrees include a home-style Yankee pot roast with brown gravy; 
Angus porterhouse steak, 20 ounces' worth; and thin-sliced calf's liver with 
crisp onion straws and smoky bacon. The menu's Diestel Farm turkey is some of 
the most tender and flavorful turkey I have ever tasted. It comes with a 
crunchy, interesting pecan dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the menu abounds with seafoods. The Nantucket platter is like the 
fisherman's plates you get on Cape Cod, though fancied up with the addition of 
a crab cake. It's mostly fried shrimp, scallops and halibut, plus the de 
rigueur tangy coleslaw and skinny French fries. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitefish is sauteed with mushrooms and capers here, making for a dish that 
seems rather French for a Yankee menu. Better is the beer-batter fish and 
chips, made with flaky Canadian halibut -- a little heavy on the batter but 
definitely good to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are quite substantial, if not quite up to Yankee standards. The 
deep-dish blueberry cobbler, for instance, is not a cobbler at all but, rather, 
a single-crusted pie, topped with a scoop of Haagen-Dazs vanilla. There's a 
chocolate bread pudding with Jack Daniels sauce (from a state where the word 
Yankee is less than a compliment, I should think) and a fine raspberry creme 
brulee our forefathers doubtless never heard of. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee Tavern is moderate to expensive. Appetizers are $2.50 to $8. Main 
course salads and sandwiches are $7.95 to $10.95. Entrees are $10.50 to $19. 
Desserts are $4.

PARKER'S PALCE: IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, BETWEEN HEARTACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outside, as I write this, is a beautiful Indian summer day, warm and 
breezeless beneath a pale, unfettered sky. Inside my heart there are more than 
the usual amounts of pain and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way to reconcile the afternoon's loveliness with a soul's distress 
other than the obvious, which is to remember that the weather has as little 
influence on our moods as our moods have on the weather. But this is smug and 
fatuous and unhelpful. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives? 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women in general, and that contested rope between them -- love. I look 
around and think about my friends and family, and I can't help but notice a lot 
of disappointment that was once hope, a lot of confusion that was once clarity, 
a lot of sand slipping through fingers that once seemed to hold only gold. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, I have a friend whose wife left him after 20 years of marriage. 
They have three fine children, a warm and spacious home in San Juan Capistrano, 
jobs that have been rewarding. They still have those things, I suppose, but he 
lives alone now, surrounded by birds in a rental not far from his former home. 
His birds -- rare, exotic, expensive, hard-to-care-for and noisy -- have been a 
love of his life. Sometimes when I talk to him on the phone, he has to go into 
the bathroom to be heard above their chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 That's a complicated question for which I have gathered only dull and partial 
answers from others who know her: She was unfulfilled; she was not autonomous; 
she was suffering a midlife crisis. She was not happy.  
</P>
<P>
 Mystified, hurt, angry, proud and shamed, her husband sits on bar stools next 
to me, and we joke about finding his next wife. But he doesn't want a next 
wife, he wants her, and after a drink or four he's the first to admit it. Some 
women I know are after him, but he's the most married single guy they'll ever 
chase. He is not happy.  
</P>
<P>
 I have another friend who was married once, briefly, but it ended. He's an 
idealistic type -- hard to please and critical, but forgiving and often 
generous. Fortyish now, he lives alone in a house that is too large for just 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past couple of years he was seeing an intelligent, pretty, practical 
woman, and they usually seemed pleased to be together. They were proud of each 
other in an unoffensive way, affectionate and attentive. Sometimes when I'd see 
them, her young son would be with them, and my friend would look a little 
awkward, not sure how to act. He had told me more than once that he feared he 
wouldn't be able to find the courage -- or love -- that would allow him to 
stepfather this little boy and be happy himself. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend announced a couple of weeks ago that he and this woman had called it 
quits. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? 
</P>
<P>
 He was still unsure that he could get used to someone else's son living under 
his roof -- that spacious, too big roof! But the time had come to make a 
decision one way or the other. Funny, but he told me he feels ready for the 
familiar chaos of a household not devoted exclusively to himself.  
</P>
<P>
 I have another friend whose husband of 14 years fell in love with someone 
else. He left the state and is reputed to be remarried and quite happy. She is 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another friend is still in love with a guy who broke her heart a decade 
ago and wonders if they might be good together again. He wonders too. I know 
both of them well enough to understand that more than anything else, they are 
terrified of what might happen if they try, and terrified of what might happen 
if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 When I'm in the room with the two of them, I can sense a flexible present 
trying to accommodate a specific past in the name of a hypothetical future. 
They are too scared for happiness to be even in their vocabulary just yet, and, 
yes, I'm terrified for them too. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives? 
</P>
<P>
 At times like this, I'm convinced the founding fathers considered "the pursuit 
of happiness" an "inalienable right" because it is such a fragile thing -- as 
hard to find and keep as life and liberty itself. At times like this, I'm 
convinced that happiness is alien, caused only by an occasional convergence of 
uncontrollable forces. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you subscribe to that notion, it follows that anyone who expects a 
relationship (not to mention a life) to produce a high degree of happiness is 
being tragically optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, at times like this, I want to tell all my aching friends that life 
is geared to misery, toil and heartbreak, so stop heaping more of those things 
onto your loved ones just because you don't feel happy.  
</P>
<P>
 Right now, with optically pure sky overhead and the warmth of a late autumn 
sun on my arms, I am convinced that life is vain bitterness and grand delusion. 
I'm convinced that we live short and die long. That life mocks hope. 
</P>
<P>
 But, to be truthful, I'm only good for about one day of this, then I start to 
crack. If I'm just another hungry child bawling for my happiness, then so be 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 So while I brood under these perfect skies I keep one eye trained on tomorrow, 
or a day soon, when the storm winds will howl in off the ocean and the sky will 
be black as midnight at noon and the rain heaving down will be cold and sharp 
as ice picks and somehow the world will seem a happier place. 
</P>
<P>
 I noticed just a moment ago that a breeze has come up, and the evening is 
already turning cool.

CLIPPERS POOH-POOH A SHOT AT RECORD; PRO BASKETBALL: RICHARDSON'S BASKET AT END 
OF OVERTIME BEATS BUCKS, 96-94, AND ENDS STREAK AT 16. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know that headline type used for earthquakes, riots and floods? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, break it out today because the Clippers finally won their first game of 
the season after losing their first 16. 
</P>
<P>
 One loss away from tying the NBA record for the worst start set when the 
expansion Miami Heat lost its first 17 games in 1988, the Clippers finally 
found a team they could beat, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks, 96-94, in overtime 
Wednesday night before an announced 6,443 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Pooh Richardson made a 20-foot jumper from the top of the key as time 
ran out to give the Clippers their first victory and trigger a wild 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the sweetest shot I ever saw," forward Loy Vaught said. "It's a very 
good feeling. That futility record we almost set is something we didn't want to 
have our names attached to." 
</P>
<P>
 With "I Love L.A." playing over the loudspeakers, fans and players flooded the 
court and mobbed Richardson, who had nine points and 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied at 94-94 after Marty Conlon made a layup, the Clippers 
called a timeout to set up a play. Richardson passed it to Eric Piatkowski, who 
was stripped of the ball by Eric Murdock. However, rookie forward Lamond 
Murray, who had 19 points in his first NBA start, came up with the ball in a 
wild scramble and fed Richardson for the game-winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaught, who promised to buy the team a bottle of Dom Perignon when it got its 
first victory, had a career-high 30 points and 14 rebounds as the Clippers 
ended a 20-game losing streak dating back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept the fans on the edge of their seats, but nothing comes easy here," 
Vaught said. "Every single guy had a hand in this win. It was like 12 guys 
against the world. We had a lot of critics. A lot of people wanted us to set 
the record." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clippers trailing, 92-88, after Vin Baker scored the first four 
points in the five-minute overtime period, Vaught hit a jumper to trigger a 6-0 
spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who had never won an NBA game, made a three-point shot to give the 
Clippers a 93-92 lead with 1:31 remaining. Murray added a free throw with 45.6 
seconds remaining to give the Clippers a two-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks called time out to set up a play, but Clipper reserve forward 
Charles Outlaw blocked a layup by forward Glenn Robinson with 26 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After another timeout, Robinson faked a shot and passed to Conlon, who made a 
layup with 22.5 seconds left to tie it at 94-94. Conlon, who was fouled by 
Murray, missed the free throw  
</P>
<P>
 With the Clippers leading, 88-85, in regulation, Robinson, who had 22 points, 
made a three-point shot from the top of the key to tie it at 88-88 with 22.1 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had a chance to win it in regulation, but Richardson missed a 
jumper with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 66-65, the Clippers went on a 15-7 run to take an 81-72 lead on 
Richardson's jumper with 6:33 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bucks outscored the Clippers, 12-6, to cut it to 87-84 when Jon Barry, 
who had 10 fourth-quarter points, made two free throws with 2:11 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks had two chances to take the lead after Vaught missed a jumper on the 
ensuing possession, but Barry missed a jumper and Murdock missed a follow shot 
with 1:28 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski made the second of two free throws with one minute left to give the 
Clippers a four-point lead. However, Vin Baker made one free throw with 58.1 
seconds left for 88-85. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers ran the clock down to 34 seconds before Murray missed a 
three-pointer that resulted in a 24-second violation because it didn't hit the 
rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Dunleavy used a timeout to diagram a play. There was little doubt 
that the Bucks would try to work the ball to Robinson, the first player 
selected in the NBA draft. Robinson missed a jumper, but got his own rebound 
and made the tying three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Harold Ellis changed his pregame routine in hopes that it 
would help change the Clippers' luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to different music coming over," Ellis said. "I always listen to 
Oletta Adams, but tonight I changed it up and I listened to Sting on the way 
over here." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Fitch changed his starting lineup, inserting Murray in place of 
center Matt Fish. Murray had 11 points and three rebounds as the Clippers took 
a 52-49 halftime lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Clipper guard Terry Dehere sat out the final quarter after spraining his right 
ankle in the third quarter.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; KANSAS TRAILS ONLY ONCE IN VICTORY OVER NO. 6 
FLORIDA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerod Haase scored 22 points, Greg Ostertag tied a school record with eight 
blocked shots and fourth-ranked Kansas trailed only once Wednesday night in 
defeating sixth-ranked Florida, 69-63, at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jayhawks (4-0), who beat then-No. 1 Massachusetts, 81-75, on Saturday at 
Anaheim, led the Gators at halftime, 29-25, and quickly ran up a 36-25 
advantage after Sean Pearson made a three-point shot, Haase scored on a driving 
layup and Jacque Vaughn made a 10-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida (3-1) never got closer than five after that. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Massachusetts 85, Pittsburgh 57 -- Lou Roe and Mike Williams scored 13 
points each as the Minutemen (2-1) used all 15 players and got points from 12 
in rolling over the Panthers (1-3) at Amherst, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Kentucky 73, Indiana 70 -- Walter McCarty made a three-point shot with 
1:37 to play at Louisville, Ky., to help the Wildcats (3-1) hold off the 
Hoosiers, who never recovered from a delay-of-game technical foul with 4:02 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Reed's layup gave Indiana (2-4) a 64-62 lead, but he was called for the 
technical when he swatted the ball out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Epps made the two free throws off the technical to tie the score. 
McCarty was fouled by Alan Henderson 10 seconds later and made both free throws 
to give Kentucky (3-1) a 66-64 lead. The score was tied only once more. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Georgetown 76, Providence 74 -- Jerome Williams' rebound layup with 41 
seconds to play gave the Hoyas their only lead of the night as Georgetown (3-1) 
rallied from a 14-point deficit against the Friars (4-1) at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Allen Iverson, who scored 30 points, made a 15-foot jumper with 1:20 
remaining to pull Georgetown within 74-73, then stripped the ball from guard 
Jason Murdock 30 seconds later. Iverson missed a jumper that would have given 
the Hoyas the lead, but Williams got the rebound and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Iverson, who had 21 points in the second half, made one of two free throws 
with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 Ohio 87, Ohio Dominican 57 -- Ed Sears scored 22 points to lead the 
Bobcats (6-2) over the Panthers (4-5) at Athens, Ohio.

LOYOLA GETS LIFT FROM BENCH IN COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Battling foul problems and a 10-point deficit at one point in the first half, 
Loyola Marymount rallied with the help of a freshman forward to defeat San 
Diego State, 75-67, Wednesday night before 924 in the campus gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to get back to defending, rebounding and taking care of the ball," 
Loyola Coach John Olive said."Once we did that, we were OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola improved to 4-1 going into a 10-day break for final exams. San Diego 
State (3-1) was unbeaten but untested, with victories over Southern California 
College, Cal Poly Pomona and Sacramento State. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola won despite the considerable foul problems of starting forwards Wyking 
Jones and Mike O'Quinn. Jones still managed to lead the Lions in scoring with 
15 points on seven-for-seven shooting from the field and O'Quinn had 14. "Our 
bench was critical tonight," Olive said. "We got very valuable minutes from our 
bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Ammerman, a freshman forward from Sacramento, was particularly important 
at a stage of the first half when San Diego State was threatening to blow the 
game open. The Aztecs, controlling the offensive boards, led by 10 and Jones 
was on the bench in foul trouble. Ammerman's five defensive rebounds, however, 
keyed Loyola's rally to a 35-35 tie at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Quinn provided the offensive spark to ease the Lions into a lead in the 
second half, scoring eight points in the first 9 1/2 minutes as Loyola moved to 
a 58-54 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola would have been more comfortable with its lead, except that both Jones 
and O'Quinn were forced to the bench with four fouls. But Ammerman made a 
driving basket that gave Loyola its first double-figure lead at 65-54.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CHAPMAN GUARD DZIERZYNSKI PROVING 
COACH'S POINT WITH HIS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman men's basketball Coach Mike Bokosky has always believed Adam 
Dzierzynski would be a terrific point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Dzierzynski, a sophomore from Santa Margarita High, started to 
prove Bokosky's point. Dzierzynski averaged 19 points and eight assists in 
leading the Panthers to the Redlands tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tournament has given him an unbelievable amount of confidence," Bokosky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Dzierzynski split time with senior Brian Wood at the point, but 
this year it's his show. He had 24 points and eight assists in Chapman's 85-78 
victory over Redlands in the title game and was named most valuable player. 
Dzierzynski made 20 of 32 shots from the field (62.5%) in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After losing its first game of the season to Claremont-Mudd, the Panthers 
(4-2) have bounced back. They beat Claremont in the first round of the 
tournament, 90-78, then beat Menlo, 82-69, before taking care of Redlands. Each 
of those teams are expected to be among the top NCAA Division III teams in the 
West Region. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if we continue to play well, we'll be one of the top teams in the 
West," Bokosky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Mumaw, an all-tournament selection, averaged 18.6 points in the three 
games. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Concordia women's basketball team seems to be making rapid progress under 
first-year Coach Dave Wolter. The Eagles are 3-4, but they made a surprising 
run in the Golden State Athletic Conference preseason tournament last week in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles won two games to advance to the final, where they lost, 81-66, to 
Northwest (Idaho) Nazarene, ranked No. 21 in the preseason NAIA Division II 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolter said the team is improving with each game. In a 106-67 loss to Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, the Eagles forced more turnovers than they committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been something very positive to take away from every game we've 
played," Wolter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia has achieved much of this on the road. In a 10-day span starting 
Thanksgiving Day, the Eagles spent only about 40 hours at home, traveling for 
tournaments at Humboldt State and Fresno Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NBA guys get a better road trip than that," Wolter said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Record-breaker: Pacific Christian's Charles Ross broke the school's career 
scoring record Monday in a 108-38 victory over California Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The game at Cal State Fullerton was stopped when Ross broke Brian Keiser's 
mark of 2,655 with about eight minutes left in the first half. Ross was 
presented the ball and a certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Keiser set the record in four seasons from 1986-90; Ross, a 6-foot-3 senior, 
has played 2 1/4 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross is averaging 29 points this season and has 2,662 in his career. He should 
also soon break Burton Lalk's school rebounding record. Ross, who averages 13 
rebounds, has 1,383, 43 short of Lalk's mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross has continued to excel despite starting the season with a sprained ankle. 
Doctors suggested he sit out the first two games because of the injury. Ross 
ignored the advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't been able to push off it and he's had to have more rest than 
usual," said PCC Coach Lee Erickson. "We don't want to kill him off because we 
want him at the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross was named athlete of the week in the National Christian College Athletic 
Assn. after scoring 32 points in a 106-97 loss to Cal State Dominguez Hills 
last week. Pacific Christian (7-5) is the top-ranked team in the NCCAA Division 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals are scheduled to play No. 7 American Indian College today in 
Phoenix.

KEEPING TRACK / JASON REID: ERICKSON HEATS UP QUICKLY WITH BOILERMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Easing into things wasn't Nicole Erickson's style in high school -- and 
nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month into her freshman year, Erickson is starting at point guard 
for nationally ranked Purdue, putting her name in the Boilermakers' record book 
and creating fan excitement in West Lafayette, Ind. Yeah, pretty much the stuff 
she has always done. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been great," said Erickson, one of the best female basketball players in 
county history while at Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game is a big game. We've already played Stanford, Vanderbilt, 
Tennessee. It's been incredible; so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Having fun isn't too difficult when you're exceedingly talented. She has 
started the last three games and is averaging 7.6 points, 3.6 rebounds and two 
assists for Purdue (3-3), ranked No. 11 in the USA Today/CNN Poll. Solid 
numbers for someone adjusting to life in the Big Ten Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an adjustment any time you go from the high school level to the 
college level," she said. "You have to prepare yourself mentally for every 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're playing against people who are as talented as you and who know the 
game as well as you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, 5 feet 6, dazzled the crowd while starting for the first time in the 
Boilermaker Classic last Saturday against Florida A&M. She scored 18 points, 
and had five rebounds and five steals in Purdue's 97-37 victory. She also tied 
the school record for three-pointers in a game by making six of nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bit nervous, but not really," Erickson said. "It wasn't that 
much different than coming off the bench. You still have to do the same things 
and not mess up." 
</P>
<P>
 At Brea, the bench was something Erickson only visited to catch her breath in 
between terrorizing opponents. A starter since the first game of her freshman 
year, Erickson led the Ladycats to a record of 130-5 -- a 96% winning 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea won its fourth consecutive State championship last season as Erickson 
averaged 15.7 points and 8.1 assists. She also received The Times Orange County 
Edition player of the year award for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Erickson's transition has been especially smooth, she believes 
her development is far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some habits I have to change," she said. "I was used to doing things a 
certain way at Brea for all those years, and I can't do that stuff now." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kristin Spataro and Ayesha Attoh led Princeton (26-5) to the Ivy League 
women's volleyball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Spataro, a 5-6 junior setter from Corona del Mar, was named most valuable 
player of the Ivy League tournament, won by Princeton in mid-November. Attoh, a 
5-8 outside hitter from University, was the Ivy League's freshman of the year. 
Both were selected All-Ivy League. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Heather Dillard finished her Alabama Birmingham volleyball career with another 
strong season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillard (5-9), a Cypress graduate, led the Great Midwest Conference in assists 
for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillard, an all-conference setter, averaged 12.3 assists. She averaged 10.8 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blazers were 8-24 and tied for fourth in conference at 4-8.

basketball season is over, now has won two in a row, including Wednesday's 
55-38 victory over Troy to advance to the semifinals of the Brea-Olinda Ladycat 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy (4-1), ranked 10th in The Times' preseason county poll, wasn't caught off 
guard. Before the game, Coach Brad Sand said he expected Ocean View (2-2) to 
find its way into the county's elite by the end of the season. Afterward, he 
had not changed his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to play teams like this," Sand said. "Someone puts you in a paper top 
10, you still have to go out and play and prove it. I just want to see good 
basketball; if we play good basketball and lose, then that means we lost to a 
good team." 
</P>
<P>
 But Troy didn't play well. Seven first-quarter turnovers led to only seven 
shots -- and the Warriors made only one -- as they fell behind, 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors began to solve Ocean View in the second quarter, lobbing the ball 
over coverage to 6-foot-3 Jennie Gadd, who helped to pull them within five. But 
midway through the quarter, Gadd twisted an ankle and Troy's dependence on the 
senior was evident: Ocean View outscored the Warriors, 10-2, and took a 31-16 
halftime lead. Troy never got closer than 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were embarrassed our first two games, against Edison (51-27) and Mater Dei 
(76-32), and that was my fault," Ocean View Coach Ollie Martin said. "We tried 
to play the same style as last year when we had three seniors and could do some 
sophisticated stuff. This year, that didn't work. We had to go to a real basic, 
up-tempo style. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even practice it -- I just drew things up before (beating Pasadena 
in the first round on Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Becky Fraser led Ocean View with 22 points and 11 rebounds, and 
Jennifer Tuiolosega had 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Gadd returned in the third quarter for Troy, but Ocean View kept her from 
becoming a factor; she finished five of seven from the field and had 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this game will give us some momentum," Martin said. "Troy's a good 
team, and Torrance Bishop Montgomery's going to be tough (in the semifinals), 
but it's important for us to get into this style of play; the girls will get 
better and better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure we'll be a top-10 team eventually." MARTIN HENDERSON

<P>
 Schea Cotton was the difference in Mater Dei's 56-39 nonleague victory over 
Los Alamitos Wednesday night at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, who missed the Monarchs' season-opener Monday because of a rash, 
returned to the starting lineup a week earlier than expected and scored a 
team-high 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I needed to get him in shape as soon as possible," Coach Gary McKnight 
said. "He practiced yesterday. He's got to wear a T-shirt under his uniform 
because (the rash) is irritating." 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore shot six of 11 from the field, and turned the ball over five 
times, including three times in the first quarter. Cotton grabbed four rebounds 
and was eight of nine from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty points, that's not bad for a kid that sat out 12 days," McKnight said. 
"It's a slow process getting back into the flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos took advantage of the Monarchs' slow start, jumping out to a 9-7 
lead after the first quarter. Guard Cory Johnson's three points led four 
Griffin scorers in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins (4-1) led, 11-7, before Mater Dei (2-0) got going. Guard Clay 
McKnight scored five consecutive points on a three-pointer and layup off a 
steal to give the Monarchs their first lead, 12-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton scored six of Mater Dei's next 10 points to increase the edge to 22-16 
at halftime. Los Alamitos went cold in the second quarter, hitting only three 
of 10 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Shaun Jackson carried the Monarchs through the third quarter, scoring 
six points, grabbing three rebounds and two steals. Mater Dei built a 34-19 
lead with 3 minutes 23 seconds left before the Griffins went on a 10-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson scored four points in the final three minutes to cut the deficit to 
seven points after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton took over in the final quarter, scoring eight straight points, 
including six on free throws. The Griffins hit three of 10 shots down the 
stretch, but couldn't hold off the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first career start, Mater Dei senior forward Mark Pozsgai held Los 
Alamitos center Jeremy Vandervoet to eight points. The Griffins hit only four 
of 18 from three-point range, and had nine turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei shot 43% from the field and hit 14 of 19 from the free-throw line. 
The Monarchs also had 14 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are struggling," McKnight said. "We have a lot of young kids blending with 
a lot of veterans. We are going to be a good team at the end of the year, but 
we are going to have our struggles." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson finished with 15 points and six rebounds and sophomore guard Kevin 
Augustine added 11 points for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson scored 12 points to lead Los Alamitos. JON CLIFFORD

HOLLYWOOD PARK; STRODES CREEK RETURNS STRONGLY WITH SWIFT RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Whittingham didn't mince words after Strodes Creek's successful 
comeback in the $56,200 J.O. Tobin on Wednesday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's the best horse in the country today," Whittingham said after the 
3-year-old Halo colt rallied from last in his first race since finishing third 
in the Belmont Stakes on June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 After chasing Tabasco Cat and Go For Gin home in New York, Strodes Creek 
underwent surgery, then was bothered by a minor splint injury while preparing 
for his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to training, Strodes Creek had worked exceptionally well but 
wasn't scheduled to start until the Malibu Stakes on Dec. 26, Santa Anita's 
opening-day stakes, but Whittingham chose to run him in the J.O. Tobin. That 
race was supposed to mark the return of another talented 3-year-old. However, 
Wekiva Springs will make his comeback in Saturday's $100,000 Vernon O. 
Underwood Breeders' Cup Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Strodes Creek is a match for Holy Bull remains to be seen, but he did 
what he was supposed to as the 7-10 favorite Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Off a step slowly, which has been the norm for him, he trailed down the 
backside under Eddie Delahoussaye, moved up on the outside entering the 
stretch, then ran down 16-1 shot Subtle Trouble, who led by 2 1/2 lengths with 
an eighth of a mile to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit with the whip three times in midstretch, Strodes Creek won by nearly two 
lengths in 1:21 for the seven furlongs. The track record for the distance is 
1:20 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had done everything right," said Whittingham of the colt he owns in 
partnership with Arthur Hancock III and Rose Hill Stable. "The rest we gave him 
helped. He's just learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek could surface in the seven-furlong Malibu, but it seems more 
likely that the second leg of Santa Anita's Strub Series, the 1 1/8-mile San 
Fernando Stakes on Jan. 14, will be his next start.

NBA ROUNDUP; MAGIC HAS CAVALIERS' NUMBER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal sparked a 10-0 run midway through the fourth quarter and 
finished with 33 points and 10 rebounds Wednesday night to lead the Orlando 
Magic to a 90-75 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the second in as many nights for the Magic over the Cavaliers, 
who stayed close for three quarters despite making only 39% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic broke the game open with the 10-0 run that gave them an 80-65 lead. 
Anfernee Hardaway, who had 14 points, made a three-point shot during the surge, 
which Anthony Avent finished with a fast-break tip-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 111, Miami 102 -- Jeff Malone scored 13 of his season-high 34 
points in the third quarter to lead the 76ers at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some great games against the Heat," said Malone, who has topped 30 
points five times against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the 76ers join the Boston Celtics and the Lakers as the only 
three NBA teams with 2,000 victories. Since their inception in 1949 as the 
Syracuse Nationals, the 76ers are 2,000-1,564. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Barros and former Miami player Willie Burton each scored 19 points for 
the 76ers. Glen Rice led Miami with 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 93, Atlanta 80 -- Dee Brown scored 24 points and Xavier McDaniel 23 to 
help the Celtics overcome a 10-point deficit at Boston. The Celtics played 
without their leading scorer and rebounder, Dino Radja, who suffered a broken 
right hand Tuesday night against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mookie Blaylock led the Hawks with a game-high 26 points. Stacey Augmon 
contributed 16 in his 11th consecutive double-figure game. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Montross scored 16 points and had a season-high 14 rebounds for the 
Celtics, who ended a three-game losing streak.

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley cycling enthusiasts will get a chance to sweat it with 
Mayor Richard Riordan on his ongoing Ride L. A.: Community Bike Tour of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 20-plus-mile rides are scheduled here: one in the West Valley on Dec. 17 
and the other in the North Valley on April 22 of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to get a little community spirit going," said Mike Weintz, a 
veteran bicycle racer and coordinator of Ride L. A. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a large city. . . . (The ride) gives people a chance to see the 
city in a unique way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming West Valley tour will take the mayor and any interested 
participants from Cal State Northridge to Warner Ranch Park in Woodland Hills, 
then through Balboa Park and back to the university, according to the mayor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the bike tour said all participants under the age of 18 must 
wear a helmet and recommend that all others do so too.

 The women of the Verdugo Hills Showtime Chorus of Sweet Adelines are planning 
an unusual Christmas musical extravaganza this weekend in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-part harmonies of barbershop music are usually associated with male 
voices, but the women's chorus, which was founded in 1954, has received 
international acclaim for its vocal prowess.The group recently placed eighth in 
the Sweet Adelines International competition in Reno, making it one of the top 
10 groups in its field, said Carolyn Butler, master director of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Showtime Chorus, plus the Crescenta Valley Highlander Chorus, 
will perform at the third annual Barbershop Christmas show at Glendale High 
School. Both groups will perform traditional carols in their a cappella style, 
giving familiar Christmas music a new sound, said Nancy Branam, co-chairwoman 
of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Christmas caroling of the '90s, expanded and performed on stage with 
lights and sound," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3 p.m. concert is in the high school auditorium. For tickets and 
information, call (818) 843-6909. STEVE RYFLE

 A longtime Encino resident who retired to Northern California in the 1980s, 
Gibson died in his sleep Wednesday, said his grandson, Ernie Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Theo Gibson on Oct. 4, 1899 in Bellview, Tex., he settled in California 
with his family in 1907. While a 17-year-old high school student in Monrovia, 
Gibson persuaded his parents to let him enlist in the Army following the 
outbreak of World War I. He served six months in France and was discharged in 
1919. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Gibson finished school and married his former classmate, 
Frances Tate, in 1921. In June of 1925, they moved to Encino where they ran the 
community's first grocery store and service station, according to Josie 
Hendricks, the Gibsons' longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Gibson recalled that the store, situated at the southeast corner of 
Ventura Boulevard and Oak Park Avenue, was a popular gathering place in the 
then-small community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only spot, regardless of politics," he told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 After the second Encino Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1936, Gibson served 
on the board of directors under entertainer Al Jolson, the chamber's first 
president. During many years with the chamber, he served as president, vice 
president, treasurer and secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 18, 1938, Gibson was appointed Encino's first postmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called the (postal) inspector and asked what I was supposed to do," he 
wrote of his appointment nearly 50 years later. "He said, 'You open a post 
office.' I knew what a stamp was, but little more. I bought two sections of 
boxes . . . built an office in the rear of our store and opened for business. I 
paid for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson served as postmaster until retiring in 1946. He later worked in real 
estate and was active with his wife in community affairs for many decades. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, the Gibsons retired to Santa Rosa. Frances Gibson died in 
February at age 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors do not include any immediate relatives and there will be no 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Lafferty & Smith Colonial Chapel in Santa Rosa is handling the arrangements. 
Gibson's cremated remains will be interred at Oakwood Memorial Park in 
Chatsworth and memorial donations may be made to the Encino chapter of the 
Kiwanis Club.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; ELWAY SAYS STATUS IS STILL UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denver Bronco quarterback John Elway says the final decision on his 
availability for Sunday's game against the Raiders at the Coliseum probably 
won't be made until that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway has a strained muscle in his left knee, an injury suffered last Sunday 
against the Kansas City Chiefs, sidelining him in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he could have faced the Raiders on Wednesday, Elway said, "I couldn't 
play right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, who has sat out six starts in his 12 pro seasons, is officially listed 
as questionable for Sunday. Although he is feeling better, he is not expected 
to practice at all this week. If Elway can't play, he will be replaced by Hugh 
Millen, who came in to lead the Broncos to a victory on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go in there and I'm not effective, Hugh might be able to be more 
effective," Elway said. "So I've got to be smart to where I'm not hurting the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Elway said he isn't sure the Raiders care whether he plays, considering that 
they have beaten Denver in 10 of their last 11 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're really not too concerned about it, because they've had a lot 
of success even with me in there," he said. "They are probably looking at it as 
if it doesn't matter who is in there." 
</P>
<P>
 It matters to Raider Coach Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will prepare for John Elway," he said. "I really feel John Elway is going 
to play. If there's any way to play, he's going to play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders do not expect to sell out by 1 p.m. today, the deadline for 
lifting the television blackout, but do expect, based on ticket sales, a large 
crowd. . . . The annual Raiders Toys for Tots program, run in conjunction with 
the U.S. Marine Corps, will be in operation at Sunday's game. Fans are 
encouraged to bring unwrapped toys that will be collected at the gates and 
distributed to needy children. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; CHANDLER WILL START AGAINST TAMPA BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he wanted to find a spark for his 4-9 team, Coach Chuck Knox will start 
Chris Chandler at quarterback in place of Chris Miller for Sunday's game 
against the Buccaneers at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, 2-2 as a starter this season, has been the coaching staff's leading 
candidate for the job but has been recovering from an ankle injury suffered in 
the Raider game. He came off the bench in the fourth quarter last week against 
New Orleans when Miller suffered a mild concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said Wednesday he is sound. Knox called the quarterbacks into his 
office separately to tell them of the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no reflection on Chris Miller," Knox said. "Both have started, and 
both have been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for a spark, Chandler played back at Tampa, and we felt it was 
time to do something. Miller just came off a head injury. There were a lot of 
reasons. " 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said Miller, 2-7 as a starter, will back up Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously I'm frustrated," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox can swap notes on team troubles with Tampa Bay Coach Sam Wyche, whose 
team also is 4-9 and whose job is also rumored to be on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wyche has one problem that Knox doesn't: heckling fans.  
</P>
<P>
 A group of Tampa fans behind the Buccaneer bench has been pretty tough on 
Wyche, who jabbed back at them Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You remember your first beer, don't you?" Wyche said. "These guys are 
reliving their childhood. There are eight of them now (behind the bench). . . . 
They memorized their one chant, and if they don't repeat it enough, they'll 
forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 And what chant is that? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jimmy Johnson chant," Wyche said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the Rams put rookie defensive tackle D'Marco Farr on the 
injured-reserve list and promoted defensive end Jay Williams from the 
injured-reserve list to the 53-man roster. . . . Injury report: Rams -- 
defensive tackle Jimmie Jones (ankle) and linebacker Joe Kelly (knee) are 
questionable. Tampa Bay -- linebacker Barney Bussey (shoulder) and defensive 
end Keith Powe (knee) are probable. MIKE REILLEY

BEVERLY HILLS BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT; HART TAKES SHOT, CAN'T CATCH BUENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't until Dave Pinsel's desperation three-point shot at the buzzer fell 
short Wednesday that the Buena High basketball team could collectively breathe 
a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 By withstanding a furious Hart rally in the final three minutes, Buena posted 
a 54-51 victory and advanced to Friday's semifinals of the Beverly Hills 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena will play against Loyola at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, defending tournament champion, nearly overcame a 10-point deficit in the 
final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians' 35-34 lead after three quarters disappeared when Buena scored 11 
consecutive points as Hart went five possessions in a row without a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an inexperienced team and we will learn," Hart Coach Mike May said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were too many turnovers and we can't afford to do that due to our lack 
of size." 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary lapse only set the stage for Hart's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mike Posey hit two three-point shots and converted a three-point play 
during the run for nine of his 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Posey's second three-pointer brought Hart to within 52-51 with 20 seconds 
remaining, but Buena's John Tobias sank two clinching free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Howrey had 16 points for Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena improved to 4-1 and Hart dropped to 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola 73, Cleveland 62 -- Unable to handle the Lions' press, the Cavaliers 
committed 22 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Bailey scored 25 points for Loyola (5-0) and Eric Bible had 11 for 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers are 1-4.

HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS / CITY SECTION GIRLS' INDIVIDUAL SEMIFINALS; TAFT'S FELDMAN 
AVOIDS GLARING MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tired old excuse "I couldn't see the ball because the sun was in my eyes" 
was used by a winner Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, Taft High singles player Julia Feldman said the glare of 
the afternoon sun provided more discomfort than the wind, the cool temperature 
and even her opponent, Ilona Kordonskay, in a 6-3, 6-4 victory in a semifinal 
of the City Section girls' individual tournament at the Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The north side of the court) was pretty bad," Feldman said. "I would serve 
and I wouldn't know what happened. . . . I couldn't see where the ball was 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior, who has a 47-2 record and was making her third consecutive 
semifinal appearance, will face Dorsey sophomore Kendra Segura in Friday's 1:30 
p.m. final. Top-seeded Segura is the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, who lost to Segura in the semifinals last year, is seeded second. In 
doubles, top-seeded Juanita Narida and Merry Arrogante of Carson eliminated 
Stephanie Shapiro and Terri Rosenthal of Taft, 6-0, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong server, Feldman pounded the ball into the brightness when she had to 
play the north side. But Kordonskay, also a hard server, was tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to play it safe, the freshman from Los Angeles High served softly from 
that side. Feldman attacked, hitting several winners off those easy serves. 
Four times in the first set, Feldman broke Kordonskay, who twice double-faulted 
on game point. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kordonskay covered the court well and displayed a dangerous backhand. She 
gained confidence in the second set, fighting off five break points and staying 
even at 4-4. But Feldman pulled ahead, 5-4, with a service winner and coaxed 
Kordonskay into two unforced errors in the freshman's final service to win the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about getting to the finals," Feldman said. "I'm looking forward 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Feldman lost in the final to then-teammate Brahna Pastorini. 
Her only other loss at Taft came in the 1993 semifinals to Segura, 6-3, 6-4. 
Segura went on to upset defending champion Pastorini, 6-7 (7-2), 6-2, 6-3, in 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Segura earned the right to defend her title Wednesday by defeating Dorsey 
teammate Delana Daniels, 6-4, 6-2.

BOYS' SOCCER / TEAMS TO WATCH; ROYAL, HARVARD-WESTLAKE MIGHT HAVE STRONGEST 
KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Led by Harvard-Westlake, boys' soccer will be well-represented among the 
area's Southern Section schools. The Wolverines boast a deep and experienced 
team that should advance far in the Division III playoffs and could well bring 
home a title. Notre Dame will challenge Harvard-Westlake in the Mission League 
and both Palmdale and Burroughs will present roadblocks in the section 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Southern Section, Royal will again be a power in Division I 
while Buena hopes nine new starters can put the Bulldogs in the Division II 
postseason for the sixth time in seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In the City Section, Birmingham looks to rise from last season's abbreviated 
and losing season on the feet of Gabriel Ortega, and should hold off Reseda and 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 BIRMINGHAM 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Jose Freire 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 3-4-1 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Blessed with a distinct home-field advantage and several strong 
upperclassmen, the Braves should be among the city's better teams this year.  
</P>
<P>
 While most of the section's teams labor in the cramped boundaries and dust of 
football fields, Birmingham is lucky enough to play on an Olympic-sized pitch 
(75 feet wide, 120 feet long) covered with grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having to share our field with anybody, we may have developed a little 
faster than the other teams," said Freire, whose squad is 2-0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other teams tend to get tired when they play us there, but also, when we play 
on a short field we get crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Freire has a crew that could operate out of a shoebox if necessary. Ortega, a 
junior and first-team North Valley League selection, leads the team from the 
midfield. He is also designated as the Braves' shooter on penalty kicks, having 
made four already this season and eight in the last two.  
</P>
<P>
 Midfielders, seniors and second team all-league selections Edwin Espranza and 
Jaime Tinajero will help Ortega control games, while sophomore stopper Joshua 
Smith has shown promise at keeping the ball in front of diminutive goaltender 
Edgar Delgado. 
</P>
<P>
 BURROUGHS 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Mike Kodama 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 15-7-3 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Kodama is upbeat despite returning only six varsity players from 
last year's team that won a third consecutive Foothill League championship and 
advanced to the Division III Southern Section final. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be able to handle the ball very well but we're young and small, so 
we'll try to keep the ball on the ground," said Kodama, who doesn't see his 
team winning many battles in the air. "This team has the potential to be as 
good as the Burroughs teams of recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Diaz, a senior midfielder who is the team's playmaker, is a cousin of 
Burroughs' 1993-94 All-American Roberto Perez, now at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior goalkeeper David Ramos should be a solid backstop, while senior Gabriel 
Santana and sophomore Claudio Navarette, both forwards, move up from the junior 
varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 BUENA 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Sean Roche 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 15-6-3 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Steady defense leads to steady play for the Bulldogs, who have made 
the Southern Section playoffs five of the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's team wound up second in the Channel League and advanced to the 
second round of the playoffs before bowing to Mater Dei. And they did it with 
consistency from the net out, led by goaltender Mark Thompson, who returns 
after posting 14 shutouts a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson may have to come up big early on, for Buena lost nine starters from 
last year's team. Senior fullback Shepley Brohammer and junior midfielder Jose 
Mendosa (two goals, nine assists) will be crucial to the attack, while senior 
striker Aaron Older (three goals, four assists) must find the net more often to 
keep the Bulldogs in close games. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Darryl Mundy, fresh from football, will find a spot somewhere in the 
lineup but Roche is unsure where to pencil in the fast and physical player. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys enjoy playing with each other and they should be able to handle 
stress better than most teams," Roche said. "Defensively we're strong; scoring 
on other teams could be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 PALMDALE 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Claudia Cline 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 22-2-2 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Cline moves up from the Falcons' junior varsity and inherits a team 
that advanced to the Division III quarterfinals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cline, who began her coaching career 12 years ago in area youth programs, will 
rely on seniors Raul Rossil and Bryce Sewalson in the midfield and a back line 
of seniors Justice Jones and Bryce Sewalson along with junior Geoff Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
 Firepower should come from junior forward Murad Dibbini, whose older brother 
Mike played for Palmdale last season and led the Golden League in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We typically play a defensive style but we're working on becoming 
well-rounded and on having everyone get into the game on offense," Cline said. 
"We strive to keep the game's pace fast." 
</P>
<P>
 KENNEDY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Fred Singer 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 16-4-2 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: A traditionally strong program, the Golden Cougars may struggle to 
make the playoffs this season as ineligibility and injury slow them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy won the Northwest Valley Conference championship last season and 
advanced to the City semifinals but suffered heavy losses to graduation on the 
back line, and will need younger players to step in immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 Junior midfielder/forward Adam Rofer scored nine goals last season and will be 
counted on heavily, along with defensive standout Robbie Shapiro, a senior 
sweeper. Senior goaltender Shawn Beattie will start for the third consecutive 
year after allowing only 1.1 goals a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 HARVARD-WESTLAKE 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Rick Commons 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 20-1-4 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Harvard-Westlake roared through last season's lengthy schedule 
without a hitch, reaching the semifinals of the Division III Southern Section 
playoffs before being dumped by Bell Gardens. The Wolverines allowed only 12 
goals all season and return seven starters, bad news for other local teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of talent coming back and we're probably the favorite (in the 
Mission League), but we had some very close games last year," said Commons, who 
has 11 seniors among his 16 players. "It's possible we could go a very long 
way, even all the way, in the playoffs. It's also possible that we could get 
knocked off by two or three teams in our league before we ever get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior captain and midfielder Warren Davidoff was the Mission League's 
offensive player of the year and a first-team All-Southern Section pick, 
scoring 13 goals. Senior midfielder Brian Angelini added seven scores and 
senior striker David Tuizer had three goals in the Wolverines' first three 
playoff games despite missing much of the season with a severe groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior goaltender Jay Rosen was a second-team All-Southern Section pick, 
posting 15 shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Ken Dale 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 14-5-2 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Though rookie coach Dale kept his program's supporters happy with a 
win and a tie over archrival Royal last year, he spent much of last season 
trying to get his team to play at a similar level against other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the kids, beating Royal is important and a lot of emphasis was placed on 
that," said Dale, who lost six starters from last year's team. "You want to 
beat the guys from your neighborhood and some of last year's seniors had never 
done that at any level. At the same time I'm disappointed we didn't have the 
same focus in other games." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a bad season all the same. Simi Valley finished second to Royal in 
the Marmonte League and placed center midfielder Alfonso Ruiz on the 
All-Southern Section second team. Ruiz is back to captain the Pioneers in his 
senior season after playing in the California Olympic Development program over 
the summer. He will team with junior forward/midfielder Sean Herrity, who 
played in France this summer with the U.S. under-17 national team, and senior 
midfielder Damon Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely need to make the playoffs; the tradition established here 
dictates that," said Dale, whose team fell to Hawthorne in the first round of 
last year's Division I playoffs. "But we lost a lot of defense to graduation so 
we'll need to possess the ball as much as possible and take a lot of shots." 
</P>
<P>
 NOTRE DAME 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Colin McFeely 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 16-8-1 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: Football isn't the only program at Notre Dame that relies on the leg 
of Chris Sailer. The senior kicker who recently set the state record for field 
goals in a season will turn his attention to helping the Knights' soccer team 
defend its 1994 Mission League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer scored 23 goals in as many games for Notre Dame and was the Mission 
League MVP and an All-Southern Section pick. His continued dominance from the 
midfield should boost the Knights, but a strong supporting cast won't hurt 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 McFealy lists senior midfielder Andres Padilla, junior striker Steve Lee and 
junior Jeff Teague, a positional nomad, as the workhorses for his squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla is an emotional leader, while Lee will seek to recapture the 
consistency of two years ago, when he scored 13 goals as a freshman. Teague is 
the team's unsung hero, described by McFeely as being "as consistent as the day 
is long." 
</P>
<P>
 ROYAL 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Kevin Corley 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD LAST SEASON: 21-4-3 
</P>
<P>
 SYNOPSIS: The past two seasons have ended in heartbreak for Corley and the 
Highlanders. After a pair of successful campaigns, the team has bowed out in 
the first round of the Division I Southern Section playoffs each season, 
including last year's defeat to Edison at home in a hailstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ranked No. 1 in Division I most of the year and to go out like that 
was very disappointing," said Corley, in his fourth year as coach. "In the past 
we've focused on offense but we have practiced team defense over and over this 
year because in the playoffs one little mistake can kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 This season holds the promise of further advancement, mostly due to a quartet 
of returning seniors, all of whom earned All-Marmonte League honors in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the four -- Tim Pederson (10 goals, 13 assists), Vince Alves (five 
goals, six assists) and Chris Fernandez (13 goals, six assists) -- are 
midfielders. Alves was an All-Southern Section selection and Pederson landed on 
the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth All-League player, 6-3, 220-pound goaltender Ty Russell, posted a 
1.2 goals-against average. A standout defensive lineman on the Highlander 
football team, he will be out at least three weeks after surgery for a hernia 
that he played with during the final weeks of the football season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be the best goalkeeper in our league by far," Corley said. 
"He's intimidating in there. Most teams will get one breakaway a game and then 
that's it, they don't want anything to do with him."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: John Phillips (eighth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 15-3-1, 6-0-1 in the Sea View League; although University was the 
league favorite in preseason polls, Irvine won its second consecutive title and 
was second to Calvary Chapel at Southern Section Division III championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Jeremy Brown, Sr., 125; Peter Hamilton, Jr., 112; Justin Meier, 
Sr., 135; Steve Ruiz, Sr., 189; Alan Rush, Jr., 140; Cris Testerman, Sr., 140. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Andrew Pena, So., 119; Zak Stevens, So., 135; Tim Testerman, 
So., 145. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Now that Calvary Chapel has moved to Division I and University is in 
the Pacific Coast League, Phillips thinks the Vaqueros can not only win their 
third consecutive league title but also have a shot at the Division II 
championship. Irvine, which lost only three starters from last year, is led by 
Meier, who qualified for the state championships, and Ruiz, who finished fourth 
in the section Division III finals. Phillips also has high expectations for 
league champions Testerman and Hamilton.

<P>
 Coach: John Azevedo (sixth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 17-0, 3-0 in the Olympic League; won its second consecutive State 
championship and in the process set a record for team points.Qualified eight 
wrestlers to the state tournament, where Shane Valdez (112), Ed Mosley (152) 
and Josh Holiday (145) won titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Mike Aquirre, Sr., 171; Joe Calavitta, So., 125; Josh Holiday, 
Sr., 152; Ed Mosley, Sr., 160. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Danny Robinson, Sr., 145; Matt Van Hook, Sr., 189. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Despite the loss of wrestling twins Shane and Dane Valdez, the Eagles 
are ranked No. 1 in the state in the Wrestler Assn.'s preseason poll. Though 
not popular among public schools because of their ability to recruit -- Aquirre 
is a recent transfer from Victor Valley High -- Azevedo and his "Church Boyz" 
pay no mind to the talk. Though not as strong as last season's team in the 
lower weights, the Eagles are seemingly unbeatable in the middle- and 
upper-weight classes. Barring any injuries, watch for Holiday, and maybe 
Mosley, to repeat as state champions.

wrestlers to the Southern Section Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Alex Coria, Jr., 125; Robert Droughns, Jr., 171; Reuben 
Droughns, Jr., 189; Hugo Herria, Jr., 112; Jose Lopez, Sr., 103; Manny Megia, 
Jr., 135; Leonard Ruiz, Jr., 152; Alexei Yanuaria, Sr., 130. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: None. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Mark thinks his team was shortchanged when the preseason rankings had 
the Colonists ranked sixth in the county. He believes they should be second 
only to Calvary Chapel. He has 13 returning starters, eight of whom are ranked 
in the top five in their respective weight classes. Maybe Mark has a point. In 
any event, Anaheim should do well this season. The Droughns brothers will no 
doubt have another good season. Also watch for Lopez, who went 42-7 last season 
and is ranked No. 1 in the county's preseason poll at 103 pounds.

BOYS' WRESTLING 1994-1995: WRESTLING PREVIEW; SIX TEAMS TO WATCH; LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Cliff Jarmie (12th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 15-1, 5-0 in the Pacific Coast League; breezed through its league 
schedule to win its sixth consecutive title but ran into Calvary Chapel in the 
Division III dual meet championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Casey Elliott, Sr., 152; Jeff Greco, Sr., 140; Mike Greco, Sr., 
145; Scott Morinoue, Sr., 135; Mark Zolikoff, Sr., Hwt. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Abel Bratton, Jr., 135; Thanh Nguyen, Jr., 119. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Jarmie thinks he has a strong group of experienced wrestlers, 
particularly in the middle and heavyweight classes. Jarmie said Elliott has 
been looking exceptional on the mat and might surprise some people. Heavyweight 
Zolikoff, who was league champion and qualified for the State tournament last 
season, should again be a strong performer. "Last year, we used up a lot of our 
energy on the Southern Section dual meet championships with Calvary Chapel," 
Jarmie said. "As a result, some of our guys were eliminated in the first round 
(of the section individuals). This year, we will focus all our energy on 
Southern Section (individuals) and Masters tournaments."

 Outlook: Ranked fourth in the county, the Vanguards not only have lost key 
people to graduation but also have to face Calvary Chapel in Division I. And

Modena will provide plenty of competition. Led by Ventimiglia, who took fifth 
at the Division I finals, and Klinker and Burns, who were Division I 
qualifiers, the Vanguards will be strong in the lower and middle weights. El 
Modena continues to move up strong wrestlers from the JV and frosh-soph ranks 
-- a testimony to Clinton's program.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE SALT OF THE EARTH?; SNOW ANGELS BY 
STEWART O'NAN ; DOUBLEDAY $25, 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every college generation deserves a "Catcher in the Rye" or "A Separate Peace" 
of its own, and this fine first novel seems a strong contender for the '90s. In 
Stewart O'Nan's "Snow Angels," 14-year-old Arthur Parkinson tells two distinct 
stories, never forcing the connection but allowing the lives of the Marchand 
family and the Parkinsons to merge, separate and rejoin in the small 
Pennsylvania town where both lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel is set in 1974, when Arthur is a high school freshman and his 
parents are separated and waiting for their divorce to become final. He's at 
band practice when gunshots startle the crowd of students. "What we had heard 
was someone being murdered, someone most of us know, if dimly." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim turns out to be Annie Marchand, who had baby-sat for Arthur and his 
sister years before, when the Parkinson family was intact and Annie was herself 
an ebullient teen-ager. Arthur's connection with her was more than merely 
casual. More than once as a child, he had caught himself wishing that 
vivacious, red-haired Annie was his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Arthur's sister, Astrid, is thousands of miles away with the Army in 
Germany; his father has moved out, and Arthur and his mother are living in a 
seedy apartment project, pretending not to mind their reduced circumstances -- 
and fooling no one. Caught between his hostile parents, Arthur is smoking too 
much pot, ditching school and retreating into a no-man's-land of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Marchand has grown up, married and had a daughter, but she and husband 
Glenn are no longer together. Annie is living alone with her toddler in an 
isolated, run-down house at the end of a cul de sac, working as a waitress at 
the country club and is in the midst of a pointless affair with a guy who just 
happens to belong to her best friend. Even though Glenn Marchand still adores 
her, Annie is bored with his fecklessness, tired of rushing home to a demanding 
child and a husband who's spent the day on the sofa with a six-pack and the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 She's vulnerable, and Brock picks up signals she hardly knows she's given. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur tells her story as he tells his own, letting the reader perceive the 
parallels and make the analogies. Butler, Pa., doesn't offer much beyond a 
decaying downtown, a shabby strip mall, a couple of fast-food places, the steel 
mill and the Home for Crippled Children where Arthur's mother works. 
</P>
<P>
 The best and the brightest leave town as soon as they can. Twenty years later, 
when Arthur and his sister go back to Butler for their annual Christmas visit 
to their mother, the name of the Home has been changed to the politically 
correct "Rehabilitation Center," but everything else is just as it was the year 
that Annie Marchand was killed and Arthur's father left home.  
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the town again, ritualistically driving past his old house, he tries to 
put the events of that pivotal season in perspective. In reliving the story of 
that particular winter, he finally succeeds in comprehending the pressures that 
led to his parents' breakup and to the Marchands' compound tragedy. He couldn't 
make sense of these things as an adolescent, but in retrospect, everything that 
happened seems predestined and inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Recollected, the bits and pieces of Annie Marchand's life create a distinct 
pattern of carelessness, disappointment and despair, each small and apparently 
insignificant incident building on the one before until the whole ramshackle 
structure crumbles, destroying an entire family. Told in roughly alternating 
chapters, the disparate elements of the novel fuse naturally, subtly but 
dramatically illustrating the inexorable process by which hope fades, ambition 
falters and love dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rueful and ironic, "Snow Angels" proves the enduring vitality of realism. Once 
you've finished it, your view of flyover towns and the people who live and work 
there will be radically and permanently changed. You won't soon forget the 
Parkinsons and the Marchands, and you'll wonder what happened to the folks who 
used to be called the salt of the earth and the backbone of America. The 
answers aren't easy, but they're worth exploring.

WESTSIDE WATCH: YACHTS TO ADMIRE IN MARINA DEL REY'S ANNUAL CHRISTMAS BOAT 
PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-two years after Marina del Rey yacht owners first festooned their boats 
with Christmas lights to celebrate the end of a fierce storm, 100 boat owners 
will do so again and sail Saturday evening in the annual Christmas Boat Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's theme is "Music of the Seven Seas," with former Limelighters 
troubadour Glenn Yarbrough, known as the Singing Sailor, leading the parade as 
grand marshal. As many as 75,000 spectators have gathered at past parades to 
watch the yachts, some adorned with pirate scenes, palm trees, and boxes of 
toys with music and animation. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's parade will begin with fireworks at 5:30 p.m. and is scheduled to 
last about two hours. Parking for spectators is available in 12 lots throughout 
the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing sites include Fisherman's Village, 13755 Fiji Way, and Burton Chace 
Park, 13650 Mindanao Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Any boat that can maintain 5 knots is eligible to enter. Boat owners can 
register until Friday evening. The entry fee is $50 for individuals, $80 for 
groups, $100 for office parties and $200 for businesses. Information: (310) 
821-7614.

 WIN, PLACE AND SHOW: Look no further for the most livable part of Los Angeles 
County. You're already there. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what Los Angeles magazine concluded in a survey contained in 
the current issue. The Westside won the trifecta when the mag rated Beverly 
Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica as the top three places to live out of 20 
communities ranked. 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings were based on criteria ranging from education and air quality to 
restaurants and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock Park and West Hollywood, also Westside territory, were fifth and 
sixth, respectively. (Manhattan Beach, in fourth place, kept the Westside from 
a clean sweep of the top six.) 
</P>
<P>
 After that, our fair Westside cities didn't fare so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood trailed in 11th place, its attractive neighborhoods eclipsed in the 
survey by lack of convenient shopping and cultural activities. Venice, which 
has been beset by crime problems, limped in at 16th place. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, somewhat surprisingly, Venice beat out Malibu, which wound up rated 
17th, followed by Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems Malibu lost points for being inconvenient and lacking first-rate 
restaurants, arts and entertainment, and a medical facility. 
</P>

<P>
 HIP HOP: Back by popular demand, UCLA Extension is offering a "Pet Rabbit 
Care" class in its winter catalogue for the third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular course is taught by Frank Lavac, a veterinarian at Wilshire Animal 
Hospital in Santa Monica, who says he now has 753 current rabbit clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of customers with pet rabbits and there's not a lot of 
information out there about how to take care of them," he said, noting that 
rabbits are his fourth-largest clientele after dogs, cats and birds. "Rabbits 
are becoming more popular pets -- they're clean, quiet, have distinct 
personalities and are very interactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Lavac's class will focus on basic care, behavior, and the prevention and 
treatment of typical medical problems such as broken toenails, respiratory 
problems and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 In his course, Lavac also recommends "The House Rabbit Handbook," a popular 
tome with chapters on how to bunny-proof your house, set up outdoor playpens, 
toilet train, travel and mix rabbits with other pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really fall in love with them . . . and with proper diets and medical 
care some rabbits can live as long as 10 years," he said.

 Somewhere, Bugs is smiling.

DEADLOCKED SANTA MONICA CITY COUNCIL UNABLE TO PICK MAYOR; POLITICS: NONE OF 
THE MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO WIN THE FOUR VOTES NEEDED. CITY ATTORNEY DETERMINES 
THAT JUDY ABDO SHOULD STAY IN THE OFFICE FOR NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With divided political alliances hopelessly deadlocked, the Santa Monica City 
Council was unable this week to elect a new mayor from within its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, with three newly inaugurated members, tried repeatedly to elect a 
mayor Tuesday, but none of the council members could garner the necessary four 
votes to win the largely ceremonial position. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 45 minutes of fast-paced voting on a mix of candidates, it became 
clear that no member would be elected, nor was any pair of council members 
acceptable to the full council to split the two-year term. The only agreement 
the council was able to reach was to table the election until next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadlock resulted in the first time in the city's 119-year history that a 
council failed to elect a mayor, although in recent years the council has found 
it necessary or preferable to divide the term between two members. 
</P>
<P>
 When an impasse appeared likely in the days before the vote, the city 
attorney's office reviewed the City Charter and determined that Judy Abdo 
should continue as mayor until another council member wins the post.  
</P>
<P>
 For several years, the council has been split between the entrenched Santa 
Monicans for Renters Rights and the Coalition for a Safe Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, although the renters rights group controls four seats on the 
seven-member council, the votes for mayor were divided between council members 
Paul Rosenstein and Ken Genser. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coalition for a Safe Santa Monica supports only three council members -- 
Robert Holbrook, Asha Greenberg and Ruth Ebner -- and has not been able to 
muster a vote from a council member backed by the renters group to elect one of 
them mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The council made more than a dozen nominations, trying to mix and match 
candidates to split the two-year term. But in no instance could Genser win more 
than two votes to serve two years as mayor, nor would he cast the necessary 
fourth vote for Rosenstein to win a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Admitting to be the spoiler to a Rosenstein win, Genser said later that he 
would only vote for Rosenstein if the two-year mayoral term was split between 
the two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days leading up to Tuesday's vote, some council members were actively 
negotiating to see who would wield the mayor's gavel. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook, who was the top vote-getter Nov. 8 and a senior member of the 
coalition, said he had received several calls from mayoral hopefuls Genser and 
Rosenstein. Although they wanted his help in winning the election, Holbrook 
said, they were not able to make any concessions to the coalition "because SMRR 
would be upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook said that if the council refused to back him for a full term as 
mayor, he would be willing to split the term with Rosenstein. The compromise 
between the renters group and the coalition might garner four votes -- if 
Rosenstein would agree, Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein, though, said he was not willing to split a term. He said that if 
he agreed to cast his vote for Holbrook to serve as mayor for one year it would 
adversely affect his already tenuous relationship with the renters group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not worth it to be mayor . . . to cast my lot with another camp," he 
said.

HOUSE OF BLUES DISPUTE SOUNDS POLITICAL NOTE; WEST HOLLYWOOD: COUNCILMAN 
ACCUSES MAYOR OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN ACCEPTING CAMPAIGN DONATIONS FROM 
CONTROVERSIAL NIGHTCLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was once a neighborhood controversy over the popular nightspot House of 
Blues is now fueling a political fight in West Hollywood City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have bitterly complained of traffic, noise and parking problems at 
the Sunset Boulevard nightclub and restaurant since it opened in May. Last 
week, West Hollywood City Manager Paul Brotzman took the unusual step of 
publicly defending his staff's response to the complaints before a crowded and 
testy meeting of the Planning Commission, which is now threatening to hold 
hearings on revoking the club's permit. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the issue sparked a political battle when freshman City Councilman 
Steve Martin accused Mayor Abbe Land of a conflict of interest on the issue 
because she accepted almost $13,000 in cash and in-kind contributions from 
House of Blues and its construction manager during her unsuccessful bid last 
spring for state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin suggested that had it not been for such donations, the city might have 
been more responsive to neighborhood complaints about the nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the absolute appearance of a conflict of interest here," Martin 
said. "It's very difficult to believe that these contributions did not impact 
the city's deliberations on House of Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 Land confirmed that her campaign received the donations but denied any 
favoritism for House of Blues. "I don't see it as a conflict of interest, given 
that I reported everything (on campaign disclosure forms) and have been quite 
upfront (that House of Blues must meet all of its permit requirements)," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, elected to the five-member City Council in April, has formed a loose 
coalition with two other council members, Paul Koretz and Sal Guarriello. The 
three have often been at odds with Land, who has wielded much influence in the 
city, along with Councilman John Heilman, a frequent ally. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign finance records, Land's largest campaign contribution 
during the reporting period that began Jan. 1 and ended March 17 was a $5,000 
donation made Feb. 8 by House of Blues. In May, House of Blues hosted a 
campaign reception for Land that amounted to an additional in-kind contribution 
of $5,389. 
</P>
<P>
 And Boston-based CT Management Inc., which managed the construction of House 
of Blues, gave the Land campaign $2,500 last December. The nightclub's 
developers were thus among Land's biggest backers during the hotly contested 
42nd District Assembly primary race. 
</P>
<P>
 Land was not the only West Hollywood council member to receive campaign money 
from House of Blues. The nightspot, founded by restaurateur Isaac Tigrett, gave 
$3,250 to Paul Koretz, one of Land's opponents in the Assembly primary. Koretz 
did not return a phone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the basic plan for House of Blues, a couple of years 
ago but the club has not yet met all of the conditions for its permanent 
occupancy permit. Community activists have argued that the city allowed House 
of Blues to open without sufficient parking, which severely disrupted traffic 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's 4 1/2-hour Planning Commission meeting included testimony by 
neighbors who blamed House of Blues patrons for a sharp increase in traffic, 
early morning noise and auto vandalism. The seven commissioners directed 
pointed questions to Brotzman and House of Blues general manager Steve Strauss 
about the nightclub's impact on the neighborhood. Brotzman told the commission 
that the city had underestimated the popularity of House of Blues and was 
working to correct parking and noise problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is scheduled to resume discussion of problems related 
to House of Blues on Dec. 15.

SANTAS KICK INTO GEAR; FUELED BY A MOTHER'S LOVE, BIKERS' GROUP MAKES TOY RUN 
TO HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For more than 15 years, Joyce Chance had been looking for a way to say thanks 
to UCLA Medical Center for prolonging the life of her 6-year-old son, who died 
in 1972 of liver cancer. She found the answer while riding on the back of her 
husband's Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past five years, Chance has been the force behind the annual UCLA 
Memorial Toy Run, sponsored by the Fullerton chapter of the Harley Owners Group 
(HOG), of which Chance is a member.  
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA gave Johnnie two years I wouldn't have had with him," Chance said. "I 
saw the HOG doing toy runs for other groups, and I said to myself, 'That's what 
I can do for UCLA.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning, about 90 bikers, many with toys strapped to their 
Harley-Davidsons, journeyed in a convoy on the Artesia (91) and San Diego (405) 
freeways from Fullerton and converged on UCLA Medical Center. With more than 60 
motorcycles parked in the hospital's outpatient drop-off area and bikers 
milling about eating doughnuts, the scene could have been a Harley-Davidson 
rally instead of a toy drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But there they were, more than 100 toys piled high on a long table and on the 
floor underneath. Gifts ranging from teddy bears to Tonka trucks, hand-held 
electronic games and strollers will be distributed primarily as Christmas and 
birthday presents to children who are patients at UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 Because most of the children were too sick to leave their beds and see the 
gifts, a swarm of leather-clad bikers went up to the ward to visit them. As if 
walking in a parade, the HOG members moved down the corridor, waving and 
calling out greetings to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 The smiles came slowly, although 3-year-old Sierra Penn, who sat in a stroller 
in the doorway of her room, had no such inhibitions. She blew kisses to the 
bikers, and even the burliest of the group blew kisses back. "Most of us have 
kids, so the fatherly and motherly thing comes out," said Jim (Wolfman) 
Fortier, director of the Fullerton HOG and a Long Beach police sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 One HOG member, with the permission of the nursing staff, brought his 
Harley-Davidson up to the third floor for show-and-tell. Dwayne Freeman, an 
11-year-old patient with his arm linked to a mobile intravenous unit, sat 
wide-eyed and speechless on the back of the motorcycle as he was rolled down 
the hall to his hospital room.  
</P>
<P>
 The scene left one biker teary-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't miss this for anything," said Joe (Tennessee) Herron, 35, who was 
sporting a long, bushy beard, leather vest and a handkerchief tied around his 
head. "Rain or shine, I'd be here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton HOG also donated $450 to UCLA's Child Life Program, which helps 
young patients accept their illnesses and adjust to being hospitalized. Much of 
the program, directed by Dr. Judith Golub, is focused on 40% of the children in 
the hospital -- those who must undergo painful and traumatic procedures such as 
bone marrow aspirations, transplants and chemotherapy.  
</P>
<P>
 Golub praised Chance's initiative in helping to make the young patients more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although many of our families do want to give something back to the hospital, 
not many of them have the determination that Joyce has shown in getting this 
together," said Golub, who also directs a special program for the 45 families 
whose children are patients with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance, a soft-spoken housewife, said the toy run is something that her son, 
like most children, would have enjoyed. Johnnie was found to have Wilms' tumors 
when he was 4, and was operated on several times at UCLA between 1971 and 1972. 
He spent up to five consecutive days hospitalized during his chemotherapy 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital did what it could to make the situation pleasant, Chance said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to have something like a picnic every Wednesday for the children, 
with clowns and games," she said. "For the kids who were bedridden, they would 
even wheel down the beds." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sadness she felt in those days about her son's illness is still vivid 
and painful, Chance said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go inside," she said, standing on the sidewalk outside the hospital. 
"I tried it last year, thinking I would be OK, then all of the memories come 
rushing back. But I don't need to do that. What I'm doing outside here -- it's 
enough."

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; 25-UNIT LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT MOVES FORWARD 
DESPITE OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite opposition from some residents, housing advocates are welcoming a 
series of favorable rulings by Los Angeles zoning administrators regarding 
construction of a 25-unit apartment building for low-income families in 
Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed development at 325 4th Ave., which will include one- to 
four-bedroom units with a maximum monthly rent of $569, would include a 
community garden, a barbecue area with picnic tables, a recreation room and a 
basketball and recycling area.  
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a real asset to the community, well-designed with lots of open 
space and recreation areas for kids and adults," said Steve Clare, executive 
director of the Venice Community Housing Corp., a nonprofit builder of 
affordable housing on the Westside that hopes to construct the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighborhood homeowners and landlords who are opposed to the project, 
called the Fourth Avenue Apartments, are concerned about what they say would be 
the detrimental effect of another low-income housing development in Venice. 
They point to crime and other problems that have plagued 14 federally 
subsidized apartment buildings in the area, known as Holiday Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group of people building this are well-intentioned do-gooders who are 
naive about the perils of renting to low-income people," said Peter Nott, a 
property owner in Oakwood for 17 years and a board member of the Oakwood 
Property Owners Assn. "These buildings attract a criminal and hard-core gang 
element who hang out in the property and sell drugs. . . . A bit of green grass 
and a recreation room is not going to solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The developers say their proposal differs markedly from the area's public 
housing projects because its design is geared toward the working poor. Tenants' 
work histories and income levels will be scrutinized, the management company 
will be on site and the housing corporation's board will be made up of people 
who live in the community, the developers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Multifamily housing often has problems with absentee landlords who don't care 
about the community," said David Kramer, the housing corporation's director. 
"But that's not the case because our community-based board will ensure this 
project is an asset to the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The housing corporation also plans to set up a job-training program for the 
area's youth to work on the development. Clare also said he will require the 
building's contractors to employ a significant number of skilled construction 
workers who live in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the $3.4-million project, which will be funded through a mixture 
of city housing department grants, tax credits and bank loans, say critics 
should look at the housing corporation's other affordable housing developments 
in Venice -- one each on Navy Street and Brooks Avenue and a 32-bed women's 
shelter on Westminster Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation's other projects "are running according to the way they said 
they were going to run, and I'm very confident they're going to do a good job," 
said Ivonne Guzman, a 30-year resident of Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is expected to go before the City Council for approval early next 
year. ADRIAN MAHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH-CENTRAL; POSTERS AND DOCUMENTS TRACE HISTORY OF BLACK 
PANTHERS; UNTIL THE LIONS HAVE THEIR HISTORIANS, TALES OF HUNTING WILL ALWAYS 
GLORIFY THE HUNTER.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This African proverb acts as a bookend to "All Power to the People," a 
showcase of protest posters, graphics, newspapers and government documents 
produced during the height of the Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Compiled by the West Los Angeles-based Center for the Study of Political 
Graphics, the 94-piece exhibition is at the Southern California Library for 
Social Studies and Research, 6120 S. Vermont Ave., through Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't understand the present if we don't understand history," said Carol 
Wells, one of the founders of the center and curator of the show. "If we really 
want to understand history, we have to look at these posters." 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old library and the center are nonprofit operations that collect 
material on social struggles and political movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition, which borrows its name from a 1969 poster by Black Panther 
artist Emory Douglas, takes the viewer on a historical tour from the beginnings 
of the party to its triumphant days of political empowerment and its demise 
through government intervention and intra-party splintering. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the issues that the Panthers tried to struggle against -- racism, 
illiteracy, health care, hunger -- are still issues today that need to be 
confronted," Wells said. "This is a show of what the Panthers wanted to 
accomplish and what happened to them. We are providing an introduction of what 
they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes of police brutality and racial violence captured on film or depicted by 
artists hang side-by-side, testament to the volatility of an era of black 
political empowerment that followed the 1965 Watts riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Part 1 of the series, "A Call to Arms," outlines how the party was modeled 
after the Community Alert Patrol, a watchdog organization formed to protect 
black citizens of Watts from unlawful police actions. Founded by Huey Newton 
and Bobby Seale, the Black Panther Party called on its members to bear weapons 
for self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The notorious 1970 poster of Newton in Panther garb, sitting in a peacock 
chair wielding an African spear in one hand and a machine gun in the other, 
opens the second series, "Serving the People." Eighteen posters and other media 
report the party's political ambitions, from free medical health clinics to a 
grocery giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other sections depict how the party grew and then was dismantled by 
violence and government subversion. FBI documents obtained through the Freedom 
of Information Act hang as evidence of government action to stymie the party's 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Struggle Continues," the last portion of the display, brings the party to 
the present with poster No. 90, "Free Geronimo Pratt." Pratt, who was the 
party's deputy minister of defense and head of the South-Central chapter, is 
serving a life sentence in the 1968 killing of a schoolteacher and the wounding 
of her husband. Pratt has steadfastly maintained that he was elsewhere at the 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the Panthers split in 1970, Wells said, Pratt was forgotten during his 
trial by infighting party members.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we do these (types of) exhibits, we don't expect people to agree. There 
are different ways in seeing the world," Wells said. "In collecting these 
posters, we are the historians for the 'lions.' " ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; VISITING CUBAN ARTIST LEAVES HIS MARK ON L.A. BY 
CREATING MURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEILA COBO-HANLON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Salvador Gonzalez paints at breakneck speed in the middle of the night, specks 
of bright yellow, red, black and blue flying from his brushes onto the huge 
canvas before him as music by Jean-Michel Jarre blares in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 By 6 the next morning, what began as an inspiration at the back space of 
Venice's Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) has become a 
bigger-than-life mural dominated by Yemaya, the Afro-Cuban goddess of the salt 
waters and protector of women. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon project late Friday and early Saturday was Gonzalez's way of 
leaving his mark in Los Angeles during his first U.S. visit. In doing so, the 
Cuban muralist worked in typical fashion: alone, without sketches or drafts. 
The result was an 6-by-20-foot canvas that the center plans to hang in 
locations that have yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just delighted he could paint this mural," said Gail Schwartz, the 
program director for the center, which donated the paint, canvas and space for 
the project. Gonzalez "is basically single-handedly creating the Cuban mural 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a task the 46-year-old, internationally known artist has taken to heart. 
Gonzalez has painted many murals on the walls of buildings in downtown Havana. 
Although he is critical of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, he says he mainly 
addresses cultural and religious themes in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my work is inspired by the values of ancient cultures," said the painter, 
who although he is half white belongs to the Afro-Cuban Yoruba religion. "Many 
artists re-create Hispanic cultures, but black culture has been historically 
disputed. I'm interested in promoting these values that are part of my people's 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Gonzalez has left images of his culture on walls in New York, Arizona 
and New Mexico, and plans to paint murals in New Jersey and Washington as part 
of his three-month U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great country, where many cultures converge and where each place 
signifies a new experience," he said. "It's a dream come true for me to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba, however, is his place in the world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said: "I know my country has problems . . . but I'm very much a man 
of Cuba, even if it's governed by the devil." LEILA COBO-HANLON

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; INQUIRY SOUGHT IN HANGING OF INMATE IN CELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have called for an investigation into the death of a jail inmate who 
allegedly hanged himself in the cell he shared with another prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmate, identified as Christin Alamira, 26, appeared to have used his 
T-shirt to suspend himself Sunday from the upper bunk in the two-man cell he 
shared with an unidentified prisoner in Santa Monica Municipal Jail, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamira, described by police as a transient from Mexico who was also known as 
Alberto Funis and Alfredo Medell, had been arrested Friday night and was 
awaiting arraignment on charges of selling rock cocaine to an undercover police 
officer, Santa Monica Police Sgt. Gary Gallinot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police said they believe Alamira's death was a suicide, they have 
asked the district attorney's office to investigate because it is unusual for 
prisoners to commit suicide in the presence of a cellmate, Gallinot said. The 
Los Angeles County coroner's office will conduct an autopsy, he added. SUSAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; FEMA SAYS IT WON'T PAY IF MUDFLOW CLEANUPS ARE NEEDED 
THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials in Malibu, still reeling from mudslides last winter, have learned 
that the federal government won't fund mudflow cleanups this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was notified in a letter from officials at the Governor's Office of 
Emergency Services that the Federal Emergency Management Agency will not pay 
for future mud cleanup, even though city hillsides are still unstable, covered 
only with shallow-rooted vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the Nov. 2 fire last year, soil experts predicted that it would be 
five to eight years before hillside vegetation grows enough to prevent erosion 
during rainstorms. In the months after the blaze, heavy rains triggered several 
mudslides in the city that required about $1.5 million in cleanup work -- 75% 
of which was paid by the federal government and 25% of which was funded by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing a dry dance instead of a rain dance," said John P. Clement, the 
city's public works director. Laguna Beach and Altadena have also received 
notice that they should not expect federal mudflow cleanup money next year, 
Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't afford rain right now," Clement said. "Where we used to have four or 
five crews out there cleaning up, now we'll only have one." 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu city officials received the bad news in a letter last month. City 
Manager David N. Carmany said he is working with the office of Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), whose district includes Malibu, to urge FEMA to 
change its stance. Laguna Beach officials are also taking part in the effort, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the two agencies met last October to discuss, among other 
things, flood and erosion projects proposed in Malibu. Sometime during the 
meeting, FEMA officials said Malibu would be ineligible for federal funds to 
pay for mud cleanups in the coming year. According to an OES spokesperson, 
Malibu has not been eligible for such funding since April, the official end of 
the federally declared "incident period" following last year's Nov. 2 
firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 In its letter informing Malibu of FEMA's decision, the state emergency 
services office made clear that it opposes the move. "Please be assured that we 
do not concur, and strongly believe that any such mudflows will be a direct 
result of the fire disaster," the state agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also cast some doubt on whether the city will receive federal 
funding for part of a $21-million erosion and flood control project planned for 
Las Flores Canyon to resolve a decades-old flooding and landslide problem. 
</P>
<P>
 During their review of Malibu's proposed project, the letter said, federal 
officials determined that FEMA would not pay for the purchase of nine 
flood-prone properties in the canyon. The officials did say that if a study of 
the proposed project "determines that the purchase of the property is required 
to stabilize the hillside," then FEMA will consider purchasing the properties.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; WEEKLY FILLS VOID LEFT BY PAPER'S DEMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new local newspaper, the Culver City Chronicle, distributed its first 
26-page issue Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The free weekly is being published by National Media Inc., which runs seven 
other local papers and distributes more than a quarter of a million copies a 
week, said Stephen Laxineta, chairman of the company.The Westsider, the West 
Hollywood Independent and the Hollywood Independent are among newspapers 
published by National Media. 
</P>
<P>
 It took National Media just two weeks to begin delivering the Culver City 
Chronicle to homes and businesses after the news broke that Coast Media 
Newspapers -- which had published another free weekly paper, the Culver City 
News -- had been seized by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS shut down 
Coast Media because the company failed to pay more than $228,000 in back taxes 
from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 National Media has its headquarters in the Mid-Wilshire district.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; NEW T.J. MAXX A BOON TO PLAZA'S HOLIDAY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the heels of the recent opening of a T.J. Maxx discount clothing outlet, 
anchor stores at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza reported higher sales and 
increased foot traffic the weekend after Thanksgiving, traditionally the year's 
biggest weekend for sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Marj Aldolph, general manager of Sears, described sales figures as "superb" -- 
22% higher than last Thanksgiving weekend.She attributed the success to the 
store's recent $2.5-million face lift and its proximity to the adjacent T.J. 
Maxx. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Robinsons-May and Broadway reported improved sales over last year, said 
plaza marketing director Linda Gray.  
</P>
<P>
 T.J. Maxx, part of the national retail chain that sells discounted name-brand 
clothing and other items, opened at the plaza Nov. 15. And foot traffic has 
been consistently busy since the opening, said store manager Yun Conger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a steady increase of people in here now," Conger said.  
</P>
<P>
 Day manager Yendas Harper said that while foot traffic has indeed been good, 
it has yet to compare with more established T.J. Maxx locations such as the one 
at Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of T.J. Maxx, which occupies six upper-level storefronts, boosts 
mall occupancy from 68% to 85%. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Bruning, vice president of the mall's developer, Alexander Haagen 
Properties, said holiday sales are already 25% over last year.

 At the Nuart Theatre in West Los Angeles, patrons forsake creature comforts 
for the sake of cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the foremost theater in Southern California devoted to first-run art 
films, old-movie revivals and documentaries, the Nuart has carved out its own 
niche in the annals of theater exhibition. It has given important early 
bookings to a host of young directors who went on to greater glory -- John 
Waters, David Lynch and Jane Campion, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters' "Pink Flamingos" and Lynch's "Eraserhead," two '70s films now 
considered classics, each received important early exposure at Nuart midnight 
screenings, which attract a colorful mix of aging hippies, tweedy cineastes , 
leather-clad punkers and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as the Nuart marks its 20th anniversary under the same management, the 
venerable movie house finds itself at a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Landmark Theater Corp., co-founded in 1974 to operate the Nuart, was acquired 
in 1991 by the Samuel Goldwyn Co., which has since embarked on an aggressive 
national expansion. Based in West Los Angeles, Landmark now runs 120 screens in 
16 cities, employs 1,000 people nationwide and is building new multiscreen 
theaters in San Francisco, Minneapolis and Boston. The company also operates 
two other Westside first-run specialty houses, the Pavilion in Rancho Park and 
the NuWilshire in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts say the so-called multiplexes, along with the rise of home 
video, have gone a long way toward making single-screen theaters like the Nuart 
all but obsolete. But Landmark insists its 550-seat flagship theater on Santa 
Monica Boulevard can thrive in the changing marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one builds single-screen theaters anymore," concedes Landmark President 
Steve Gilula. But, he adds, "the Nuart is a unique institution." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuart owes its singularity, in part, to the rise of independent films in 
the last decade or so. This has given art cinemas plenty of new movies -- 
allowing the Nuart, for instance, to offer such sleeper hits as Campion's 
"Sweetie" and Gus Van Sant's "Drugstore Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, the availability of old movies on video and cable TV has 
made it harder for theaters that show classics to attract audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Nuart, like a handful of other art theaters nationwide, has survived 
with a crazy quilt of offerings -- some old movies, some new, some totally 
obscure. The eclectic mix is reflected in the four-color calendar that the 
theater publishes every three months, replete with boxes of blurbs and photo 
cutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuart's programming has slowly evolved since the mid-1970s, when Gilula 
and partners Gary Meyer and Kim Jorgensen took over the theater and devoted it 
almost entirely to revivals of old movies. Such theaters were called 
"grindhouses" because they showed a different double-feature bill every night. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the Nuart had, like many art cinemas, fallen on hard times. Built 
during the 1920s, the theater played studio pictures that had just finished six 
or eight weeks in the plush movie palaces along Hollywood Boulevard. Then, 
during the '50s and '60s, the Nuart began riding a wave of high-brow foreign 
films by Ingmar Bergman and others. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late 1960s, U.S. studios had begun making bolder, more artistically 
challenging pictures that competed favorably with the foreign films. Movies 
such as "Midnight Cowboy" and "The Godfather" sold out at neighborhood theaters 
that were previously not known for showing cutting-edge cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuart and many other art cinemas survived by showing racy potboilers and, 
later, soft-core pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a theater operator, you've got to keep the doors open," Meyer said. 
"They found out sex was selling and subtitles weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilula, now 44, and Meyer, 46, were both fresh out of college when they met in 
the film-buying department at United Artists Theaters in San Francisco during 
the early 1970s. After a brief period working for a small film company, Gilula 
in 1974 teamed up with Jorgensen to run the Nuart. Meyer became involved in 
programming the UC Theater in Berkeley, which was another early Landmark 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer handled film bookings from his native San Francisco as Gilula managed 
Landmark's growth from Los Angeles. During the mid-1970s, the chain more than 
doubled its number of screens (from four to 10), using internal cash flow and 
financing from a concessionaire. In the early 1980s, Landmark -- so named 
because many of its theaters were in historic buildings -- merged with Movie 
Inc., a New Mexico-based exhibitor that ran about 13 single-screen theaters in 
the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the company grew, Gilula kept the atmosphere relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one in our office wears a suit and a tie," he said. "We're high-energy and 
intense but very casual about the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer spent much of his time screening new movies and traveling to film 
festivals. But he and the other principals realized that a slate of old movies 
wasn't enough for a single screen like the Nuart. They needed a gimmick. So, in 
addition to reviving movies ranging from "Casablanca" to "A Clockwork Orange," 
the Nuart -- like some other art theaters around the country -- began offering 
midnight screenings of fringe cinema, including films by Waters, Lynch and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon midnight movies became a cultural phenomenon from coast to coast. Fans of 
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" packed screenings at which they sang, danced 
and wore outrageous costumes inspired by the comic musical. The events became 
more live theater than cinema -- and remain so to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an occasion for the audience to identify itself, to cluster around a 
particular movie," said Jim Hoberman, film critic of the Village Voice and 
co-author of the book "Midnight Movies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Often these were films regarded as outre , and in midnight screenings they 
could be released without the typical procedures of reviews and conventional 
release patterns," Hoberman said. "The films could catch on and be an in-group 
kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Theaters in New York were the first to show Waters' "Pink Flamingos" and 
Lynch's "Eraserhead," but both directors credit the Nuart for giving their 
careers an early boost in the film capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nuart ran 'Pink Flamingos' for 10 years, for heaven's sake. Talk about 
good legs," Waters said in a telephone interview. "It's still a theater (where) 
I go to to see a film. . . . It always had the films that took the most 
chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes these runs led to special relationships between certain directors 
and the Nuart. For instance, Waters made a short film for the Nuart about 10 
years ago that was soon picked up by other theaters nationwide. The film showed 
the director smoking a cigarette and reminding audiences that the law 
prohibited smoking in a public theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "But don't you wish you had a cigarette now?" Waters asked viewers. "Go ahead 
and smoke. It gives ushers jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 By then, many viewers had begun watching old movies on VCR and cable and 
stopped going to revival houses. Over the past dozen years, the number of 
Landmark screens devoted solely to old movies has dwindled, from almost two 
dozen to about four or five. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer and Gilula (Jorgensen left the company in 1982) began mixing more 
first-run foreign and independent movies into the Nuart's revival programming. 
They scored some big successes with Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" and the 
director's cut of "Blade Runner," among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger with Goldwyn three years ago benefited both parties. To expand, 
Landmark needed capital that could be provided by a large, publicly traded 
company. Goldwyn, meanwhile, was interested in acquiring the theater chain to 
help diversify its holdings beyond TV, and movie production and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer Gottlieb, president and chief operating officer of the Samuel Goldwyn 
Co., said that the audience for specialized movies such as those shown at the 
Nuart is the fastest-growing segment of the market, accounting for almost 20% 
of the $5-billion annual box office ticket sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldwyn has so far resisted the temptation to turn the Nuart into a 
reconstituted movie palace. Unlike the El Capitan or Chinese theaters in 
Hollywood, the Nuart has no grand rococo details or stately lobbies. Instead of 
classical or easy-listening music before the feature, the speakers pipe out 
be-bop jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nuart patrons come for the movies, not the ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not the most comfortable theater in the world, but that's a 
small price to pay for what they show," said Jonathan Benair, a Los Angeles 
screenwriter who has frequented the Nuart for years. Meyer said that Landmark 
prefers to spend money on upgrading sound and projection equipment rather than 
interior design, but he added that a new curtain is on order. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's main marketing tool remains the calendar, which is distributed 
in the lobby and at area coffeehouses and bookstores. The current issue 
advertises a December run of "Red," the final segment in a trilogy by Polish 
director Krzysztof Kieslowski, and a special series of old noir films in 
February. And there's a Betty Page look-alike contest on Jan. 6, at a midnight 
screening of some rare burlesque reels featuring the famous '40s and '50s 
pinup. 
</P>
<P>
 The eclectic approach has captured a broad cross-section of film-goers. Benair 
said he often sees the seats fill up with hard-core movie buffs he calls "film 
geeks." But he said the theater also attracts large numbers of teen-age punks, 
college kids, music fans, and gays and lesbians, many of whom are drawn by 
special series. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the theater's obvious following, though, some wonder how much longer 
the Nuart and other single-screen theaters can survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Single screens "are the dinosaurs of exhibition," said Bob Laemmle, owner of 
the Laemmle Theatres, a chain that competes with Landmark for bookings and 
viewers. Two years ago, Laemmle opened the Sunset 5, an art cinema multiplex in 
West Hollywood that has successfully combined first-run art movies at night and 
classic revivals on weekend mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really need to spread costs over a multiple number of screens to continue 
to function," Laemmle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilula admits that a multiplex has certain advantages over the Nuart. Meyer, 
who still does most of the theater's booking, has very little margin of error 
because a flop movie cannot close before the ending date posted in the 
calendar. Sometimes distributors want their pictures to have time to develop an 
audience instead of being locked into a fixed run. Sometimes audiences just 
aren't interested in certain pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilula explained the disappointing results of one special series this year by 
noting, "I'm not sure people wanted to see films about human rights."  
</P>
<P>
 But Gilula says that, despite the odds, the Nuart has stayed profitable and 
grown into a cultural institution with formidable staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater really has its own reputation," he said. "It provides an outlet 
for films people could see nowhere else. It's raised the consciousness and 
broadened the taste of a whole generation of filmgoers."

REGIONAL REPORT: INGLEWOOD; CITY'S MURDER RATE RANKED 14TH IN ANNUAL FBI SURVEY 
OF MAJOR U.S. CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER

<TEXT>
<P>
 There it is, listed among the 25 most murderous cities in the United States 
and next to places whose reputations for violence are known nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 The inconspicuous South Bay suburb of 112,000 -- better known as the home of 
the Los Angeles Lakers than as a center of crime -- had the 14th-highest murder 
rate in the country in 1993 for cities with populations over 100,000, according 
to a Federal Bureau of Investigation report released Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Gary, Ind., ranks first on the list of 25, with 89.9 murders per 100,000 
residents. Oakland comes in at 13th, one notch worse than Inglewood. Detroit is 
fifth. Los Angeles is last on the list, and notoriously dangerous New York City 
doesn't even appear. 
</P>
<P>
 But Inglewood -- quiet, middle-class Inglewood -- sits smack in the middle 
with a rate of 39 murders for every 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 If the statistics aren't exactly what Inglewood Police Chief Oliver Thompson 
wanted to hear, neither do they come as any great surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that people kill people in this town," Thompson said. "But I live 
in this city, and I think the city is a very safe place. I don't make too much 
of statistics, whether they're good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the figures in the FBI's annual report, called Crime in the United 
States, could be broken down in a variety of ways, and adjusting the parameters 
slightly can drastically change the outcome.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearby Compton, for example, does not make the publicized top 25 list because 
it has 96,500 residents, just missing the 100,000 population cutoff. Had it 
been factored in, Compton would be fifth on the list, nearly doubling the 
Inglewood murder rate, with 64.1 murders per 100,000 residents. ERIC SLATER

OUT AND ABOUT / 'JAZZ ON TAP': FANCY FOOTWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about fast-moving feet. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts sponsors "Jazz on Tap," 
a multi-generational lineup of tap artists performing everything from 
traditional jazz favorites to trendy hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic director and master of ceremonies Cholly Atkins, best known as the 
creator of Motown-style dancing and as half of the tap duo Coles & Atkins, has 
brought together a talented group of dancers. Scheduled to appear tonight 
through Saturday at the Wadsworth Theater are Dianne Walker, LaVaughn Robinson, 
Fred Strickler, Van Porter, Germaine Ingram, Wayne Doba and the Nicholas 
Sisters, granddaughters of the famed Nicholas Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really getting to see tap-dancing at its best," said Strickler, a 
51-year-old Riverside resident and longtime tap performer. There is a 
"wonderful, friendly one-upmanship" among the performers, Strickler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances will feature virtuoso tap-dancing, jazz music, popular show 
tunes and vintage film clips. Tappers perform class acts, funk, hip-hop, jazz 
and comic pieces accompanied by a local jazz trio. Some performers dance alone; 
others perform in duos, trios and with full ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for using their feet as percussive instruments, tappers are musicians as 
well as dancers. The toes tap the melody and the heels play the bass.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz on Tap" celebrates a legendary art form that has been nearly lost. 
Tap-dancing reached its height of popularity on the Broadway stage and in 
Hollywood musicals more than six decades ago. The uniquely American art form 
suffered a decline between the mid-1940s and the late 1960s, when television 
and rock music came onto the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, tap-dancing's popularity has experienced a resurgence of 
sorts as young artists attempt to carry on the tap heritage and forge new 
styles that are hip to today's music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tap artists are pushing (the craft) forward with new things like hip-hop," 
said Strickler, who began dancing professionally at age 19. "This (show) is a 
celebration of dancing and the human spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz on Tap," Wadsworth Theater, Wilshire and Sawtelle boulevards, Westwood, 
8 tonight through Saturday. All shows feature a pre-performance discussion at 7 
p.m. with Dave Gere, faculty member of the UCLA Dance Department. Tickets are 
$28, $25 and $9 for students. Reservations and information: (310) 825-2101.

ACTIVISM: REMEMBERING BERKELEY'S FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louise Yarnell's depiction of the world of the '64 Free Speech Movement (UC 
Berkeley Activists of '64 Return to Takeover Site," Dec. 4) as one where even 
the slightest hint of nonconformity could bring taunts of "Commie" or "Red" is 
unmitigated hogwash. Certainly those nonconformists who actually endorsed 
Communism and socialism as the wave of the future earned those comments.But 
there were many different forms of nonconformity in those days and the catcalls 
Yarnell describes were generally reserved for those who deserved them. 
</P>
<P>
 Amusingly, the nonconformists did change much of the way today's America views 
society. Among other things, it's hard to stand out as a nonconformist in 
today's immediate world where -- as Democrat Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
points out -- we have defined "deviancy down." 
</P>
<P>
 And certainly it is wondrous, indeed, to watch the tenured professors who led 
the countrywide "Free Speech" Movement impose, in today's world, the most 
restrictive and stifling of speech codes on our university campuses in the name 
of "political correctness." But then the legacy of Mario Savio and his 
followers is historically one of evolving hypocrisy -- Yarnell's somewhat 
romanticized vision notwithstanding. These are the same folks, mind you, who 
accuse conservatives of living in the past while they celebrate what looks 
increasingly like lifetimes of adolescent self-indulgence misrepresented as 
"protest" and "activism."

 REVOLVING DOOR 
</P>
<P>
 The merry-go-round for football coaches at Playa del Rey St. Bernard took 
another spin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Yarnall, the school's longtime baseball coach who became football coach on 
an interim basis, resigned Monday. Yarnall served as co-coach with Tom Burgess 
after Mike Noonan resigned three days before the start of the season. Burgess 
also has decided not to return. The pair led the Vikings to a 5-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be back," Yarnall said. "I enjoyed it, but I'm going to 
stick to baseball. To me, football is just a brute-strength sport. Baseball is 
more of a finesse game. Besides, I have more knowledge of baseball than 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings will be looking for their fourth coach in four years. Tom 
Strickland resigned one month before the start of the 1993 season and was 
replaced by Noonan. Yarnall said 15 people have applied for the position, 
including defensive coordinator James Swain and offensive coordinator Kevin 
Crawley. Crawley is a former head coach at Gardena Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 A new coach is expected to be announced before Christmas vacation. FINAL FOUR 
</P>
<P>
 After two dramatic comeback victories, UCLA has qualified for the NCAA 
semifinals in soccer and will play top-ranked Indiana on Friday at University 
of Davidson in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (18-4) came back from a one-goal deficit to beat Charleston, 3-2, 
Sunday in the quarterfinals. UCLA led, 1-0, early in the second half, but 
Charleston scored two quick goals after goalkeeper Chris Snitko and fullback 
Frankie Hejduk received red cards and were ejected from the game. Snitko and 
Hejduk must sit out the semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing with only nine men, the Bruins came back when midfielder Eddie 
Lewis headed an Ante Razov free kick in the net at 80:51. Greg Vanney scored 
the game-winner nine minutes later. Vanney also scored the winning goal in a 
dramatic 4-2 victory over Southern Methodist on Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid is one win away from his 250th career victory. SHIRTS 
AND SKINS 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester will play host to Inglewood on Friday at 7 p.m. in one of the 
biggest high school boys' basketball games of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The game pits Inglewood forward Paul Pierce against the Comets' talented 
guards Danny Walker and Ben Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Weschester Coach Ed Azzam complains his team "has nothing to wear" for the big 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Honest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any (home) uniforms," Azzam said. "We ordered uniforms from a 
new sporting goods store, but the shipment has not arrived yet. The way they 
talk, I don't expect to get them before the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Westchester wore its away uniforms in the Comets' 67-56 
season-opening victory over Washington at Washington. The Comets have not 
played since then. 
</P>
<P>
 To say Azzam is upset would be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are probably another 20 schools in the same boat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their season opener, Sanders scored 17 of his 23 game-high points in the 
second half. Tarik Bragg, who had 12 points, and Jarvis Young, who had 11, were 
the only other Comets in double figures. KEEPING QUIET 
</P>
<P>
 The way Jeff Porter tells it, the Brentwood girls' volleyball team didn't 
really need his coaching to win its second consecutive State Division V 
championship. But don't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first team I have ever had that did not need a whole lot of 
coaching," said Porter, who is in his 18th season as Eagles coach. "We had 
talent, we had experience and a real good knowledge of strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the Eagles had some outstanding players. Sarah Neal has great touch 
for a setter. Kelly Gentile is one of the Westside's most powerful hitters. 
Erin Hawkins, Katherine Kuchenbecker and Karin Friederic also are talented, 
well-disciplined hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal and Gentile were selected co-players of the year in Southern Section 
Division V. Hawkins also was named to the first team, while Kuchenbecker was 
picked to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Their talent was evident in a decisive 15-8, 15-5, 16-14 victory over Oakland 
College Prep in the state final Saturday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took coaching for the Eagles to accumulate an impressive two-year mark 
of 49-2. They have won 13 Delphic League titles, including seven in a row under 
Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles may have had the athletic ability to win, but it was Porter who 
inspired the team to play their best. REBUILDING? 
</P>
<P>
 Take away St. Bernard's twin towers and the Vikings will become an average 
girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings still have a winning program despite 6-3 forward Olympia Scott and 
6-4 Marte Alexander taking their games to Stanford and Arizona, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 They may be smaller, but not considerably weaker. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard beat Banning, 58-45, Saturday in the final of the South Torrance 
Tournament, completing a 4-0 tournament. The Vikings beat highly regarded 
Carson, 62-39, Friday in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're better than people think," said St. Bernard Coach Lori Pawinski, who 
has guided the Vikings to two consecutive State Division IV titles. "We're a 
lot faster and we shoot well from the perimeter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings were led in the South Torrance Tournament by returning point guard 
Tracie Oaks, who averaged 20 points and seven assists in the four games. Small 
forward Nicole Monette averaged 15 points and three three-pointers a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be young, but we can play," Pawinski said. TOURNAMENT TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from an encouraging fourth-place finish in the Las Vegas Invitational, 
West Los Angeles College's basketball team will play tournament host Cuesta 
College in the Mid-State Classic in San Luis Obispo. 
</P>

MAYOR NOMINATES BLACK FOR SEAT ON FIRE COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of mounting allegations of discrimination and sexism in the Los 
Angeles City Fire Department, Mayor Richard Riordan has nominated an African 
American businessman to a vacant seat on the Fire Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office said Wednesday that his choice of Kenneth T. Lombard, who 
now sits on the Metropolitan Water District board, was based on Lombard's 
qualifications for the post and was not made in response to calls for a black 
on the commission that oversees the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombard said the mayor had first approached him about filling an upcoming 
vacancy on the Fire Commission several weeks ago, before the release of a city 
audit last month detailing the difficulties faced by minorities and women in 
the department. Most of the top department posts are held by white men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Commission has had no black representative since Riordan took over 
from Tom Bradley in July, 1993, and called for resignations of all 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department, which has denied any wrongdoing, has come under 
increasing criticism and scrutiny, which was heightened by the release this 
week of a videotape showing the struggles of women recruits. A divided Fire 
Commission voted Nov. 23 for an independent review of department hiring and 
promotion practices, and several City Council members have castigated 
department leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombard, 40, a business partner in basketball great Magic Johnson's bid to 
bring a movie theater complex to the Crenshaw area, said he wants to reserve 
judgment on the Fire Department until he can review the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 A venture capitalist who helped build shopping centers in Watts and other 
urban areas, Lombard said he met Riordan in a business capacity and later 
supported Riordan's campaign for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombard said he believes that "having diversity on all the commissions has 
been a priority" for Riordan and that the issue has come up "in every 
conversation I've had with the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 The choice was hailed by an official of the Stentorians, an organization of 
black firefighters that has pushed for African American representation on the 
commission in the wake of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an urgent first step the mayor needed to take," said Melanie Lomax, 
legal counsel for the Stentorians. "When a Fire Department is dominated by 
white males, it is critical that you have a Fire Commission that represents the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the mayor's statement last week that ethnicity would not be a factor in 
the appointment, Lomax said she was "really surprised, but favorably surprised, 
that Mayor Riordan is taking this step. . . . He indicated he would appoint 
based on qualifications, and I'm glad he found someone who is African American 
and meets his standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Lomax said she does not know Lombard but added that he has a reputation as 
"reasonable and a moderate." 
</P>
<P>
 If the appointment is confirmed by the City Council, Lombard will replace 
Michelle Park-Steel, who resigned to accept an appointment to the Airport 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development Wednesday, three former female firefighters at a news 
conference blasted Fire Chief Donald O. Manning for characterizing the video as 
a harmless compilation of bloopers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manning had said their protective garb made it impossible to tell the gender 
of the recruits in the video. But one of the women, a member of the Fire 
Academy class featured in the footage, said that she can identify all the 
recruits who made the mistakes and that all of them are women.  
</P>
<P>
 "(The video) documents an assault on a woman's right to work in the Los 
Angeles Fire Department," said Kay Harter, 22, who quit the academy two weeks 
before graduation. She said the training exercises "were intended to discourage 
us from our dreams of becoming firefighters."

WEEDING OUT OF SIMPSON JURORS BEGINS; TRIAL: TWO ALTERNATES ARE ALLOWED TO 
LEAVE. THEN A LENGTHY CONFERENCE BETWEEN JUDGE AND LAWYERS AND A HEARING HALTS 
PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing in on the end of a process that began more than two months ago, the 
judge and lawyers in the O.J. Simpson murder trial completed their questioning 
of alternate juror candidates Wednesday and began weeding out the group of 
panelists who have come this far. 
</P>
<P>
 Two prospective alternate jurors were allowed to leave, and then Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito huddled with the attorneys in a long, private 
conference. After conferring for more than an hour, Ito told most of the 54 
remaining jurors and alternate jury candidates that they could go home for the 
day and return this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues that have come up, and I have to deal with, are relatively 
complex," Ito said. "I anticipate that I will spend the rest of the afternoon 
dealing with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not specify what the issues were, but a source close to the case said 
they were related to allegations that at least one member of the jury panel may 
have been guilty of misconduct -- a broad charge that can include anything from 
improper contact with attorneys to inadvertent exposure to publicity involving 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito closed his courtroom for the hearing and excused most of the 
panel for the day, he did ask five panelists to remain. The five included three 
members of the jury itself and two prospective alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, both of those potential alternates were excused as 
well, emerging from the secretive hearing with little comment on what had 
transpired. That left a pool of 40 under consideration for possible service. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanticipated hearing ground the process to a halt, as surprise 
developments have done time and again since jury selection began Sept. 26. 
Because of the latest glitch, the two sides failed to settle on a dozen 
alternate jurors who will be called into action if any of the panel's original 
12 members are excused between now and the end of the trial, in which the 
football Hall of Famer is charged with killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. Simpson has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and the attorneys will return to court this morning in the hope of 
concluding jury selection, which Ito has called the most difficult and delicate 
task confronting him as he oversees the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can finish that this morning, the judge and lawyers will move to 
consideration of several legal issues, one of which could alter the composition 
of the jury panel almost as soon as it is seated. Ito has scheduled a hearing 
for today to consider possible juror misconduct, apparently a continuation of 
the session that he began Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said in court earlier this week that "we may 
be losing someone from our panel of 12." 
</P>
<P>
 Although both sides have long feared that some panelists would be lost by the 
time the case is over, few had expected the attrition to begin so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the two sides could begin exercising their peremptory challenges 
for alternate jury candidates Wednesday, several panelists asked to be excused. 
One prospective alternate announced that she had written to the judge to 
explain why she should not remain on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 That woman, a 53-year-old telephone company employee from Compton, was one of 
the five panelists asked to stay after the rest of the group had been allowed 
to go home for the day. She ultimately was excused, declining to comment in 
detail as she left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stressful to me," the woman said. "This is for someone who doesn't have 
a life. I have a life." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said in court she recently had been approached by a friend who asked 
her why Judge Ito agreed to give a televised interview even as he was 
dismissing potential jurors for being exposed to media coverage of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably like my father: 'Do as I say to do, not as I do,' " the juror 
said she responded. She turned to Ito and added: "Sorry, judge." Ito smiled and 
shrugged, declining to pursue the topic, which has become a source of 
embarrassment and has subjected him to withering criticism from a number of 
legal commentators. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wednesday's hearing did not conclude the jury selection process, it 
did provide each side with one last opportunity to speak to the jury candidates 
as a group -- all 12 of the original jurors and every potential alternate was 
in court -- and to emphasize particular elements of their cases that they want 
the jurors to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the jury selection process, prosecutors have tried to demonstrate 
to prospective jurors that circumstantial evidence need not be considered any 
less reliable than direct, eyewitness testimony. The prosecution case against 
Simpson is thought to rely heavily on circumstantial evidence such as the 
results of DNA tests that may link Simpson to the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 That testing has been under way for months, and at least one batch of tests is 
now all but complete, according to a Dec. 5 letter from Simpson lawyer Robert 
L. Shapiro addressed to Clark and Ito. In that letter, Shapiro wrote that PCR 
tests -- one type of DNA analysis -- have been completed at a Maryland 
laboratory and are "virtually complete" at a state Department of Justice 
laboratory in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tests probably will play a large role in the government case, and 
prosecutors have sought to impress upon jurors that circumstantial evidence 
from such results is in many ways just as reliable as eyewitness testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 To make that point, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman has occasionally 
employed a simple demonstration: On numerous occasions, he asked prospective 
jurors to watch as he held up a pen and then dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jury candidates could not see the pen hit the floor from where 
they sat, Hodgman noted that they could use their knowledge about the laws of 
gravity to conclude that the pen logically fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, however, Shapiro tried to subvert Hodgman's example by mimicking 
the demonstration. After dropping his own pen, Shapiro asked the jury 
candidates where it had landed. Several responded that it had hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shapiro reached down and emerged with a box, showing the members of the 
panel that the pen actually had landed in the container, not on the floor. 
Their misimpression, Shapiro said, illustrated the perils of relying on 
circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Clark dismissed Shapiro's demonstration as "this little trick" and 
accused Shapiro of trying to deceive the jury candidates. She also urged jurors 
to dismiss anything they have heard about the wildly speculative accounts of 
the murders that have dominated tabloid -- and some mainstream -- news coverage 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 When the attorneys reconvene in Ito's courtroom today, they hope to at last 
finish jury selection, a milestone that will allow the case to proceed to the 
next stage. Hearings on a jail visitation issue, as well as on the defense's 
objection to one prosecutor and on the jury misconduct issues, are set for 
today but could be delayed until Friday if they cannot settle on an alternate 
jury panel by lunchtime.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: JURY MISCONDUCT OFTEN IS JUST HUMAN NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phrase "jury misconduct" evokes an image of bribing or threatening a 
juror. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the time it comes down to something much more commonplace, such as 
a juror's uncontrollable compulsion to talk about the case, or getting the 
nutty notion of conducting a free-lance investigation of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know the specifics of the misconduct allegation in the O.J. Simpson 
double murder case. All we do know is that Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark 
threw out a tantalizing hint in court Monday, saying: "We may be losing someone 
from our panel of 12." 
</P>
<P>
 The implication was that one of the 12 jurors sworn in last month may be 
dumped and replaced with an alternate. Judge Lance A. Ito set a hearing on the 
matter for today but didn't provide any details. "You have as much knowledge as 
I do with regard to what the issues are at this point," he said. "Each side has 
to take into consideration that we may lose some of the originals. We may not." 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to find out more about the subject of jury misconduct but I knew I'd 
never learn anything in the courtroom. A half a year of writing about this 
trial has convinced me of the futility of trying to interpret the opaque 
language of the legal process. So I sought out an expert who operates more on 
my level. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Keith Rohman, a private investigator specializing in discovering 
misconduct by jurors, a fascinating but little-known part of the justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives move into action after the verdict. Attorneys hire them to find out 
if the jury engaged in forbidden conduct that might convince an appellate court 
to overturn the verdict.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'd read about Rohman in a story by Martin Berg in the Los Angeles Daily 
Journal, the legal newspaper that I'd clipped and put away. When the misconduct 
issue came up, it seemed like a good time to look him up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, I drove over to Rohman's office at 3rd and Alameda streets, on the 
fringe of the Downtown warehouse district. It sounded like a perfect 
neighborhood for a private eye, and I imagined a Philip Marlowe kind of 
character holed up in a loft. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohman turned out to be a Marlowe for the 1990s, a former Vista volunteer and 
liberal political organizer who lives with his family in a house on Mt. 
Washington and accompanies them to temple on Friday nights. His office was not 
a run-down loft, but a spacious suite in a more trendy stretch of Alameda 
Street, across from the Little Tokyo senior citizen housing development and a 
large mall, and near a few good restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 He told me he's heard stories of juror bribery but has never seen it. "Most is 
of the garden variety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He mentioned several: "Undisclosed biases, undisclosed aspects of your 
background or character, conducting your own research or investigation. The 
idea is that the jury is supposed to have one source for its information and 
that is what is fed to them through the filter of the trial court. You are not 
supposed to get comments from neighbors. You are not supposed to go to your 
minister and say, 'I need help.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Why do jurors talk about their cases in violation of judicial orders? 
</P>
<P>
 "People, especially people involved in a capital punishment case, are involved 
in an intense human drama that they may never experience again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serving on a murder jury is for most people an incredibly painful and 
wrenching experience. First of all, (jurors) are exposed to things they have 
never seen before. You and I may have seen crime scene photos, but most people 
never see them. People talk to me years later about still having nightmares 
about what they saw when they were on juries. One guy just started to cry. . . 
. It is just so intense, the responsibility, deciding whether someone is going 
to spend the rest of their life in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, he said, find it impossible to keep this experience to themselves 
and give in to a compulsion to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 This helps him in his post-verdict investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've had this very intense experience that nobody else in their life 
really understands," he said. "Their wife is probably bored hearing about it. 
Their friends don't really understand the nuances of the evidence. And here is 
someone showing up at their doorsteps, fascinated about what they have to say, 
taking it all down, asking questions. . . . It's cathartic for some of these 
jurors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This process is magnified in the Simpson trial. When KFWB says, "Give us 22 
minutes and we'll give you the world," its world usually includes the Simpson 
case. It's at the top of almost every television newscast, not to mention the 
tabloid and discussion shows. Plus print. 
</P>
<P>
 We reporters on the case know we're covering history -- tabloid history, 
maybe, but history just the same. People we meet in shops and parties want to 
hear about it and, of course, most of us can't resist holding forth. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same, I'm sure, for the 12 jurors and the alternates. They know Judge 
Ito's order and no doubt intend to obey him. But when you are part of history, 
about to begin one of the most traumatic six months of your life, it's 
difficult not to talk about it.

BUILDING FLAWS CITED IN REPORT ON QUAKE; SEISMIC STANDARDS: BETTER ENFORCEMENT 
OF CURRENT CODES COULD HAVE PREVENTED MUCH DAMAGE, ENGINEERS FIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of engineers commissioned by the state to examine the effects of the 
Northridge earthquake has found that in many cases, failures of design, 
construction and inspection caused more damage than building code deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the widespread calls for tougher codes immediately after the Jan. 17 
earthquake, case studies of 27 buildings yielded evidence that much of the 
typical damage could have been prevented by inexpensive measures to better 
enforce the current code, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faults pinpointed in the study included missing joint reinforcement, gaps in 
wood framing, discrepancies between a designer's assumptions and actual field 
conditions, and a design that did not allow the proper distribution of seismic 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also shows that retrofitting helped prevent damage in some cases 
and not in others, depending on how well it was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn in part from that study, recommendations being presented to the state 
Seismic Safety Commission today in Sacramento will focus primarily on how to 
ensure that the code is followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the recommendation is that quality control -- doing what we do, but 
doing it better -- is the fundamental recommendation, rather than change the 
code," said L. Thomas Tobin, executive director of the Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe a good portion of the damage in the earthquake was due to a 
failure of quality control, either through design by the engineer or architect 
or plan checking, construction or inspection," Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposals will be a requirement that architects and engineers 
identify all seismic features in their plans and that local building officials 
specifically inspect those features. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the commission staff will recommend that the architect or engineer 
personally inspect the project during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get the best pair of eyes out on the job, the individual who 
designs the building," said Fred Turner, the commission's staff structural 
engineer. "Quite often, when you get out in the field, you may see the 
opportunity for improvements. You can resolve construction difficulties. You 
can even learn so your construction process is better." 
</P>
<P>
 The study was coordinated by consulting engineers Rutherford & Chekene of San 
Francisco, which retained other engineers for the 27 case studies. A draft was 
shown to the Seismic Safety Commission in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Its findings, incorporated into staff recommendations that are expected to be 
adopted early next year, shed light on some of the most spectacular -- and 
unexpected -- building failures. 
</P>
<P>
 The team investigating the Bullock's department store in Northridge Fashion 
Center, for example, found that it was designed with "an inadequate lateral 
system consisting of discontinuous shear walls" which, in effect, bounced up 
and down independently, punching through the concrete floor beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers concluded that had the earthquake lasted longer, the Broadway 
department store in Northridge Fashion Center could have collapsed because of 
the failure of columns around the escalators. 
</P>
<P>
 Those columns, which were not part of the building's seismic apparatus, were 
unable to sway with the exterior frame and broke instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems at the Broadway store included masonry walls that were poorly 
fastened to the building frame because of the difficulty of grouting such 
walls, causing them to move independently. 
</P>
<P>
 One code deficiency was noted in the separation of the Broadway's roof from 
its walls. The engineers said the forces were great enough to have caused the 
failure even if the 1970 building had been designed to current code. 
</P>
<P>
 The incompatibility between systems that carry the weight of a structure and 
those designed to resist the lateral force of the earthquake noted at the 
Broadway was also responsible for the collapse of the Cal State Northridge 
parking structure, the report said. Non-seismic columns breaking in the 
interior of the garage pulled the exterior frame inward. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cases, engineers found that retrofitting proved ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 The team investigating the Broadway store in Topanga Plaza said that a 
retrofitting project helped to keep damage within the design criteria of the 
building, but that "the inadequate attachment of the original construction 
walls to their foundation reduced the total resistance provided and led to 
significantly greater damage than would otherwise have occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Bullock's at Northridge Fashion Center, the engineer 
singled out an inadequate retooling of the plan improvised just after the 1971 
Sylmar earthquake, while the building was under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra shear walls were added, but consisted of "shotcrete," concrete sprayed 
between existing columns. The walls were not fastened to those columns, causing 
the discontinuous load path. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most perplexing findings was that damage often could not be 
explained by current seismic theoretical models. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-story Holiday Inn in Van Nuys, for example, was most heavily 
reinforced in the lower floors, based on the assumption that they would be 
subject to the greatest seismic forces. However, damage to the red-tagged 
building was concentrated on the fourth and fifth floors. 
</P>
<P>
 The same pattern showed up in the Sherman Oaks Towers, a 12-story concrete 
frame building whose fifth floor was most seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, staff structural engineer for the commission, called it 
"disconcerting" that the actual performance of buildings -- including some that 
should have failed but did not -- cannot be replicated by currently accepted 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can say that the general performance objectives of the building code were 
met," Turner said.

 Seven months after a semester that saw three students and a recent graduate 
killed, there is an air of resilience on campus. Hallways buzz with laughter, 
gum popping and lively noise. Students and teachers say they are waging a 
campaign of optimism and self-healing. There is a Peace Club on campus, as well 
as a grief support group and a "male responsibility counselor." 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, though, the school remains haunted by the growing roster of 
students killed by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio D. Lewis, a star basketball player, was killed in May outside a party 
when he stood up to gang members who were harassing him. His classmate, Michael 
Nasir, a talented young rapper with dreams of fame, was shot and killed after 
leaving his girlfriend's house in April. Also dead are Sam Canady and recent 
graduate Wallace Dumas, who was killed while working on his car outside his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders of high school students usually draw attention when they occur on 
campus. Yet the off-campus killings, which are far more numerous, hit the 
students' home school just as hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirteen of my friends have been killed in the last three years," says 
Michael Walters, a member of Washington's Black Student Union, shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Students such as Walters have become hardened by the increasingly common 
deaths among their friends. LaJoy Bullard, a recent Washington graduate who had 
dated two of the young men killed earlier this year, said moving on -- not 
wasting tears -- is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why cry?" she asked, her voice strained by weary sadness. "I have cried all 
that I could cry. . . . There was a time when we were going to three funerals a 
month for our friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Many children at Washington -- like students everywhere from South-Central to 
the San Fernando Valley -- live each day as if they are senior citizens: Death 
is not welcomed, but it is accepted. They exist in a world of "strapped" 
(gun-wielding) teen-agers, in which the fear of getting shot is a daily weight 
and guns become the negotiator, the only means of resolving a dispute.  
</P>
<P>
 Groping to transcend the stereotypes of a largely black high school plagued by 
violence, Washington has revamped its approach to education: Under stricter 
dress codes, students whose pants sag must pull them up and young men cannot 
wear earrings or potential gang attire, such as Raiders football shirts. This 
year's schoolwide theme, "Increase the Peace at the Prep," is being paired with 
the Monday meetings of the Peace Club. There are noontime forums for students 
to address their concerns about the school and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate to deal with the emotional aftermath of shootings, school officials 
have installed a variety of unusual support programs.  
</P>
<P>
 In the school's group counseling office, the emphasis is on the endangered 
status of young black men, who made up the majority of the high school-age 
youths killed this year, according to county Sheriff's Department statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, about 10 students shared stories as they sat in a circle 
around Vance Howard, Washington's male responsibility counselor, a position 
created to help young men feel that they have a big brother. He is there to 
feel their anger, help them talk through the pain of a friend's death or just 
listen. It is his job, according to program coordinator Henrietta Smith, "to 
give the boys permission to grieve." 
</P>
<P>
 A greater number of young black men have been coming to Smith's office seeking 
emotional support for themselves or friends. Young men's machismo resistance to 
counseling is wearing off as they see the value of talking about their 
emotions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her assistant, Elizabeth Felton, oversees the "grief group," a year-round 
support group dealing with everything from students' emotions about suicide to 
slain classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Washington's student leaders, usually the least likely to be involved in 
violence, are struggling with spilled blood.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first, we didn't cherish our friends," said Washington's student body 
president, Jasmine Brown. "Now I'm like: I don't want to say anything bad to my 
friends or other students, because I may never see them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown beams as she talks about how her school is changing after last 
semester's horrors. Her long, thin black braids bop with optimism as she 
details how bridging the gap between teachers and students has built trust, how 
opposing sides are constantly communicating whenever there is even a slight 
possibility of gunfire or conflict between gang factions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet officials acknowledge that policies can make only a small dent in problems 
such as poverty and gang violence when about 1 in 20 students in the United 
States carry guns to school and gunfire is the leading cause of death for 
people between the ages of 15 and 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Bakeer, an English teacher at Washington and the author of "Crips," a 
fictional history of the black street gang, attributes the alarming number of 
gun killings of Washington students to a generational shift for African 
Americans. Black children of today, he said, don't have the same type of moral 
obligations or codes that their parents had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cliches and slogans won't solve the problems with violence," Bakeer said. "We 
need a national movement like Stop the Violence, Increase the Peace (a campaign 
founded by black leaders in the late 1980s) that mobilizes young people to stop 
killing each other." 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda High School in the San Fernando Valley and at Hollywood High School, 
students and teachers are grappling with the same concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, two Hollywood High students have been killed, one right 
outside the school's steel gates on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after 17-year-old Rolando Ruiz was shot during midday traffic in 
September by gunmen who abandoned their cars and ran, administrators scrambled 
to put in place a team of community volunteers, parents and school officials 
who would be ready whenever a crisis occurred.  
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they get to high school, even if they try to stop their negative 
behavior, they often aren't able to," said instructor Lorraine Bradley, former 
Mayor Tom Bradley's daughter, who coordinates Hollywood High's crisis 
intervention program. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the students who saw Ruiz's bloody body lying on the concrete at the 
corner of Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue outside the school said the 
image is still forged in their minds every time a fight or the sound of gunfire 
erupts. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Jerry Massey said Hollywood High was recently given an 
award by school board officials for its crisis intervention program, but he 
sees that as much as an omen as a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were recognized for being prepared for death when we should be ready for 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, in the crowded hallways at Reseda High School, football 
player Robert Heard whipped out a gun in the school's science building, shot 
Michael Ensley one time in the chest, and fled the campus weeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Reseda honor roll student and basketball player Nikki 
Foley was shot and killed while standing outside her apartment building in 
Panorama City. The 16-year-old and her family had moved there to escape the 
crime and violence of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Ensley's death, English teacher Jay Shaffer rounded up some students and 
started an anti-violence program called WARN (Weapons Are Removed Now). It won 
them a trip to New York to appear on Phil Donahue's TV show in April. Members 
of WARN visit the elementary and junior high schools that feed Reseda High, 
warning younger children about guns and violence.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get to the young people when they are still very impressionable," 
Shaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 WARN President Debbie Carlos, a senior, said she got involved because the 
death of students from her campus brought the issue closer to home. "We all 
thought Reseda was such a safe school," Carlos said. "I didn't think it could 
happen in the suburbs." 
</P>
<P>
 The students at Reseda said metal detectors, which have been the remedy for 
most schools across the country, won't work.  
</P>
<P>
 "If someone wants to get a gun into our school then they will," said WARN 
member Jayme Rebbeck. "No matter what devices they have." 
</P>
<P>
 More important, said Reseda student Pedram Torbati, is breaking through a 
mental block. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids don't understand the finality of death," he said. "They accept it so 
easily."

POLICE INQUIRY CLEARS 2 OFFICERS IN WOMAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing yet another chapter in the controversial police shooting of a 
knife-wielding single mother last year, the Los Angeles Police Commission has 
ruled that the two officers who shot Sonji Taylor acted within department 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, announced Tuesday, came nearly a year after the Dec. 16, 1993, 
death of the 27-year-old Taylor, shot nine times on the roof of St. Vincent 
Medical Center as she babbled incoherently and threatened her 3-year-old son 
with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven officers who responded to the call managed to free the sobbing 
toddler by shooting pepper spray into Taylor's face. But as they pulled the 
child to safety, police said, the woman lunged at one of the officers with a 
12-inch knife blade and they were forced to shoot her. 
</P>
<P>
 Singled out in the investigation were Sgt. Michael Long, 44, and Officer Craig 
Liedahl, 41, who fired the bullets that killed Taylor. In the aftermath, the 
woman's family sharply criticized them and the police force, saying that Taylor 
died as a result of excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the case sparked intense publicity when autopsy reports revealed that 
Taylor, whom the officers contended attacked them head-on, had seven bullet 
wounds in her back. 
</P>
<P>
 This issue was also raised in a report issued in September by the district 
attorney's office, which raised "the possibility . . . that the officers are 
not being truthful about their actions that evening." Nonetheless, prosecutors 
determined that the fusillade could have spun Taylor's body as she fell, 
causing her to be hit in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 They concluded that the shooting, while tragic, was not criminal in nature and 
no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's announcement by the police commission marked the end of the LAPD's 
departmental probe, and the formal conclusion echoed the district attorney's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recommendation of Police Chief Willie L. Williams, the panel found that 
the officers were forced to shoot because they feared for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report is not the final chapter in the incident. The family has 
filed a $20-million claim against the city, which is preliminary to filing a 
lawsuit.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH HILLS; VETERANS 
PROTEST CUTS IN HOSPITAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waving American flags and hand-made signs, about 50 veterans gathered 
Wednesday outside the Sepulveda Veterans Affairs Medical Center to protest cuts 
in substance abuse and psychiatric programs made after the stately, red-brick 
complex was badly damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials last winter decided to demolish Sepulveda's 431-bed hospital 
rather than spend an estimated $188 million to rebuild it.The hospital 
emergency room was closed and a number of in-patient programs were transferred 
to the bigger VA medical center in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Veterans Affairs plans to replace Sepulveda's hospital with 
a $53-million ambulatory care center that will offer a range of medical 
services, including outpatient surgery. Another $48 million will be spent on 
seismic improvements and repair work at Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 But many San Fernando Valley veterans complain that it is hard for them to get 
to West Los Angeles and that the care is not as good there. They also worry 
that lives may be jeopardized by the lack of full emergency services at 
Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans Affairs officials at both medical centers insisted that no one's 
health has been damaged or jeopardized by the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, Sepulveda's in-patient programs in mental health and drug and 
alcohol abuse were transferred to West Los Angeles.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BERNSON 
PLAN TO USE TAXES FOR QUAKE AID CHALLENGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson clashed with other council members 
Wednesday over a plan to set aside all new property taxes in his San Fernando 
Valley district for an earthquake loan guarantee program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, new property taxes, or tax increment, can be diverted for 
redevelopment projects, including disaster assistance programs such as loan 
guarantees for quake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But some council members are concerned about the impact of Bernson's plan on 
other city services, the county government and school and community college 
districts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have some serious problems with how this is coming down," said Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg. "I can very easily see that what could happen, if it passes as 
it is written, the increment will be used in a very narrow way in a very large 
area."  
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, who represents Northridge, Granada Hills and Chatsworth, defended the 
proposal, saying his district needs the extra help.  
</P>
<P>
 "We received 50% or more of the total damage of this city," Bernson said. "We 
were the epicenter. . . . People out there are having a tough time recovering. 
They need help."  
</P>
<P>
 Other council members said the redevelopment plan will force other areas of 
the city to shoulder the burden of funding the increased cost of municipal 
services in Bernson's district.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
LITTLE IMPACT EXPECTED IN VENTURA BLVD. CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposed budget cuts of nearly two-thirds to a 20-year master plan to widen 
and beautify Ventura Boulevard, the San Fernando Valley's historic "Main 
Street," will barely register a blip with shoppers and merchants, city 
officials predict. 
</P>
<P>
 New turn lanes would still be added at intersections, relieving traffic 
congestion.Trees, special paving and benches would still be put in along the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning and transportation officials say the reductions, rather than 
gutting the plan, in fact give a more realistic picture of the actual costs of 
the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, as the proposal is known. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for this -- according to the Transportation Department, which 
is proposing the cuts -- is that $139.4 million of the original $222.1 million 
plan came from an arithmetic error, cost projections for land acquisition that 
grew outdated and widenings that later were deemed infeasible or excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is that the planning department has scaled back projections for 
new development along the 17-mile corridor, from 8.6 million square feet by the 
year 2005 to 4.1 million square feet by the year 2010.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SYLMAR; MISSION COLLEGE 
CHIEF TO HELP DISTRICT FIND FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mission College President Jack Fujimoto will take a leave from his job for at 
least a year to help the financially ailing Los Angeles Community College 
District find public and private funding, district officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of Fujimoto's departure from the Sylmar campus is expected 
today at a district-wide meeting, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Norlund, vice president for academic affairs at Pierce College in 
Woodland Hills, will replace Fujimoto as interim president at Mission.  
</P>
<P>
 The news of Fujimoto's transfer downtown comes as the district, the nation's 
largest two-year college district, seeks sources of outside funding -- 
including federal grants -- in the wake of state budget cutbacks, declining 
enrollment and other financial stresses on the district's nine campuses.  
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto, 65, is considered an expert at finding and cultivating sources of 
education funding. 
</P>
<P>
 But his departure will leave Mission College, the youngest and smallest 
college in the district, without steady leadership at a time when enrollment is 
down nearly 19% from its peak in 1992. The college's enrollment dwindled to 
fewer than 6,000 this fall.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTCHESTER; WOMAN GETS 
JAIL FOR BID TO SKIP COMMUNITY SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westchester businesswoman who falsified documents to avoid performing 
court-ordered community service was sentenced to 60 days in jail, City Atty. 
James K. Hahn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Municipal Judge Veronica S. McBeth gave Ionie Albertha Richmond, 
42, the choice of serving the time in jail or on a Caltrans work crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond had been fined $1,000, placed on three years probation and ordered to 
perform 300 hours of community service after she pleaded guilty in January to 
grand theft.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said she submitted false information about her assets and 
employment to qualify for $30,833 in housing assistance from the city Housing 
Authority. As part of her sentence, she also was ordered to repay the money.  
</P>
<P>
 Richmond later submitted timekeeping documents showing she had completed the 
300 hours of community service by doing clerical work at West Los Angeles 
College. But Deputy City Atty. Deborah Sanchez reviewed the documents and 
became suspicious after noticing that the name of the person who verified the 
time sheet was the same as a name on the Housing Authority application.  
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez called the college and learned that Richmond had never done any work 
there, Hahn said. The signature turned out to be that of Richmond's son.

POLICE UNION ASSAILS BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY; POLITICS: LABOR GROUP PLANS TO 
DEMONSTRATE AGAINST HER CAMPAIGN FOR THE CITY COUNCIL SEAT LEFT VACANT WHEN HER 
HUSBAND WAS ELECTED TO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that they fear she will be a "political puppet," officials of the union 
that represents the Los Angeles Police Department's rank-and-file workers said 
they plan to demonstrate against Barbara Yaroslavsky as she kicks off her 
campaign to gain her husband's vacant City Council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Protective League is targeting Yaroslavsky because union leaders 
blame her husband, Zev Yaroslavsky, for delaying labor contract talks last year 
when he was on the council. They also fear she will continue what they call his 
anti-police policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said they will send at least 50 off-duty officers to picket in 
front of a fund-raising event tonight at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Harkness, director of the league, said that Barbara Yaroslavsky does not 
have the experience to fill the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to tolerate her running for office," he said. "We don't want 
to do business with people who turn their backs on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky called union leaders sexist for assuming that she is 
unable to have a political opinion independent of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "To assume that a woman would follow blindly in the footsteps of her husband 
is outrageous," she said. "This is the '90s. The 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 The planned protest signals the beginning of a heated race to represent an 
affluent and politically powerful district that stretches from Sherman Oaks to 
the Westside. The primary is scheduled for April and a runoff election would be 
held in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The union already has backed Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino for the 
post. Also running for the seat are Michael Feuer, the former head of 
Bet-Tzedek, a legal services agency; Jeff Brain, former president of the 
Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce, and Roberta Weintraub, a former Los Angeles 
school board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkness said Barbara Yaroslavsky has never approached the union to offer an 
explanation of her positions on various city issues, and he criticized her 
campaigning as a police supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 The union will continue protesting her candidacy at political events, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any problem following her around the city of Los Angeles when 
she tries to convince people she supports the Police Department," Harkness 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Yaroslavsky said she has approached union President Danny Staggs 
to explain her ideas and has yet to get a response from the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am more than willing to talk to anyone on the leadership of the league," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the union's opposition, Barbara Yaroslavsky said she supports the 
department and backs Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to bolster its numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky, who clashed with police during his 19 years on the council, 
assumed his new post Monday as a member of the County Board of Supervisors.

behind bars, wept openly after hearing the sentence imposed Tuesday by Santa 
Monica Superior Court Judge Leslie W. Light. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence was condemned as "ridiculous" by James' public defender, who said 
that his client does not pose a threat to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Light defended his ruling as an attempt to follow the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the way I'd write (criminal sentencing) legislation, but I'm not 
writing law, I'm enforcing it," the judge said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law, signed in March by Gov. Pete Wilson, requires a 
sentence of 25 years to life for any defendant who has previously been 
convicted of two violent or serious felonies. James had been convicted of six 
felonies dating back to 1982, including two burglaries, two auto thefts and one 
count of assaulting a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 His most recent run-in with the law occurred June 23, when he was arrested at 
a Culver City supermarket on suspicion of attempting to write a forged check 
and carrying a fake driver's license. He was caught when store employees 
suspected that his identification was bogus. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted James of the two charges in October. Because of his felony 
convictions, he was eligible for sentencing under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest-hearted conservative who voted for (the law) would have been 
moved by the sight of this man reduced to a sobbing blob of humanity (after the 
sentencing)," said Deputy Public Defender Charles Cervantes, who represented 
James. 
</P>
<P>
 James is the latest on a growing list of defendants facing hefty jail time for 
nonviolent offenses. Earlier this year, Jerry Dewayne Williams was facing 25 
years to life for allegedly stealing a slice of pepperoni pizza from four 
youngsters in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts say that soaring prison costs will eventually force the public 
to reconsider the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lack the resources to put away all repeat offenders for the rest of their 
lives," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor and former criminal defense 
attorney. "That is something Californians will have to come to grips with in 
the very near future."

CITIZENS GROUP CLAIMS BALLOT DISCREPANCIES IN VENICE PRECINCTS; ELECTION: 
SUPPORTERS OF DEFEATED CANDIDATE ASK COUNTY TO EXAMINE INCORRECT ADDRESSES ON 
ROSTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A citizens group claimed Wednesday that about 300 voters in Venice cast 
ballots even though the addresses for them on precinct ballot rosters were 
wrong or in some cases, were for residences that have been vacant for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee for Election Integrity, which includes former workers or 
supporters of South Bay congressional candidate Susan Brooks, called on the Los 
Angeles County registrar-recorder to investigate their claims to see if any 
instances of fraud can be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, citing voter irregularities, has not conceded in the 36th 
Congressional District race against Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), who won 
the ballot count by 812 votes. The district runs from Venice to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is very clear that these irregularities are on a much larger 
scale than anyone in a position of responsibility is willing to admit," said El 
Segundo Councilman Liam Weston, who is leading the effort by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's campaign spokesman, Roy Behr, dismissed the efforts as politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have yet to provide a shred of evidence that the alleged irregularities 
would have changed the outcome of the election by one vote," he said. "These 
are run-of-the-mill, standard issues that come up in every campaign across the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Weston, however, cited a specific discrepancy involving an address written by 
a voter at a Venice precinct as an example of the possible irregularities his 
group has found. Next to her signature on the ballot roster, the voter gave her 
address as 659 San Juan Ave. But the home has been vacant since 1991, according 
to its owner, who appeared at a news conference Wednesday with Weston in front 
of the shuttered building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not concluded anything at all at this point," Weston said. "I am not 
suggesting anyone has done anything illegal. I am suggesting that 
irregularities exist that should be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the news conference was Harold Ezell, a key supporter of Proposition 
187, which denies a range of public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell, who is now leading the Voter Fraud Task Force, charged this week that 
77% of the precincts in Harman's district contain "questionable returns." In a 
separate study, he cites instances where the vote counts kept by precinct 
workers did not match the certified count of the Los Angeles County registrar 
of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Orange County has to file for bankruptcy, the Los Angeles County registrar 
ought to file for bankruptcy because of the way they handled this election," 
Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Weston's group found the 300 cases after canvassing about 1,200 
homes in seven Venice precincts, Weston said. Workers tried to contact voters 
over the phone, through the mail and at their homes to determine where they 
lived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call them 300 mysteries," Weston said. "It's not empirical evidence. It's 
the best evidence that we gathered." 
</P>
<P>
 The 36th Congressional District contains 547 precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County registrar-recorder spokeswoman Marcia Ventura said that 
they have so far found no evidence of voter fraud. And she said that neither 
Weston's group nor Ezell's task force has filed a formal complaint with the 
office.

<P>
 All federal buildings and offices in Los Angeles and the nation will be 
inspected for earthquake safety risks under a directive issued by President 
Clinton, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency to notify all federal 
departments and agencies to inspect their facilities and estimate retrofitting 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Director Richard Moore said the agency is developing a national 
strategy to reduce the impact of natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 An interagency panel will issue inspection and cost estimate guidelines within 
the next year, and federal agencies must submit their reports to FEMA within 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The president's directive also instructs FEMA to prepare a report for Congress 
on how to achieve an adequate level of seismic safety in federal facilities in 
an economically feasible manner.

NO. 1? THEY BEG TO DILFER; RAMS PASSED ON ROOKIE, WHO IS NOW A BACKUP IN TAMPA 
BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Asked what he thought of Tampa Bay rookie quarterback Trent Dilfer after 
studying game films, Ram defensive coordinator George Dyer couldn't provide an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have him on any of our films," Dyer said. "It's all been Craig 
Erickson." 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer has only a bit role in Tampa Bay's game films -- and in the Buccaneers' 
offense. And when the Rams and Buccaneers meet Sunday at Tampa Stadium, Dilfer 
will be where he was last week against Washington -- on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't where those who criticized the Rams for passing on him with the 
fifth pick in last spring's draft thought he would be at this point in the 
season, especially with the Buccaneers out of the playoff race at 4-9. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Sam Wyche, whose job status is tenuous because of that record and 
because the team is up for sale, isn't comfortable putting his coaching future 
in the hands of a rookie quarterback who has struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dilfer has started only one game and has completed 38 of 82 passes (46.3%) 
for 433 yards with one touchdown and six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He has been sacked seven times in the five games he has 
</P>
<P>
 played. In his homecoming game 
</P>
<P>
 at San Francisco, he completed only seven of 23 passes for 45 yards with one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He lined up behind right guard in an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He moved to the end of the bench, away from teammates celebrating a victory 
over Washington last week in a game that could have been a showdown between 
Dilfer and the Redskins' Heath Shuler, the league's other heralded rookie 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was rooting for the team in that game, naturally," Dilfer said. "But 
selfishly, it was hard for me because my rival (Shuler) was out there and I 
wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring Dilfer gave up his final year of eligibility at Fresno State to 
make himself eligible for the draft. He and Shuler were the two prized 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer, 6 feet 5 and 230 pounds, set an NCAA record with 318 consecutive 
passes without an interception and led major college passers with a 173.1 
efficiency rating, third-highest in NCAA history behind Jim McMahon and Ty 
Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before the draft, Ram Coach Chuck Knox told reporters he would take 
Dilfer or Shuler if either was available, despite the fact that the team had 
signed free agent Chris Miller to a three-year, $9 million deal a month 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler was taken by Washington, but Dilfer was available when the Rams' turn 
came at No. 5. After failing to trade the pick to Dallas for Alvin Harper, they 
traded down to Indianapolis' eighth pick and later San Francisco's 15th 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 They used the 49ers' pick to take Auburn's Wayne Gandy and used lower-round 
picks acquired in the trades to take defensive end Brad Ottis (second round) 
and tailback James Bostic (third round). Gandy starts at right tackle, Ottis 
plays on special teams and Bostic was inactive before going on injured reserve 
because of a wrist injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, everyone wrote that I was shocked by what happened in the draft, 
but I really wasn't," Dilfer said. "The Rams told me they would take me, but it 
was a 50-50 chance on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
 "My agent had told me there was some dissension among the coaches and front 
office. The front office wanted me, but the coaches wanted to win right away 
and didn't think they could do that with a rookie quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously they were interested in a young quarterback because they traded for 
Tommy Maddox a few months later." 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Rams get the best of the deal by passing on Dilfer? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say anything derogatory about anybody," Knox said. "I think 
Trent will be a fine quarterback. He's like a lot of new quarterbacks who come 
in the league and struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure if he was lighting it up down there, there would be people saying we 
made the big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer held out of the Buccaneers' rookie camp and pre-camp workouts to 
negotiate his contract and was rewarded with a staggering salary that landed 
him on Forbes' list of the 50 highest-paid athletes for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 He's ranked 33rd with $5.5 million in endorsements and earnings (including a 
signing bonus). 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer began the season as Erickson's backup and got some mop-up work in four 
midseason games. He threw his first NFL touchdown pass in a backup role late in 
a 36-13 loss to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyche gave him his first start in Week 9 against the Chicago Bears, saying he 
wanted to give the rookie several consecutive starts to see what he could do. 
Dilfer completed 13 of 25 passes for 159 yards with no touchdowns and an 
interception in a 20-6 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer missed his next two starts because of a pulled muscle near his rib cage 
and a brief bout with flu. The Buccaneers were 2-9 when he returned, but the 
starting job was Erickson's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed the Detroit game, but I was ready to come back the next week against 
Seattle," Dilfer said. "But they (coaches) found an excuse not to start me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not bitter or mad, just frustrated. The general rule in the NFL is that 
you don't lose your starting job to injury. But that happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom also says to play a rookie late in a losing season and get 
him some experience. Wyche disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where we have a rub because I'm absolutely not in favor of 
conventional wisdom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, Trent is going to get his playing time," Wyche said. "There 
will be a heck of a competitive situation between Craig, Trent and Casey 
Weldon." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. Erickson becomes a restricted free agent at season's end, and 
several teams, including the Cardinals, are reportedly interested in signing 
him. With so much money tied up in Dilfer's contract, it's doubtful the 
Buccaneers can match a sizable offer from another team to keep Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Wyche -- or whoever is coaching the Tampa Bay/St. Louis Bucs next 
season -- with Dilfer as the future quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the kid," Wyche said. "He's a great competitor, strong arm, big, 
smart. He's young, and has a lot of trial and error in front of him, but he's 
going to be a big-time player." The Right Move? 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Rams make the right choice during the off-season? They dumped Jim 
Everett, failed to get Warren Moon and passed on free agent Scott Mitchell and 
rookie Trent Dilfer, instead signing free agents Chris Miller and Chris 
Chandler, and later trading for Tommy Maddox. A look at how some of the team's 
quarterback candidates have fared through 13 games: 
09,16,13,06,06,07,07,04,06,07 Player Team Att. Com. Pct. Yds. TD Int. Rec.*

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; CLIPPERS BLEW CHANCE FOR NBA IMMORTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, nobody's perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Staring immortality in the face, the Clippers blinked. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently locked into a rendezvous with a destiny that seemed to have been 
waiting for them since Donald T. Sterling first met Danny Manning, or since 
Sterling heard of professional basketball, the Clippers did the improbable. 
</P>
<P>
 They won. Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told 'em, 'Bring your cameras. When you get it done, when you get that 
monkey off your back, it'll be the ugliest and the biggest and there won't be 
enough bananas to feed it, so get out of its way,' " Coach Bill Fitch said 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fitch's players forgot their cameras, it's OK. Everyone else brought 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clipper players mobbed Pooh Richardson, and the crowd of about 4,500, 
pumped up to 6,433 for the official announcement, screamed like 45,000, five 
minicam crews danced around the fringes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper coaches and players, mostly recent arrivals, are innocents in this 
play, which is more about Sterling's front office, but they were the ones who 
had been forced to shoulder the ridicule. The Donald could multiply their pay 
by 10 and still not be even. 
</P>
<P>
 The first four weeks of the season were their nightmare. Wednesday was their 
Game 7 of the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never," said Harold Ellis, asked if he had been through anything similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere. I had a little league football team, we forfeited one, lost six and 
tied three. But we did have that one. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Teams had gone through bad times but at least the record-smashing 9-73 76ers 
of 1972-73 didn't have to put up with smart-aleck anchors on ESPN. In the era 
of 500 channels, ridicule weighs heavily on one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told the guys, 'If reading the papers bothers you, don't read 'em. If 
watching TV or listening to the radio bothers you -- just don't let that extra 
baggage that goes with something like this get too heavy for you,' " Fitch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this might cut a few things out of your life. 
</P>
<P>
 Malik Sealy says he quit reading the paper when he was in high school. He 
still catches a glimpse of TV here and there, but lately he has been careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might catch some highlights, but when they start talking about us, I turn 
it off," Sealy said. "I might catch some college highlights." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say they needed this night badly. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Bucks, losers of eight in a row. One could say the Clippers beat a 
road-weary team, tottering into its fourth game in five nights, but the Bucks 
are also one of the NBA's promising young franchises, with several fine young 
players and one budding superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody coming in here is going to think the same thing," said Coach Mike 
Dunleavy before the game. "You don't want to be the first to be beaten by the 
Clippers, but we can't think about that. We need a win desperately." 
</P>
<P>
 So Wednesday was desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers led by 13 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks went on a 10-0 run at the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers opened it up to 81-72 midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks closed to 88-85 in the closing seconds, then tied the score when 
Glenn Robinson, the budding superstar, rebounded his own missed 10-footer, took 
the ball out to the three-point line and canned one from there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers led, 94-92, in the last 30 seconds of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson got caught up in the air, passed up a wide-open 15-footer to tie, 
lost the ball . . . and saw teammate Marty Conlon pick it up in the lane, score 
and draw a foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in here, the gods must have decided they were tired of torturing the 
Clippers. Conlon missed the free throw. Richardson turned a busted play at the 
Clipper end into the dramatic game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers may not be the best team that ever came down the pike, but at 
least they wouldn't make any history this night. They deserved that much, at 
least.

 Last spring Dilfer gave up his final year of eligibility at Fresno State to

quarterbacks, just as Drew Bledsoe and Rick Mirer had been the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer, 6 feet 5 and 230 pounds, set an NCAA record with 318 consecutive

 "At the time, everyone wrote that I was shocked by what happened in the draft, 
but I really wasn't," Dilfer said. "The Rams told me they would take me, but it 
was only a 50-50 chance on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
 "My agent had told me there was some dissension among the coaches and front 
office. The front office wanted me, but the coaches wanted to win right away 
and didn't think they could do that with a rookie quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously they were interested in a young quarterback because they traded for 
Tommy Maddox a few months later." 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Rams get the best of the deal by passing on Dilfer? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say anything derogatory about anybody," Knox said. "I think 
Trent will be a fine quarterback. He's like a lot of new quarterbacks who come 
in the league and struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure if he was lighting it up down there, there would be people saying we 
made the big mistake. There's always people who are going out to find warts on 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer held out of the Buccaneers' rookie camp and pre-camp workouts to 
negotiate his contract and was rewarded with a staggering salary that landed 
him on Forbes' top 50 highest-paid athletes list for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 He is ranked 33rd with $5.5 million in endorsements and earnings (including a 
signing bonus). He is sixth among NFL players behind Joe Montana ($10.3 
million), Scott Mitchell ($6.4 million), Shuler ($6.3 million), Marshall Faulk 
($6.2 million) and Dan Wilkinson ($6.1 million). 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer began the season as Erickson's backup and got some mop-up work in four 
midseason games. He threw his first NFL touchdown pass in a backup role late in 
a 36-13 loss to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyche gave him his first start in Week 9 against the Chicago Bears, saying he 
wanted to give the rookie several consecutive starts to see what he could do. 
Dilfer completed 13 of 25 passes for 159 yards with no touchdowns and an 
interception in a 20-6 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer missed his next two starts because of a pulled muscle near his rib cage 
and a brief bout with flu. The Buccaneers were 2-9 when he returned, but the 
starting job was Erickson's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed the Detroit game, but I was ready to come back the next week against 
Seattle," Dilfer said. "But they (coaches) found an excuse not to start me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not bitter or mad, just frustrated. The general rule in the NFL is that 
you don't lose your starting job to injury. But that happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom also says to play a rookie late in a losing season and get 
him some experience for the future, especially because Erickson will be a 
restricted free agent at the end of the season. Wyche disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where we have a rub because I'm absolutely not in favor of 
conventional wisdom,"he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His unconventional wisdom was to play Erickson and salvage the season. 
Erickson has averaged 252 yards passing with a touchdown the last two weeks, 
leading Tampa Bay to consecutive victories for the first time since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyche's other reason: He is 14-31 in his third season with the Buccaneers and 
regularly hears chants of "Jimmy Johnson, Jimmy Johnson" from a group of fans 
behind the Tampa Bay bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyche wants to save his job, and if the Buccaneers win their remaining three 
games -- home against the Rams and Green Bay Packers and at Washington -- a 7-9 
finish would do wonders for his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing as if we were in the hunt," Wyche said. "I don't think it would 
be fair to the players or fans if we made personnel decisions as we would in 
training camp."

ANALYSIS; ATTENTION, MR. BETTMAN: SOMEONE HAS TO GIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the latest proclamation of gloom and doom at the NHL talks, there will 
be a hockey season. 
</P>
<P>
 Like students who have two months to complete a term paper but do nothing 
until the day before it's due, owners and players postured and dawdled until 
they finally felt a sense of urgency. They have about three weeks left to save 
the season. It's now a matter of who blinks first. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still reason to believe they can see eye to eye. Players will realize 
they're better off with a tax on salaries than with no salaries. Owners will 
realize it's better to get revenue from 20 or 25 home games than to have no 
games at all.  
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman has said that he wouldn't want to play fewer than 50 
games, not that he wouldn't authorize a schedule of 40 or 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling off the season would set the NHL back immeasurably, especially in 
regions where hockey isn't entrenched. Advertisers and sponsors would flee to 
the newest trendy sport. Revenues would suffer. Can union chief Bob Goodenow 
refuse to make a deal knowing that a canceled season might depress players' 
future earnings more than the salary controls he accepts from the league? 
</P>
<P>
 And can Bettman, who has already extracted a host of concessions from players, 
demand they give more? 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman was hired to overhaul the NHL's economic structure and halt the 
escalation of salaries. He has found new revenue sources (Fox TV and Nike) to 
help owners offset payroll costs. He prevailed on the rookie salary cap, 
essentially getting players to clean up after owners who threw money at rookies 
such as Alexandre Daigle and Brett Lindros and then cried that their wallets 
were emptying too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 His claim Tuesday that the sides were "too far apart on substance" was a scare 
tactic. He's still trying to frighten players into caving in, which he 
accomplished with the rookie cap and the franchise player designation that 
limits free agency for veterans. He can't be blamed for trying again, but even 
he knows he has pushed as far as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, from all accounts, too close on the major issues not to make a deal. 
After winning so many points, it's Bettman's turn to give in. 
</P>
<P>
 They are inches away from agreeing on terms for unrestricted free agency. The 
NHL dropped the franchise player demand but raised the age for eligibility to 
31 for the first two years of the agreement and 30 for the next three years. 
That can easily be bridged. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks, they also closed in on the salary limit for first-round 
draft picks, which will be about $1 million. The NHL wants to cap bonuses and 
players want no restrictions, but that can also be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Their biggest difference is the union's request that salary arbitration be 
binding, while the NHL wants non-binding arbitration. But even the most hawkish 
of players acknowledge a compromise is possible, perhaps by granting 
unrestricted free agency to players if clubs reject arbitrators' decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the payroll tax, which has never had universal support among club 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tax alone is blocking a deal, NHL governors, who will meet Monday in 
New York, are likely to urge Bettman to drop it or reduce it again. They will 
probably reduce it, formulating a final proposal and setting a deadline of 
about Dec. 20 for the union to accept it or face the cancellation of the 
season. General managers caucused by phone Wednesday, as did players. Bettman 
and Goodenow did not speak, and they are not scheduled to talk before Monday's 
NHL gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's clear now is that the All-Star game, scheduled on Jan. 21 at San 
Jose, will be wiped out. But the season can be salvaged.  
</P>
<P>
 Players will have to live with a payroll tax, which they've already indicated 
they can do. Their Oct. 10 proposal included a tax ranging from 1% to 7% on the 
league's top 16 revenue-earning clubs. What made it acceptable then and 
philosophically unacceptable Tuesday? The players are posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners can make the tax a bit more palatable. After getting many key, 
money-saving concessions from players, it's time for the NHL to make one 
minor-to-moderate compromise that will enable both sides to save face. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners are willing to blunt the impact of the tax by crediting gate tax 
payments toward the payroll tax fee. They also devised a grandfather clause to 
ease the hit on clubs whose payrolls already exceed the $18-million limit. 
(That limit would rise to $19 million in the second year of the agreement and 
$20 million the third year). 
</P>
<P>
 The next move is to reduce the peak tax rate from 25% to 20% and lower the age 
for unrestricted free agency to 29 or 30. Players would buy that, knowing that 
if they fail to strike a deal, they would lose more than a season: They would 
lose part of their future.

JIM MURRAY: HE DISLIKES TREYS ON SILVER PLATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his heyday, Ben Hogan hated an easy golf course. He once played in a Palm 
Springs tournament in which two players shot 61s. "What," asked Hogan, "am I 
doing on a golf course where people can shoot 61s?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Reggie Miller, the basketball player, can relate to Hogan. Miller is 
a 6-foot-7 shooting guard for the Indiana Pacers. He is the leading scorer in 
Pacer history, an inspired player who smiles a lot on court and often gives the 
impression the game is fun, almost just a playground shoot-around again. Of 
course, when he gets the ball, the joke's over for the other team. 
</P>
<P>
 His specialty is the long-distance basket, the three-point shot, basketball's 
version of the home run. Reggie has made 882 shots at long range. He is the 
equivalent of battleship Indiana or the Pacers' railroad gun. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reggie is unhappy. The three-point basket, which used to be 23 feet 9 from 
the basket, has been marked down to 22 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie feels like Hogan would if he saw them chopping down a tree or removing 
a sand trap. Or moving the tee up to take 25 yards off a finishing hole at 
Augusta or St. Andrews. Turning a par four into a par five. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too tempting," grouses Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, too easy. Reggie doesn't need the extra foot and a half. For him, 26 
feet would be temptation enough. Reggie threw in 840 threes from 23-9, and a 
lot of them were from almost midcourt. When he's on, Miller can make them from 
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan used to feel that way about an easy course. It eliminated shotmaking. It 
put the inferior player on the same plane as the championship player. If the 
opera doesn't have high C in it, everybody is Caruso. And Nijinsky wants a Swan 
Lake, not a fox trot. 
</P>
<P>
 And Reggie Miller doesn't want any 22-foot threes. Reggie wants to run the 
ribbon clerks out of this game. Thirty feet would do him just fine. In fact, 
when the now-defunct ABA put the three-point basket in the pro game back in 
'67, the range was 30 feet. At that distance, there were few takers. At 22 
feet, the air may be filled with jump shots this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball is in a quandary anyway. Saddled with the 10-foot basket, which was 
deemed perfectly adequate back in the days when the human race was five to 
seven inches shorter on average than it is today, the game now sees a courtful 
of giants who drop baskets in from above like a guy posting a letter in a 
mailbox. And at 280 pounds, they usually go to the basket like a buffalo to 
water. Shaquille O'Neal doesn't need a jump shot any more than Bronko Nagurski 
or Larry Csonka did. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers of the game saw basketball as an antidote to the physicality of 
football. They never envisioned a sport in which a basket would not be a 
20-foot set but a two-inch drop. In their day, seven-footers went in the 
circus, not a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The old ABA was scorned for its introduction of the three-point basket, but by 
1979, the NBA reinstated the shot. And made it seven feet shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was perceived as a way to level the field between the seven-footers and the 
six-footers, but even then it was used only sparingly and didn't make much of a 
difference in the game. Dunk shots were still preferred 2-to-1 over 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller was one of a few players who made an art form out of the three. 
Larry Bird led the league two seasons in a row with 82 one season and 90 the 
next. Dale Ellis of San Antonio was the first to pop in more than 1,000. Dan 
Majerle of Phoenix broke the one-season mark with 192 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is probably the game's most unsung superstar. He wasn't drafted until 
the 11th pick by Indiana when he came out of UCLA and never became "Air" Miller 
or "Magic" or "Downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Reggie's problem was his happy-go-lucky appearance on the court. 
Actually, it was misleading. When Reggie grins, it's a good time to check your 
watch or your wallet. And he wasn't above exchanging taunts with a Spike Lee or 
whoever else was at courtside rooting against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's geography. Indianapolis isn't really in the endorsement loop, but 
Miller electrified the basketball world last June when, playing against Patrick 
Ewing and the lordly New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden, Miller threw in 
25 points in the fourth quarter one night, including a record five 
three-pointers. He put the worm in the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 He made the Dream Team II in the World Championships, where he became the 
second-leading scorer. If it weren't for Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon, he might 
have been the league's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he doesn't like to see that magical three-pointer cheapened. He doesn't 
want rinky-dinks running up scores taking his shots. Like Hogan, he doesn't 
want the fairway mowed, the Pacific Ocean taken out of play, the rough cut or 
the game played from the white tees. Great boxers don't want to fight palookas, 
great tennis players don't want to play 200th-seeded players. And Miller wants 
a three-point basket you can hardly see. Make basketball into the Battle of 
Jutland, not a dockfight, and Reggie'll blow you out of the water.

CSUN FOOTBALL MAY BE JUST A PASSING FANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a hangover no aspirin will cure. Sometimes, it's more of a migraine, a 
persistent headache that won't disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when most colleges are plotting the particulars of their 1995 
football season, top-level administrators at Cal State Northridge are deciding 
whether it's worth the effort to field a team at all. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time Northridge has been here. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two months ago, football was on the chopping block as the athletic 
department wrangled with budget problems. The program survived the sack attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet dwindling enrollment, a sluggish economy and damage from the Northridge 
earthquake have saddled the department with a projected deficit of $700,000 for 
1995-96. Department administrators concede that cutting football would be the 
quickest fix. Recent losing seasons, off-field embarrassments and student 
apathy have created an anti-football sentiment on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on Northridge football could come as soon as next week, when 
President Blenda J. Wilson is expected to receive a list of potential budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have traveled this well-beaten path. Bill Shumard was athletic director 
at Cal State Fullerton when football was dropped after the 1992 season. 
Predictably, the campus citizenry was not altogether pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you drop a sport as popular as football there's an emotional 
hangover," said Shumard, now an assistant athletic director at Long Beach 
State. "Even when there's not much revenue tied to it, it hurts in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping a major program is typically a complicated, disheartening process 
that sends tremors beyond the campus proper. Boosters question the school's 
commitment to athletics, coaches and athletes are left adrift, and the business 
community clamps a hand on its collective wallet. It's a public black eye -- 
but it's not like there haven't been several of those already. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Northridge wrestled with more than a few problems during a 3-7 
season, and many had nothing to do with football. A starting lineman was 
charged with two counts of attempted murder, a crucial athletic fee referendum 
was narrowly defeated by students, and with two weeks left in the season, 16 
players boycotted a practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, players also staged a practice boycott. Normalcy and upheaval are one 
and the same at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year there's something new," tight end Travis Hall said this week. "On 
top of that, there's always the threat of cutting football. It's always 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Public headaches only complicate matters for a program operating on what is 
called a "cost-containment" basis. The Northridge football team has just 17 
scholarships and minimal funding, even for the NCAA Division I-AA level. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors finished last for the second consecutive year in the American 
West Conference, ended the season on a five-game losing streak and failed to 
defeat a program above the Division II level. Northridge hasn't put together a 
winning record since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw it all together and it doesn't generate much goodwill among Northridge 
denizens. If these are the economic winds of change, some want the football 
team standing downwind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kopita, Northridge's dean of students, said feedback he has received from 
the campus community has been running 50-50 on whether to retain football. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita last month established a three-member committee of administrators to 
address athletic funding scenarios for 1995 and beyond. The group is 
scrutinizing the departmental budget -- which stands at $3.6 million for 
1994-95 -- and will outline cuts and configurations to be presented to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 If the process sounds somewhat familiar, it should. Two years ago, an 
independent panel of administrators and analysts formed by Wilson released a 
study in which it recommended that Northridge retain its I-AA football program. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel determined that football would cost Northridge $189,000 for 1993, in 
large part because the program generated $150,000 in guarantees for playing 
road games with Northern Arizona and Division I schools San Diego State and 
Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 In an estimate he termed "pessimistic" since revenue hasn't been fully 
calculated, Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said football carried a price tag of 
approximately $350,000 this fall when the school received only $55,000 in 
football guarantees. Fund-raising also is down this fall, Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating the program would seemingly pare the athletic department's 
impending $700,000 deficit in half -- but there's a catch. The loss of 
football, even a shoestring program such as Northridge's, could hamper the 
department's ability to generate funds across the board, officials cautioned. 
Fund-Raising Could Take a Hit 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bubb, an assistant athletic director who oversees most of the 
department's fund-raising ventures, said football was the key element in 
landing a sponsorship from a major beer manufacturer. Corporate sponsorship 
packages run between $14,000 and $20,000 annually and often include radio 
spots, Bubb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some (sponsorships) might be curtailed or cut" if football is eliminated, 
Bubb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubb started at Northridge five years ago, when the school moved up from 
Division II. Uncertainty surrounding athletics is damaging the department's 
credibility in the Division I ranks, not to mention its ability to harvest the 
corporate and community cash crops, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate sponsorship packages and advertising generated $95,000 for the 
department in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're behind where we could be or should be in terms of what we generate," 
Bubb said. "The inability to generate or follow through on a plan of action 
hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 With the program's future in doubt, the private sector is watching. Gary Gray, 
president of the Matador Athletic Assn. board of directors, a booster club that 
helps generate funds for Northridge sports, said finding deep-pocket donors is 
next to impossible given the department's state of flux. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to get a response from the business community," said Gray, an 
attorney from Encino. "(Potential donors) have a difficult time going to their 
board of directors and saying, 'Let's give to this program,' when nobody seems 
sure about the direction of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Losing football won't make fund-raising easier. Gray said it is conceivable 
that club membership could dwindle in light of football's popularity, which in 
turn might affect fund-raising for other Northridge sports. The Athletic Assn. 
stages a series of golf tournaments and auctions that generate between $5,000 
and $22,000 per event and whose proceeds are earmarked for several sports, Bubb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the association raised $170,000 for Matador athletics, of which 
$21,000 went to football. The totals include donations and fund-raisers. Both 
figures were considered uncharacteristically low because quake-related 
developments hindered fund-raising efforts, several department officials said. 
The Domino Effect 
</P>
<P>
 There's a human element, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Four full-time and four restricted-earnings coaching positions would be 
eliminated along with the football team. Coach Bob Burt's contract, which runs 
through next season, stipulates that he loses his job if the program is 
canceled. Burt has a nine-year record of 49-46 and is one of two coaches in the 
program's 33-year history with a winning career mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt has begun recruiting players for 1995. Not an enviable position in light 
of the program's very public state of flux. Burt will stay the course, because 
the rest is out of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they drop the bomb, then we'll scatter for cover," Burt said. "I'm 
operating on the premise that there will be a program. I've got a job to do and 
I plan to do it as well as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen of the 73 players on the 1994 roster will be seniors next fall. If 
the program is cut, finding a Division I or I-AA school at which to play won't 
be easy, even for the most talented. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's vital to find a team and to practice in spring ball at that school," 
said Hall, a junior who finished second in the conference with 47 receptions. 
"If they wait too long to make a decision, it's too late. . . . Don't keep us 
hanging." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the department's chances of someday joining a Division I 
conference with guaranteed postseason berths, such as the Big Sky, likely will 
evaporate if football does likewise, athletics administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Northridge's football program joins Long Beach, Fullerton and UC Santa 
Barbara on the extinction list, Southern California will be left with four 
teams above Division III -- UCLA, USC, San Diego State and University of San 
Diego (a non-scholarship I-AA program). 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, the booster club president, has a request for Kopita and other senior 
school administrators: Make a mission statement and stick with it. He adds an 
aside: Football is worth keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does a school opera have to turn a profit to be worthwhile?" Gray said. "Does 
a play or a musical event have to make money (to be staged)? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think to eliminate a major program hurts the totality of the university." 
Boon for Other Sports 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone may mourn the possible loss of football. Former Fullerton 
athletic director Shumard said some coaches there claimed that football's 
losing record stigmatized the entire department. In some quarters of the Titan 
athletic department, no tears were shed when football was flushed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called it an albatross," Shumard said. "They thought it affected 
everything from recruiting to our overall image." 
</P>
<P>
 Football's elimination meant more money was spread over fewer programs, 
Shumard said, because football's allocation wasn't redirected into academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate," Shumard said. "That's a political battle fought on any 
campus (in the process of trimming sports programs)." 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems. In fact, Hiegert said, it is an "incorrect assumption" that 
football's termination means more for other Matador programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has said that if we drop football, resources from the students and the 
state will stay the same," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some of the department's funding sources are unpredictable or 
discretionary. Revenue from certain accounts can fluctuate wildly from year to 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 * Athletics receives $4 per student each semester and enrollment this fall 
fell to 24,378, down 10% from 1993-94 alone. When the school moved to Division 
I five years ago, projections pointed toward an enrollment of 40,000 by the 
turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the past three years, money from the state general fund has dropped by 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Annual funding from the school's University Corporation, formerly called the 
Foundation, has fallen from $430,000 in 1993-94 to $225,000 this year. It is 
unclear to what degree, if any, the Corporation will fund athletics next year, 
Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which means Northridge coaches aren't cartwheeling down the hallways at 
the thought of football being axed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody here (among the coaching staff) is in favor of 
canceling football, though we might be if we thought we'd benefit from it," 
said John Price, the men's volleyball coach. "I think we'll be funded at the 
same . . . level regardless." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with 24,000 students, Northridge ranks among the nation's 60 largest 
universities, according to NCAA figures. Shumard believes large colleges can 
easily maintain a national athletic identity without football. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, a Cal State school which dropped football in 1991, unveiled a new 
gymnasium Nov. 30 and has designated six sports of paramount importance -- 
men's and women's basketball and volleyball, baseball and softball have become 
departmental focal points. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard said "the company line" is that being nationally competitive in these 
programs is not only realistic but attainable. Nobody talks much about football 
anymore. Long Beach has retooled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to select what we're going to be good at and walk our talk in those 
sports," Shumard said. "If you make it work in those sports, maybe you add 
football again later. Who knows?"

BASEBALL LABOR TALKS; PLAYERS' NEWEST PROPOSAL DOESN'T INCLUDE A CEILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The baseball players' union completed the framework of a multifaceted proposal 
Wednesday that it will deliver to the owners in Rye Brook, N.Y., Saturday, the 
final attempt to reach a negotiated settlement before the owners declare an 
impasse and implement their salary-cap proposal next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the new proposal, reached in deliberations with more than 80 
players in Atlanta over the last three days, were not revealed, but it does not 
include the one item owners have wanted most: a ceiling on cost controls, be it 
a straight cap or a high-rate tax plan that includes a payroll ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't give them a cap, nor do they expect us to offer one because they 
know our view on artificial restraints," union leader Donald Fehr said from 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're giving them a number of new and different elements designed to 
address all of the stated concerns of the (owners) regarding the future 
financial health of the sport and which require a commitment of both players 
and clubs to the long-term interests of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're interested in bargaining, the road map is there. If not, they'll 
dismiss it like they have everything else we've proposed. I won't make a 
prediction, but we feel good about it. We think it has a good shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Devoid of a cap and/or the elimination of salary arbitration, as the owners 
have also proposed, the union's optimism probably translates to wishful 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the proposal includes a 5.33% tax on the club's with the highest 
revenues and payrolls, generating about $58 million to be shared with the 
smaller-revenue clubs. The rate is up from a 1.6% union proposal in September 
that generated about $30 million, but is far short of the owners' tax plan, 
which includes a payroll ceiling and tax of more than 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 The union proposal retains free agency and arbitration in their current forms, 
but also calls for joint marketing and capital ventures, including elements of 
a suggestion made by Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos, who has said some of 
the funds shared by the clubs should be designated for stadium construction in 
cities where a new stadium would make a difference. If accepted, the proposal 
would also give the union a partnership voice in the hiring of a commissioner 
and the signing of TV contracts, among other major industry decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kansas City pitcher David Cone: "The key issue is the taxation plan. We 
feel we've come a long way toward trying to make a compromise. . . . We know 
this isn't the time to make a proposal that will be rejected and not lead to 
anything."

CHANDLER HAS PUT LIFE BACK ON TRACK; MOTOCROSS: A QUADRIPLEGIC SINCE 1985 
ACCIDENT, FORMER CHAMPION KEEPS BUSY WITH VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For four months in 1982, Danny (Magoo) Chandler was the finest motocross rider 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1977 to 1985, he was -- if not the best -- certainly the most spectacular 
rider in the sport. Chandler's showboat way of ending a race, one hand off the 
handlebars and the bike nearly horizontal to the ground -- "as flat as a 
pancake," he called it -- was a crowd-pleaser from the Coliseum to Paris, from 
Carlsbad to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 It all came to a crashing end one December night in Paris in 1985 when 
Chandler was temporarily blinded by photographer's lights as he pancaked high 
above the finish line at Bercy Stadium. He had just won his heat in the Paris 
Supercross. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember anything about the accident, but I've studied it a hundred 
times in super-slow motion," Chandler said. "I can see the flashes going off 
and I'm coming down and I don't land right, like I couldn't see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd done the pancake so many times for so many years that I thought I could 
do it blindfolded, but this time I never got my hand back on the handlebar 
before I hit. The bike crashed into some hay bales that pitched me off, and I 
hit a cameraman before I landed headfirst on the concrete floor." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact broke his neck, leaving him a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, my body felt like it weighed 1,000 pounds, gravity was pushing me 
down," Chandler said. "It was two years before I could reconcile what had 
happened and I was halfway normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends know, though, that he was never "normal." A hyper, freckle-faced 
redhead from Foresthill, Calif., a mountain town between Sacramento and Lake 
Tahoe, Chandler came pancaking out of Placer County to become a cult hero to 
the young motocrossers who loved his daredevil image. His slogan was, "If you 
don't crash once in a while, you're not going fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
 In that four-month span in 1982, Chandler won the U.S. Grand Prix at Carlsbad, 
all four races of the Motocross des Nations in Europe against the world's best 
250cc and 500cc riders, and came back to Carlsbad to win the Superbikers, a 
motorcycle decathlon involving champions from all types of cycle competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like all I had to do was throw my leg over the bike and I had 
everybody covered," he said. "Looking back, my biggest problem was that I 
didn't give a darn about winning championships. All I wanted to do was win 
races, have fun and give the crowd a thrill. There were times when I'd rather 
jump higher than anybody ever jumped off a ramp than lead a race." 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine years since Chandler's crash, he has had his ups and downs -- more 
downs than ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part (of being paralyzed) was realizing that life wasn't going to 
go on like it had," he said. "There's no way you can be prepared for the shock 
that you're never going to do what you used to do. And no one can tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 When he realized what a helpless feeling it was, Chandler helped produce a 
30-minute video that he hoped would help explain to paraplegics what it was 
going to be like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not long after (the accident), my wife left me and my mother died," he said. 
"I hit the bottom then. I started hanging out in the local bars and felt like 
life was not worth living. Losing my wife and my mother hurt worse than the 
injuries, but sometimes you've got to hit the bottom before you start climbing 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The climb out started when Chandler met Brenda Beechler in a Foresthill bar. 
She was a little down on her luck too, and they decided to battle back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the hardest thing about being crippled, after some time passes by, is 
admitting to yourself that you're never going to be independent," Chandler 
said. "You have to have someone with you. I tried hard to do it by myself, but 
now that Brenda's with me, I know I need her." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, with Brenda at his side, will take part this weekend in the "Legends 
of Motorcycling" feature of the Cycle World International Motorcycle Show at 
the Anaheim Convention Center. Along with Don Emde, the 1972 Daytona 200 
winner, and Jim Holley, the 1982 world supercross champion, Chandler will show 
film clips of his races and be interviewed by master of ceremonies Larry 
Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two years, Chandler's life has been full of mountain bike racing, 
which he promotes on the High Sierra ski runs near his home in Foresthill, 
learning to ski in his wheelchair and designing a wheelchair that will allow 
him and other paraplegics to race on mountain trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mountain bikes are about where motocross was 20 years ago," he said. "It's 
easy to attract a lot of riders, but I keep busy going to city hall meetings, 
working with the forest service and the environmentalists to keep areas open 
for competition. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Someday, I'd like to promote a major league motocross, like the ones I used 
to race. I still enjoy motorcycles. I owe a lot to the sport and I feel a need 
to tell young kids how important it is to take some responsibility in keeping 
it on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, 35, can't do the "pancake" anymore, but he's still as competitive as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets pretty gnarly out there," he said of his mountain bike courses. "And 
I still crash. I always fall out of my chair once or twice a week. The guys 
who've never been around wheelchairs much say, 'You're crazy.' I think that's 
cool."

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL; BLUE DEVILS NEXT STEP FOR BRUINS

 UCLA, playing in the South Region of the NCAA women's volleyball tournament, 
is expected to have the easiest time of the three local teams playing today and 
Friday in regional semifinal games. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (29-3) will play Duke (24-5) today at 2 p.m. PST in the NCAA South Region 
semifinals at Gainesville, Fla., and USC will play Arizona at 6 p.m. in the 
West Region semifinals at Stanford. Long Beach State (26-5) will play host to 
Hawaii (25-4) on Friday at 8 p.m. in the Northwest Region semifinals in the 
Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 The South and West regional finals will be held on Friday, and the Northwest 
regional final will be held on Saturday at their respective sites. Winners will 
advance to the final four Dec. 15 and 17 at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-ranked UCLA is top-seeded in the South Region and should have a 
relatively easy time at that regional tournament, where no other team is ranked 
higher than No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The road has become a familiar place for the Bruins, who started the season 
with three tournaments -- at Honolulu, at Tallahassee, Fla., and at La Grange, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which won NCAA titles in 1984, 1990 and 1991, was shut out by BYU in the 
West Regional final at UCLA last year and failed to advance to the NCAA final 
four for the first time since 1987. Annett Buckner, the Pacific 10 player of 
the year who leads the conference with 4.95 kills per game, will try to lead 
the Bruins back to the NCAA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other South Regional semifinal, No. 14 Florida (28-5) will play No. 17 
Houston (25-6). The semifinal winners will play Friday at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For No. 10 USC, the West Regional tournament is packed with four teams from 
the powerful Pac-10, including second-ranked Stanford.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (21-7) are trying to advance to the NCAA semifinals for the first 
time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Arizona (17-9) is led by Barb Bell, a sophomore who averages 4.52 
kills.  
</P>
<P>
 In the other West Regional semifinal, No. 15 Arizona State (18-9) will play 
Stanford (28-1).

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL FINAL FOUR MOVING TO ESPN; TELEVISION: OFFICIALS LAUD DEAL 
THAT WILL ADD DAY OF REST BETWEEN SEMIFINALS AND FINAL AND PROVIDE COVERAGE OF 
EARLIER ROUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 NCAA women's basketball officials reacted positively to the announcement 
Wednesday that their Final Four will move beginning in 1996 from CBS to ESPN, 
even though the money they are receiving from the cable network is minuscule 
compared to the television money for the men's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN will pay $19 million for the women's tournament during a seven-year 
stretch through 2002. CBS announced Tuesday a $1.725-billion deal to televise 
the men's tournament during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cedric Dempsey, executive director of the NCAA: "We had two priorities 
for the women's basketball championship: a day of rest between the semifinals 
and final, and live coverage of earlier rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 In the new agreement, ESPN or ESPN2 will televise 19 NCAA championship events 
from the 1995-96 academic year through 2001-2002, and part of that agreement 
calls for ESPN to carry the NCAA women's basketball tournament exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN will televise eight games from the round of 32 and all games after that. 
The semifinals will be played Friday night and the final Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's Final Four went to consecutive days -- the semifinals on Saturday, 
the final on Sunday -- at the behest of CBS, which began carrying both in 1991. 
Before that, beginning in 1982, CBS carried only the final, and there was a day 
of rest after the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Barmore, the women's coach at Louisiana Tech, called the ESPN deal a 
major step up for women's basketball.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to really elevate the women's game in this country," he said. 
"We are now with the right network. I just don't think CBS cared about us 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Barmore had been an outspoken critic of the back-to-back schedule.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a good mind to put these young women on a plane tonight and take 
them home," he said after his team defeated Alabama, 69-66, in the semifinals 
last April. 
</P>
<P>
 "If television made the men play back-to-back days for their championship. . . 
. Well, it just wouldn't be allowed to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Holland, UCLA senior associate athletic director and a former chairman of 
the NCAA's women's basketball committee, pointed out another plus with the ESPN 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never knew how much we were actually getting from CBS because we were 
lumped in with a lot of other sports," she said. "This way, we are dealing 
directly with ESPN." 
</P>
<P>
 Len DiLuca, vice president of programming for CBS Sports, said the network did 
not want to lose the women's basketball package. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were delighted to be partners with the women for so many years, and would 
have loved to have continued that partnership," he said. "But they, choosing to 
take a risk, went elsewhere so they get the day of rest and also get more 
exposure for the earlier rounds."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; THERE'S A STORM BREWING OVER LOPEZ AT 
ST. JOHN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mid-October. Third day of practice. St. John's assistant coach Ron Rutledge is 
standing under the basket as freshman guard Felipe Lopez runs through a play. 
Rutledge, the guy responsible for signing America's No. 1 recruit, is 
overwhelmed by the sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "George," he says to Red Storm assistant George Felton, "I just can't believe 
that he's here." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Lopez is everywhere. On the cover of Sports Illustrated. On ESPN. On 
the minds of every opposing coach who has to deal with his 19.6-point, 
4.4-rebound, 2.6-steal averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks partly to Lopez, St. John's is 5-0 for the first time since 1990-91, 
the same season it advanced to the NCAA regional finals. Attendance is up. 
Interest is through the Alumni Hall roof. People are talking St. John's hoops 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 And all because of Lopez, the 6-foot-5 shooting guard who starred at Rice High 
in New York, who led the team to a state championship, who earned MVP honors at 
Magic Johnson's all-star game in Detroit and at the McDonald's All-America 
competition, who reportedly could have signed a $400,000 deal to play in Spain 
this season and might be in the NBA by next season. 
</P>
<P>
 So things are hunky-dory at St. John's, right? After all, the school's address 
isn't 8000 Utopia Parkway by accident, is it? RED STORM RISING--PART II 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, not so fast. Quoting an anonymous St. John's player, a recent 
Village Voice story suggested that Lopez's instant fame has caused resentment 
among his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, someone's jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, (guard Derek) Brown and (swingman James) Scott are seniors who 
hoped to play in the NBA all their lives," the player said in the story. "This 
was going to be their year to show their stuff to all the scouts. Then here 
comes a young kid who never played a game as yet, a freshman straight out of 
high school, and suddenly all we hear about is Felipe this and Felipe that. 
It's not fair. We're not even the St. John's team any more. We're just Felipe 
Lopez's teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction: Last season's St. John's team without Lopez was 12-17. St. John's 
team with Lopez is undefeated. Next question. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutledge hasn't read the Village Voice story, but he didn't need to. Told of 
the verbal back-stabbing aimed at Lopez, Rutledge quickly dismissed it as 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I've observed, (Lopez and fellow prized recruit Zendon Hamilton) 
have been well received by their teammates and by the coaches and by the 
university," he said. "I don't sense any resentment to the attention they've 
received at this point. Everybody seems to be very comfortable with the 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 If Lopez, 19, is worried about the story, he doesn't show it. He says all the 
right things in interviews and does all the right things on the court. If it's 
an act, Lopez has fooled a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that (Lopez and Hamilton) are such easy people to get along 
with," Rutledge said. "They handle the notoriety without any ego problems. They 
realize it's a team sport. They don't want to take anything. They want to 
share." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Chris DeLorenzo, the St. John's assistant sports information 
director who travels with the team and helps arrange Lopez's interview 
schedule: "He's a really good kid, a team player." VCR SCOUTING 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches continue to do a slow burn over the NCAA rule that prohibits them from 
scouting opponents in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Enacted with the blessings, if not the urging, of the powerful Presidents 
Commission, the measure was seen as another way to cut costs and at the same 
time, put a shorter leash on coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 True enough, money has been saved. Under most arrangements, a school now sends 
its next opponent four of its most recent game tapes. Compare the cost of 
mailing a tape overnight vs. sending a coach on the road and you can understand 
why the presidents loved the new rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the coaches are wondering whatever happened to the wonderful world 
of legislative quid pro quo . 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the rule," Kansas Coach Roy Williams said. "The biggest reason I 
don't like the rule is because as coaches we felt like we were giving up 
something that we wanted to do in the scouting rule, thinking we were going to 
get something back from the Presidents Commission. Needless to say, they took 
what we gave and gave us nothing back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just keep giving, giving, giving and not getting anything back in return, 
so I have selfish motivations there." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches' shopping list: an added scholarship, freshmen ineligibility, some 
room on standardized testing requirements. Instead, Williams said, the coaches 
are running out of patience and bargaining chips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a pretty good collection of ties, myself personally," Williams said. 
"I think that's about the only thing we have left. I think we've given in every 
area that you can possibly give. We keep getting hit right between the eyes. 
Unless they like my collection of ties, I don't know if I've got much left that 
I can give them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhetoric aside, the worst part of the rule has to do with scouting snafus. 
Kansas State Coach Tom Asbury wouldn't name names, but he said his staff 
recently received an opponent tape of such low quality "that we couldn't even 
see the (uniform) numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury is like most coaches. Given his druthers, he'd rather scout a team in 
person. You get a feel for a player's size, his quickness, his intensity. . . . 
all the intangibles that don't necessarily appear on a videotape filmed from a 
single halfcourt camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't particularly like the rule," Asbury said. "But that's not the first 
rule we're not crazy about." 
</P>
<P>
 Get used to it, fellas. It won't be the last. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 If you're keeping count--and they are at St. John's and Georgetown-- Lopez is 
trailing slightly in the Big East Conference freshman of the year November- 
December balloting. You know about Lopez's numbers, but before Wednesday 
night's game against Providence, Georgetown point guard Allen Iverson was 
averaging 22.7 points, 5.3 assists and 2.7 rebounds. Lopez does lead the league 
in the all-important interview category. Lopez is available on Thursdays, but 
Iverson isn't available until the beginning of second semester--standard Coach 
John Thompson operating procedure for freshmen. . . . New Iowa State Coach Tim 
Floyd has found life in the Big Eight Conference a bit more intense than at the 
University of New Orleans. Marathon Oil beat the Cyclones in an exhibition 
game, which didn't go over very well in Ames. And then there are the recruiting 
problems. Because of the timing of his hiring, Sept. 9 was the first time Floyd 
and his staff could visit prospects. By then, Iowa State was dead. "(Other 
recruiters) were more or less high-fiving with the youngsters and we were 
having to explain who we were," Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks into the season and already there have been three No. 1 
teams--Arkansas, Massachusetts and North Carolina. Last season there were six 
changes atop the polls. So what does it mean? At the moment, not much. The 
Razorbacks, No. 1 ranking or not, still remain the favorite to repeat. "Last 
year I felt like and said that from December on, I thought the two teams that 
had the most players and who could withstand problems easier than anyone else 
were Arkansas and North Carolina," said Kansas' Williams. "I didn't have any 
doubt in my mind about that. This year I think Arkansas is clearly a team that 
can stand more problems, injuries and things like that than anybody else."

 Ralph Willard, who left Western Kentucky to rebuild Pittsburgh's program, is 
having all sorts of fun. The Panthers played last Saturday's game against 
Buffalo with five scholarship players. That's because point guard Andre 
Aldridge, a former walk-on who inherited the starting job after star Jerry 
McCullough tore up his knee this summer, was suspended for one game. Then guard 
Garrick Thomas was given a one-game suspension for violating an NCAA rule. Pitt 
was back up to seven scholarship players for Tuesday's game against St. John's, 
but the Panthers still lost. Some good news: Senior forward Chris Gant, who has 
a stress fracture in his foot, will return in the next week or two.  
</P>
<P>
 Spanning the globe in search of a center, George Washington Coach Mike Jarvis 
has found another foreigner to replace Yinka Dare, the Nigerian who surprised 
the Colonials by ditching the team for the NBA after his sophomore season. This 
time Alexander Koul of Belarus is in the pivot and playing beyond expectations. 
The 7-1, 265-pounder is averaging 13 points, five rebounds and shooting 69.8% 
from the field. He had 13 points in his debut, which just happened to be the 
same night the Colonials upset Syracuse. Last Friday, he made 13 of 14 shots 
against South Carolina State. The Colonials are 5-2, but the best news has 
nothing to do with their record. According to Jarvis, Koul isn't expected to 
pull a Dare-like shocker and leave early.

DESORMEAUX GETS A STAY OF SUSPENSION FROM STEWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux received a stay of the five-day suspension given him by 
Hollywood Park stewards on Wednesday for standing up before the wire in a race 
last Saturday, and he will be able to ride Wekiva Springs in the Underwood on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Third approaching the wire in Saturday's second race on About To Shout, 
Desormeaux stood up and the 3-year-old was passed by Air Corn. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been cited five previous times by the stewards for similar errors. He 
was fined four times in amounts ranging from $200 to $1,000 and was suspended 
for five days in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Off his mounts because of flu last Wednesday and Thursday and able to ride 
only his first three mounts on Friday night, Desormeaux avoided a 10-day 
suspension only because he attributed Saturday's incident to his illness. After 
riding About To Shout, he was off his remaining mounts Saturday and he did not 
ride Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux could face another five-day suspension after his disqualification 
aboard Sham Pain in Wednesday's seventh race. The 3-year-old filly, seeking her 
sixth victory in a row, was disqualified and placed second for interfering with 
runner-up Choobloo nearing the finish line. BOB MIESZERSKI

 What's golf without another new event? 
</P>
<P>
 One less television program. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.1-million Diners Club Matches, made-for-television match play among 
members from the PGA, Senior PGA and LPGA tours, begin today at the Nicklaus 
Resort Course at PGA West. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular tour matches start today with 16 teams. There is $890,000 at stake 
with $250,000 going to the winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded is the duo of Lanny Wadkins and Paul Azinger; Loren Roberts and 
Rick Fehr are seeded second. Other teams include Fuzzy Zoeller-Curtis Strange, 
Phil Mickelson-Ben Crenshaw and Hale Irwin-Jay Haas. 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors and the women, who are playing for $610,000 in prize money, begin 
play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 All three tournaments end Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer are seeded first in the seniors' bracket, and 
they will open against Simon Hobday and Tom Weiskopf. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kelly Robbins and Tammie Green are top-seeded in the LPGA tour bracket, which 
also features a partnership between Hall of Fame members Patty Sheehan and 
Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament will use a four-ball format. Each player plays his or her own 
ball with the better score of the two partners counting as the team's score on 
a hole.

 C'EST LA VIE ; FRENCH TEAM'S YACHT DAMAGED IN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The French team's yacht for the upcoming America's Cup races was damaged 
Wednesday during an accident in the team compound on Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 A piece of equipment used to lift the yacht into the water failed, dropping 
the yacht and forcing the keel up through the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no structural damage to the hull, the French syndicate said. But the 
yacht's deck suffered substantial damage and the mast is beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't immediately known how much it will cost to repair the boat, said 
French team skipper Marc Pajot. A new mast alone could cost $300,000 to 
$500,000, but the French team said it has a spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Pajot predicted the repairs could be finished within two weeks. Until then, 
the French team will practice on the boat it had used during the 1992 America's 
Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the accident, and Pajot said he felt lucky the damage to 
the boat wasn't worse. The yacht was only a few feet off the ground when the 
lifting box failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pajot and other team sailors were in a meeting in an office building nearby 
when the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The America's Cup teams have been training in the waters off San Diego in 
preparation for the races, which begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The French team is one of the overseas challengers that will compete for the 
right to take on the defending team, America 3.

BIRMINGHAM CAN WRAP UP CITY 3-A TITLE AS PERFECT GIFT FOR RETIRING EPSTEIN . . 
. ; WHO SAVED BEST TEAM FOR LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was graduation day 1968 at Birmingham High and Mitch Voges, future U.S. 
Amateur golf champion, was about to venture down the long fairway of adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 A 26-year-old man called Chick by most and Coach by Voges stood quietly at the 
rear of the room, his face beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the biggest smile I've ever seen and it conveyed one thing: his love 
for kids," Voges said. "He was satisfied with the work he had done." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan (Chick) Epstein was near the beginning of a coaching career that would 
take him down many tranquil fairways and many tumultuous football fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a lifetime later, Epstein, 52, a genuinely nice guy in a high-octane, 
high-decibel fraternity, will retire as football coach after Birmingham's game 
against Bell on Friday night for the City Section 3-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 What in many ways has been an ordinary career is ending in extraordinary 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein has spent most of his 17 years as head football coach in frustration. 
Some opposing teams bent recruiting rules, players lacked commitment, only one 
assistant coach could be scrounged up: This was the norm, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the players who walked through my door, for better or worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for one joyous run, the Braves (7-5-1) have outlasted the rules-benders 
with committed players coached by a crack staff of five. A Birmingham team that 
endured a four-game losing streak at midseason and was seeded last in the 3-A 
playoffs has defeated No. 1-seeded Reseda, Monroe and Wilson in succession. 
</P>
<P>
 This has become one heck of a last hurrah. Chick-a-boom!  
</P>
<P>
 "To have players who really care, to have a strong staff and to put it all 
together, this has been a dream of mine," said Epstein, whose career record is 
78-85-4 with six playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship game is the Braves' first since they won the City title in 
1963. That year, Epstein walked onto the Birmingham campus for the first time 
as a student teacher, UCLA diploma in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned letters in football, baseball, basketball and track at Santa Monica 
High before playing three years of baseball at UCLA on a partial scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 It might appear out of character for the unassuming Epstein to say, "I am a 
good athlete," almost by way of introduction, but athleticism is at the core of 
his identity. In an unguarded moment he admits his dream is to play enough golf 
to improve his 4-handicap and take a stab at the Seniors Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-day tryout with the Dodgers was the closest he got to a professional 
baseball career, so he followed in the footsteps of his older brother, Jack, 
and became a high school coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's first years at Birmingham were spent coaching B basketball, wrestling 
and junior varsity baseball. He took over the golf program in 1966 and over the 
past 28 years coached seven boys who eventually earned PGA Tour cards. 
</P>
<P>
 But football was the passion of the Epstein brothers (a third brother, Arnold, 
is a Beverly Hills physician). Jack was an early architect of the run-and-shoot 
who retired last year after more than 30 years coaching at Palisades, Narbonne, 
Hamilton and West L.A. College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were football buffs, traveling all over to attend clinics," Epstein said. 
"I looked up to Jack. I don't think he ever had a losing season." 
</P>
<P>
 As coach at Hamilton in the early 1970s, Jack developed a sprint-out passing 
offense utilizing one running back and four wide receivers. And he found the 
ideal quarterback: Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago as a guest of Roy Firestone, Moon was asked about the Houston 
Oilers' supposedly revolutionary run-and-shoot attack. "It's no different than 
what Jack Epstein taught me at Hamilton High," Moon replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, who picked up the nickname while carrying a chicken across his Santa 
Monica schoolyard as a third-grader, was Jack's assistant. He would teach at 
Birmingham then drive to Hamilton for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning to Birmingham and serving as defensive coordinator for a few 
years, Epstein was named head coach in 1978. He and his wife Mona bought a home 
in Agoura Hills and raised their sons, Josh and Matt. Both became all-league 
receivers, Josh at Birmingham and Matt at Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring Epstein still coached golf, and eventually he opened a summer 
youth golf camp, but it was the football team that often was below par. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had a team that could win," he said. "Even when I had good athletes I 
never had the line. That's the difference this year, we are beating them up 
front." 
</P>
<P>
 A nucleus of eight three-year varsity players -- including linemen Jimmy 
Uline, Mauro Navarro and David San Vicente -- have provided consistency and 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein and his most-experienced players forged a relationship of mutual 
respect through two years of enduring a roller-coaster ride together. The 
Braves were 4-5-1 last season and 5-4 in '92, and some of the turbulence 
carried into this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning quarterback Paul Prince was replaced by Courtney Blunt to open this 
season after Prince missed several summer practices. After one game, Epstein 
reinserted Prince and moved Blunt to tailback. Blunt flourished and has rushed 
for 1,528 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys didn't look to me as a leader," Prince said. "Coach and I 
had a long talk about showing poise in the huddle and showing leadership on and 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could be more like him, calm all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein realizes he is easygoing almost to a fault. That's why he has kept Tom 
Richards, a demonstrative coach, as an assistant since Richards retired as 
Sylmar head coach in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Being nice and calm as a coach can invite misbehavior. Uline, the team's 
senior center and three-year starter, witnessed as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach is such a great guy that I saw seniors last year and the year before 
take advantage of him," Uline said. "They'd take too long of a water break or 
talk back to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a nice guy. You could tell he was mad but he wouldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 As he approaches his final game, however, Epstein's kindly manner is entirely 
appropriate. Warmth permeates the locker room after a practice this week as the 
coach walks through slowly, patting players on the shoulder, asking about minor 
injuries, giving encouragement. Everyone is at ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein stops at a locker to check on Marvin Powell, a four-year starter who 
suffered a frightening neck injury against Wilson. It turned out to be only a 
sprain, but immediately after the game Powell's football future was in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was shocked but you could really tell Epstein was very hurt by it," 
Uline said. "It showed the compassion he has for his players, how much he cares 
about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Voges, who occasionally plays a round of golf with his former coach, remembers 
a youthful Epstein much the way current players describe him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He cares about people," Voges said. "Loyal, caring, thoughtful. From the 
bottom of his heart he wants to see people succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Success in the form of a championship game found Epstein, a nice guy who might 
just finish first.

RELATED PURSUITS; FATHER AND SON FORGIONE SEEK SOCCER SUCCESS AT RIVAL HIGH 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Matias Forgione worked his way through the postgame handshake line with the 
rest of the Kennedy High soccer team, then dallied for a few minutes, talking 
with friends and teammates in the center of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking free, Forgione, 16, broke into a loud laugh as he glanced toward one 
of the goals and spied the opposing team being put through a series of postgame 
wind sprints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, look at those guys run," Forgione said to no one in particular. "I love 
my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Forgione, was referring to the man directing the runners: his father, Rafael, 
the first-year boys' soccer coach at Granada Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 That father and son would find themselves on the same soccer field in the 
United States, let alone associated with rival teams in the North Valley 
League, would have seemed improbable several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rafael emigrated from Argentina to the United States in 1982, he left his 
wife and three children behind, hoping they could eventually follow. When that 
plan failed, Forgione's marriage dissolved and ended in divorce. He saw his 
children only on short visits to Argentina every few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he was preoccupied with survival and building a new life. Ten years 
later, with Rafael established as a successful businessman in the San Fernando 
Valley, Matias came to live with him at his Granada Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still adjusting to each other," Rafael said shortly after Matias' 
Kennedy team beat Granada Hills, 2-1, last week. "He gives me a hard time like 
every 16-year-old kid does to their dad. I don't think he takes life too 
seriously; he doesn't realize this is the land of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael is certainly aware that opportunities abound in the United States. He 
speaks so glowingly he could be a publicist for The American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize how nice this country is when you come from different 
places and see how many nice things there are here," Rafael said. "Always, 
since I was a little child, I was impressed with the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael is a native of Buenos Aires where he grew up playing soccer, first in 
the streets and later in high school. After studying architecture at Buenos 
Aires University for two years, Forgione came to Los Angeles at 26, leaving his 
old life behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew only the friend of a friend of a friend when I got here," Rafael said. 
Rafael, who is currently a resident alien but expects to become a U.S. citizen 
next June. "But she was kind enough to put me up in a hotel and arrange to get 
me a Social Security number and driver's license, all the things you need to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 After working at a series of odd jobs, including dishwasher, gas station 
attendant and courier, Rafael acquired a real estate license and became a 
broker with a West Los Angeles firm. However, he grew frustrated by the demands 
of his job and in 1989 opened his own real estate business in Granada Hills. He 
also remarried. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Matias and his younger brother, Nicolas, spent two months in the 
United States visiting their father. Matias liked it so much he came back for 
good in December of 1992, although he had many adjustments to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were gang members you had to watch out for, and the Hispanics and some 
of the white boys make fun of Argentinians for their accents," Matias said. "I 
had to get used to a whole new neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 In Argentina, Matias had been accustomed to taking school lightly and living 
it up at night. Rafael put a screeching halt to that, though he still struggles 
to impart the importance of academics to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was always trying to step on my back," Matias said. "In Argentina the 
kids go out at night and party more and I liked that way to live. But my dad 
talked to me about it and if I do it (again) he will yell at me."  
</P>
<P>
 For a while, father and son worked together on Matias' soccer skills, going 
through speed, agility and ball-handling drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning we worked a lot, but now he gets too cocky on me," Rafael 
said with a smile. "He's got good skills but he has to put a little more heart 
in his game." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his father, Matias learned the game in the streets of Buenos Aires, often 
playing with rolled-up socks instead of a ball. Less than a month after 
arriving in California, he joined a club soccer team that includes many Latino 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was easier for me after (joining the team)," said Matias, who found 
another Argentinian on the roster. "I made a lot of friends -- like half the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Matias' second year on the Kennedy varsity, and Coach Fred Singer has 
started him at midfielder for the first six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great kid and his strength should be in ball distribution, but he's 
still very young," Singer said. "He can be a dominant player when he wants to 
be, but he's got to get to the point where he can do it every time." 
</P>
<P>
 While Matias was breaking in with the Golden Cougars last year, Rafael was 
busy coaching the girls' soccer team at L.A. Baptist to a 5-3 record. He also 
tutored his son's club team briefly earlier this year before quitting to spend 
more time with his family. Ironically, though, it was his wife who steered him 
in the direction of the Granada Hills coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I quit club (coaching) for her but she noticed how I was missing soccer so 
much and she got me an interview at Granada," said Rafael, who was hired in the 
middle of October. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgione inherited a team in disarray, but has the Highlanders 3-3 and said he 
is making strides toward respectability. Nearly 60 boys tried out for soccer 
this season, and Rafael kept 32, though the roster numbered only 23 at the time 
of the Kennedy game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost a lot of players," said Forgione, whose team includes 13 
underclassmen. "I get carried away and yell too much, but I want to put respect 
on the field. We'll give some schools a hard time this year but it's gonna take 
me a while. That's why I recruited so many freshman and sophomores. I can work 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills played well against Kennedy, and if not for shaky goal-tending 
might have won. Matias played about half the match. He said that he was able to 
put aside the thoughts of the family showdown once taking the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of laughing . . . it was the first time we were going against each 
other," Matias said. "All my teammates and our neighbors were talking about it, 
but I didn't even think about it when I was on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Competing against a family member wasn't as easy for Rafael. After rooting 
passionately for Matias and his Kennedy teammates last season, he found 
coaching against them an emotional experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I followed all of their games all season long and watched them play a lot," 
Rafael said. "It was hard to be on this side of the field, but I've got a great 
bunch of kids to work with on my team."

RODMAN TURNS LEAVE OF ABSENCE INTO SUSPENSION WITHOUT PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman was suspended by the San Antonio Spurs for the second time this 
season Wednesday when he failed to return from a 3 1/2-week paid leave of 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Hill said Rodman called during practice Wednesday and said he was in 
Dallas.Rodman told Hill the keys to a friend's truck were stolen from his 
pocket, and some of the player's possessions were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no understanding of why he was not at practice or where he was today," 
Spur General Manager Gregg Popovich said at a news conference. "The excuse was 
not acceptable, if that's what you're wondering." 
</P>
<P>
 This latest suspension is without pay. Popovich said it could be lifted when 
Rodman returns to the team and meets with team officials, but the general 
manager gave no timetable for that happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, 33, whose erratic behavior has been a repeated source of irritation to 
the Spurs, has yet to play this season. He led the league in rebounding the 
last three seasons, averaging 17.3 a game last year.

THE COLLEGES / MIKE HISERMAN; COMMITTEE ON NORTHRIDGE ATHLETICS NOT GIVEN A 
SPORTING CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penny Pincher, Emma Clueless, Alec Smart, Jacque Sniffer and chairman Doc 
Dogood, members of the latest Cal State Northridge committee on athletics, 
convene for the first time -- sometime in the 21st century: 
</P>
<P>
 Bang!  
</P>
<P>
 Doc: I'm calling this meeting to order. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Hey, what kind of gavel is that? 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: It's a ruler, the one Coach Kim Chandler uses to measure the vertical 
leap of her women's basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: It's not very long. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: Doesn't have to be. Anyway, it's time to get down to business. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: Yeah? Well, who put you in charge? 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: Hey, somebody's got to show some leadership around here. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: Hard to argue with that. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: We all know why we're here. Our athletic program is at a crossroads and 
the top-level mucky-mucks in administration want us to take a good long hard 
look at the situation and make some suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 All: Not again! 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: Again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: When is this gonna stop? Hell, groups have been studying athletics 
around here since Reagan was President. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Who? 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: Ronald Reagan, you know, the old actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: There were committees studying athletics before we made the step up to 
NCAA Division I status. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: What's Division I? 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: I'll explain later. Anyway, there was another committee organized by 
President Blenda J. Wilson just after she came here way back when. Was supposed 
to be a "blue-ribbon crew," a panel of experts from across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: What did they say? 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: They said we belonged in Division I and we should keep our football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: Nice choice! 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: Then there was another committee to explore the feasibility of 
instituting some kind of training table or meal plan for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: A what? 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: That's not even worth explaining. Then, after that, another committee was 
formed to research potential budget cuts when athletics started running at a 
deficit because of declining enrollment and damage from one of the earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Which earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: The one in January of '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Oh, that little one. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: Anyway, that's a brief outline of those very first committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: How did we get stuck on this committee, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: The truth? We are the only ones left -- the only folks left on campus who 
haven't served on a previous committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny: I think we should drop football. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: Oh, no. . . . Here we go again. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny: I'm serious. My husband's friend played football here in 1993 and '94 
and he said he felt like quitting anyway. He said that the players were forced 
to eat leftover pizza out of trash bins and that their coaches hollered at them 
too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: '94. . . . Didn't we win a game that year? 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: Yeah, that was the start of the streak. Won three, lost the last five 
and. . . . Well, you know the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque (chuckling): When people ask, I just tell them we've won as many 
football games as our sister schools, Long Beach and Fullerton, since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny: I didn't think Long Beach and Fullerton played football. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: They don't. Geez, try a little wry humor around here. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Coach Bob Burt tries. It's not his fault we had to play Notre Dame, 
Nebraska and Penn State this year just to earn enough money to keep his team in 
tape and shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: Yeah, but don't you think it's embarrassing? I mean, Rudy Jr. scored 
twice against us! 
</P>
<P>
 Penny: I agree. And those player strikes. One a year for what, 17, 18 years 
now? 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: Why did Don Fehr have to get involved? 
</P>
<P>
 Penny: Well, at least we had the foresight to hire Richard Ravitch to 
negotiate for us back in '95 when his contract with the baseball owners was up. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Baseball owners? 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: Remember professional baseball? Went out about the same time as 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Oh, sure. I remember watching the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: That was soccer. Baseball had the World Series and hockey had the 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Oh. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: We're drifting here. Let's get back to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny: We should drop football and concentrate our resources on helping Coach 
Pete Cassidy's men's basketball team. It's easy math. A couple of players and 
St. Pete will have us in the Sweet Sixteen! 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Pardon? 
</P>
<P>
 All: Never mind! 
</P>
<P>
 Penny: Basketball needs to be able to recruit out of state. We have the 
weather. We have Hollywood. We con a coupla city kids from Chicago into 
thinking this campus is oceanfront property and we're on our way. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: One more quake and this campus will be oceanfront property! 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: Why does basketball need to go out of state for players? I happen to 
know, and I'm quoting experts here, that California players are the very best 
because our kids play year-round in our wonderful weather. 
</P>
<P>
 (A long silence) 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: That's baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma: What? 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque: You're talking about baseball. Basketball is played indoors. Anyone 
can play year-round! 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: Folks, once again, let's get back to business. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec: Sure thing Doc. By the way, what are we calling this here committee? 
</P>
<P>
 Doc: I dunno. The guidelines say our charge is to determine whether the 
committees preceding us did their jobs. What say we call this The Committee on 
Committees?

HOLLYFIELD TO HAVE SURGERY TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's Autumn Hollyfield, the leading three-point scorer in 
women's college basketball last season, is scheduled to have arthroscopic 
surgery today on her knee and is expected to be sidelined four to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollyfield, a 5-foot-11 senior forward, was the team's leading scorer last 
season, averaging 17.9 points. She had scored 35 points in the team's first two 
games this season but re-injured the knee in the last game, a 96-74 victory at 
Loyola Marymount. She scored a team-high 23 points in the season-opening loss 
to Washington State.

BOYS' WRESTLING 1994-1995: WRESTLING PREVIEW; GRECO TWINS GIVE LAGUNA HILLS A 
WINNING 1-2 PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 As Jeff Greco remembers it, he was the first to take the plunge into wrestling 
after listening to his father's exploits on the mat. But it didn't take long 
for Jeff's twin brother, Mike, to join. And before long, both were learning the 
sport and coming to the realization that wrestling was their cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1991, during their freshman year at Laguna Hills High. Now 
seniors, the Greco twins are two of the county's best in their weight class and 
have their eyes set on the State championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the end of last season, when both fell short of their desired goal to 
place in the Masters tournament, they have been working hard on conditioning 
and weights and wrestling freestyle during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been training very hard over the summer," Mike said, as Jeff listened 
quietly. "I was disappointed that I didn't get very far in Southern Section 
(Division III finals) last year. I think the dual match with Calvary Chapel 
took it out of a lot of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff fared a bit better at the Division III finals, placing fifth. But 
nevertheless, both agree that Calvary Chapel took the wind out of their sails. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the best," Jeff said of Calvary Chapel. "And though they can get 
wrestlers from anywhere they want, it's still good to have a team like that -- 
a team that is almost untouchable." 
</P>
<P>
 For the brothers, the passion for the sport still burns and their desire to do 
well underlies every word they speak. But unlike some twins, where sibling 
rivalry is the name of the game, Jeff and Mike are surprisingly genteel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really fight anymore. I guess we don't want to hurt each other," 
Jeff said. "I mean we are close, but not like some twins where they spend a lot 
of their time together. We have our friends and interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Off the mat, both excel in the classroom. Jeff has a grade-point average of 
3.9 and Mike's is 3.8. When Jeff and Mike wrestle in practice, they focus on 
techniques of wrestling, advising each other on takedowns and escapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things he's good at that I'm not that great in, and there are 
some things I do better than him," Mike said. "But we talk to each other and 
work on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, a 1994 Pacific Coast League champion with a 41-8 record last season, 
most likely will be wrestling at 135 pounds. Jeff, also a league champion with 
a record of 40-10 last season, will be wrestling at 140. During the summer, 
both attended a two-week Iowa training camp run by wrestling great Dan Gable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was actually our second time going," Mike said. "It's really good as far 
as the intensity level. It makes you mentally tough." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if they roomed together, both smiled and answered, "No!" in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I roomed with someone else," Jeff said. "I mean, we see enough of each other 
at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Casey Elliott, a two-time league champion, also attended the camp. 
Elliott, Scott Moranoue and heavyweight Mark Zolikoff are seniors who started 
wrestling under Coach Cliff Jarmie as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the most close-knit group of guys I've ever had," Jarmie 
said. "As a coach, you go through cycles when it comes to high school athletes. 
There are years when grades, problems at home or getting into trouble keeps me 
busy with some of the wrestlers. But this group is just good kids. . . . You 
just appreciate when you get a group of kids like this." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as predictions, Mike and Jeff think Laguna Hills will win Division III 
now that Calvary Chapel has moved to Division I. Of course, they would also 
have to get by Santa Ana, which is ranked second in the county, according to 
the preseason wrestling polls. Laguna Hills is ranked third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana will be tough. But I still think we can beat them," Jeff said. "We 
all are really up for the season. And if we don't have any injuries, I think we 
have a good chance." 
</P>
<P>
 For both, their desire to have a great year is amplified because both said 
this would probably be their last year wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want to continue wrestling in college," Mike said. "I'll be 
focusing on academics. Wrestling just takes too much time. Besides, I want to 
enjoy my college years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wrestling requires a lot from a person. It requires a lot of dedication and 
hard work if you want to be one of the best. Wrestling taught me how to focus 
and remain on course. It is a great sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff nodded in agreement.

 Notes: Anaheim Coach Joe Mark complained when his team was ranked sixth in the 
Orange County preseason polls: "We should be second behind Calvary Chapel," he 
said, noting the number of returning wrestlers. . . . Every coach and team that 
had to deal with Calvary Chapel in Division III is breathing a sigh of relief 
now that the Eagles have flown the coop and moved up to Division I. Most 
coaches agree Calvary Chapel will repeat as State champions as yet another 
top-ranked wrestler -- Mark Aguirre of Victor Valley -- has been added to the 
Eagles' nest. . . . Brother acts continue to be a feature of the mats this 
season. They include Jeff and Mike Greco at Laguna Hills, Robert and Reuben 
Droughns at Anaheim and Cris and Tim Testerman at Irvine.

 CLAREMONT: The city, which invested nearly $5.4 million in the Orange County 
investment fund that has lost $1.5 billion in value, is considering the impact 
of Orange County's decision to file for federal bankruptcy protection. City 
Manager Glenn D. Southard said he will attend a meeting today for managers of 
cities with investments in the fund.But he said he expects Claremont will 
recover most of its investment. City Atty. Wynne S. Furth said Claremont is not 
at immediate financial risk from the bankruptcy declaration because the city 
does not use that money for its operating expenses.

 PASADENA: World Cup USA '94 still owes Pasadena more than $200,000 for 
services it provided in staging the soccer games in June and July, according to 
city officials. World Cup is disputing several city bills, but primarily is 
objecting to a $157,000 charge for having Pasadena Police Lt. Roger Kelley 
spend 18 months planning security for the games at the Rose Bowl, said David 
Jacobs, Rose Bowl interim director. City officials say the costs were in the 
security contract signed before the games and they expect to recover the money. 
Officials added they aren't the only ones waiting for payment: the World Cup 
still owes the U.S. Department of Defense $14 million for security.

 WEST COVINA: The City Council voted to issue a series of notices to BKK Corp. 
warning that its landfill facility is in violation of its permit. A review of 
the landfill's unclassified use permit found about two dozen violations, 
including an outdated master development plan, overly steep slope construction 
and weed problems.

CITY HALL NEWS: MONTEREY PARK; CITY OKS PAY HIKE IN BID TO DETER FIREFIGHTERS 
FROM LEAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to dissuade firefighters from fleeing its Fire Department for 
higher-paying jurisdictions, the Monterey Park City Council has moved the city 
off the bottom of county fire pay rankings by approving a 7% increase over two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay raise was approved last week after leaders of the Monterey Park 
Firefighters Assn. pointed out that the city's firefighters had the lowest 
salaries and benefits among the county's 34 fire departments. The firefighters' 
group accused city management of fostering a transient fire department with 
high turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Fred Balderrama said he hopes the pay raise will reduce the number 
of employees looking to leave the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd learn the ropes here and then, basically, we didn't pay enough to keep 
them here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, a dozen of the department's 52 employees have left; 
another two captains, five engineers and 16 firefighters have applied to other 
departments and are on waiting lists, said Chris Donovan, president of the 
firefighters group. 
</P>
<P>
 One firefighter said, "Those around the department like to joke (that) the 
only person with a shorter tenure than an NFL coach is a Monterey Park 
firefighter." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract signed last week is the first revision in five years and provides 
a 4% increase this year -- retroactive to July -- and 3% next year, plus a 
$1,000 signing bonus for each firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, a Monterey Park firefighter earned an average of $3,830 a month in 
salary and benefits, compared with $4,777 in Arcadia, which has a similar-sized 
department, according to a recent city-by-city study. Under the new Monterey 
Park contract, salaries will immediately go to an average of about $4,000 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're no longer the lowest-paid, and I hope this will persuade more 
firefighters to stick with the department," Donovan said. According to a recent 
survey, if the pay and benefits of other departments do not change, Lynwood 
would be in the bottom spot. Monterey Park would still be in the bottom five. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members were reluctant to approve the contract. Councilman 
Francisco Alonso said he believes the association has exaggerated the rate of 
turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a high turnover among probationary recruits . . . but I understand 
only around 10% overall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonso said he would like to keep firefighters from playing one city against 
another to raise their pay. "I am surprised the cities don't form a monopoly, 
and all pay the same, to stop this."

SAN MARINO GROUP GEARS UP FOR ACTION OVER BUSY AVENUE; TRAFFIC: A LEADER OF THE 
LOS ROBLES GROUP THREATENS PROTESTS OR RECALLS OVER ALLEGED CITY INACTION. A 
COUNCILMAN SAYS PROPOSED CHANGES WOULD DUMP CARS ON ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD.

<P>
 During the seven years that Terry and Sharon Hotchkin have lived on a corner 
lot at Los Robles Avenue and Monterey Park Road, four cars have crashed into 
their yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year they have witnessed a serious accident, and one time a traffic 
signal ended up on their front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hotchkins and dozens of other San Marino residents along the busy artery 
linking the Foothill (210) Freeway and Huntington Drive complain that City Hall 
has failed to curb the daily onslaught of 20,000 speeding cars, buses and big 
rigs that drive the avenue paralleling part of the Long Beach (710) Freeway 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
 They and other residents of the wide north-south avenue struggle daily with 
extra trash, car horns, MTA buses and the difficulty of getting in and out of 
their driveways. Three out of every four vehicles on the road are commuters 
driving through the wealthy enclave, according to a recent city traffic study. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a safety issue," Terry Hotchkin said. "We're tired of being a 
sacrificial lamb. Be it protests or recalls, the residents here will actively 
consider these measures to get the City Council to do something about the 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Robles residents calling themselves SMART (San Marinans Anxious to Reduce 
Traffic on Los Robles) have demanded since September that the city take 
immediate action. They have suggested major road changes such as extra traffic 
signals, narrowing the street and blocking some turn lanes to reduce the 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the City Council on Oct. 12 chose another, less busy road for 
alterations, then in November authorized some inexpensive changes to Los Robles 
Avenue to slow traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders acknowledge the residents' anger, but say they must look at the 
citywide picture and what impact removing traffic from Los Robles would have on 
surrounding streets. To do that, officials said, further action will likely 
follow an analysis of a citywide traffic master plan by the city's Traffic 
Study Task Force, expected to be completed in three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sympathetic to their problems, but we've got to look at the 
consequences of moving traffic to another residential street," Councilman 
Eugene H. Dryden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must consider how we can solve the problem in the best overall way and 
that's why the traffic task force is looking at the whole city." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryden said the changes called for by SMART would force about 1,500 vehicles 
onto Garfield Avenue, making life worse for the residents there. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, city officials said SMART's $480,000 worth of suggestions would 
bring about only a small cut in traffic volume and that some changes to reduce 
danger from vehicles are already being made. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council authorized the city to paint parking lanes and edge strips to 
reduce the width of the road and that will reduce speeds," said Debbie Bell, 
assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic signals at the intersection of Wilson Avenue and Los Robles also will 
be upgraded ahead of schedule. "They are getting something right now and there 
is light at the end of tunnel," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 SMART's leaders remain unconvinced. "Striping and parking isn't really going 
to do anything," said Alan Shenoi, a SMART leader. "We literally have a de 
facto 710 Freeway here. We can't visit our neighbors . . . friendships have 
been formed by people who only live on one side of the street. It's sort of 
like a river." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Kuhlman, another leader of the residents' group that now has 210 members, 
said the problem has worsened in recent years as the economy has improved and 
Old Pasadena has developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlman said traffic has increased 10% in the last two years and now one in 
eight San Marino accidents happen on the single avenue that accounts for less 
than one of the 70 miles of road in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials dispute Kuhlman's numbers, saying he counts accidents at 
the Huntington Drive intersection, which is past the houses. According to the 
city, traffic increased 15% over the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents' traffic plan includes installing 18 landscaped mid-block 
chokers and islands to reduce road width, painting median strips, creating new 
median left-turn lanes, rerouting buses, additional traffic signals and 
eliminating the turns from Huntington Drive. The plan would require the 
cooperation of Pasadena to the north, which is already trying to reduce the use 
of its section of Los Robles with more traffic signals and narrower lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 SMART leaders say they hope to extend their coalition into Pasadena and 
Alhambra. "We're all victims of traffic," said Kuhlman, who noted that Alhambra 
for years has complained about the throng of drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Los Robles residents have kind words for Pasadena and Alhambra, they 
have none for South Pasadena, their neighbor to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no signs. It's not made inviting. Left turns (from Huntington 
Drive) have been blocked, stops have been placed instead of lights, turns have 
been blocked unilaterally," Shenoi said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena City Manager Kenneth C. Farfsing denied that his city has taken 
steps to increase traffic on Los Robles, which he said has been a major artery 
for decades.

PRINCIPAL CALLS MEETING TO FIGHT RACIAL TENSION; ALHAMBRA: BALDWIN MIDDLE 
SCHOOL EDUCATOR IS ECSTATIC ABOUT THE HIGH PARENT TURNOUT. ANOTHER COMMUNITY 
GATHERING IS PLANNED. 
</P>

<P>
 It was bad enough to have occasional racial spats erupting between 11- and 
12-year-old Asian American and Latino youths at Baldwin Middle School in 
Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Asian American teen-agers from the surrounding high schools started 
coming onto her campus this fall to beat up anyone who looked Latino, Principal 
Barbara Wong decided she had seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra police were called and the teen-agers were threatened with arrests, 
although none were made. Nonetheless, Wong wondered how long it would be before 
someone drew a gun. Before one of her students showed up dead on the evening 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal quickly organized a community meeting to discuss racial 
tensions. She dragooned police officers, probation officers, high school deans, 
community leaders and a 15-year-old former gang member to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said she would have been pleased to get about 25 parents. Instead, 80 
thronged the cafeteria for a 6 p.m. meeting that was still going when the 
janitor arrived to clean up at 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came because we're worried about our kids, they're good kids and we want 
to make sure they don't get into any trouble," said John Godinez, whose 
children attend Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an effort to prevent a serious incident from happening," Wong said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 She called the parental turnout "awesome," noting that most of the families at 
her working-class school had to make sacrifices to attend the evening meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still had people talking at the flagpole at 11 p.m. It blew me away," Wong 
said. "Over the years, the demographics in this community have changed and that 
change is always threatening," she added. "But if we can get to know each other 
we can break down those barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of public demand, a second meeting, which will include students, has 
been scheduled for Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong is making a preemptive strike to confront the racial tension that has 
bubbled below the surface in the west San Gabriel Valley for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos, many of whom have lived in the area for generations, see Asian 
immigrants moving in, outnumbering them and in many cases, doing better 
financially. Meanwhile, some Asian Americans have adopted negative stereotypes 
of Latinos. Children of both ethnic groups bring their parents' racism to class 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes largely from family and the message in our community that nobody's 
getting enough of the goodies," says Elizabeth Sesztak, Baldwin School's 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence has already erupted in the high schools. In 1992, 24 Asian American 
and Latino students were expelled after two days of racially divided fistfights 
at Mark Keppel High School. In 1991, a group of Latino students beat up two 
Chinese American brothers at San Gabriel High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alhambra school district is 49% Asian American and 39% Latino, with the 
rest divided among various other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The hints of gang activity at the middle school also have teachers worried, 
especially because they know that youths are most vulnerable to gang 
recruitment from the age of 11 to 14. By the time they hit high school, 
teen-agers have either embraced gang life or have steered clear of it, gang 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kao, dean at Alhambra High School, says he's not surprised that the 
action is moving to the middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you're getting harassed, or there's a group that's bullying you at the 
middle school, and the high school kids say, 'Hey, you need a little 
protection, we'll handle those guys for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The danger, Kao says, is that the high school gangbangers turn around and tell 
the middle school students, "Now you owe us." And slowly the youngsters get 
sucked into gang life. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems at Baldwin surfaced in September, when some youngsters scrawled the 
words Asian pride over the bathroom walls. That was soon crossed out and 
replaced with Mexican power.  
</P>
<P>
 School officials estimate that up to 15% of the 400 students in the middle 
school are involved in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Sesztak's charges, a young Asian American boy, says he is afraid he 
will have to join a gang for protection once he is in high school. His older 
sister did just that because Latino youngsters were always harassing her, the 
boy told Sesztak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes down racial lines; the Asian kids are after the Latino kids and vice 
versa and they get fed up with getting bullied so they have their older friends 
come over to retaliate," Sesztak says. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat the gang encroachment, Baldwin prohibits students from wearing hats 
or clothing with sports team insignia. But many students still wear extremely 
baggy pants to school, a popular clothing style that can also indicate gang 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 So Wong keeps several sets of her husband's clothing in the office and isn't 
shy about ordering youths to slip out of their baggy clothes and into her 
husband's gear. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, which was translated simultaneously into Mandarin, Spanish and 
Tagalog, parents ate lasagna, then listened as school officials apprised them 
of troubles at the campus. Later, they swapped parenting tips. One mother said 
she took a pair of scissors to her son's oversize pants. Another said that she 
goes through her children's wardrobes, pulling out any clothes that bag or hang 
too low. A third said she spends time getting to know her children's friends to 
make sure they aren't gangbangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they came from Mexico or Korea, India or Taiwan, the parents listened 
intently and raised their hands to ask questions about gangs and racial strife. 
Many said they were unaware of the fights on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 One Mexican American father urged the school to develop children's spiritual 
side, because that was what got him out of gangs. A Taiwanese American father 
explained how he corrected his children when they said bad things about other 
ethnic groups. All said parents need to spend more time with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are also taking steps. Last year, Baldwin's teachers went 
through multicultural training offered by Los Angeles County. The school asked 
experts from the Asian Youth Project, a nonprofit group that works with 
troubled youngsters, to come to Baldwin and conduct conflict resolution classes 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sesztak works on a weekly basis with seventh- and eighth-graders who come 
to her during their advisory period to discuss issues such as gang life, home 
life, drugs and sex.

TOPICS / ART; MURAL TO HONOR A LONG-AGO HERO; PLANNED ARTWORK AT SAN DIMAS 
CIVIC CENTER WILL DEPICT LEGENDARY NATIVE AMERICAN, JUANA MARIA. SHE LIVED 
ALONE ON AN ISLAND FOR 18 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A depiction of the Native American tribe that once inhabited the area that is 
now San Dimas will soon grace its Civic Center in a mural commissioned by the 
San Dimas Festival of Western Arts.  
</P>
<P>
 The mural in sculptural relief will depict the life of Juana Maria, the lone 
woman of St. Nicolas Island. The legendary Tongva woman survived 18 years of 
solitude after she was abandoned on the island, and inspired the children's 
novel "Island of the Blue Dolphins." 
</P>
<P>
 To members of the Tongva tribe, the mural project is a long-overdue tribute to 
their culture, which flourished in the Los Angeles Basin and Channel Islands 
for 7,000 years before the arrival of Europeans. The Spanish missionaries 
called the tribe the Gabrielinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an acknowledgment of our people," said Cindi Alvitre, director of the 
Ti'at Society, a local Native American group named for the traditional Tongva 
canoe. "It's a coming out of our history." 
</P>
<P>
 The mural will be 45 feet long by 7 feet high, and will depict scenes from 
Juana Maria's story and vignettes of everyday Tongva life, said Ken Sheffer, 
director of the festival's public arts committee. The committee will select an 
artist through a national competition and is seeking submissions for the 
$75,000 project. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhibit of Tongva culture and artifacts will accompany the mural at San 
Dimas City Hall, including a 27-foot redwood-plank canoe built by the Ti'at 
Society and items gathered at archeological digs in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tongva people lived in more than 100 villages scattered from the Channel 
Islands to Riverside, including one in the San Dimas-La Verne area, Alvitre 
said. They developed a regional trade system and an elaborate maritime culture. 
After hostilities with Russian traders decimated the population of St. Nicolas 
Island in the 1830s, missionaries from the San Gabriel Mission sailed over to 
relocate the remaining two dozen tribe members, Alvitre said. But one woman, 
known now as Juana Maria, leaped off the boat to search for her child, who had 
been left behind. Stormy weather forced the ship to leave without them; the 
child is believed to have died a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumed dead, Juana Maria remained alone on the island for 18 years. 
Fishermen sailing near the island eventually caught glimpses of her and 
realized she was still alive. She was rescued in 1853 and taken to Santa 
Barbara, where she died less than two months later, Alvitre said.  
</P>
<P>
 The story formed the basis for Scott O'Dell's 1960 novel, "Island of the Blue 
Dolphins," and Juana Maria became a heroic figure to her tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "She maintained her pride, her generosity and her integrity," Alvitre said. 
"She just reflects so much of the tragedy and the pride and the values of our 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 When the public arts committee consulted with Tongva tribal members to ask 
what they would like to see depicted in the mural, Sheffer said, Juana Maria 
was the almost unanimous choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the Tongva, she symbolizes the kind of courage they need in themselves, in 
their struggle to keep their culture alive," he said.

TOPICS / BUSINESS; FUNERAL HOME FILLS NEED BY CATERING TO ASIANS

 Kneeling in the parking lot of Universal Chung Wah Funeral Home in Alhambra, 
grieving family members held smoldering sticks of incense and murmured prayers 
for their mother, who had died in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're praying (by the street) for the god to help their mother have peace 
in another world," said Henry Kwong, the funeral home's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Buddhist pantheon, he explained, there are gods for the street, for the 
home, for every facet of life. And those gods must be honored properly, even in 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every funeral home director would know of the custom. Fewer still would 
provide incense, have a Buddhist altar on hand, or rent viewing rooms for weeks 
while family members decide on a lucky day for the funeral. Although other 
mortuaries have begun to incorporate some of these traditions in Asian 
funerals, Kwong said his is the first in the San Gabriel Valley to cater 
exclusively to Asians. After operating another funeral home in Chinatown for 11 
years, Kwong opened Universal Chung Wah in Alhambra in August, responding to 
what he says is a growing demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just expanded because the San Gabriel Valley has such an overwhelming 
Asian population," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinatown site averages one funeral a day, Kwong said, and Universal Chung 
Wah is expected to exceed that, drawing customers from surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The family mourning their mother traveled from Cerritos to find a mortuary 
they were sure would follow tradition. A monk chanted as they prayed. An altar 
was loaded with vegetarian food, candy and fruit, as well as other items the 
mother would need in the afterlife, right down to denture cleaner and cold 
cream. Paper bank notes that read "hell money" were on hand -- mourners burn 
them to help loved ones pay their way through the afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
 It's crucial, Kwong said, to know the difference between a Buddhist service 
like this one and Christian, Taoist or Confucian rites. But there are also 
variations among mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam or Cambodia, and even among 
provinces within a country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy for anyone to open a funeral home," Kwong said. "Especially an 
Asian funeral home."

Forestry program funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration.The grant 
will allow Duarte to plant trees along the city's recreation trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's two phases -- buying the trees and planting them -- will be 
contracted to local nurseries or other businesses. The city will provide some 
matching funds to prepare the trail and install irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree planting is planned to start in January or February, and the city 
will begin working with local schools to develop an urban forestry program to 
be introduced next fall.

NON-LATINO SCHOOLS CHIEF FACES CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA WALKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Patrick Leier even started his job on Nov. 1 as Pomona Unified School 
District's superintendent, the Latino community was concerned about him. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the students in the district are Latino, and some Latinos were 
unhappy that a Latino candidate wasn't among the finalists for the 
superintendent's job. Leier, a former assistant superintendent of business 
services for the district, won out over a field of four finalists -- three 
whites and one African American -- in a race to replace Irv Muskowitz, who quit 
last summer to take a job in the Denver school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabian Nunez, a Latino activist, said he was disappointed with the school 
board's decision and thought the district didn't search hard enough for a 
Latino candidate, but declined to comment on Leier's performance so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to give (Leier) an opportunity to prove himself," Nunez said. 
"But we will be watching closely to see how he deals with Proposition 187, 
bilingual education and other needs of the Latino community." 
</P>
<P>
 Leier said he has worked with people from all ethnic backgrounds and believes 
he can do just as good a job as a Latino. He would not say where he stands on 
Proposition 187, except that it's an unfortunate situation for schools to be 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which was passed in November's election, denies illegal 
immigrants access to public education and health services, but has yet to be 
enforced pending court hearings on its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 While Leier said he thinks Proposition 187 will not solve the state's economic 
problems, he also said the school district will follow the law if it is 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Castillo, a bilingual teacher at Vejar Elementary, said she was 
dissatisfied with the choice of superintendent, but hopes Leier will work with 
the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past superintendents showed no interest in our concerns," Castillo said. 
"We just want someone to listen to us, to make sure that schools are held 
accountable for maintaining bilingual education programs."  
</P>
<P>
 Leier, a Pomona resident since 1955, immigrated here from Canada and said his 
biggest challenge will be to find more funding for a district that continues to 
grow in size and not funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Leier said he plans to continue with bilingual education and to assemble a 
staff sensitive to the cultural needs of Latinos.

SOUTH PASADENA: FOOTING THE LAWSUIT BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Oct. 19 South Pasadena City Council meeting, the mayor announced that 
the city would indemnify the ex-mayor Evelyn Fierro and two city commissioners 
for punitive damages awarded against them in the civil rights case initiated by 
former Mayor Lee Prentiss. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-0 vote to absorb damages in the amount of $7,500 stated that "the acts 
were committed in good faith, without actual malice. . . ." The four council 
members witnessed, at best, an insignificant amount of testimony during the 
trial, which consumed several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, on the other hand, heard every word of testimony during the 
courtroom encounter. The 11-1 vote to award punitive damages for malice was 
based on evidence presented, not on political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's decision included their convoluted rationale that "an award 
on personal liability will tend to discourage qualified citizens from seeking 
to participate in the political process by serving on the council and city 
commissions." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, I feel any award on personal liability for public officials who 
maliciously attempt to violate a person's civil rights should be paid by the 
officials themselves. This would send a clear message to future public servants 
who might wish to become masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, at the same City Council meeting, our city spenders unanimously 
agreed to shell out $8,000 to purchase a secondhand car for use by the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there misplaced values involved here? Should the City Council share with 
the community how they arrived at their conclusions to indemnify the officials 
(which were developed in secret session)? Does anybody care?

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; TRYING FOR A SPORTING CHANCE; TO BEAT THE 
HIGH COST OF COLLEGE, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE AN ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW and DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Estrada is standing on the sidelines at the Bishop Amat-Fontana High 
School football game, watching intently as Bishop Amat star Daylon McCutcheon 
intercepts a pass and runs 70 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "His All-American status is holding up pretty well," Estrada mutters into the 
cold night air, speaking about the young running and defensive back. "He 
definitely showed his running ability with that play." 
</P>
<P>
 He's holding a clipboard and making notations on a form after every play, but 
Estrada actually carries much more than that in his hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Estrada is holding the dreams and futures of young men. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada is a professional high school football scout. Every year, he watches 
40 to 50 high school football games in the San Gabriel Valley and throughout 
Los Angeles on behalf of a firm called Para-Dies Scouting, assessing the 
players' abilities, attitudes and potential. 
</P>
<P>
 His reports and those from other Southern California scouts are assembled and 
sold to colleges and universities for $1,500 to $2,000 a copy, giving them an 
overview of what's available in the Southern California high school football 
market.  
</P>
<P>
 For anxious players waiting for those college football coaches to call, a 
thumbs up or a thumbs down from Estrada could be a deciding factor. Each 
notation he makes on that clipboard can help advance -- or demolish -- a high 
school boy's dreams of getting a "ride" -- that is, a full college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's big business, this scholarship quest, in all sports -- for girls as well 
as boys. Full or partial scholarships are available in about 24 sports, and 
since implementation in the 1970s of Title IX, which seeks to put women's 
sports on even spending with men's, the growth of women's athletic scholarships 
has been explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the last year for which figures were available, the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. reported that about 90,000 college athletes were 
receiving about $468 million in full and partial scholarships -- almost a third 
of them to women -- from 540 NCAA Division I and II colleges and universities.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the numbers are large, the scholarship pie actually is small, given 
the huge demand for a slice of it. No one knows how many high school students 
and their parents dream of athletic rides. But insiders estimate that only 10% 
qualify for athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the San Gabriel Valley has a history of producing great athletes. Jack 
Clark went from the diamond at Azusa High to become a Major League Baseball All 
Star. Kermit Johnson and James McAlister, known as "The Blair Pair" because 
they went to Blair High in Pasadena, went on to play at UCLA and in the NFL. 
Pat Haden, quarterback for the Rams and USC, graduated from Bishop Amat in La 
Puente. Former Laker star Michael Cooper played at Pasadena High School, and 
one of the NBA stars of the 1990s, Stacey Augmon, came out of Muir High in 
Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 If it can happen to them, some parents think, maybe it can happen to their 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Many adults go to great lengths to help their children get an athletic 
scholarship, which eases the tuition burden and could be a ticket to the pros.  
</P>
<P>
 Some San Gabriel Valley parents drive miles to get their kid in the best, most 
high-profile athletic program for his or her sport. Others drive cross-country 
to "showcase tournaments" where college coaches and recruiters can see them in 
action. Still others pay hundreds of dollars to companies that circulate 
athletic resumes among college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some, including Bishop Amat High School basketball coach Alex Acosta, wonder 
if things have gone too far.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's out of control," Acosta says. "A lot of these kids start participating 
in a sport because they think they have a chance to receive a scholarship. It 
used to be you played as an extracurricular activity. Now for every team 
there's four kids who are here to get a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta cites a 14-year-old girl he coaches who just made the junior varsity 
basketball team. "She's never played a game in her life, and she came up to me 
and said, 'Do you think I'm going to be good enough to get a scholarship?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Wallenbrock of Arcadia, who scouts for the Cleveland Indians, blames it 
on what he calls "the Texas cheerleader moms." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more competitive than it was, and we sign more kids out of high 
school," Wallenbrock says. "But one of the biggest problems you have to deal 
with is parents who are pretty unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in high school sports has a story about pushy parents 
screaming at their kids for supposedly blowing a scholarship by missing a layup 
or muffing a grounder. And yet, with the average cost of a private four-year 
college hovering around $14,000 (for tuition, room and board) a year, who can 
blame a parent for thinking it would be nice if Junior or Sissy could get all 
or even a portion of that tuition picked up by the school's athletic 
department? 
</P>
<P>
 So the question becomes, how do you help the kid do it? How do you increase 
the chances that your young athlete will get financial aid? Based on interviews 
with coaches, student athletes, scouts, recruiters and parents, here are some 
suggestions: Make Sure the Kid Can Play 
</P>
<P>
 That may sound obvious, but the ability to play a sport well -- very well -- 
is a factor some parents overlook. Simply put, they think their young athlete 
is better than he or she really is.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of wishful thinking going on out there," says football scout 
Estrada. "But you have to be realistic. Parents . . . ask me about their kids. 
I can't lie to them. . . . I tell them the truth. Most of the time they're nice 
about it, but sometimes they don't want to believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Brownfield, football coach at Muir High School in Pasadena for many years, 
also cautions parents about the "big fish/small pond" syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big difference between being a great player at Muir and just being 
a player at USC," Brownfield says. 
</P>
<P>
 Very few kids are standouts, the so-called blue chippers. For them, it's not a 
question of whether they're good enough to get an athletic scholarship, but 
rather which school they will grace with their presence.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, track athlete Heather Sumptner of Muir High, who is 
ranked third nationally for high school students in the 100-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
 Under NCAA rules, recruiters aren't permitted to contact high school players 
until after their junior year. But since her first day of eligibility, the 
soft-spoken 17-year-old senior has received hundreds of calls and letters from 
recruiters, representing all the top college women's track programs in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumptner, who trains on weights and distance running in the off-season, has 
narrowed the list to a handful, mainly in the Sunbelt. Across the country, 
college track coaches are anxiously awaiting her decision, hoping she will 
choose them.  
</P>
<P>
 "I get about 15 calls a week, and sometimes one will call and another will be 
on the line, and they'll say, 'Oh, is that another recruiter? Tell him you're 
going to my school,' " Heather says. 
</P>
<P>
 The young athlete, who runs a three-mile stretch of Lake Avenue with her 
father three times a week, says things are getting more intense as the year 
progresses. Some college coaches even get their star athletes to write to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get letters that say, 'We've been watching you since ninth grade . . .' 
but I don't let it stress me out," Heather says. 
</P>
<P>
 George Sumptner spotted his daughter's potential when she was an 11-year-old 
soccer player and has nurtured it ever since with daily coaching and 
father-daughter workouts. Aware of the fragility of teen talent, however, 
Sumptner also watched his daughter closely to make sure she didn't burn out by 
running too much, competing in too many meets or letting the pressure get to 
her. At the same time, her talent has been a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 "College is so expensive, and with (the high cost of) tuition, it wouldn't 
have been easy," says George Sumptner, whose son won an academic scholarship to 
Hampton University in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many students have undeniable athletic abilities, they must jump 
through another hoop before taking those abilities to college. Which brings us 
to an equally important requirement for getting an athletic scholarship: Make 
Sure the Kid has Good Grades 
</P>
<P>
 Until the early 1980s, about the only academic requirement for playing college 
ball was maintaining a 1.6 grade-point average in college courses -- not a 
skull-busting requirement. In 1983, however, the NCAA started requiring high 
school graduates to meet minimum grade-point and SAT standards to be eligible 
for scholarships. There is now a sliding scale: If you have a 2.0 GPA, you need 
a 900 combined SAT score; if your GPA is 2.5, you need a 700 SAT. And the GPA 
must be in "core courses" of math, English, the sciences.  
</P>
<P>
 The rules are strict. Poor grades mean no scholarship and no play. End of 
story, end of dreams.  
</P>
<P>
 Says football scout Estrada: "L.A. probably has the best athletes overall in 
Southern California, but a lot of times nobody's pushing those kids to study 
and go to school. So you get a kid with maybe a high C average, but then you 
look at his SAT, and sorry, it's 600 -- and you get 200 just for writing your 
name. So those kids can't get scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Gabriel Valley, the schools are generally better, the grades are 
better and the SATs are higher, coaches say. For a kid who's good but not great 
as a player, grades can be the most important factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids, in fact, flip the equation, making athletics an adjunct to getting 
an academic scholarship. La Canada High School's outstanding basketball player 
this year, Charlie Petit, is an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "Extra-curricular activities like sports is one of the main things (colleges) 
look for," says Petit, an 18-year-old who stands 6 foot 1, has a 3.9 GPA and 
wants to study premed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's been approached by several colleges that provide athletic 
scholarships, Petit wants to attend an Ivy League school, preferably Harvard or 
Yale, which do not award them. But he knows that being a sports standout could 
tip the admissions scales in his favor. Already, he is being courted. 
Admissions officials from the University of Pennsylvania, another Ivy League 
school, recently flew out to meet with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can also take another important step in increasing the chances for a 
scholarship. That is: Make Sure the Kid Plays Where the Decision-Makers Will 
Look 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley features a number of powerhouse schools in certain 
sports: football at Bishop Amat, basketball at Glendora, track at Muir and 
badminton at Mark Keppel in Alhambra (yes, there are scholarships for badminton 
too). Faced with limited travel budgets -- especially in the so-called 
non-revenue sports such as volleyball, which don't pay for themselves through 
game tickets and concessions -- coaches and recruiters gravitate toward the 
best teams, the ones with the stars and blue chippers, bypassing lesser-known 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 High school coaches say games featuring these showcase teams can be meat 
markets, crawling with recruiters, agents and college coaches, as well as 
nervous kids and parents. At the Bishop Amat-Fontana game, Greg Dies, the 
founder and owner of Para-Dies Scouting, showed up with Estrada to film the 
game and take notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (Bishop Amat) is the No. 1 team in the nation. We like to have as many 
guys here as we can, especially since colleges can't come out and see all the 
games all year long," Dies says. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Estrada: "You have to look at their level of intensity, how they're 
playing, whether they're hustling, how they're doing mentally as they come off 
the field. Colleges want a kid with a good attitude, not a kid that's . . . 
making excuses if something goes wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 But what if you don't happen to live in the Pasadena school district, or 
whatever district is tops in your child's sport? With open enrollment in most 
school districts, that doesn't matter too much anymore, provided you are 
willing to drive your child across the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Bishop Amat, a parochial school, crossing district lines has 
always been a possibility. Consider Kory Minor, a 17-year-old All-American 
football player at Bishop Amat who is being recruited by colleges around the 
nation. He lives in La Verne but commutes four cities away to La Puente each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor and his mother say they were drawn by Bishop Amat's extraordinary 
football team, and although the blue-chipper is assured of a full scholarship 
to college, he already is thinking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to play football forever, just as long as you're blessed, so 
academics always comes first for me," says Minor, who wants to study business 
law in college and become a sports agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor's blue-chip teammate McCutcheon, son of former Los Angeles Rams running 
back Lawrence McCutcheon, lives in Rowland Heights but also opted to commute to 
La Puente to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom had heard about the football team, and she thought that coming and 
playing at Bishop and the teams they play against would give me more of a 
challenge," McCutcheon says. 
</P>
<P>
 The gamble has paid off: McCutcheon is virtually assured a full college ride. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if you can't make the sacrifices necessary to ensure your kid is in 
the best sports program? What if you can't afford to fly all over the country 
showing off your kid at showcase tournaments? How can you get recruiters and 
coaches to notice you? The solution may be: Advertise 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you're a true blue-chipper in football or basketball, you need to 
market yourself," says Tracy Jackson, president of College Prospects of 
America, an Ohio-based firm that contracts with student athletes to distribute 
profiles of their athletic and academic statistics to colleges across the 
country. "It's a dating service concept; we introduce athletes to colleges and 
vice versa. If they want to get married, that's up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest and largest company of its type, 9-year-old College Prospects 
operates through about 175 independently owned franchises in 47 states. For 
$650, a student can have a complete resume sent to every college athletic 
program in which they might legitimately be qualified to play. Jackson makes no 
guarantees that they'll get a scholarship, but he says there's a money-back 
guarantee that the athlete will get at least one response from a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone approves of the concept. Mike LeDuc, who coaches the basketball 
team at Glendora High School, says such organizations "are just using kids to 
make money"; many others worry that fly-by-night operations have damaged the 
concept's image. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company literature is thick with testimonials from college and high 
school coaches and parents. And some student athletes say it's the only way to 
get their names out there. 
</P>
<P>
 James Urquidi, a standout baseball player at Arcadia High School, says he 
hoped somebody would notice him, but the offers weren't rolling in. His coach 
at the time, Mike Stubins, recommended he try College Prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't been getting quite as many colleges looking at me, and my coach 
didn't understand why, so we thought it would be a good way for my name to get 
out," Urquidi says. 
</P>
<P>
 Urquidi's family saw the fee as a reasonable investment for big potential 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you get a quarter scholarship, that's still $5,000 or so a year," 
Urquidi says. 
</P>
<P>
 The young athlete has already received several letters of interest from 
colleges, says his mother, Katherine Urquidi. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most important piece of advice on college athletic 
scholarships, according to almost everyone, is not to attach too much 
importance to them. For most kids the odds are long, the payoff often is not 
that great -- especially from a partial scholarship -- and the athletic 
scholarship might not jibe with the kid's educational goals.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tell my kids that getting an education is the most important thing," Bishop 
Amat basketball coach Acosta says. "They're here because we have a good 
football program, but while they're playing and trying to get those 
scholarships, they also have a great opportunity to get a great education."

FASHION: DESIGNER HELPS THE BLIND, DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Designer Karl Kani ("Clothes Make the Man," Dec. 4), has used his success to 
help us at the Foundation for the Junior Blind as a caring and credible mentor 
to sighted inner-city teens in our First Steps Youth Enrichment Program. The 
foundation created First Steps in 1992 as a commitment to Los Angeles, going 
beyond our work with the blind, visually impaired and multi-disabled blind 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Kani hosted our 1994 class in his offices and told them his story and 
observations firsthand, which expanded the teens' worlds and gave greater 
relevance to our ongoing First Steps program of providing jobs, teaching life 
skills and developing the self-esteem needed to define and pursue life goals.

EATERIES: THE VOTE ON THE SMOKING ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Restaurateurs Say Councilman Double-Crossed Them" (Dec. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, was I steamed at how City Councilman Tony Vazquez double-crossed the 
restaurant owners who paid him to vote against a restrictive smoking law. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's my question: Is there a menu or a price list of how much votes 
cost? Does each council member publish his or her own, or are these things 
negotiable, like for congressional representatives? I need to get a zoning law 
changed in a hurry and I was wondering who the cheapest council members are 
because I don't have a lot of money and some comparison shopping guidelines 
would sure help.

 Re: This Sunday's article on the restaurateurs who thought they could buy Tony 
Vazquez only to have him vote his conscience -- they're not the only ones who 
feel they've been double-crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 I campaigned vigorously for Bob Holbrook and his so-called Safe City slate 
because I truly believed he had the interests and safety of the people of Santa 
Monica as his priority. Therefore, I was bitterly disappointed to learn the 
only reason he cast a "yea" vote for the new, tougher smoking ordinance was so 
he could revisit it and ensure its defeat once he and his cronies were sworn 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 I had an occasion to let him know how I felt about this and he freely admitted 
that the "hospitality" industry in Santa Monica had convinced him they would 
lose a ton of money as a result of the ordinance, especially with European 
tourists who smoke like forest fires. The specific example he used was the 
Loews hotel. "They've got thousands of square feet of open space in their 
atrium! Why shouldn't people be allowed to smoke in the lobby?" I pointed out 
to him that the Coliseum, Dodger Stadium and the Rose Bowl have thousands of 
miles of airspace, yet smoking is prohibited in those places. Those examples, 
of course, fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica and its council have a duty to protect their citizens first -- 
everyone else comes second. My advice to the Loews hotel: Set aside rooms for 
smokers like everyone else does but prohibit smoking in the lobby, where the 
vast majority of people who are nonsmokers won't have their health compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 To the restaurateurs, bars and human chimneys: Learn to live with the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 To Bob Holbrook: Vote what you believe so we can believe your vote. As far as 
I'm concerned, you've compromised your integrity this time.

IT WAS A ROUGH YEAR FOR TEAMS, A GREAT ONE FOR PLAYERS; FOOTBALL: DESPITE 
ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING SHOWING IN POSTSEASON PLAY BY WESTSIDE TEAMS, THE AREA

<P>
 The 1994 high school football season was a good one for individuals and a bad 
one for teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Venice won in the first round of the playoffs, although Brentwood, a 
traditional power in eight-man football, advanced to its third consecutive 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a number of outstanding players at the skill positions," Santa 
Monica High Coach Dan Escalera said. "They were pretty exciting players. 
Unfortunately, everyone got booted out of the playoffs early." 
</P>
<P>
 The level of talent is again reflected on The Times' 1994 all-star team. Of 
the 23 players selected, eight are being recruited by Division I colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Six players have been named to the team for the second consecutive year. They 
are Culver City quarterback Damon Williams, Culver City receiver Jasiri Rodell, 
Westchester receiver Tony Griffin, Venice kicker Michael Barry, Santa Monica 
linebacker J'Von Willis and Beverly Hills lineman Andrew Kline. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy quarterback Danny Ragsdale, Culver City defensive back Aki Wilson and 
University running back Marco Pleas, second-team selections in 1993, were named 
to the 1994 first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches, all of whom were asked 
to participate, and a poll of Times sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Players named to the 23-player first team, along with their parents and 
coaches, will be guests of The Times at an awards brunch at 9 a.m. Sunday at 
the Guest Quarters Suite Hotel in Santa Monica. The winners of the Westside 
back, lineman and coach of the year awards will be announced at the brunch. 
</P>

TIMES' TEAM SHOWCASES ABUNDANCE OF TALENT IN AREA; FOOTBALL: THERE'S PLENTY OF 
BRAWN BEYOND BISHOP AMAT, THE NATION'S NO. 1 TEAM.

<P>
 High school football in the San Gabriel Valley drew national attention this 
season because Bishop Amat spent every week atop at least one national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bishop Amat, which will attempt to conclude an unbeaten season when it 
plays Mater Dei for the Southern Section Division I title on Saturday, wasn't 
the only school to enjoy tremendous success. Outstanding players from schools 
throughout the area provided fans with many memorable moments and 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' 1994 San Gabriel Valley all-star football team includes 23 of those 
players. Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches, all of whom 
were asked to participate, and a poll of Times sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Players named to the 23-player first team, along with their parents and 
coaches, will be guests of The Times at an awards brunch at 9 a.m. Sunday at 
the Holiday Inn in Pasadena. Winners of the San Gabriel Valley back, lineman 
and coach of the year awards will be announced at the brunch. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Benavidez, Charter Oak -- The 6-foot-2, 180-pound senior wide receiver is 
an outstanding blocker as well as a talented pass-catcher. He helped the 
Chargers to the Division VI semifinals with more than 800 receiving yards and 
an average of 19.4 yards a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Bedell, Arcadia -- The 6-6, 260-pound Bedell was part of an offensive 
line that paved the way for one of the area's most potent rushing attacks. The 
Pacific League's lineman of the year in 1993, Bedell played offensive tackle 
and defensive end. He also was a force on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Haden, Bishop Amat -- Lancer running backs got all of the headlines, but 
Haden, a 6-1, 245-pound senior offensive lineman, provided many of the holes 
that sprung the backs for long gains. He proved equally adept as a run and a 
pass blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Torres, Alhambra -- Torres, a 6-4, 295-pound senior offensive lineman, 
ran interference on 85% of the Moors' rushing plays. Torres' play on offense 
and defense was instrumental in helping Alhambra achieve its best season in 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Rodriguez, South Hills -- Rodriguez, a 6-1, 200-pound senior center, 
anchored a line that protected multitalented quarterback Brett Pierce and 
helped the Huskies to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Fineanganofo, Garey -- At 6-1, 315 pounds, Fineanganofo provided an 
intimidating presence for the Vikings and was a force on offense and defense 
even when he was not involved directly in the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Daylon McCutcheon, Bishop Amat -- Arguably the best player ever for a school 
that has produced some of the area's best, the 5-10, 175-pound senior has 
rushed for a school-record 2,251 yards and is also a premiere defensive back 
and kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McAlister, Pasadena -- A multitalented quarterback, defensive back and 
return specialist, the 6-3, 177-pound senior rushed for more than 970 yards and 
10 touchdowns, passed for more than 900 yards and 16 touchdowns, returned four 
punts for touchdowns and intercepted four passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Graham, Charter Oak -- The 5-10, 195-pound Graham, the only junior on 
the first team, scored 31 touchdowns and electrified the Chargers' offense with 
long scoring runs in almost every game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Shepherd, Arcadia -- The 5-9, 185-pound senior gained 1,432 yards and 
scored 16 touchdowns in the regular season and carried the Apaches to the 
Division II quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Styles, Claremont -- The 6-2, 180-pound senior quarterback passed for 
more than 2,300 yards and led the Wolfpack to one of its best seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Aryn Hart, Alhambra -- Hart, a 6-1, 175-pound senior, did it all for the 
Moors, passing for more than 1,800 yards, rushing for five touchdowns, kicking 
two field goals and intercepting three passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Villigran, Los Altos -- The 6-4, 265-pound senior dominated on the 
defensive line and also was a force on offense. In addition to more than 70 
tackles, he blocked seven passes, had four sacks and forced three fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Waleed Ibrahim, West Covina -- Ibrahim, a 6-2, 225-pound senior defensive 
lineman, picked up where he left off in 1993 when he was an all-league 
selection. Ibrahim was in on 96 tackles and had five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Ili, Bishop Amat -- The 6-foot, 285-pound senior was a two-way player 
for the Lancers and gave opponents fits on both sides of the line. Ili helped 
the Lancers limit opponents to fewer than 150 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kory Minor, Bishop Amat -- The 6-3, 240-pound senior defensive lineman entered 
last week's Division I semifinal with 19 sacks and 31 1/2 in his career. He is 
the anchor of a Lancer defense that has manhandled opponents all year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester Towns, Pasadena -- A force at linebacker and running back for the 
Bulldogs, the 6-3, 230-pound senior is one of the area's best all-around 
athletes. Towns was in on more than 100 tackles and had seven sacks in the 
regular season. He also rushed for more than 900 yards and scored 10 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramogi Huma, Bishop Amat -- He missed 2 1/2 games because of an injury, but 
the 6-2, 205-pound linebacker was otherwise dominating for a unit that forced 
more than 40 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Wells, Ganesha -- A three-year starter and two-time all-league player, 
the 6-2, 225-pound senior's leadership and aggressive play at linebacker was 
instrumental in helping Ganesha reach the playoff quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Shaw, Rowland -- The 5-11, 180-pound senior defensive back, a key two-way 
player for the league champion Raiders, was as good at stopping the run as he 
was at making them as a running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Guanko, Bishop Amat -- The 6-1, 190-pound senior played both ways for 
the Lancers but excelled as a defensive back for a unit that has given up only 
103 points in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Pierce, South Hills -- Pierce, a 5-10, 170-pound senior, used all of his 
skills to lead South Hills to one of its best seasons. He passed for more than 
1,600 yards and 18 touchdowns, served as the team's kicker and also played 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Strycula, Charter Oak -- Another multitalented player, Strycula, a 6-1, 
195-pound senior, was a force on defense and offense. He passed for more than 
1,300 yards, rushed for more than 500 and teamed with his brother, Chris, to 
give the Chargers one of the best defensive backfields in the area.

 SPEAK YOUR MIND: You have strong feelings about the hot illegal immigration 
issue -- Proposition 187? If you want someone to shout at, the county's Human 
Relations Commission members say come lay it on them. But be aware that you 
have three minutes maximum to unload. . . . They're having a public hearing 
tonight at 7 at their Santa Ana office, 1300 S. Grand Ave., Building B. Its 
purpose, says Chairman Kenneth Inouye: To determine "where do we go from here?" 
</P>
<P>
 VANCE ADVICE: Beware of your neighbor, says Smart Money magazine -- if your 
neighbor happens to be on the homeowners association board. This month's issue 
discusses those who have taken on homeowners association decisions and paid 
dearly after losing. . . . It quotes Willowdean Vance of Lake Forest, whose 
group seeks legislation to control such boards. Board members, she told the 
magazine, "are just on a power trip." 
</P>
<P>
 GAVEL TO GAVEL: At his swearing-in this week as Huntington Beach's new mayor, 
Victor Leipzig announced he was doing away with the traditional mayor's gavel, 
preferring "words and thoughts" for running City Council meetings. . . . And 
congratulatory presents he received? Outgoing Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson 
gave him a gavel, inscribed with his name. And his parents, George and 
Marguerite of Lake Wildwood, presented him with. . . a gavel. His mother, a 
former mayor of Redwood City, told him: "You've made a terrible mistake, 
Victor. You need to use the damn thing!" 
</P>
<P>
 COSMETIC CHRISTMAS: If you've got big bucks, what Christmas present do you buy 
a spouse who has everything? Local plastic surgeons report a December jump in 
business, especially breasts and noses. . . . Michael Niccole, director of 
CosmetiCare Plastic Surgery in Costa Mesa, explains it: "Most holiday gifts are 
short-lived; one's boosted self-image lasts a lifetime." . . . But he sternly 
warns: Be certain the surgeon is board-certified and the procedure is performed 
at an accredited facility. 
</P>
<P>
 TONIGHT: The Pacific Symphony at 8, Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 WEATHER: Mostly sunny. Highs in the upper 60s, lows in the 40s. (B10)

 ON THE EDGE: The CSUN football program, which almost got sacked in 1992, is on 
the ropes again. Lower enrollment, a poor economy and quake damage have left 
the athletic department with a projected deficit of $700,000 for 1995-96. . . . 
Getting rid of football would be a quick fix, but some worry it could hinder 
overall fund raising.A special report on the program begins on C1. 
</P>
<P>
 NO EXPOSURE: CSUN administrators are trying to get to the bottom of why 
Playboy magazine was once again taken off campus bookstore shelves. In 1984, 
feminists persuaded the bookstore's governing board to remove sexually explicit 
magazines (B6). . . . Playboy, however, is still available in the campus 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD TIMING: Birmingham High football coach Alan (Chick) Epstein, above, knows 
how to make an exit. He'll coach his last game Friday, and it's some game -- 
Birmingham vs. Bell for the City Section 3-A Division championship (C8). . . . 
Epstein, the golf coach for 28 years, will spend much of his retirement on the 
links. He occasionally plays with former student, ex-U.S. amateur champ Mitch 
Vogues. 
</P>
<P>
 BURBANK BASH: Want to lunch with the Fonz? You may get a chance if you attend 
a fund-raiser tonight in Burbank. Proceeds from items to be auctioned go to the 
Burbank Police Officers Assn.'s Catastrophic Injury and Illness Fund. . . . 
Besides lunch with Henry Winkler, you could win tickets to "Seinfeld." The 
event is organized by actress Marlee Matlin and her husband, Detective Kevin 
Grandalski. Call (818) 842-1133. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKE FATHER: Sinatra was a big smash in the Valley on Tuesday. No, not that 
Sinatra. Rather, it was his son, Frank Sinatra Jr., who performed at a sold-out 
Moonlight Tango Cafe in Sherman Oaks (F1). . . . Junior doesn't mind sounding 
like his dad: "Why shouldn't I be delighted to carry on his tradition?"

MARY SIMPSON, KNOWN FOR VOLUNTEER WORK, DIES; OBITUARY: THE WIFE OF EX-ANAHEIM 
COUNCILMAN BOB D. SIMPSON HAD UNDERGONE BYPASS SURGERY AFTER SUFFERING HEART 
ATTACK. SHE WAS 59. SERVICES WILL BE FRIDAY.

<P>
 Mary Simpson, wife of former Anaheim Councilman Bob D. Simpson, died Monday 
night as a result of heart damage from a heart attack she suffered last week, 
family members said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Simpson, 59, was hospitalized last Thursday for chest pains, underwent 
bypass surgery Saturday and was in stable condition Monday, said her husband, 
who was the last family member to speak with her Monday night by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes after the couple got off the phone, the hospital called 
Simpson to report a change in his wife's condition. She had died by the time he 
arrived at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known her for 50 years, have been married to her for 39 years, and in 
all that time I have never heard a single person say an adverse thing about my 
wife," said Simpson, whose last words to his wife were, "I love you."  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Simpson had a history of arterial problems and had undergone bypass 
surgery 18 years ago, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her tolerance for pain was incredible, and she just kept going," said 
daughter Christy Price. "She was concerned for everybody else but herself." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Simpson, born in Shawnee, Okla., on Nov. 23, 1935, was well known for her 
volunteer work in various Orange County charities. She had served, for 
instance, as first vice president of the Assistance League of Anaheim, a 
national philanthropic organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "She certainly will be tremendously missed by everyone in the Assistance 
League and everyone she has associated with in the community," said Mary Bouas, 
the league's president. "It is a big loss to the community because she had so 
much to give."  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Simpson's pastor described her as one of the kindest, most unfailing 
members of his congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the epitome of consistency, and that was characteristic of her life," 
said Dr. Bryan Crow, pastor of the Garden Church in Anaheim Hills. "If you need 
a real definition of what Christianity is, Mary Simpson was it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband, she is survived by three children, Christy Price 
of Diamond Bar, Bob Simpson Jr. of Tustin and Greg Simpson of Temecula; a 
sister, Jane Horvath of Mission Viejo; a brother, Jim Hammons of Newport Beach, 
and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is planned for Friday at 10 a.m. at the Anaheim United 
Methodist Church, 1000 S. State College Blvd.

 Serving Up Style: The baby-faced male counter clerk/waiter is a colorful punk 
peacock: his dyed, platinum-blond hair tucked under a multicolored, puffy hat; 
a vivid blue, cropped-sleeve sweater over a white, long underwear shirt; 
ultra-baggy, patched jeans with a rear horizontal zipper, and a dangling white 
rosary-beaded cross necklace. The owner is Katharine Hepburn meets Pippi 
Longstocking: large blue eyes; bright-red lipstick; blue and red baseball cap 
over platinum-blond hair worn in two teensy braids; a blue and white 
pin-striped shirt; pleated khaki pants and white Keds. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer Themes: Ubiquitous baggy khaki pants. Faded pin-striped shirts for 
the I-don't-care-I'm-an-engineering-student look. Pale, makeup-less faces and 
bags under eyes for the 
I-spend-a-lot-of-time-in-the-library-stacks-writing-my-sociology-thesis look. 
Faded denims mixed with washed-many-times whites for a Westsider look. Leather 
sandals with pilly, olive-green socks for the angry male 
I'm-still-a-graduate-student-after-all-these-years look. New Age-y 
"empowerment" silky pinks and purples and longish fingernails for the 
I'm-a-masseuse-and/or-devil-worshiper-and-I-also-play-the-guitarlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair Apparent: Long, healthy, just-washed locks for fresh-faced college 
beauties; pale, frizzy, who-cares-it's-just-hair tangles for the 
studying-for-finals sociology students (see the "bags under eyes" description 
above); blond, Ethan Hawke dos for wholesome dorm boys; long, graying ponytails 
for aging New Agers; neat gray ponytails for grandmothers back to school, and 
proud displays of copious body hair for missing-link types. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories: Backpacks; leather shoulder bags for men; silvery necklaces with 
dangling religious or symbolic medallions; Tarot cards; black-framed reading 
glasses for studious grandmothers; algebra equations scrawled on graph paper; 
furrowed brows and Nuart schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Observations: Many slightly older New Age-y philosophers play guru to eager, 
earnestly blinking young couples on dates. The New Agers' rambling, 
lecture-styled conversations cover topics ranging from "giving the body a 
chance to heal" to "the 36 different forms of water."

 When we finally got a look at the long-awaited "Ready to Wear (Pret-a-Porter)" 
Tuesday night we found the fashion less impressive than all the bodies on 
display. And we're not talking about Robert Altman's much-publicized naked 
fashion show. (If you've seen one skinny naked runway model, you've seen them 
all.) Far more fascinating was the sight of Tracey Ullman in a black G-string 
(a little cellulite on the buns, but a nice flat stomach). Sally Kellerman 
baring her surprisingly girlish breasts. And Sophia Loren's age-defyingly taut 
thighs. As Stephen Rea's lecherous fashion photographer character says, "I'm 
sick of all those models and their implants!" Yeah.

 Moss Is Boss: It wasn't the Mossimo store opening in Old Town Pasadena as much 
as an opportunity to trade quips with designer Mossimo Giannulli himself that 
drew hundreds of teen-agers -- as well as "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" star Chad 
Allen, House of Pain's Danny Boy and John Tempesta of White Zombie fame -- over 
the weekend. Apparently Moss sightings are as rare as the West Coast designer's 
clothing stores. (This is only the second in as many years.) The line for 
autographs started to form a good hour before his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like an idiot . . . but to achieve a certain level as a company, this 
kind of thing sort of has to happen," said Mossimo, three hours later crouched 
on the floor after signing his name for the 500th time. The store itself is a 
three-level airy maze of cubicles rising from weathered barn-wood floors. The 
idea, said the designer, was to create "an aggressive, soulful, whimsical, fun 
and contemporary" clothing shop that appears as if it grew from the remnants of 
something else. And indeed it did. The 5,000-square-foot space is housed in the 
One Colorado building, built sometime around the turn of the century and former 
home to a Salvation Army store.

 Bell Bottom Blues: The words museum curator aren't ones we'd normally 
associate with designer Stephen Sprouse, the guy who brought back neon and 
dressed rock stars Axl Rose, Debbie Harry and Mick Jagger. But officials at the 
Cleveland, Ohio, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced this week that Sprouse 
has signed on as creative fashion consultant. He'll be in charge of the 
museum's costume installations and will help create mannequins that depict rock 
'n' roll attitude, gestures and style. Hmm, like retching on stage? Guess we'll 
find out when the museum opens next September.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: DRESSED TO HARASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Disclosure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: In a movie based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, Seattle computer 
company executive Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) launches a sexual harassment 
battle against his boss, Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore, pictured), after she 
comes on strong. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Gloria Gresham, whose credits include "When Harry Met 
Sally," "A Few Good Men," "Diner," "The Natural," "Tin Men," "Footloose" and 
"Avalon." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: A visit to a prominent (but unnamed) Seattle computer company, as 
well as photos from Forbes of employees of Microsoft, the software giant in the 
same region. "Then I closed the magazine and said, 'Let's do our own thing,' " 
Gresham says. 
</P>
<P>
 His Look: How to make just another promotion-hungry guy look lovable? Sanders' 
rumpled khakis, beat-up barn jacket and especially his one pattern mix-up day 
do the trick. His non-traditional work uniform also telegraphs where his 
loyalties lie -- he's a lot closer to the adorable, brainy computer dweebs, who 
can barely button their shirts straight, than to the company's ruthless navy- 
and black-suited power wielders. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Look: You have to laugh a little at Johnson's ladder-climbing efforts. 
Let's just say her tiny drop earrings are modest. There's definitely something 
chic and vaguely Armani-Calvin-Donna-ish about her choice of unfussy suits. But 
otherwise, Johnson's navy and gray ensembles with their tight, 
take-no-prisoners tailoring (though fairly demure just-above-the-knee hemlines) 
and no-hose statement hardly reek politic. As Gresham says, "I don't know if 
what we do helps women in business -- we're making a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "This is not earthshaking news -- dark colors are power colors. You 
see it in men's suiting all the time. The President of the United States 
doesn't give his State of the Union message in a tan suit, does he?" Gresham 
says of her choice of dark suits for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Talk about versatile. For the key harassment scene, Johnson removes 
her suit jacket to reveal not a blouse, but a sexy, happy-hour vest with cut-in 
shoulders. "That was very carefully thought out," Gresham says. "The script 
says she takes off her jacket and there's her blouse, but I thought a blouse 
was too pedestrian." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Johnson's suits and blouses were custom-made. Her earrings are by Ted 
Muehling. BETTY GOODWIN

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: A FILM TRIP BACK TO THE 1950S 
</P>

 The Scene: Monday's screening at the Beverly Connection of "Diner" as part of 
the American Film Institute's Third Decade Council's Favorite Film Series. The 
evening was hosted by Turner Pictures Worldwide. It included the screening, a 
panel discussion by the filmmakers and a magnitude 4.5 earthquake about 30 
minutes into the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars, Daniel Stern, Kevin Bacon, Tim Daly and Paul 
Reiser; director Barry Levinson, and executive producer Mark Johnson. Levinson 
said he made the 1982 film to "de-myth the '50s. There had been 'Grease' and 
'Gidget.' I wanted to depict it more closely to what I remembered." The actors 
mostly recall being confused at the end of the filming. Said Stern: "When it 
was over, I remember saying, 'Is that a movie?"' 
</P>
<P>
 The Organization: The Third Decade Council is a youngish support group for 
AFI. Its name comes from the generations of patrons who have supported the film 
institute over its 26 years. The first decade were AFI's founders. The second 
decade were the affluent donors who maintained it. And the third decade, one 
member joked, "are people who want to be wealthy like the ones in the second 
decade." 
</P>
<P>
 Observed: This is how a film crowd handles quakes. Some walk quickly to the 
lobby, then call home on cell phones and speak amateur Spanish into the phones. 
The rest of the audience stays seated because, as Reiser noted, "Why am I going 
to run outside? Why is it better to be hit by glass than a lighting fixture?" 
</P>
<P>
 Handling Disaster: When the quake hit and dozens of guests streamed toward the 
exits, one of the organizers said, "It reminded me of those monster movies 
where the creature breaks into a theater and the patrons flee. I wanted to 
stand in the back and shout, 'No! Stop! We have food afterward!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Food Afterward: The Daily Grill served a '50s Baltimore-style menu of 
meatloaf, mashed potatoes and chili. This plus an artery-clogging Maryland 
delicacy featured in the film -- French fries with gravy. "It seems to be one 
of those perverse pleasures you usually eat by yourself," said one of the 
servers about the fries.

 It's a big weekend for holiday parades and marching bands, red-suited grand 
marshals and lots of lights and good cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the unique things about coastal city parades is that most of them are 
on the water.Decorated with lights and festive figures, many with music and 
holiday revelers on board, the vessels make their way along the channels, 
passing waterfront restaurants and shops, boardwalks and breakwaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Following are some of the holiday boat parades scheduled this weekend: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fireworks will signal the start of the 32nd annual Christmas Boat Parade in 
Marina Del Rey's Main Channel at 5:30 p.m. Saturday. "Music of the Seven Seas" 
is the theme, and music will be heard from the vessels decorated with holiday 
displays, animated figures and laser light shows. Best viewing from Burton 
Chace Park on Mindanao Way or Fisherman's Village on Fiji Way. Free. (310) 
821-7614. 
</P>
<P>
 * Activities in conjunction with Oxnard's 29th annual Channel Islands Harbor 
Parade of Lights begin with a Toys for Tots Dinghy Race at 9 a.m. Saturday; a 
snow field for kids to play in, 10 a.m.-1 p.m.; sleigh rides and carolers, 11 
a.m.-4 p.m.; arts festival, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. The parade begins at 7 p.m. in the 
harbor. Free. (805) 985-4852. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Huntington Harbor Christmas Boat Parade gets under way at 5:15 p.m. 
Saturday with more than 50 boats from the main channel, across from the pier. 
(714) 840-7542.  
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Harbor Christmas Afloat Parade takes place Saturday and Sunday at 6 
p.m., departing the east basin in the Port of Los Angeles. Good viewing points 
are Banning's Landing in Wilmington, Ports o' Call Village and Cabrillo Marina. 
Free trolley rides in Ports o' Call Village, Saturday through Dec. 17. (800) 
831-7678. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

 Consider these foods for holiday gifts. The cranberry mustard, winter fruit 
salsa and crunchy five-grain granola are all fairly simple and straightforward 
to make.  
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to endow presents with a special holiday presence of their own. For 
the cranberry mustard and the winter fruit salsa, decorate great-looking jars 
with colored ribbons, bows or raffia, pine cones, holly sprigs, even little 
candy canes or ornaments. Package the granola in decorative tins, baskets or 
small baking pans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cranberry mustard is such a good idea, a bright-colored tangy mustard, thick 
enough to serve as a sauce and just right for a spread on a sandwich. Serve it 
in a small dish with hot or cold meats and poultry or as a sandwich spread.  
</P>
<P>
 CRANBERRY MUSTARD 
</P>
<P>
 1 (12-ounce) bag cranberries 
</P>
<P>
 2 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, diced 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons prepared mustard 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 In 3-quart non-reactive pan, combine cranberries, apples, water, sugar and 
allspice. Bring to boil. Simmer, uncovered, until apples are tender, about 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Place in blender or food processor fitted with metal blade. Puree until 
smooth. Add vinegar, mustards and salt. Mix until well combined. Let cool at 
room temperature. Adjust seasonings to taste. Can be kept refrigerated up to 2 
weeks. Serve chilled. Makes about 2 3/4 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Each 1-tablespoon serving contains about:

<P>
 29 calories; 30 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 0 fat; 7 grams carbohydrates; 0 
protein; 0.17 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This versatile winter fruit salsa can be served with meat, game and poultry, 
either as a relish passed at the table or spooned over a serving.  
</P>
<P>
 WINTER FRUIT SALSA 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium orange, seeded and cut into 8 pieces, with zest 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup cranberries 
</P>
<P>
 1 Red Delicious apple, cored and cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups pineapple, cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 tablespoons lime juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, optional 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons diced red onion 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium jalapeno chile, seeded and minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon honey 
</P>
<P>
 In work bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade, finely chop orange 
pieces and cranberries, pulsing on and off and scraping down sides of work 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Place in large mixing bowl and add orange zest, apple, pineapple, lime juice, 
cilantro, red onion, sugar, jalapeno, salt and honey. Stir until well combined. 
Refrigerate overnight before using and up to 1 week. Serve cold or at room 
temperature. Makes 1 quart.  
</P>
<P>
 Each 1/4-cup serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 40 calories; 36 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 0 fat; 12 grams carbohydrates; 0 
protein; 0.36 gram fiber.

 A variety of whole grains gives this low-fat granola taste and crunch. Besides 
making a hearty breakfast when served with milk, this granola is wonderful as a 
topping for fruit, yogurt, ice cream and puddings. The recipe recommends 
specific grain proportions but a total of 4 1/2 cups in any combination will 
also work out well. Just remember to choose good-size grains with texture. The 
dried apples and raisins can also be replaced with other dried fruits.  
</P>
<P>
 CRUNCHY 5-GRAIN GRANOLA 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup honey 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup thawed frozen apple juice concentrate 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 cups thick sliced oat flakes or regular oat flakes 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup kamut flakes or rolled wheat 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup finely snipped dried apples 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup flax seeds 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup oat bran 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
 In 1-quart saucepan combine honey, maple syrup, apple juice concentrate, 
cinnamon and zests. Bring to boil and simmer, uncovered, 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl combine oat flakes, kamut flakes, apples, flax seeds, oat 
bran and raisins. Add honey-maple syrup mixture and toss until well combined. 
Divide mixture between 2 foil-lined jelly roll pans, spreading out evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees until well toasted, about 25 minutes, stirring every 10 
minutes. (Use rubber spatula to avoid tearing foil.) Reverse pans if granola is 
baking unevenly. Cool completely on racks. Can be stored in airtight container 
in cool place up to 3 weeks. Makes about 2 quarts.  
</P>
<P>
 Each 1-cup serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 476 calories; 9 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 103 grams

GIFTS OF TASTE; IN THE KITCHEN; I BAKE YOU A MERRY COOKIE

By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are many good reasons for giving homemade Christmas presents, not the 
least of which is the fact that they're inexpensive.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know about you, but my house isn't the kind of Martha Stewart 
wonderland where we spend endless days spray-painting pine cones gold. When 
times are flush, we are as apt as anyone to send sweaters. With two parents 
working, time is more valuable than money, and even the couple of hours it 
takes to go to the store can be a luxury. These are the times we marvel at the 
world of catalogue shopping, where a simple phone call nets a boxed, wrapped 
present already in the mail on the way to Grandpa -- just give them a credit 
card number. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are not those times. And so we bake. And we can. And we preserve. 
This year, Grandpa and the assorted aunts and uncles, friends and neighbors are 
going to get jars of Meyer lemon marmalade, strawberry preserves, olalliberry 
jelly or plum butter, and, of course, big tins of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While this is more time-consuming than picking up the phone, it is not all 
that difficult. The jars represent a year's worth of putting by, each made in 
its time of abundance. The lemons came from our back yard -- at peak season we 
were going through them by the sinkful. The strawberries I picked whenever I 
saw a particularly nice flat at a good price at the farmers market. The 
olalliberries I gathered one hot early summer morning at a U-Pick in Moorpark 
with my sister and our daughters. The plums were waiting for me when I got back 
from vacation -- when you've got a yard full of fermenting plums, you've got to 
do something quick. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about all of this is that for the entire year we've been 
breakfasting on the Christmas gifts. Call it quality control. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that's left for us to do now is bake cookies. And that's 
something we usually do anyway. Already, there's a tray of my wife's "hello 
dollies" in the fridge and a bag of cut-out sugar cookies in the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, I'll spend a night making these little Italian cookies. There's 
nothing particularly Christmas-y about them, really, except that they can be 
made easily in great quantity and their clean taste and chewy texture always 
seem welcome at a time when simply sweet is the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 They're based on a recipe from Mary Taylor Simeti's wonderful book of Sicilian 
cookery and lore, "Pomp and Sustenance" (Alfred A. Knopf: 1989; $25). There is 
a wide range of Sicilian convent cookies, everything from minni di vergini 
(virgins' breasts) to fedde del cancelliere (chancellors' buttocks). The 
sisters of the Badia Grande at Alcamo, being either more chaste or less 
imaginative, call these bocconetti di mandorla (almond kisses) and stuff them 
with zuccata , a stiff preserve made from baseball-sized zucchini. This is one 
jam I haven't gotten into, so I substitute tart-sweet dried sour cherries 
instead. Feel free to improvise. 
</P>
<P>
 I've adapted the recipe so the whole thing is made in the food processor. 
Grind the almonds and sugar together -- they make a terrific roar at first, but 
then quiet down. Add the egg whites and leave the machine running until the 
dough forms a ball that runs around on top of the blade. This should take about 
a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, should you elect to make these the more traditional way, you can 
finely ground the almonds by hand before mixing them with the sugar and then 
folding in beaten egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forming the cookie kisses is a breeze; the only trick is pushing the dough 
into pyramids. After a couple of kisses, you'll get the knack. Do rinse and dry 
your hands every half-dozen or so cookies -- the residual stickiness that 
builds up will start to hinder the shaping process.

LOW-FAT COOKING: GIFTS OF TASTE; RED BREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The holidays find even noncooks venturing into the kitchen to try their hand 
at baking. A relatively simple recipe for a new baker is this low-fat cranberry 
bread. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut down on the fat found in many holiday breads we used nonfat milk along 
with egg substitute. Before baking, a small amount of butter is brushed over 
the top of the bread for flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before putting the bread together it is best to assemble and measure all 
ingredients. Check the date on the yeast package to be sure it is fresh. The 
temperature of the water for dissolving the yeast is critical; it should be 
between 105 and 115 degrees. If it's too hot, the yeast will be killed and the 
bread will not rise. If it's too cold, the yeast will not dissolve and the 
bread will not rise. Also, for the yeast to be fully effective, be sure to stir 
together the yeast and the water until the granules are completely dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The finished bread dough should be kneaded until smooth and elastic. This will 
take about 10 minutes or less, if you are preparing the bread in an electric 
mixer or food processor. Don't forget to drain the excess liquid off the 
cranberries before kneading them in. 
</P>
<P>
 After rising, the dough may be shaped into a round or braided, if you like. 
Let the shaped bread rise in a warm place until doubled. Depending on the 
temperature of your kitchen, this may take an hour or longer. Brush the bread 
with butter, then bake.  
</P>
<P>
 The loaf is done when it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped. It is 
best to let the bread cool a bit on a rack before slicing, so the texture 
remains light and not gummy. CRANBERRY SWEET BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 envelope yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup nonfat egg substitute (equivalent to 1 egg) 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup cranberries, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons melted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Heat milk and 1/2 cup sugar in saucepan to scalding, then cool to lukewarm. 
Combine yeast and warm water in mixing bowl, stirring until yeast is dissolved. 
Add cooled milk mixture to yeast mixture in mixing bowl. Stir in egg 
substitute, vanilla and salt. Beat in 1 cup of flour. Beat in enough remaining 
flour to make soft dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Knead about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Put dough into greased bowl. 
Let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over chopped cranberries. Let stand while bread 
rises. Drain excess liquid off cranberries. Knead into dough. Shape into round. 
Spray baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray, or grease lightly. Place dough 
round on baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. 
Brush top of bread with butter. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar. 
Bake at 375 degrees 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool to warm. 
Makes 8 servings.

CANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much mystery is made of the canning process. Essentially, it is very simple. 
Make sure you have clean jars and a new set of lids and liners (jars can be 
re-used as long as they're sterile; lids and liners cannot). 
</P>
<P>
 Fill jars almost to top with preserves (the gap, called headroom, is to allow 
the preserves to expand during heating). Attach lids. Submerge jars in boiling 
water for specified period of time, usually 10 to 15 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Carefully remove jars from boiling water and set in cool, draft-free spot 
overnight. When cool, wipe outside of jars with damp cloth and gently tighten 
lids. Tightening too much can break seal. It's easy to check the seal: Press 
down in the center of the lid -- it should give very little; if it flexes 
noticeably and pops back, reprocess in the boiling water.

 The following mail-order companies sell glassware of various manufacturers. 
Most have catalogues and will take orders by phone. All charge for shipping; 
such charges vary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the Riedel line is available at many fine wine shops and 
better department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Marjorie Lum Glassware, (415) 454-0660. Lum has been marketing glassware for 
decades, and her 13 1/2-ounce chimney, the so-called Monterey glass, sells for 
$48.25 for a set of six. Her price for the "restaurant-quality" Riedel Vinum 
Burgundy, glasses with very slight flaws, is $15.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
 * International Wine Accessories, (800) 527-4072. This well-regarded catalogue 
carries Riedel crystal including the new Gourmet glass, a smaller-stemmed, 
large-bowled (13-ounce) glass that is safer in a dishwasher than longer-stemmed 
models. They cost $64.95 for a set of 10. The Riedel Vinum Burgundy sells for 
$75 for a set of four, plus shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wine Enthusiast, (800) 356-8466. This wine magazine sells a complete line of 
Riedel in addition to glassware it has made for its own catalogue. Riedel Vinum 
Burgundy sells for $71 for a set of four, plus shipping.  
</P>
<P>
 * Brown Derby, (417) 883-4066. This wine shop, located in Springfield, Mo., 
has a wide selection of glassware, including Riedel, at discount prices. Also, 
it has modest shipping charges. Riedel Vinum Burgundy sells for $69.99 for a 
set of four, plus shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wine Appreciation Guild, (800) 231-9463. This San Francisco firm markets a 
line of British-made glasses under the name John Jenkins, about $20 each. A 
best buy is the INAO (Institut National des Appellations d'Origine) tasting 
glass. This is an attractive nine-ounce, 24% lead crystal glass that many 
winery tasting rooms use. The guild's price is $49.95 per dozen plus $4 
shipping. DAN BERGER

 How you fill your wine glass determines how the aroma will be perceived.The 
best suggestion is to fill larger glasses just to the widest point of the bowl. 
The glass is meant to be filled with aroma, not wine, so pour sparingly and 
swirl well. 
</P>
<P>
 The main thing you want is a surface area large enough to aerate the wine to 
release its fruit. Red wines are, therefore, generally poured into larger 
glasses than white wines because they usually need more aeration. DAN BERGER

WINE: GIFTS OF TASTE; RAISE A GLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two glasses of wine were set down before us. Both contained the same wine, 
poured from the same bottle. A wine-loving friend and I sniffed both and agreed 
that the second glass was better. It was an excellent Pinot Noir, with an aroma 
generously hinting of cherry, strawberry, cinnamon and nutmeg. The first glass 
wasn't actually dissimilar, but it lacked something. The aroma had none of the 
depth, nuance or aromatics we both tasted in the second glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came revelation: The first glass was a standard U-shaped molded glass 
with a wide lip, the kind usually found in restaurants. The second, made by 
Riedel of Austria, was a tight-lipped shape called the Vinum Burgundy, designed 
specifically to enhance the qualities of Pinot Noir. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the mere shape of a wine glass improve the aroma of a wine? Yes and no. It 
depends on what you want out of a wine. If you buy $1.99 specials from the 
close-out bin at the local supermarket, nothing will help it. Chill it and 
pray. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, you care a lot about the subtle aroma of good wine, the 
Riedel vs. the mustard jar test is astonishing -- at least for the aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a skeptic when Georg Riedel first offered the challenge of his glasses 
competing against standard glasses. He said he'd bring the wine. I crossed him 
up: I brought a wine from my cellar, one I knew well. He poured the wine into 
two glasses. One was his Vinum Burgundy, the other a standard restaurant issue. 
The proof was in the sniffing. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't think the Riedel glasses improved the actual taste of the wine, 
although Riedel thinks they do. He says their fine rims distribute the liquid 
to the palate more precisely. But there was no arguing that the aroma was 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Riedel is not the only company to make fine glassware for wine. Literally 
dozens of others have, including Baccarat, Waterford, Hoya, Christian Dior, 
Orrefors, Anchor and Libby. Most make attractive stemware, but only a few have 
succeeded in the area of sensory pleasure the way Riedel has. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawback with Riedel glassware is cost. Suggested retail prices for the 
top-of-the-line Connoisseur crystal stemware run between $45 and $80 each, 
though some "seconds" are sold at about half price. Riedel's Vinum line 
averages $20 each, but most wine shops discount them to $15 or even less. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is possible for a wine glass to be too accurate. I have found 
that the glasses called Les Impitoyables, though attractive to look at, 
accentuate flaws as well as benefits in wine, not something I'm eager to do at 
the dinner table. (At a blind tasting, that might be a benefit.) Moreover, 
because of their small, tight rim, Les Impitoyables require you to tilt your 
head so far back there may be a danger in tipping your chair completely over. 
</P>
<P>
 A few companies have made knockoffs of these Riedels; these run about $25 for 
a set of four. They are machine-blown, serviceable and attractive. Finding them 
is best done by a call to various wine catalogue services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wine lovers like nothing better than another set of four or six glasses that 
work with different types of wine. Over the decades, certain glasses have 
become associated with certain wines. Here are a few examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Champagne. Bubbly is traditionally served in the straight-sided, 
point-bottom glass called a flute. It is considered gauche to serve sparkling 
wine in flat, saucer-like coupes. They are easy to spill and the bubbles escape 
too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * White Burgundy/Chardonnay. The most widely accepted glass for Chardonnay is 
a medium-sized, medium-height glass that holds about 15 to 20 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bordeaux/Cabernet Sauvignon. A tall, broad-middle, wide-mouthed tulip often 
is used, but any larger glass is appropriate. This also works well with Barolo. 
Generally choose something that holds 22 ounces or so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Burgundy/Pinot Noir. The large, rounded bowl called a balloon once was 
considered classic for Burgundy. The Bacchus by Baccarat is a lovely 32-ounce 
balloon with a very narrow rim that some feel is great for Burgundy. But at 
$195 each, it is hardly something to acquire by the dozen. Riedel's Vinum 
Burgundy, since copied by others, is a superb glass, both attractive and 
wonderful for the wine. It has a huge bowl and a smaller opening at the top 
than most glasses, allowing the wine to be swirled well, mixing air and wine 
esters to show off aroma best. This is the glass that most improved the Pinot 
Noir we tested. It holds 24 ounces and retails for $18 each, though often 
discounted to about $15. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zinfandel/Chianti. There is no single, widely accepted glass for these 
wines, though Riedel recently released a glass that is intended for both. They 
are tall tulips with a capacity sufficiently large to swirl the wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sherry. My favorite glass is the Spanish copa , slightly smaller than a 
flute with a rounded bottom, but the copa is difficult to find in this country. 
The copita , a Spanish bar glass, is the name used for a smaller, similarly 
shaped glass that is easier to find here. It is elegant to serve Sherry in 
copitas alongside a hot soup on a cold evening.  
</P>
<P>
 * Riesling/Gewurztraminer. There is no single traditional glass for these 
wines, though German hock glasses (squat, round-bowled, green-stemmed) appear 
in books. These so-called Romer glasses are modeled after ancient Roman 
glasses. I prefer a tall, small-bowled glass that may be held at the base of 
the stem, so the warmth of the hand doesn't warm the wine too rapidly. Riedel's 
version of a Riesling glass, designed for young white wine, is smaller than a 
white Burgundy glass, with a rim that flanges very slightly out at the lip.  
</P>
<P>
 * Port. The traditional tiny V-shaped glass used by restaurants is awful and a 
rip-off, based on how much wine you get (not much). A smaller red wine glass 
(such as the previous one) seems best. Also good is the standard INAO glass. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brandy/Cognac. Tradition says the best glass is a squat, wide-bowled 
snifter. I prefer a copa or a standard (8-ounce) tasting-room glass. Too much 
surface area in the snifter gives you too strong a hit of the alcohol. 
Waterford and Royal Edinburgh make a traditional thistle shape -- a small 
chimney -- that also works well here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The foregoing aside, one basic glass can easily serve for a multi-wine dinner. 
Setting the dinner table with six or even glasses per person is impressive, but 
unnecessary. Any good all-purpose tulip-shaped glass will work fine with any 
wine.  
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no single "perfect" wine glass for all purposes, the one 
that seems to have the widest appeal in winery tasting rooms, and the one that 
may be found in the most locations, is the INAO glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Wineries I spoke with say the INAO glass is relatively inexpensive (about $4 
each), small enough to fit into the top rack of most dishwashers and sturdy 
enough not to break if treated a bit roughly. And when wine is poured only to 
the center of the bottom curve in the glass, even poor swirlers don't have to 
worry about messing up their shirts.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: WESTSIDE SOUTHERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mamie's Southern-Style Kitchen is a cheerful restaurant in a bright neon 
mini-mall, with gingham oilcloth and two kinds of hot sauce on the tables and 
photographs of rural Louisiana on the walls -- the kind of semi-Creole place 
you'd expect to see on the fringes of a Texas downtown but not on the fringes 
of the new Olympic corridor, squeezed between a Subway and a Mrs. Fields' 
Cookies.  
</P>
<P>
 Mamie's may not be the single best Southern restaurant on the Westside -- the 
celebrity-infested Aunt Kizzy's edges it out on corn bread and fried chicken -- 
but it's certainly the only restaurant of its kind within miles. If you fax in 
an order, Mamie's will deliver to your office building -- and let you pay with 
an American Express card -- though smothered steak with black-eyed peas and 
collard greens seems too good to be eaten at a desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Like urban lunchrooms from Birmingham to Houston, Mamie's is sort of a 
cafeteria-style place, with a line that starts at the door, steel tracks to 
push your tray along and fixed-price lunches: stuffed peppers on Wednesdays, 
gumbo on Fridays, fried chicken every day of the week. With your entree you get 
dryish corn biscuits, a choice of rice or mashed potatoes and any two 
vegetables: smothered cabbage, goopy creamed corn, rich mac 'n' cheese, 
intense, spicy black-eyed peas. 
</P>
<P>
 Red beans are cooked down to a sort of pillowy tenderness with a liberal dose 
of what tastes like Cajun Magic seasoning, which more or less replaces Lawry's 
seasoned salt on Louisiana tables. Sweet potatoes, big chunks, float in a 
dense, nutmeg-scented syrup, seriously sweet, and taste something like the best 
sweet-potato pie you've ever had.  
</P>
<P>
 Mamie's makes certain concessions to Westside tastes. Collard greens are 
available either stewed down with fatback or meatless, and there's meatless 
gravy on the mashed potatoes. The green beans cooked with tomatoes and onions 
are more California-crisp than two-hour Mississippi-limp. You have to put the 
sugar in the iced tea yourself.  
</P>
<P>
 Most gumbos are sharp and musky, but Mamie's version (available Fridays) is 
creamy and mild, based on a thick, butterscotch-colored roux, with a mellow top 
note of long-cooked sweet peppers, filled with shrimp, crab pincers, hunks of 
sausage. It's as genteel as you can imagine a gumbo to be. Gently seasoned 
Creole meatloaf, in a Mom-style tomato sauce, seems almost as packed with 
vegetables as it is with meat. The Saturday oxtails, stewed until they threaten 
to float free of their bones, are gelatinous and meaty, drenched in a brown 
gravy lively with capers like an old-fashioned sauce piquant. They're the best 
food in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But a meat-and-three restaurant lives or dies by its chicken, and the chicken 
is pretty good here, whether baked, smothered in tan gravy and served with 
dumplings, or especially pan-fried -- moist and sandy-crusted, packing a jolt 
of garlic and black pepper.  
</P>
<P>
 The desserts are fairly basic -- sock-it-to-me cake and sweet-potato pies and 
a blackberry cobbler that might have been terrific if a quick trip through the 
microwave hadn't turned the crust into something resembling yesterday's 
lasagna.

BACK TO BASICS: BETTER BUTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as you can dress up a basic black dress with a scarf or jewelry, butter 
decoratively shaped or placed in an unusual dish is a simple way to make 
holiday meals even more festive. 
</P>
<P>
 We used regular butter when photographing this column, but the same techniques 
work well with some of the other butter-like products now on the market. They 
are defined as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Butter -- Made from cream, milk, or a combination of the two. By law it must 
contain 80% fat. Salt is added for flavor and to prolong shelf life; yellow 
coloring is an optional addition. One tablespoon has 100 calories and 11 grams 
of saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unsalted butter -- Butter with no salt added. It is sometimes called sweet 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Light butter -- Made of cream and milk, but water and skim milk or other 
milk products and non-dairy ingredients are added for flavor and to hold it 
together. Contains half the calories and fat of regular butter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whipped butter -- Air or inert gas is beaten into regular or unsalted butter 
to make it more spreadable and lower in fat and calories. It should not be 
substituted for regular or unsalted butter in recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Butter-margarine blend -- Combination of butter and margarine in one spread. 
The stick form may be substituted for regular butter or margarine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Margarine -- Butter-like product made from vegetable oil. It may contain 
water, milk, coloring, preservatives and emulsifiers. Some margarines are 
fortified with vitamins A and D. One tablespoon contains 100 calories and 11 
grams of polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, depending on the type of oil 
used in production. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spreads -- Butter-like products usually made with vegetable oil. The 
category includes diet spreads and squeeze-on liquids. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these products must be kept refrigerated, well wrapped or covered to 
prevent them from absorbing other food flavors. Unsalted butter may be stored 
under refrigeration for up to two weeks, regular butter for three weeks. Both 
may be frozen six to nine months. Check the packages of butter-like products 
for the recommended length of storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular and unsalted butter and regular margarine are typically sold in 
1-pound packages, with these equivalents: 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound=2 cups=4 sticks 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound=1 cup=2 sticks 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound=1/2 cup=1 stick 
</P>
<P>
 2 2/3 ounces=1/3 cup=2/3 stick 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces=1/4 cup=1/2 stick 
</P>
<P>
 1 ounce=2 tablespoons=1/4 stick 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Placing butter in a small crock is the simplest way to add some panache. If 
you have a French-styled butter dish, press softened butter into the smaller 
half and fill the larger with ice water. Invert the half with the butter into 
the cold liquid until just before serving, then turn upright. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the different types of shaping tools takes practice, so do some 
experimenting ahead of time. Curls or molds that don't turn out to your liking 
can be used for cooking or baking. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden paddles and molds must be scalded with boiling water, then soaked in 
ice water for about 10 minutes before use. Metal tools usually work best when 
rinsed under warm water. 
</P>
<P>
 For best results, the butter should be firm but not too cold. Once 
attractively formed, drop the butter into ice water to set, then refrigerate up 
to 12 hours, or drain, wrap well and freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wooden paddles -- Cut the butter into 1/2-inch slices, press each into a 
rounded lump and drop into ice water. Place one lump at a time on the ribbed 
side of one paddle. Position the other paddle, ribbed side down, at a 90-degree 
angle (Step 2) and rotate the paddles until a ridged ball is formed . 
</P>
<P>
 * Curlers -- A variety of curved-blade tools produce shell-like ribbed curls. 
Pulling toward you, lightly draw the tool lengthwise across a cube of butter . 
If the curls crack, the butter is too cold. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wooden molds -- Cut the butter into 1/2-inch slices and press the cup of the 
mold through each butter pat . Push the plunger firmly into the butter so it 
leaves an imprint. Lift the mold, pull back on the wooden cup and, with the tip 
of a sharp knife, release the butter round from the plunger. 
</P>
<P>
 After the decorative butter has set, arrange over ice for serving .

BOOKS; HOT FUSION; PACIFIC CROSSINGS BY LILY GAMBOA O'BOYLE ; ACACIA CORP: $35, 
ILLUSTRATED IN COLOR, 192 PP.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lily Gamboa O'Boyle is a crusader -- and a remarkably slim one, considering 
her cause. O'Boyle is out to get attention for an unsung cuisine -- that of the 
Philippines. Of all Asian cuisines, this one is the least publicized and the 
most elusive. In the United States, it thrives in homes, not restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, O'Boyle produced a stunning book, photographed in the islands, called 
"Philippine Hospitality." This year she has come up with a sequel, "Pacific 
Crossings." The new book highlights the work of 10 contemporary Filipino chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them joined her in November for a weekend of book-signing at Duet 
restaurant in Glendale. They were Nancy Reyes, whose family has operated the 
Aristocrat, one of the best known traditional restaurants in Manila, and Sandy 
Banks, one of the bright young stars of Filipino cooking. Duet's chef-owner, 
Andre Guerrero, also from the Philippines, organized the event as part of his 
own campaign to promote Filipino food. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Aristocrat closed in October after 58 years of operation, customers 
responded with vigorous protest. But the restaurant will reopen after 
revamping, says Reyes, who left the Aristocrat to operate a chocolate truffle 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Banks is the son of Nora Daza, prominent cookbook author and restaurateur. 
Banks recently collaborated on the menu for Daza's restaurant in Paris, Aux 
Iles Philippines. He now operates a Thai fast-food restaurant that Daza opened 
in Manila in 1989. Her previous restaurant there, Au Bon Vivant, closed in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Reyes and Banks, fusion cooking has caught on in the Philippines. 
O'Boyle's book acknowledges this with dishes such as baked mussels with pesto 
and mozzarella cheese, prawns and fish roulade in saffron beurre blanc, and 
fiddlehead ferns with ginger and coconut. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediterranean cooking is another important trend. "Our seafoods lend 
themselves to it," Reyes says. Both trends are encouraged by young chefs who 
trained abroad and want to apply Western techniques to local ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, bistros were the vogue in Manila. Now all-you-can-eat 
restaurants have taken over, some offering such luxuries as Black Angus beef 
and Peking duck at incredibly low prices. The gimmick is, if you don't clean 
your plate, you pay twice the price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Filipino food is thriving too, and O'Boyle includes such hearty 
old-style recipes as short ribs with mongo (mung beans). Adobo , a stew 
regarded as the national dish, rates an entire chapter. Along with Malay- and 
Spanish-influenced versions, there's hamburger adobo, in which the conventional 
seasonings are mixed with ground beef. A chapter devoted to barbecue includes 
Reyes' pre-war chicken barbecue, so-called because the marinade contains 
molasses, which went out of fashion after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Boyle, who left the Philippines 16 years ago, now lives in New York. These 
recipes, prepared by the guest chefs at Duet, are from her book -- with some 
alterations. At Banks' suggestion, the short ribs usually cooked with mongo 
were replaced by ox tails to produce a richer broth. Reyes used pork instead of 
chicken in the pre-war barbecue. Her recipe for sweet peppers, with an unusual 
stuffing of cheese, nuts and raisins, reflects her admiration for American 
peppers, which are meatier than those grown in the Philippines. BELL PEPPERS

<P>
THE ISLE OF EDAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a story about a cheese, an island and a dish born of two continents. 
The cheese, a smooth, butter-colored beauty from Holland, is called Edam. The 
island is another Dutch beauty, the crown jewel of the Dutch Antilles: Curacao. 
</P>
<P>
 The dish bears the curious name of keshi yena (pronounced kay-shee YAY-na). 
It's a perfect symbol of the extraordinary cultural intermingling that 
characterizes Caribbean cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Our story begins in the 13th Century in the village of Edam in northern 
Holland, where Dutch farmers perfected a cheese that would bring their town 
international acclaim. It's a curious cheese, made with whole milk from the 
morning milking and skim milk from the night before. The curds are pressed into 
an equally curious shape: a sphere the size of a cannonball. To further 
distinguish their cheese, the farmers rubbed the rind with red dye. (Today the 
cheese is coated with red wax.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Edam is aged for as long as two years, transforming the simple curds into a 
glorious cheese: firm yet creamy in consistency; mild, mellow, even buttery in 
flavor, with a gently piquant aftertaste. It is, in short, the sort of cheese 
you can enjoy every day. This is precisely what countless generations of the 
Dutch have done through the centuries. A slice of Edam on buttered pumpernickel 
remains a prized part of their breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before other countries got wind of the virtues of Edam. English 
diarist Samuel Pepys noted its availability in London in 1663 and was much 
impressed by its quality. By the 19th Century, Edam was firmly established in 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
 And there it was put to one of the strangest uses a cheese has ever served. It 
seems that during a naval battle against the Argentines, Commodore Coe, 
commander of the Uruguayan navy, ran out of cannonballs. He ordered his gunners 
to load their cannons with the ship's provision of Edams. The astonished enemy 
was routed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No such dramatic event marked the arrival of Edam in Curacao. The Dutch took 
possession of this arid island in the south Caribbean in 1634. It's likely that 
the cheese arrived at that time or soon afterward. It certainly would have felt 
at home in Curacao's principal city, Willemstad. This bustling port, with its 
tall 18th-Century townhouses, boasts the ornate facades and red-tiled roofs 
you'd find in a Dutch old master painting. Curacao may bake under the Caribbean 
sun, but its heart remains in Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of a stolid Dutch cheese to the spice-scented Caribbean gave 
rise to one of the most curious dishes in West Indian cooking, Keshi yena in 
Papiamento, the musical Spanish-based patois spoken on Curacao. (In English it 
means "stuffed cheese.") Popular lore has it that the frugal Dutch merchants 
created the dish so as not to waste the rinds of their beloved Edams. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no accident that the name keshi yena comes from Spanish ( queso lleno ). 
The island had been under Spanish rule for more than a century when the Dutch 
took over. The vessels in Willemstad's famous Floating Market come from 
Venezuela, which is only 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cheese's filling reflects an equally strong Spanish influence. Indeed, a 
Cuban or South American would call the filling picadillo. Traditionally, it's 
made with chicken, but I've seen recipes made with shrimp, beef and even fish. 
(The latter is a kosher version popular in Curacao's Jewish community.) The use 
of raisins, capers and olives to create a sweet-salty flavor contrast is one of 
the hallmarks of Latin America's Spanish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, this filling would be baked in the hollowed shell of a 
four-pound Edam cheese. As this requires a substantial amount of both cheese 
and filling, many restaurants have developed single-portion sizes by cooking 
the keshi yena in a ramekin lined with thinly sliced Edam. This is the version 
you will find below. 
</P>
<P>
 Keshi yena is a hearty dish, reflecting the Dutch love of stews and 
casseroles. But it also evokes the vibrant flavors of the Spanish Caribbean and 
of Latin America. It is as unique and cosmopolitan as the island that gave 
birth to it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the prettiest spots in all Willemstad is the Otrabanda (literally 
"other side"), a residential neighborhood on the western side of Santa Anna 
Bay, which bisects the city. The best place to enjoy the view of Queen Emma's 
bridge and the city's gabled facades is the terrace of the Caribana restaurant. 
Another attraction here is the restaurant's keshi yena. KESHI YENA 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 green pepper, cored, seeded and finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 tomato, peeled, seeded and finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound boneless and skinless chicken breast, cut into cubes 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup dry white vermouth 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon ketchup 
</P>
<P>
 6 pimiento-stuffed green olives, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon capers, drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon raisins or currants 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 (12- to 14-ounce) slab of Edam cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in skillet. Add onion and green pepper. Cook 
over medium heat until tender but not brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in tomato 
and chicken. Cook until chicken turns white, about 2 minutes. Stir in vermouth, 
ketchup, olives, capers and raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring to boil. Reduce heat and gently simmer chicken, uncovered, until very 
tender, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring often. During last 5 minutes, stir in 
parsley, cilantro and salt and pepper to taste. Cook mixture until almost dry. 
Cool slightly. Thickly butter 6 (4-inch) custard cups with remaining 1 
tablespoon butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile remove rind from cheese. Cut cheese lengthwise into 3/16-inch-thick 
strips. Use strips to line bottom and sides of prepared custard cups. Cut 
strips into pieces as necessary to line cups completely. Cheese pieces will 
melt together as they cook. Fill lined cups with chicken mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 400 degrees until thoroughly heated and cheese begins to melt, 3 to 5 
minutes. Do not overcook or cheese will become sticky mess. Remove cups from 
oven. Let cool 2 minutes. Gently loosen cheese from top edges of custard cups, 
using tip of paring knife. Invert onto plates and serve at once. Makes 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : For this recipe use firm, mature Edam purchased at cheese shop. 
Miniature round Edams sold at supermarkets are too soft. If you can't find 
mature Edam, use firm dry cheese such as Parmesan.

ORZO, YOU SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rice-shaped pasta called orzo or riso is wonderful for making stuffings 
for poultry. The grain-like pieces of this pasta stay distinct and retain 
texture during the bird's roasting time. Unlike rice and other noodles, orzo 
holds its shape well and doesn't get mushy, fall apart or turn into a dense, 
soggy mass. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to most bread stuffings, delectable stuffings can be made from 
orzo without large amounts of butter. Orzo has a satisfying, almost creamy 
texture even when cooked with very little oil. Orzo stuffing is faster and 
easier to make than bread stuffing. There's no need to cut and toast dozens of 
tiny bread cubes. The orzo needs only brief cooking. Like all stuffings, cooked 
orzo must be cooled before it is spooned into the bird. 
</P>
<P>
 You can prepare the orzo as a pilaf similar to rice pilaf by briefly sauteing 
before any liquid is added. This gives the orzo a slightly toasted, rich taste. 
Flavor the stuffing with dried fruits and fresh ginger for a pleasing sweet and 
savory touch, or give it a Mediterranean accent by combining with sauteed 
onions, garlic, hot pepper flakes and oregano. Using chicken stock as the 
cooking liquid further enhances the taste of the stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Toasted pecans, walnuts or other nuts add a terrific taste and pleasing 
texture to all types of orzo stuffings. To save time, buy ready-toasted nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A great way to save time when roasting poultry is to roast it unstuffed and 
serve the stuffing separately. In the case of the orzo stuffings, cook the orzo 
for five minutes longer or until tender. To tie in the flavor of the roast 
bird, add a few tablespoons of the pan juices to the orzo and heat together 
just before serving.

FRUITCAKE: BEYOND DOORSTOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN BENZLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When friends and family drop off fruitcake during the holidays, I've always 
wanted to have the nerve to say: "Hey, thanks a million for this 20-pound, dry, 
lumpy, shellacked brick that doesn't seem to have an expiration date on it!" 
But year after year, I don a fake smile and say with political correctness: 
"What a lovely thought! We'll certainly use it soon." Which we do. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tradition calls for fruitcake to be the "gift that keeps on giving" 
and one should recycle them to acquaintances, I just wouldn't be able to do it 
with a straight face. Surely, they'd know instantly that A) it was a "used" 
gift, and B) that I thought of them as being very low on the totem pole of 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, we began putting the cakes out on the bird feeder for the squirrels 
until we discovered they were just knocking them off; then in the spring, when 
the snow melted, we'd find fruitcakes in the bushes (perfectly intact). 
</P>
<P>
 Once, we thought we were being real funny and used one for a festive holiday 
doorstop in the dining room until a fruitcake-giver stopped by unexpectedly and 
noticed it. "The dog must have dragged it over there," we said. So, at this 
point, the best advice I can offer on how to use fruitcake gifts is to place 
them in a circle around the garbage can to repel starving raccoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to the people who manufacture fruitcakes. Do a bunch of people 
sit around a conference table at their annual meeting and say, "No changes this 
year. Same old, same old. We'll stick with the unidentifiable green and yellow 
chunks. Meeting adjourned"? Why, after all these years, doesn't someone stand 
up and say, "I can't take it anymore. Let's add chocolate chips!"? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, someone had to come up with a great fruitcake, so I took this task upon 
myself and came up with a moist, rum-infused, pound cake-like loaf -- studded 
with dried cranberries, dates, pecans and chocolate chips -- and topped with a 
lemony, white chocolate-cream cheese frosting. The good news is, you can feel 
confident giving one to someone you truly like. And it's edible. The bad news 
is, it doesn't have the lifetime warranty that an old-fashioned fruit cake has. 
You're going to have to put it in the freezer after a few days for it to last. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following recipe is a plea for those who insist on giving fruitcakes as 
gifts. Try this one for a change, I beg you.  
</P>
<P>
 NEWFANGLED FRUITCAKE WITH WHITE CHOCOLATE FROSTING 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons rum 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup chopped pitted dried dates 
</P>
<P>
 Dried cranberries 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips 
</P>
<P>
 1 (5-ounce) white chocolate candy bar, broken into pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Pecan halves 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. In another small bowl, 
beat together eggs, rum and milk. 
</P>
<P>
 In food processor fitted with plastic blade, beat 1 cup butter until creamy. 
Slowly add sugar with processor running, occasionally scraping down bowl. When 
all sugar has been added, process 2 minutes more. Add egg mixture and beat 1 
minute. Add flour mixture, 1/3 at time, until thoroughly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulsing on and off, quickly fold in pecans, dates, 1/2 cup dried cranberries 
and chocolate chips. Turn mixture into buttered and floured 9x5-inch loaf pan. 
Bake at 325 degrees 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until golden. Cool cake in pan on 
rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and finish cooling on wire rack. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt white chocolate, stirring constantly, in top of double boiler set over 
hot, not boiling water. Set aside.  
</P>
<P>
 Beat cream cheese in medium bowl until smooth. Mix in remaining 1/4 cup 
butter, lemon juice and melted white chocolate. Generously frost top of cake, 
letting some frosting ooze down sides. Garnish with pecans and more dried 
cranberries. Makes 1 loaf.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: WILMINGTON'S BANNING MUSEUM CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS -- 
DICKENS-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HISTORY HOLIDAY: The Banning Residence Museum in Wilmington, a mansion that 
once was the home of a prominent Civil War-era family, resolutely stands as a 
reminder of the community's beginnings, regardless of the change around it. 
</P>
<P>
 To the south of the museum, the Port of Los Angeles has evolved from a 
small-town harbor into one of the largest and busiest ports in the nation. The 
community, once predominantly white, is now overwhelmingly Latino. On warm 
days, the museum grounds serve as Wilmington's major park -- salsa music blares 
from boomboxes and children romp on the well-kept lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is left of 19th-Century English American lifestyle in Wilmington. But 
inside the museum, Wilmington's culture remains as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend the museum put on its annual holiday celebration, which means 
celebrating Christmas Victorian style. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors, many of whom travel from other communities for the yearly ritual, 
were treated to plum pudding, gingerbread and wassail. Period ornaments 
bedecked the house, costumed carolers sang and bell ringers rang. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Banning Residence hasn't changed with the times. But if it had changed, 
it wouldn't be a museum.

 BLIND JUSTICE: What does a law student do when the lights go out while he's 
taking the bar exam? Follow his training and sue, sue, sue. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what David Hollander is doing. Hollander contends he failed 
the intensive three-day bar exam in July, 1993, because the overhead lighting 
in his area of the testing room took a 16-minute break during the test. Test 
administrators deemed that there was enough surrounding light and continued the 
test.  
</P>
<P>
 Hollander argues that operators of the Los Angeles Airport Hyatt Hotel, the 
test site, were negligent in allowing the lapse. "Lights don't just go off in 
absence of someone's negligence," said Michael Mirharooni, Hollander's 
attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Phooey, says Hyatt attorney Robert Anderson, who argues that Hollander should 
be suing the State Bar of California. "If the lights go out in the last minute 
of a football game and the referee requires the kicker to kick the winning 
field goal in the dark, who's to blame, the referee or Con Edison?" Anderson 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Anderson said he sees the lawsuit as a frivolous publicity stunt, 
Mirharooni disagrees. "I think this is a really important case," he said. 
Still, none of Hollander's test mates has chosen to sue after the incident, as 
far as either lawyer knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollander is seeking unspecified damages to compensate for the "economic 
injuries, mental distress and other injuries" he incurred from the incident, 
Mirharooni said. Although he passed the test on a second try in February, he is 
still looking for work as a lawyer after losing a job that was contingent on 
his passing the first test.  
</P>
<P>
 So wouldn't any fledgling lawyer worth a writ handle such a matter this way? 
Not according to Anderson. "You're supposed to bounce back; that's what lawyers 
do," h said.

 BAD TIMING: If the clocks in the Torrance courthouse are any reflection of 
America's justice system, the country's in big trouble. The question in many 
courtrooms is not "Who dunnit?" but "What time is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on which courtroom you were in one recent morning, it was 10:30, 
11:30 or 12:55, according to clocks on the walls. Courthouse workers say the 
clocks have been out of kilter since the Northridge earthquake rattled the 
building in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell people it's a different time zone here," joked Mark Lomax, acting 
court administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomax said the clocks cannot be repaired individually because they are linked 
to a master clock in the courthouse. One courthouse worker said numerous calls 
to county workers requesting their help with repairs have proved a waste of 
time. Though months have passed, many clocks are still wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say the repairs, which will probably be completed in the next 
few weeks, were delayed by high costs. Fixing the master clock will cost about 
$2,800. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that he's always going to have to deal with. But I'd rather 
accept the check and be the winner with controversy than be the loser."

KUYKENDALL BLENDS PRAGMATISM, IDEOLOGY; ASSEMBLY: LEGISLATOR SAYS ACCEPTING 
TOBACCO FIRM'S $125,000 CONTRIBUTION HELPED HIM BEAT INCUMBENT, AND VOWS IT 
WON'T EASE HIS OPPOSITION TO SMOKING.

 If the state Assembly takes up campaign finance reform again, Assemblyman 
Steven T. Kuykendall (R-Rancho Palos Verdes) admits that he might be singled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have taken what is the largest single contribution to an individual 
Assembly candidate, except for maybe Willie Brown," said Kuykendall, who was 
sworn in Monday as the assemblyman in the 54th District, which includes the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula, San Pedro and Long Beach. Campaign reform would limit 
the size of contributions to state Assembly and Senate campaigns.  
</P>
<P>
 In the waning days of the campaign, Kuykendall accepted a $125,000 check from 
tobacco giant Philip Morris even though he is on record as supporting 
anti-smoking legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It might look like a contradiction. But this is how the political system 
works, Kuykendall says, a sentiment echoed by former colleagues on the Rancho 
Palos Verdes City Council and even a few of his former opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 A more polished politician might be coy about it, but Kuykendall freely admits 
that accepting the money was a pragmatic move that may have helped him defeat 
incumbent Betty Karnette by 597 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Kuykendall, an ex-Marine and mortgage banker, is facing threats of a 
recall launched by Sacramento Democrats. The state party has already filed a 
complaint over the contribution with the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, there's been little protest beyond Sacramento Democrats. 
Kuykendall and his supporters dismiss the complaint as frivolous and doubt that 
a recall will go anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that he's always going to have to deal with. But I'd rather 
accept the check and be the winner with controversy than be the loser," said 
Republican consultant Tom Shortridge, president of Bear Republic Political 
Services in Redondo Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Even anti-smoking groups say they are confident Kuykendall won't be beholden 
to the tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect we are going to be working with him," said Paul Knepprath spokesman 
for the American Lung Assn. in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that pragmatism and ideology have clashed for 
Kuykendall. Elected to the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council as a "read-my-lips, 
no-new-taxes" conservative, he soon found himself justifying tax increases as a 
way to resolve the city's fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He voted for a utility tax, which the council passed last year, and supported 
a parcel tax, which narrowly lost when it was put on the ballot in 1992. With 
the city in need of new revenue, Kuykendall even suggested a referendum to ask 
residents if they wanted to hand control of the city over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of ideology, but whether a locally controlled city 
government can survive or not," he said at the time. "It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 The Draconian proposal went nowhere, but did get people talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a businessman, he had a way of saying 'Look at this problem or we'll be in 
bankruptcy,' " former Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said.  
</P>
<P>
 Affable and frank, Kuykendall seldom displays a hard-nosed attitude people 
have come to expect from former Marines. He served two tours of duty in 
Vietnam, including a 1972 stint in which he was among the troops stopping the 
North Vietnamese Easter offensive. (One of his three children, daughter Kerry, 
followed him into the military as an ensign in the U.S. Navy. She is training 
to be a fighter pilot.)  
</P>
<P>
 After he retired from the military, Kuykendall worked at several banks and 
then helped start Lockheed Mortgage Corp., a subsidiary of Lockheed Corp. He is 
now a principal in the David Buxton Financial Corp. in Torrance and works as a 
real estate consultant and lobbyist, including work for the Palos Verdes 
Medical Center and Peninsula Medical Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, his business affairs have taken a back seat to politics. 
In fact, during the primary, opponent Jeffrey Earle tried to cast him as a 
career politician. Kuykendall made an unsuccessful run for the school board in 
1987 and then the City Council in 1989 before he won a council seat in 1991. 
And about a year and a half after his council election, he was in the race for 
the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people said he was running too soon," said former Rancho Palos Verdes 
Councilman Bob Ryan. "But Steve's been (active) in representative politics 
since he was knee-high." Although opponents have tried to use his change of 
view on taxes and his political aspirations against him, their attacks haven't 
seemed to work. One reason, colleagues on the council say, is that he has been 
more of a peacekeeper than a combatant during council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't bring too much of his personal agenda to the table," Bacharach 
said. "In fairness to Steve, I thought it was really good of him to (switch on 
taxes). I thought it was wrong of him to run on a platform of no new taxes. But 
he became a problem solver." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Earle, Kuykendall's primary opponent, backed him in the general election. 
Kuykendall sent a last-minute mailer during the primary, noting that Earle 
lived with his mother and suggesting that he didn't have enough experience to 
succeed in Sacramento. Earle explained that he moved in to help his mother when 
she had heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really thrilled by (the mailers)," Earle said. "But these were the 
typical last-minute hit pieces that come out in a campaign. I didn't harbor any 
longstanding resentment for the stuff that came out." 
</P>
<P>
 And Kuykendall's supporters say that voters have little if any resentment over 
the Philip Morris contribution. Kuykendall notes that the tobacco giant has a 
number of subsidiaries, including real estate and food products. 
</P>
<P>
 "That company has got a lot more at stake than whether or not they sell 
cigarettes," Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 And ironically, it could be the Philip Morris contribution that ensures that 
he backs anti-smoking legislation while in Sacramento. Otherwise, opponents 
could gain even more fodder for a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to be dumb enough to vote tobacco," said Shortridge, the 
Republican consultant. "I don't think he owes them anything."

STUDY SAYS INGLEWOOD HAS HIGH MURDER RATE; CRIME: FBI PUTS IT AT 14TH IN NUMBER 
OF KILLINGS AMONG CITIES OVER 100,000 POPULATION IN 1993. THE POLICE CHIEF 
THERE SAYS HE'S NOT SURPRISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There it is, listed among the 25 most murderous cities in the United States 
and next to places whose reputations for violence are known nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 The inconspicuous South Bay suburb of 112,000 -- better known as the home of 
the Los Angeles Lakers than as a center of crime -- had the 14th highest murder 
rate in the country in 1993 for cities with populations over 100,000, according 
to a Federal Bureau of Investigation report released Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Gary, Ind., ranks first on the list of 25, with 89.9 murders per 100,000 
residents. Oakland comes in at 13th, one notch worse than Inglewood. Detroit is 
fifth. Los Angeles is last on the list, and notoriously dangerous New York City 
doesn't even appear. 
</P>
<P>
 But Inglewood -- quiet, middle-class Inglewood -- sits smack in the middle 
with a rate of 39 murders for every 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 If the statistics aren't exactly what Inglewood Police Chief Oliver Thompson 
wanted to hear, neither do they come as any great surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that people kill people in this town," Thompson said. "But I live 
in this city, and I think the city is a very safe place. I don't make too much 
of statistics, whether they're good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the figures in the FBI's annual report, called Crime in the United 
States, could be broken down in a variety of ways, and adjusting the parameters 
slightly can drastically change the outcome.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearby Compton, for example, does not make the publicized top 25 list because 
it has 96,500 residents, just missing the 100,000 population cutoff. Had it 
been factored in, Compton would be fifth on the list, nearly doubling the 
Inglewood murder rate, with 64.1 murders per 100,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And just last month, the U.S. Department of Justice cited Inglewood as being 
among the 10 California cities with the largest drop in overall crime in 1993. 
Crime in every major category, except for murder, fell by an average of about 
11%. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I didn't make too much of those numbers either," Thompson said. "Numbers 
are cold and hard. They don't really say much about what's happening in a 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI uses the category "murder" in its crime statistics to mean the killing 
of one person by another, regardless of whether a court has deemed the action 
to be murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 44 killings in Inglewood in 1993, 22 were drug- or gang-related; five 
were the result of robberies, four occurred during domestic disputes and five 
during other disputes. The remaining eight did not fall into specific 
categories, Thompson said.  
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, 45 people had been killed in the city so far this year, 11 of 
them during a two-night gang war. Victims include a 2-year-old who was caught 
in the gangland cross-fire in January, the manager of a Price Club who was shot 
for $15 in change in September, and an ice cream vendor killed during a robbery 
in November.  
</P>
<P>
 While the nearly 400-page report paints Inglewood as a city with a violent 
crime problem (even though its murder count is down from 54 in 1980), the 
picture nationwide is slightly more rosy. Crime in general was down 2.1% over 
1992, according to the document, and violent crime was down 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary figures for 1994 show a continued mild decline in crime, said FBI 
spokesman John Hoos in Los Angeles, with violent offenses down about 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bay, Hawthorne followed Inglewood on the murder list for 1993, 
with a rate of 15.8 killings per 100,000 residents. Gardena had the 
third-highest rate with 13.5 slayings per 100,000 people.  
</P>
<P>
 Of cities with 10,000 or more residents, two -- Lomita and Palos Verdes 
Estates -- went through 1993 without a single homicide. Two Palos Verdes police 
officers were gunned down in Torrance, however, during a meeting of officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the differences in the murder rates in their communities, law 
enforcement officials from both Inglewood and Lomita agree that the best way of 
reducing crime is for residents to become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be everywhere," said Lt. Ernie Roop of the Lomita Sheriff's Station. 
"The neighborhoods have to work within themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Thompson, the Inglewood police chief: "The citizens have given it all 
over to law enforcement and said, 'Hell, it's your job.' That's what gets me 
upset, not the statistics."

DISTRICT SUES LAW FIRM IN FEE DISPUTE; EDUCATION: FORMER ATTORNEYS FOR 
CENTINELA VALLEY SCHOOLS DENY CHARGES THAT THEY DEFRAUDED THE DISTRICT OF $2 
MILLION IN BILLINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the Centinela Valley Unified School District are suing their 
former lawyers, alleging they defrauded the district of almost $2 million in 
legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Liebert, Cassidy & Frierson overcharged the district for 
three years while representing the district in several racial discrimination 
claims, including one brought by former Supt. McKinley M. Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, the firm fraudulently prepared billing slips and time 
sheets and refused to submit billing claims to the district's insurance agency. 
Bypassing the agency, the suit alleges, allowed the firm to charge $100 more 
per hour than the insurance company would cover.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit also charges that Nash agreed to retain the firm's services for the 
district in exchange for favorable treatment if Nash were to sue the district 
for racial discrimination. But school district officials said Tuesday night 
that allegation will be dropped from the suit.  
</P>
<P>
 Nash, who is not listed as a defendant in the suit, called the allegation 
absurd. The suit "is crazy, unbelievable," he said. "It's a blatant disregard 
for the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Newkirk, one of the district's new lawyers, says Liebert, Cassidy & 
Frierson did not do a very good job of representing the district. He said his 
firm has agreed to be paid out of any damages paid to the district by its 
former law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Larry J. Frierson of Liebert, Cassidy and Frierson, disagreed. "We believe 
that we provided competent and sensitive legal counsel to the district during a 
difficult and stressful time," he said. "The complaint contains allegations 
which are simply false."  
</P>
<P>
 Liebert, Cassidy & Frierson was hired by the district in January, 1990, 
officials said. The firm represented the district during a contract dispute 
with Nash and during several racial discrimination claims filed by Nash and 
other district employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash's attorney, George W. Shaeffer Jr., said Nash's contract dispute was 
settled and, as a result, the discrimination claim was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims cost the district hundreds of thousands of dollars and led to a 
U.S. Department of Justice report that said the district maintained "a racially 
hostile environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's contract with the district was not renewed by the school board, and 
its legal obligations to the district expired in September, 1993, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is seeking an undisclosed amount of damages.

COMMUNITY NEWS: RANCHO PALOS VERDES; APPLICANTS SOUGHT FOR VACANT COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will appoint a replacement for former Councilman Steven 
Kuykendall, who was elected to the state Assembly in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously Tuesday to make the appointment rather than hold 
a special election, which would have cost about $70,000.The term will last 
until November, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council cannot decide on an appointee by Jan. 4, 30 days after 
Kuykendall's official resignation, the city must hold a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The council set a Dec. 16 deadline for applications for the seat. Interviews 
will take place Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, Kuykendall's one-year term as mayor was up Tuesday. The 
council unanimously chose Mayor Pro Tem Lee Byrd to fill the largely ceremonial 
position. Councilwoman Marilyn Lyon was unanimously elected mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Councilwoman Susan Brooks, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for a 
congressional seat last month, said she "most likely" will not seek reelection 
in 1995 because she plans to run for Congress again. The March, 1996, 
Republican primary will come too soon after the November, 1995, council 
election, Brooks said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some property owners on and near Daladier Drive have been asking for more than 
10 years for the city to put utility lines underground in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost of the work would be $12,000 to $18,000 for each property 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, the City Council refused to pass the Daladier assessment, noting 
opposition from those who own 62% of the land in the proposed assessment 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents argue that placing the wires, which are now on poles, 
underground is safer and more attractive.  
</P>
<P>
 But residents who do not have utility poles marring their view said they saw 
no need to put the lines underground; others said they could not afford the 
assessment. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; CITY TO RETURN TO WEEKLY STREET SWEEPING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Abandoning its pilot program, the City Council voted Tuesday to return to 
weekly street sweeping in residential and commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets had been swept only twice a month since Sept. 6 in an effort to 
save money.But the city did not change street signs when it cut back sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The old signs confused some residents -- and some parking enforcement 
officers. Eight residents reported receiving parking tickets on weeks when no 
street sweeping occurred. City officials agreed to tear up those tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council voted 3 to 0 to return to the old system, spending 
about $88,000 for the additional service. Councilwoman Kay A. Calas was absent, 
and Lorelie S. Olaes abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly sweeping will start Jan. 1. MARY GUTHRIE

<P>
 Port officials are completing deals with three railroad companies to buy about 
40 miles of track and right-of-way property for the Alameda Corridor project. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, which belongs to Union Pacific Railroad, Southern Pacific 
Transportation, and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, will cost $312 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Harbor Commission agreed to the purchase at a board meeting 
last week. The Port of Long Beach, which under the deal would pay half the 
costs, and the Los Angeles City Council are expected to approve the deal by 
Dec. 22, said Winston Tyler, the senior assistant city attorney in Los Angeles.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; CITY KILLS PUBLIC VOTE ON TRUSTEE TERM LIMITS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council killed a plan that could have imposed term limits on school 
board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 on Tuesday against asking voters to decide in March 
whether to limit Redondo Beach board members to two terms and divide the school 
district into five regions, each with its own board representative.Council 
members Joseph Dawidziak and Marilyn White supported the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes would have required a City Charter amendment. A city commission 
proposed the ballot measures that would have made school district elections 
more like council elections. Council members are elected by district and are 
limited to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board unanimously opposed the plan. An attorney representing the 
school district told the council that the changes are unnecessary. He said the 
district's current system works fine and added that changing the charter would 
conflict with state laws and probably result in a costly legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm asking you not to declare war on the school district," attorney David G. 
Miller told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawidziak disagreed. He said the council should give voters the chance to 
decide the issue. "People are fed up with government not doing it right and 
want a say-so in the process," he said. "I trust (the voters) to do what's 
right." JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; COUNCIL MEMBERS ADD 11 MONTHS TO TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members voted to extend their terms by 11 months to avoid a 
timing conflict between the next council election and the statewide 
presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The next council election was scheduled for April, 1996.But state officials 
changed the 1996 primary from June to March, which would have put the primary 
only two weeks away from the next council election. 
</P>
<P>
 That would confuse voters and strain county services, city officials said. 
Manhattan Beach depends on county polling booths and other services to conduct 
council elections, and the county indicated it would have difficulty providing 
those services so close to the presidential primary, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the council voted unanimously on Tuesday to schedule the next election for 
March, 1997. Councilman Steve Napolitano said the vote to extend council terms 
probably would draw criticism from the community, but he said the decision was 
the best for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members considered shortening their terms by five months and holding 
the council election in conjunction with the next school board election in 
November. But they said elections work more smoothly and voters can focus on 
key issues when they are held separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council terms, as well as the terms of the city clerk and city 
treasurer, will now expire in 1997. JAMES BENNING

 Police are seeking a gray-haired man in his 50s or 60s who has been trying to 
lure young girls into his van in the area of the Alta Vista School and Alta 
Vista Park, in the 700 block of Julia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, seen driving a late-1970s faded-white van with two parallel, 
rust-colored stripes around the body, has approached three girls in recent 
days, apparently in attempts to molest them, said Capt. Jeff Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, the suspect asked a 6-year-old playing at the park to come 
with him. The girl ran away. Another time, he offered lollipops to two 
8-year-old girls in an attempt to get them into his van, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as having a potbelly and a receding hairline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department is working with the Redondo Beach Unified School 
District on the case and is encouraging parents to discuss with their children 
how to handle such approaches by strangers. 
</P>

<P>
 A man who operates a topless bar in a residential area of San Pedro said he 
will fight city prosecutors on 1st Amendment grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach resident Norman Newman, 51, has owned Norm's Place at 915 S. 
Pacific Ave. for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The business was originally a sports bar with entertainment, Newman said. But 
he changed the entertainment in August to include a show featuring bikini-clad 
women who remove their tops while dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman and the bar's manager, Alastair Heald, 49, of Fountain Valley, are 
charged with violating the Los Angeles Adult Entertainment Ordinance by 
operating the business within 500 feet of a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Maria Perez Manning, who is handling the case, said the 2nd 
District Court of Appeal has already rejected the argument that the ordinance 
is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newman said he will appeal to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said police investigations began after several San Pedro residents 
complained about the bar's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men, who face a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine, 
have pleaded not guilty. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 4 in San Pedro 
Municipal Court. SUSAN WOODWARD

<P>
 The Los Angeles Harbor Board has extended a deadline given to the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers to dispose of contaminated waste in port waters. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the board agreed to allow up to 135,000 cubic yards of material 
dredged from the Marina del Rey channel to be stored on the floor of the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the agreement, the corps had to dispose of the material by Dec. 1 so 
its activities would not interfere with the port's Pier 300/400 expansion 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the corps has asked for an extension. Because the port's contractor is 
running behind schedule, staff asked the harbor board to grant the extension 
until Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Commissioner Leyland Wong was particularly reluctant, saying the board 
was warned not to grant any extensions when it first approved the corps' plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only extension we will give to the county and the corps," Wong 
said. SUSAN WOODWARD

<P>
 A 26-year-old Los Angeles woman, who said she got lost on Redondo Beach 
streets while on her way to Los Angeles International Airport, was kidnaped, 
raped and robbed by two men who approached her car Monday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who was driving a rental car, was waiting at a stop sign near the 
intersection of Aviation and Manhattan Beach boulevards when she saw two men, 
both in their late 20s or early 30s, approaching her car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 One man asked for money, and she asked him for directions, police said. He 
then put a handgun to her head and both men forced their way into the car, 
Redondo Beach Police Capt. Jeffrey Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men then drove the woman to a nearby bank and parked in a rear lot, out of 
sight of vehicles traveling on Aviation Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men raped the woman, police said, and then removed $22 from her pocket 
and threatened to kill her if she told anyone of the attack. The men fled in a 
dark-colored four-wheel-drive vehicle that was parked in the same lot, police 
said. The woman drove to a nearby gas station, where an attendant called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim gave police detailed descriptions of both men. 
</P>
<P>
 One was described as a black man, 30 to 35 years old with a light complexion 
and freckles. He had large eyes and a small chin, and the top of his left ear 
was either missing or deformed. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim said the other man was also black, 25 to 30 years old with black 
hair parted in the center and bumps or moles near his sideburns. He had crooked 
teeth and talked like a rapper. On his left ring finger he wore a gold-nugget 
ring with a diagonal groove across its top.  
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo police have studied the details of the Redondo Beach report while 
investigating a report of another kidnap-rape that occurred in August. But 
early information suggests that the two incidents are unrelated, said El 
Segundo Police Sgt. Glenn Coles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't ruled it out, but . . . it doesn't sound like the guys we're 
looking for," Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Segundo suspect held up a Subway restaurant and a Kinko's copy shop in 
the 600 block of El Segundo Boulevard on Aug. 21, then ran across the street to 
the Hacienda Hotel and abducted a 20-year-old Danish woman from the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the Redondo Beach crime is asked to call 
Detective David Atwater at the Redondo Beach Police Department, (310) 379-2477, 
Ext. 2330. ERIC SLATER

refinery explosion felt like -- not until a recent afternoon when her Torrance 
home shook furiously and a loud noise rumbled through her neighborhood, 
followed by the sound of sirens. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she views the refinery just three blocks away with a new wariness, 
wondering what goes on inside that castle-like mass of industrial towers and 
billowing steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be safe. You can't run a business unless it's safe," the mother 
of two tells herself, but she isn't entirely convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Such gnawing uncertainty is nothing new to many who live in the shadow of the 
giant Mobil Oil Corp. refinery. And in coming weeks, Torrance officials and 
residents must come to grips again with a decades-old question: Is the refinery 
safe enough? 
</P>
<P>
 A court-monitored adviser is to decide by Dec. 31 whether the refinery can 
continue using toxic hydrofluoric acid, which critics say is as dangerous as 
the deadly gas that has killed 7,000 since a disastrous leak a decade ago at 
Bhopal, India. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the adviser could reveal whether years of oil industry 
research have produced a safe version of hydrofluoric acid, which is used in a 
refinery unit that boosts the octane of unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is more than a chemistry experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is political drama as well, a test of Torrance's decision five years ago to 
sue one of the nation's largest corporations -- and then strike a pact with 
Mobil with the goal of improving refinery safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming decision on the controversial "HF" -- coming on the heels of an 
explosion at Mobil seven weeks ago -- is focusing fresh attention on the 
750-acre refinery that operates side by side with homes and playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil has been gearing up for years for this month's deadline. While its 
researchers have worked to make hydrofluoric acid safer, operators at the 
Torrance refinery have spent millions of dollars installing new equipment and 
upgrading the company's image in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts have won applause from Torrance officials and residents, who 
report that the refinery's safety record has improved markedly since a spate of 
fires and other problems in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think Mobil has responded," said Hope Witkowsky, a 28-year refinery 
neighbor and president of the Northwest Torrance Homeowners Assn.. She commends 
Mobil for working with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, seven years passed between major Mobil accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Oct. 19, a gaseous mix of propane, butylene and butane spewed from a 
pipeline that apparently had been left unconnected at a flange. That triggered 
an explosion that injured 28 workers, at least six seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hydrofluoric acid was not involved, fire officials report that the 
explosion occurred only about 50 feet from the refinery's alkylation unit, 
where the lethal acid is used. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mobil, the timing scarcely could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance officials grew leery of hydrofluoric acid after 1986 industry tests 
in Nevada showed that a leak of 1,000 gallons could form a ground-hugging cloud 
that would potentially be lethal as far as five miles downwind. The chemical's 
fumes are dangerously irritating to the eyes and respiratory system, and 
contact with the skin can cause severe burning, experts say.  
</P>
<P>
 Hydrofluoric acid ranks as one of the most toxic chemicals used in the Los 
Angeles Basin, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
Mobil, which keeps about 29,000 gallons of the chemical on site, is the only 
major Los Angeles-area refinery using the acid. But HF is also used at the 
Allied-Signal refrigerant plant in El Segundo, the Ultramar refinery in 
Wilmington and the Powerine refinery in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Torrance settled its public nuisance lawsuit against Mobil 
with a pact requiring Mobil to phase out hydrofluoric acid by 1997 unless Mobil 
could prove by this Dec. 31 that it has devised a safe form of the chemical. 
Environmental groups hailed the pact as a model example of a local government 
working to make industry safer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now some environmentalists are criticizing Torrance officials for what they 
call a weakening of the guidelines for measuring HF safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that they have severely caved in on this critical issue," said 
Denny Larson, who studies refinery issues for Citizens for a Better 
Environment-California. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparking the criticism was a court order this fall, signed by the city and by 
Mobil, to permits the refinery to continue using HF as long as a study of the 
newly modified acid shows it is safer than the industry alternative, sulfuric 
acid. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance and Mobil officials bristle at the notion that the agreement was 
diluted. On the contrary, they say, calling for a comparison of the merits of 
the two acids -- a technique called quantitative risk assessment -- will yield 
some valuable insight into refinery safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling was that this actually would give the city more information about 
what to do," said Michael Leslie, an attorney for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it does is incorporate in the consent decree something that governments 
are requiring of industry day in and day out," said Ernest Getto of Latham & 
Watkins, an attorney representing Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
 The new language, included in a Sept. 30 legal agreement, was discussed in 
private by the City Council because it was considered a matter of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Torrance has kicked this all behind closed doors without having a public 
discussion about it," said Fred Millar, a Washington-based environmentalist and 
longtime critic of hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys say that a public report is due out shortly from a 
court-supervised safety adviser on whether Mobil should continue using the 
chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 That report may help resolve a pivotal issue: whether Mobil's years of 
research have indeed produced a safe form of hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil researchers said Monday that they have found an additive that sharply 
reduces HF's tendency to form a vapor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely optimistic," said Joel H. Maness, Mobil western region manager, 
in describing the results of 1993 tests of the modified acid at an Oklahoma 
research site. "All the results are very, very positive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first volleys in the Torrance hydrofluoric battle were fired in the late 
1980s, in the wake of a massive explosion at the Mobil refinery involving the 
toxic acid. The 1987 explosion, in which six people were injured, jolted city 
officials, in part because it came just weeks after a Texas refinery accident 
that released a large cloud of the acid. 
</P>
<P>
 As concern mounted, Councilman Dan Walker launched an initiative campaign to 
sharply curtail the amount of HF allowed in the city and thus force Mobil to 
stop using it. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, a public relations consultant who had gained a pro-development 
reputation since his 1978 election, seemed an unlikely ally of ecology-minded 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This initiative, with its environmental nature, came from a conservative 
Republican who has a pro-business history," he told a reporter in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative was defeated in 1990 after Mobil spent hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to oppose it. Walker's council colleagues decided not to back the 
measure, saying they saw a city lawsuit as a more effective avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 That lawsuit led to the 1990 consent decree that set the schedule for an HF 
phaseout and created a court-supervised safety adviser. The case has cost the 
city $1.6 million in outside legal help. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Walker expresses concern that the city may have paid a high price to 
sue Mobil, only to find Mobil making the same arguments it did five years ago 
about hydrofluoric acid's safety compared to sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was so safe," he said, "all the refineries would be using it." 
</P>
<P>
 In time, refinery accidents became a less frequent occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 The political landscape changed too. Torrance got a new mayor and a new city 
attorney. Walker, now 54, left the council to run unsuccessfully for state 
Assembly and then was reelected to the council in March. Of the seven council 
members who launched the Mobil suit, only three remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Oct. 19 explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Walker has called on Mobil to make the results of its investigation 
public -- which Mobil says it plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an open letter to the community, Maness wrote: "We intend to thoroughly 
examine exactly what happened, what caused it and what we can do to assure 
ourselves that it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maness' career in Torrance began as Walker's campaign initiative wound down. 
He arrived in town as refinery manager in June, 1990, swiftly becoming a 
familiar face to Torrance officials and to readers of the community newsletter 
the company sends to city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 His mission, he says in his soft Texas drawl, was "to assure the safe, 
reliable and environmentally sound operation of our facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Maness, 44, has a resume that reads like a road map of major Mobil sites: 
Beaumont, Tex.; New York; Fairfax, Va.; Joliet, Ill.  
</P>
<P>
 In Torrance, he has adopted a personable approach to community issues. As part 
of an recent American Red Cross challenge, for example, Mobil collected more 
blood than the rival Arco Carson refinery, so the losing Arco manager had to 
spend the day pumping gas at a Mobil station in Torrance. Maness joined him, 
wearing Mobil coveralls as he worked the pump. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks proudly of the twice-a-year open houses that have given an estimated 
13,000 people a glimpse of the world inside Mobil's gates. Those tours allow 
residents "to see us as exactly who we are," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, this fall's open house was scheduled for the two weekends 
following the explosion, and Mobil decided to go ahead with the event. About 
900 people toured the refinery over two days, passing along a drive adorned 
with banners carrying the slogan, "Team Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
 Maness, dressed in coveralls, talked somberly to a group of visitors about the 
accident and the 28 injured men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I've personally failed 28 members of our team," he told them. 
"We've come away from this incident with a two-word phrase: 'Never more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A flurry of reports about Mobil will be issued in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, which is 
investigating the Oct. 19 explosion, expects to issue its report in late 
December. Mobil's own findings are due shortly. And a third investigation is 
being conducted by EQE Engineering International of Irvine, which replaced 
Westinghouse as safety adviser in September. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, EQE will also issue its recommendation on whether Mobil's modified 
HF meets the requirements of the consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure we'll have lots to read between Christmas and New Year's," quipped 
Councilman Don Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 pact says that Mobil can decide to switch to a modified HF only if it 
has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the safety adviser that the modified 
catalyst would not form "an aerosol or dense vapor cloud upon release." 
</P>
<P>
 The amended wording states that Mobil must either meet the 1990 standard for 
the acid or demonstrate "that the modified HF catalyst (including mitigation) 
presents no greater risk than a sulfuric acid alkylation plant producing a 
comparable amount of alkylate." 
</P>
<P>
 Millar criticized using mitigation -- such as water sprays -- in determining 
whether HF is safe. "You don't want to rely on mitigating factors because a lot 
of time they don't work," he said. "A fire or explosion is not kind to water 
systems or electrical power. They tend to knock them out."  
</P>
<P>
 Mobil officials, however, said they have a sophisticated system of mitigation. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the agreement means that an assessment will be performed, 
measuring the risks of the two acids. 
</P>
<P>
 City Fire Chief R. Scott Adams says he supported adding the assessment. If 
Mobil researchers have significantly reduced the acid's cloud-forming 
tendencies, Adams said, sticking with hydrofluoric could prove safer than a 
costly switch to sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 And sulfuric acid poses its own risks, such as boosting truck traffic, Adams 
said. Mobil says that about 630 trucks per month would be required to transport 
sulfuric acid to the refinery, compared to only two to three trucks per month 
of hydrofluoric acid today because the process uses larger amounts of sulfuric. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 57 refineries nationwide use hydrofluoric acid, and 45 use 
sulfuric, according to the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists gave the amended language mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense 
Council in Los Angeles, agreed that the original language could have forced a 
switch to sulfuric acid -- even if that proved more risky. She wondered, 
however, if the new language provides as strong an incentive for Mobil to make 
hydrofluoric acid as safe as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Epstein of the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington said that 
environmentalists are historically wary of risk assessments -- in part because 
they require significant expertise on the part of the public and regulators to 
make sure they are adequate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millar was more blunt, dismissing such assessments as "voodoo science."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The entire debate, however, could well be moot if Mobil has found a safe HF. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance officials have signed secrecy agreements not to disclose proprietary 
information about the research, which is being conducted jointly by Mobil and 
Phillips Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 But researchers at Mobil's research laboratory in Paulsboro, N.J., said Monday 
that they believe their findings meet both the old and new guidelines for 
judging the acid. 
</P>
<P>
 They described a two-step process involving an additive as well as mitigation 
systems such as water sprays. The additive, when mixed with HF, reduces its 
vapor-forming tendencies, with most of the acid "raining out" or landing on the 
ground within a short distance of a release, they said. About one-third still 
becomes a vapor that can be knocked down with water sprays, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert who helped conduct the 1986 Nevada tests says that he is encouraged 
by what he knows of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like they've developed some additives and an approach that works 
pretty well," said Ronald P. Koopman of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Petroleum Institute reports that other companies are making 
progress in their own hydrofluoric acid research. Texaco, for instance, began 
using an additive late this summer at its El Dorado, Kan., refinery that 
substantially reduces the amount of hydrofluoric acid aerosol that would be 
formed if a leak occurred, a Texaco spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Mobil will use a similar additive in Torrance could be decided in a 
matter of weeks. It is still unclear how much of that decision-making will 
occur in public. Although Millar has urged Torrance to convene a public 
hearing, much of the discussion may be conducted privately -- again because it 
is considered a matter of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, Mobil's neighbors will be waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jeannie Sanford never heard of hydrofluoric acid before last month, 
she knows that "if it's not good for us, I don't want it there." 
</P>
<P>
 And Witkowsky adds simply: "I wish they could come up with something else." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Mobil Refinery: A Chronology Here are 
some key events in the operation of the Torrance Mobil oil refinery.  
</P>
<P>
 December, 1979: A 19-year-old woman's car stalls near the refinery. When she 
tries to restart her engine, the spark ignites a cloud of butane gas drifting 
from the nearby Mobil tank farm, setting off a large fire. The woman and two 
refinery workers die. There was also an explosion and fire in September. 
</P>
<P>
 1986: Industry-sponsored tests in Nevada show that a 1,000-gallon spill of 
hydrofluoric acid could produce a cloud that could be lethal as far away as 
five miles downwind. 
</P>
<P>
 November, 1987: An explosion rips through the Torrance Mobil refinery, 
sparking a 17-hour fire, injuring six people and causing $17 million in damage. 
About 100 pounds of hydrofluoric acid are released, but none of it spreads 
beyond the refinery grounds. The explosion is blamed on an excess of 
hydrofluoric acid in a refinery unit. 
</P>
<P>
 July, 1988: Chemicals explode in a tank being cleaned, killing one worker and 
seriously burning two others. Earlier the same day, another explosion injures 
eight workers. 
</P>
<P>
 December, 1988: Torrance Councilman Dan Walker launches an initiative campaign 
that would end Mobil's use of hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 April, 1989: The city of Torrance files suit against Mobil, seeking to declare 
the refinery a public nuisance. The suit alleges "severe problems with safety 
conditions and procedures at the refinery" and warns that a large release of 
hydrofluoric acid could threaten thousands living in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 March, 1990: Torrance voters reject Walker's initiative by a 3-to-1 margin. 
Mobil spends at least $640,000 opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
 October, 1990: On the eve of trial, the city and Mobil announce an agreement 
in which the oil company is to phase out its use of hydrofluoric acid by 1997. 
However, Mobil will be allowed to continue using the acid past 1997 if it 
develops a safe form by Dec. 31, 1994. A safety adviser will monitor safety at 
the refinery through 1997, paid for by Mobil. Retired Superior Court Judge 
Harry V. Peetris is to oversee the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 April, 1991: The South Coast Air Quality Management District orders a Los 
Angeles-area phaseout of large-scale use of hydrofluoric acid by 1999 unless a 
safe form is developed. The rule is later overturned in court, but AQMD now 
plans to reinstitute a version of the rule by mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 May, 1991: After the city and Mobil fail to agree on a safety adviser, the 
judge picks Mobil's nominee, Westinghouse Electric Corp., and sets a $1-million 
limit for the project.  
</P>
<P>
 April, 1994: The Mobil refinery wins a National Petroleum Refiners Assn. 1993 
gold award for a 34% reduction in on-the-job injuries. The refinery also 
received awards from the association for 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 September, 1994: The city and Mobil amend the language under which Mobil would 
be forced to stop using hydrofluoric acid. They also replace Westinghouse with 
a new safety adviser, EQE Engineering International of Irvine, after costs top 
$1.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 October, 1994: An explosion and fire at the refinery injures 28 workers. The 
cause is still under investigation, but initial reports blame a leak of 
propane, butane and butylene gases from a pipeline that apparently had been 
left disconnected.

FAMILIES NEAR DDT SITE UNHAPPY WITH EPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 33 families that were moved from a Torrance area neighborhood after last 
spring's discovery of DDT contamination can continue living in temporary 
quarters through June while the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decides on 
a cleanup plan, agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that plan, announced at a meeting last week, is being lambasted by some 
families who believe the federal government should instead move them 
permanently from West 204th Street, a promise that the EPA has declined to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're giving us a little pacifier. That's all they're doing -- 'OK, we'll 
extend relocation another six months,' " said Dunia Ponce, 34, a registered 
nurse who is among those who have been living since May in hotel rooms and 
rented homes at federal expense. Residents originally were told they were being 
relocated only until January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce owns a home directly across the street from the two yards where chunks 
of DDT were excavated last spring. The discovery sparked concern because the 
yards are less than half a mile from a former DDT manufacturing plant, Montrose 
Chemical Corp., now a federal Superfund site. Directly to the north is a former 
rubber factory that is a proposed Superfund site. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of 204th Street have complained of nausea, headaches, rashes and 
other ailments that they fear are being caused by chemicals from the two sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But after conducting months of tests, federal officials have concluded that 
the results do not merit a costly permanent relocation in which the government 
would buy up homes in the unincorporated area just east of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 That testing did find traces of DDT and another pesticide in the household 
dust inside 25 of the 28 homes along 204th Street that were included in the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, angry and distrustful residents worry that they could have been exposed 
to the dust for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average American home doesn't have DDT in the dust," Ponce said.  
</P>
<P>
 EPA section chief John Blevins, however, said that further research is needed 
to determine if the levels of DDT are high enough to pose a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is studying how to clean up the six properties along 204th Street 
that are believed to contain DDT-contaminated fill, including the two where 
chunks of the pesticide were found last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 At the public meeting Dec. 1, officials described options that included 
fencing the site at a cost of $1 million, removing and temporarily storing the 
contaminated fill ($5 million to $10 million) and disposing of the material 
($10 million to $20 million). 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA would like to have cleanup completed by June, Blevins said Wednesday.

LIBRARIES: COUNTY'S SUPPORT IN HERMOSA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although we may rejoice in the provisional reopening of the county library 
branch in Hermosa Beach to five-days-a-week service, Los Angeles County can no 
more be depended on to sustain this operation than was the case 16 months ago. 
It runs a high-cost library system while suffering from ever-escalating demands 
on its tax revenue.Hermosa Beach should continue to prepare for the day when it 
must choose between an independent library or little or no library service in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 In that spirit, the Hermosa Beach Friends of the Library, while celebrating 
the short-run reprieve, has been re-examining its gift-giving policy. Rather 
than providing materials which will circulate throughout the county library 
system, we have, since September, 1993, concentrated on gifts which will remain 
in and benefit our library: newspaper and magazine subscriptions, children's 
programs and reference items. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised by our quarterly book sales, such as the one coming up 
(Saturday), and the community's support of our organization have enabled us to 
be very generous to the library. Looking ahead, we are steadily accumulating 
funds to be available as a "starter" for a new library. In that event, we will 
need even more backing from city residents and businesses.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A GIRL, A PIER, A BOWL OF CHOWDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the eighth grade, I was madly in love with a girl named Adrienne, though I 
don't believe she ever knew it. One day I overheard her telling friends that an 
older guy had taken her to dinner at Tony's on the Pier. My heart sank. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony's was way out of my league, a two-story octagonal building with a spire 
on top that stuck out on the Redondo Beach pier like the Eiffel Tower. Today, 
after 40 years of business, Tony's still stands out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony is Tony Trutanich, a San Pedro fisherman who once upon a time sold his 
wares on the pier. In 1952, he docked in Redondo for good and opened the 
restaurant. For years, Tony did it all -- busboy, waiter, cook. As word spread 
about the good fish, so did the restaurant. The nearby Tony's Fishmarket opened 
in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 People come here to enjoy the view (the more rain and wind the better, as the 
waves crash on large boulders) and to delve into a menu full of old favorites. 
Among the appetizers are such veterans as oysters Rockefeller ($7.25), 
bluepoint oysters ($6.25) and clams casino -- chopped clams with bacon, garlic, 
oregano and Parmesan ($6.95). In addition to the ever-popular clam chowder, 
there's a smoked salmon chowder ($3.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Seafood also dominates the main course selections. Lobster Thermidor ($22.95) 
combines chunks of lobster tail meat with a bechamel sauce flavored with white 
wine, tarragon, shallots and mustard. Though many say the sauce distracts from 
the pure flavor of lobster, this dish is still one of Tony's big sellers. 
Scampi ($17.95) are sauteed in olive oil, garlic and white wine, while the 
likes of shark ($12.95), sea bass ($15.95) and swordfish ($18.95) get the 
simple treatment of the grill. The dinners come with soup and salad, and a 
choice of rice or baked potato.

 As for Adrienne, she must have really been impressed. I hear she now lives in 
Redondo, near the pier.

 Tony's on the Pier is at 210 Fisherman's Wharf, Redondo Beach. (310) 374-9246.

 L et 'em run wild.  
</P>
<P>
 If those aren't exactly the words South Bay prep football coaches would use to 
describe their offenses in 1994, they'll do for a theme. 
</P>
<P>
 And as any coach could tell you, the theme this season was the running game. 
The forward pass became almost an afterthought as area teams found success with 
the most basic of football exchanges, the handoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's penchant for staying on the ground is reflected on The Times' South 
Bay All-Star team, which includes three running backs, one more than usual, and 
a quarterback known more for keeping the ball than passing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches, all of whom were asked 
to participate, and a poll of Times sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Players named to the 23-player first team, along with their parents and 
coaches, will be guests of The Times at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at 
the Guest Quarters Hotel in Santa Monica. The winners of the South Bay back, 
lineman and coach of the year awards will be announced at the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula, which led the area with 3,845 yards rushing, an average of 296 a 
game, tops the all-star squad with five selections. The Panthers (11-2), who 
lost to Antelope Valley in the Southern Section Division II semifinals last 
week, are represented by quarterback Peter Krogh, running back Petros 
Papadakis, center Jeremy Sparling, defensive tackle Clark Haggans and kicker 
Daniel Secrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra placed three players on the team, and Banning, Carson, Leuzinger, Mira 
Costa and South Torrance are each represented by two players. Mira Costa (12-1) 
will try to win a second consecutive Division VII title Saturday night when it 
meets Arroyo Grande (11-1) at Righetti High in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 The three repeat all-star selections are El Segundo defensive tackle Matt 
Jasik, Leuzinger linebacker Aaron Williams and Carson safety Joseph Redmond. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a position-by-position look at The Times' 1994 All-South Bay team: 
WIDE RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lennox (San Pedro) -- Lennox, one of the heroes of San Pedro's victory 
over Fremont in the 1993 City Section 3-A Division final, returned for his 
senior season with greater responsibilities. He responded by catching 28 passes 
for 428 yards and two touchdowns, excelling at free safety and serving as 
backup quarterback. He was a two-time All-Southern League choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Omarr Smith (Bishop Montgomery) -- Smith was the most consistent offensive 
threat for the Knights, leading the area with 45 catches for 594 yards and 
eight touchdowns. He also returned a punt for a touchdown, and scored at least 
once in each of the first eight games. He was named All-Mission League. 
OFFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lalau (Banning) -- A three-year starter at guard, Lalau teamed with 
tackle Fa'aesea Mailo on the right side to help Banning rush for nearly 2,000 
yards. Lalau, a team leader who called the blocking assignments at the line of 
scrimmage, was named All-Pacific League for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy McDaniel (South Torrance) -- A unanimous All-Ocean League selection, 
McDaniel was a force at right tackle and helped the Spartans average more than 
200 yards rushing a game. "Agile, strong and a great puller," South Coach Mike 
Christensen said of his best lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Pollard (Serra) -- The Mission League lineman of the year, Pollard was a 
two-way starter at tackle who almost never came off the field. He was graded 
the highest among Serra's blockers and had 98 tackles and six sacks. Because of 
his above-average speed, Pollard is mainly being recruited for defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Ega Usu (Leuzinger) -- "Everybody wants him," Leuzinger Coach Fred Boehm said 
of the highly recruited Usu, whose blocking at right tackle helped the 
Olympians average nearly 300 yards rushing a game. Usu, a two-time All-Bay 
League choice, is looking at USC, UCLA, Brigham Young and Arizona, among 
others. CENTER 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Sparling (Peninsula) -- The anchor of an outstanding offensive line, 
Sparling toiled in the shadows of Peninsula's skill-position players but was 
considered just as valuable by Panther coaches. He called the blocking schemes 
at the line of scrimmage and also was the deep snapper on kicks. On defense, 
Sparling played inside linebacker and was a team leader in tackles. A good 
student, Sparling is interested in attending Stanford. QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Krogh (Peninsula) -- If you were taking bets before the season, you 
would have gotten long odds on Krogh being named Bay League most valuable 
player. But after an uneventful junior season, Krogh emerged as a dangerous 
option quarterback and earned the MVP award after leading Peninsula to an 
unbeaten league season. He rushed for 792 yards and 16 touchdowns, averaging 
eight yards a carry, and completed 50 of 89 passes (56%) for 742 yards and five 
touchdowns, with only three interceptions. RUNNING BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Campbell (Torrance) -- "He was our backbone," Torrance Coach Rock Hollis 
said of Campbell, who shouldered the weight of the offense by rushing for 1,518 
yards and 10 touchdowns in 11 games. The bruising fullback rushed for more than 
100 yards in all but two games and twice went over the 200-yard mark, with a 
high of 285 against West Torrance. He averaged 9.3 yards a carry. "He'd put his 
head down and go at them, not around them," Hollis said. Campbell, an All-Bay 
League choice, also contributed as a kicker and punter. He had four field 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Fikes (Mira Costa) -- No South Bay player has gobbled up more ground 
this season than Fikes, who has accounted for 2,511 all-purpose yards heading 
into Saturday's Division VII final. Possessing speed and power, the senior 
tailback has rushed for 1,905 yards and 20 touchdowns, caught 12 passes for 272 
yards and one touchdown, and returned kickoffs and punts for 334 yards and one 
touchdown. In addition, Fikes has played quarterback when the team has run the 
option, and he has started at cornerback throughout the playoffs in place of 
injured Matt Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
 Petros Papadakis (Peninsula) -- An explosive runner with deceptive speed, 
Papadakis took his game to a new level as a senior. His long runs became a 
staple of Peninsula's offense as he rushed for an area-leading 2,001 yards and 
22 touchdowns, averaging 9.3 yards a carry. His 70-yard scoring run on the 
first play of scrimmage set the tone in the Panthers' first victory over 
Hawthorne, 44-14, and he rushed for 415 yards and four touchdowns in playoff 
victories over Canyon and Arcadia. Papadakis, named Bay League offensive player 
of the year, ranks first in area scoring with 138 points. KICKER 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Secrist (Peninsula) -- In addition to playing tight end and defensive 
end, Secrist distinguished himself as a kicker and punter. He kicked 40 extra 
points and seven field goals, with a long of 49 yards against Hawthorne, and 
averaged 40 yards in 29 punts. DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Jasik (El Segundo) -- What do coaches think of the quick, aggressive 
Jasik? Consider: El Segundo was 2-10 in league play over the past two seasons, 
but Jasik was chosen co-defensive player of the year each time. He shared the 
award this season in the Ocean League with Redondo lineman Jack Mitchell. Jasik 
led El Segundo with 71 tackles, 13 sacks and eight blocked kicks (five extra 
points and three punts), giving him 14 blocks in two seasons. Because of his 
size, Jasik will probably play linebacker or safety in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark Haggans (Peninsula) -- A two-time All-Bay League selection, Haggans 
ranked among the leaders in tackles, sacks and fumble recoveries for a 
Peninsula defense that gave up an average of nine points a game. His strength 
and quickness also were apparent at tight end. Utilized mostly as a blocker, 
Haggans was a big-play receiver with nine catches for 246 yards (a 27.3-yard 
average) and two TDs, one in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 John Toavalu (Banning) -- A disruptive force, Toavalu capped a three-year 
varsity career by dominating offensive linemen and stuffing ballcarriers. He 
finished among team leaders in tackles and sacks, despite playing on a bad 
ankle for most of the season. "John plays at one speed, and that's 110%," 
Banning defensive coordinator Ken Stumpf said. "It's too bad he's not 6-3, 
because he could play this game for a long time." Stumpf said Toavalu is being 
recruited by several schools, including Colorado State. LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
 Fa'avae Fa'avae (Carson) -- It's easy to see why Fa'avae is revered by 
everyone at Carson High. He's the student body president. He carries a 3.9 
grade-point average. And he's a record-setting football player. Fa'avae 
established a school benchmark with 174 tackles this season and, in the 
process, broke a Carson record that had stood for 21 years. His 315 career 
tackles eclipsed the previous record of 263 set by Rowen Tupuivao in 1972-73. 
Fa'avae was named All-Pacific League for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Hughes (Mira Costa) -- The catalyst of Mira Costa's big-play defense, 
Hughes leads the area with a school-record 24 sacks entering the Division VII 
final Saturday. The speedy outside linebacker also ranks among team leaders 
with 64 tackles and three forced fumbles. "It's outrageous what Dennis has 
done," Mira Costa Coach Don Morrow said. On offense, Hughes plays fullback and 
ranks second on the team in rushing (538 yards) and receiving (21 catches for 
301 yards), with 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wiley (Serra) -- Runner-up for Mission League player of the year, Wiley 
led an aggressive defense with 176 tackles, helping Serra reach the Division 
III semifinals. He had three interceptions. Utilized at fullback late in the 
season, Wiley rushed for 242 yards and four touchdowns. His size, strength and 
speed have made him a hot commodity with recruiters. A Serra assistant said 
Wiley is leaning toward UCLA but considering other schools as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Williams (Leuzinger) -- One of the area's most physically imposing 
players, Williams was the centerpiece of Leuzinger's defense and led the 
Olympians in tackles for the second consecutive season. He was named Bay League 
defensive player of the year. Williams, a three-year varsity starter, added 
playing fullback to his responsibilities this season and rushed for more than 
1,000 yards and 14 touchdowns. He visited Arizona last weekend but is said to 
be leaning toward USC. DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Kelvin Hunter (Hawthorne) -- Hunter ended his three-year varsity career with 
16 interceptions, certainly one of the highest totals in South Bay history. He 
returned two of his four interceptions in 1994 for touchdowns, and ranked among 
team leaders with 73 tackles playing cornerback and free safety. Hunter 
contributed offensively as a receiver and kick returner, accounting for 933 
all-purpose yards and six touchdowns. He has recruiting trips planned to 
Illinois, Nebraska, Texas, Arizona and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvyn Miller (South Torrance) -- South Coach Mike Christensen says there's a 
good reason Miller had only one interception this season: "Teams wouldn't throw 
his way." That's understandable. Miller, who played cornerback, is regarded as 
a top college prospect. He takes his first recruiting trip this weekend to 
Washington, and is also looking at California and Arizona, among others. Miller 
also was a leader on offense for South, accounting for 1,133 total yards and 12 
TDs playing quarterback and tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Redmond (Carson) -- The highly recruited Redmond contributed on both 
sides of the ball for Carson. At safety, he had 49 tackles, two interceptions, 
two fumble recoveries and four pass deflections. As a running back, he became 
the 10th player in school history to gain more than 1,000 all-purpose yards in 
two consecutive seasons, finishing with 1,154 yards rushing, receiving and 
returning kicks. He scored nine touchdowns. Among the schools interested in 
Redmond are USC and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Ademole Turner (Serra) -- A speedy, hard-hitting cornerback, Turner was a 
unanimous All-Mission League choice. He led the area with 10 interceptions, 
three he returned for touchdowns, and ranked second on the Cavaliers with 104 
tackles. His 82-yard interception return for a touchdown helped Serra beat 
Rowland, 19-10, in the Division III quarterfinals. A parttime running back, 
Turner rushed for 367 yards and four touchdowns.

 RETURN TRIP 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most difficult feats in sports is repeating as champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Don Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mira Costa High football coach has felt the strain of living up to 
expectations, mainly his own, as the Mustangs have battled adversity to reach 
the Southern Section Division VII final for the second year in a row. Mira 
Costa (12-1), the 1993 champion, plays Arroyo Grande (11-1) in the title game 
at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Righetti High in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've felt a lot more pressure this year trying to get back to the level (of 
play) we wanted to be at," Morrow said. "We had a better team last year. It's 
been a struggle for us in a lot of games this season. We've never been in a 
comfortable situation at any point in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that makes Mira Costa's appearance in the final all the more 
remarkable. The Mustangs don't have the array of offensive weapons they did 
last season and have been forced to rely on their defense in most games. The 
defense came through again last week in a 16-7 semifinal victory over Lompoc, 
as Jason Hughes' 77-yard interception return for a touchdown turned out to be 
the pivotal play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs have given up a stingy average of 10 points a game, despite 
losing two of their best players before the season when fullback-nose tackle 
Phil Fonua suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm and receiver-cornerback Dino 
Rossi underwent surgery for a torn knee ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no telling how good Mira Costa would have been with those guys. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes adversity has a way of bringing a team closer together. And 
there's no substitute for the confidence that comes with winning. Mira Costa's 
seniors have enjoyed success on all levels, going 9-1 in back-to-back seasons 
on the freshman and sophomore teams and 13-1 during last season's championship 
run. That's 43-4 in four years, including 25-2 in varsity play. 
</P>
<P>
 So, despite their lack of offensive weapons (tailback Michael Fikes is the 
workhorse), their inexperience at quarterback (sophomore Kevin Cooper was a 
midseason replacement for an ineffective senior), and their lack of size on 
defense (the unit frequently operates with no players weighing more than 200 
pounds), the Mustangs do have some intangibles in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow hopes he can harness them for one more game. NO-NAME DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 We're not sure what was going through the minds of Ocean League coaches when 
they selected the all-league defense, but it wasn't good. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa, despite having the league's best defense, had no players chosen to 
the first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow probably hurt his cause by nominating multiple players at certain 
positions, such as linebacker, but someone should have made it from a team that 
limited five of seven league opponents to seven points or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The most glaring oversights were outside linebacker Dennis Hughes, who leads 
the South Bay with 24 sacks, and inside linebacker Ricky Saunders, who has more 
than 150 tackles this season. Both were second-team selections. PUNCHED OUT 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, El Camino College football Coach John Featherstone compared 
Saturday's Southern California Bowl between the offensive-minded Warriors and 
equally potent College of the Desert to a heavyweight fight. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino landed plenty of punches but absorbed even more punishment in 
losing, 59-48, in a wild, four-hour game that saw the teams combine for 1,270 
total yards and 42 penalties totaling 460 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Featherstone said both schools are considering writing letters to Foothill 
Conference administrators to complain about the heavy-handed officiating. One 
controversial call was especially damaging to El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 After cutting a 38-14 halftime deficit to 45-42, El Camino appeared to recover 
the ball at the Desert 10-yard line early in the fourth quarter after Desert 
muffed a punt. But an official ruled that during the scramble for the ball an 
El Camino defender had intentionally batted the ball forward, which is illegal. 
The 15-yard penalty gave Desert a first down, and three plays later it scored a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Featherstone, after reviewing the game video, said it did not appear that the 
ball was batted intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just looks like the momentum of two huge bodies colliding forces the ball 
to come squirting out," he said. "I think we would have blown them out if it 
wasn't for the penalty. We had all the momentum, and that killed it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors finished the season 9-2, but not before quarterback Steve 
Sarkisian, named to the J.C. Grid-Wire All-American first team, capped a 
brilliant two-year career by completing 41 of 61 passes for 645 yards and four 
touchdowns. The yardage total broke his single-game school record of 481 yards 
set earlier this season, but is not considered official because it occurred in 
a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Featherstone said Sarkisian's effort will go in the record book anyway, 
accompanied by an asterisk. DEAD END 
</P>
<P>
 Question of the week: What happened to Peninsula? 
</P>
<P>
 After steamrollering opponents for 10 consecutive weeks, the Panthers hit a 
brick wall Friday in a 28-0 loss to Antelope Valley in the Division II 
semifinals. It was the first time Peninsula was shut out in 48 games, since the 
school opened in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Gary Kimbrell could have blamed four turnovers, one that was returned 
for a touchdown, but he gave most of the credit to Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a team that was defensively just relentless," he said. "They were 
as quick a group as I've ever seen. It was sort of deja vu of the Mira Costa 
game (a 9-6 loss). We couldn't get anything going. Defensively, we actually 
played well enough to win. They only got 180 yards against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbrell said Peninsula's offense was hindered by a second-quarter injury to 
quarterback Peter Krogh, who suffered a broken little finger on his left, 
non-passing hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fingernail was ripped off and it was bleeding like mad," Kimbrell said. 
"But he never said anything. He just wrapped it up and kept playing. He 
mishandled a couple of balls from center. (The injury) may have had something 
to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbrell said Krogh's determination was typical of his team, which stayed 
focused the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some real good kids," he said. "They're smart kids and they're tough, 
and they have a lot of humility. When you have smart, tough kids, you can 
accomplish a lot." LONG MEMORIES 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar drew motivation from last season's 22-21 loss to Carson in the City 
Section 4-A Division semifinals to defeat the Colts, 27-19, Friday and advance 
to the division final. 
</P>
<P>
 "We practiced with 22-21 on the scoreboard all week," said Sylmar running back 
Durell Price, who rushed for 237 yards and four touchdowns. "I couldn't get it 
out of my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (13-0) will play Crenshaw (12-1) for a title at noon Saturday at El 
Camino College. HOOPING IT UP 
</P>
<P>
 * Two of Southern California's top prep basketball teams, featuring two of the 
nation's top players, will meet Friday night when Inglewood plays its season 
opener at Westchester (1-0). Inglewood is led by senior forward Paul Pierce, a 
preseason All-American. Westchester, ranked 19th in the nation by USA Today,

PEOPLE: U.S. BARS RUSSIAN WOMAN'S VISIT TO AILING GRANDMOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tatiana Snihur wants to travel from Kiev to Torrance to see her grandmother 
one last time. But the U.S. Embassy won't let her enter the country.  
</P>
<P>
 After her mother died of cancer, Snihur was raised in Kiev by her grandmother, 
Nadia Petrova, and the two have an unusually strong bond, family members say. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrova, 72, is now in a Torrance retirement home, with terminal emphysema. 
Her dying wish is to see her granddaughter. But Snihur has been denied a 
visitor's visa four times, according to family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretaries in the U.S. Embassy in Kiev reportedly told Snihur, 20, that a 
grandmother is not a close enough relative to warrant a visitor's visa. Snihur 
might receive a visa only to attend her grandmother's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this is no ordinary grandmother-granddaughter relationship, family 
members say. 
</P>
<P>
 Snihur's mother, Anna, died of cancer in 1987, possibly due to complications 
arising from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. Snihur's father 
left the family shortly after the cancer diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became a parent" to Snihur, said Petrova in Ukrainian, as a daughter 
translated. "I was raising her. I was nourishing her." 
</P>
<P>
 But embassy officials here say that the bond between family members is not a 
deciding factor when granting visas. While officials cannot address specific 
cases, nor confirm the number of times Snihur may have applied for a visa, they 
say that foreign service officers in U.S. embassies abroad must assure that 
foreign nationals will return home. "That's the key," said spokeswoman Nyda 
Butic. 
</P>
<P>
 And visa applicants such as Snihur may have little incentive to return home, 
says another consular spokesman. "Very often, when you get a young person, they 
have no particular career ties, which are the best ties," said Richard 
Williams, chief of public affairs in the Bureau of Consular Affairs. "She 
probably is of an age where her parents no longer provide a strong tie to 
return, and she has no other family of her own yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, U.S. embassies in 1993 turned down nearly one of every four people 
who asked for a visitor's visa, Butic said. In Kiev this year, the number of 
applicants denied was greater than one in three. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Palos Verdes Estates resident Valentina Bier -- Petrova's daughter 
and Snihur's aunt -- is crusading to get Snihur a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 Bier argues that although Snihur is not married, her incentive to return to 
Kiev includes a two-room condominium she owns and a job as a computer 
programmer with a company that makes film equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bier has appealed to California's senators and to U.S. Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills). A representative of Sen. Barbara Boxer sent a Nov. 2 letter 
to the U.S. Consul in Kiev on behalf of Snihur, but Bier says her niece was 
denied a visa for the fourth time on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the power to grant the visa," said a spokeswoman in Boxer's 
office. "But we can highlight the case so it doesn't get lost in the shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
 Bier says her mother came here six years ago to visit but her emphysema flared 
up and stopped her from returning home. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrova, who speaks no English, is connected to an oxygen machine 24 hours a 
day. Bier says that without U.S. medical care, her mother probably would have 
died long ago.  
</P>
<P>
 But now Petrova would like nothing more than to see her granddaughter. "It's 
the one wish I have," she said.

SUBWAY RIDERS MARK ANNIVERSARY OF MASSACRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bouquets of flowers and Christmas wreaths lined the fences Wednesday of the 
Long Island Rail Road stop where a train gunman's massacre a year ago ended 
with six commuters dead and 19 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some survivors of the attack on Dec. 7, 1993, said they rode the same train, 
the 5:33 p.m., to the same stop, Garden City, as a way to mark the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing continued Wednesday on whether the accused gunman, Colin Ferguson, 
is competent to stand trial. Ferguson didn't appear; he told the judge Tuesday 
that he expected to be ill. When the judge asked if it had anything to do with 
the anniversary, he nodded yes. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Ferguson allegedly got up in the third car of the train as it 
approached Garden City and began firing a semiautomatic pistol.

BUMPER CROP OF SPEEDING TICKETS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE CHP, CONCERNED ABOUT 
EXCESSIVE SPEEDS ON INTERSTATE 5 IN SOUTH COUNTY, ISSUES 300 TO 400 CITATIONS 
IN 8 1/2 HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A task force of California Highway Patrol officers -- some volunteering for 
special shifts -- issued speeding tickets by the hundreds Wednesday to early 
morning commuters in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable," said Leanne Meissner, one of those ticketed on 
Interstate 5 between Oso Parkway and Cristianitos Road. "It was like crows on 
dead meat. It was just like a slaughter. People were stacked up along the side 
of the road; I find it highly ironic that it was happening the day after Orange 
County declares bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the CHP targeted both sides of the freeway from Junipero Serra 
Road to the San Diego County line, from 6:30 a.m. until 3 p.m., according to 
Officer Bruce Lian, who helped issue between 300 and 400 citations for speeding 
and seat belt violations. In all, 15 patrol cars were used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking at the accident and speed problem for the past year," Lian 
said. "Things have always had a tendency to be fast and wide open down here." 
</P>
<P>
 Accidents connected to speeding have been exacerbated by highway construction, 
Lian said, which in some areas has eliminated center dividers and shoulders. Of 
particular concern is the southbound grade in San Clemente, where the average 
speed exceeds 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the physics involved," Lian said, "your ability to recover in a 
bad situation -- a blowout or an unexpected lane change -- is greatly 
diminished." 
</P>
<P>
 CHP volunteers worked adjusted shifts to participate in the ticketing, said 
Lian, because there was no money in the budget for overtime. Earlier this year, 
the CHP mounted a similar effort in South County but paid for the overtime with 
a federal grant that targets dangerous freeway areas. More than 400 tickets 
were issued in fours hours in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just amazing," recalled CHP Officer Angel Johnson. "But the next day 
people were driving a lot slower. . . . We need to do that to get people to 
learn to slow down. We call it an education." 
</P>
<P>
 Lian said that in the past, "99% of our responses from the public has been 
positive" to CHP anti-speeding operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Leanne Meissner, who commutes daily from San Diego County to Newport Beach, 
counted herself among the other 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 While sympathetic to the goal of highway safety, she said the CHP "could also 
have done some sort of publicity campaign, put forth some sort of effort to 
warn people." 
</P>
<P>
 Regular commuters, she said, "are familiar with the regular flow of traffic, 
it's a pace they're used to."

FBI INVESTIGATES POLICE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH; GOVERNMENT: THE PROBE FOLLOWS 
CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINTS THAT OFFICERS REACTED WITH ABUSIVE FORCE DURING ROWDY 
FOURTH OF JULY FESTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The FBI is investigating civil rights complaints about police conduct during 
an unruly Fourth of July celebration, a bureau official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Kelly, supervising agent for civil rights in the FBI's Santa Ana 
bureau, said his office three weeks ago began investigating the Police 
Department's handling of the July 4 melee that occurred downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how long it will take," Kelly said, adding the Justice 
Department will decide whether to broaden the preliminary investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials defended the department's actions, in which police 
dealt with revelers who burned furniture in the streets and also hurled 
firecrackers, bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 people were arrested in the downtown area during the last two 
days of the long weekend. Citywide, 139 arrests were made for a variety of 
offenses, including public drunkenness, resisting arrest and failure to 
disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of those arrested claimed police beat and roughed them up during the 
melee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police were more out of control than the crowd," said Michael Brian 
Fitzgerald, a 40-year-old software engineer who was cited for failing to 
disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed to be the people looking for trouble," Fitzgerald said after 
being released from jail in July. He said he was running down an alley to 
escape the mayhem when he was cornered by five officers with batons who threw 
him to the ground and struck him several times. 
</P>
<P>
 David Long, a 23-year-old Huntington Beach resident, said he was caught in a 
crowd that was igniting fireworks in the streets and an officer struck him 
twice in the legs with a billy club. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman John Hoos said a preliminary investigation was requested by the 
Justice Department. Results of that investigation will be sent to the 
Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, as well as to the U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles. "They will decide whether the FBI will continue to a 
full investigation into this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoos said news reports about the alleged civil rights violations prompted the 
Justice Department to call for the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City Councilman Ralph Bauer, who was downtown on the Fourth 
of July, said what he saw was "police keeping order." 
</P>
<P>
 "People were setting fires in the middle of 11th and Orange, people were 
setting off fireworks, it was frankly, a lawless crowd," he said, adding that 
police did their job to "keep the peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said downtown residents were frightened about the large crowds of youths 
and the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our objective to make people feel safe in their homes," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said the city does not think the investigation is "going to come to 
much, but if we've done something wrong, I'm sure we will correct it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another council member, David Sullivan, welcomed the investigation, saying it 
"should clear the air." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really know anything about the FBI investigation," said Police Lt. 
Chuck Poe. "We got a courtesy call from them two or three weeks ago. That's all 
we know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said his officers acted "quickly and 
decisively" in keeping down injuries and property damage, in contrast to 
earlier holidays when matters got out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have received seven civilian complaints, Poe said. In four of those 
cases, he said, there was not enough information to evaluate their merits. In 
two of the cases, the police found the charges unfounded, and one case has yet 
to be decided.

REHABILITATION IS SOUGHT FOR 3 TAY MURDERERS; COURTS: THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT 
RECOMMENDS SENDING THE CONVICTED TEEN-AGE KILLERS TO THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH 
AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Probation Department report recommends rehabilitation, not prison, for three 
teen-agers convicted of brutally murdering honors student Stuart A. Tay in 
1992, defense attorneys said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report prepared for Friday's sentencing hearing, the Orange County 
Probation Department supports sending the convicted teen-age murderers to the 
California Youth Authority, where they must be released upon turning 25, 
according to two defense attorneys in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Mun Bong Kang, 18, of Fullerton face 
possible sentences of life in prison without parole. Kirn Kim, 18, also of 
Fullerton, faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 They and two other teen-agers were convicted of ambushing Tay on New Year's 
Eve because they believed he was going to double-cross them in a planned 
robbery of a computer-parts dealer. The robbery never took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was especially shocking because the teen-age assailants were mostly 
exceptional youths from loving homes. It was revealed at trial that the killers 
carefully plotted the ambush attack, even going so far as to rehearse their 
respective roles shortly before the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, 17, of Orange, was beaten with baseball bats and a sledgehammer before he 
was forced to drink rubbing alcohol. His nose and mouth were taped shut and he 
was placed in a shallow grave in Acosta's back yard, where his corpse was later 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta and Kim were convicted at trial of first-degree murder. Kang pleaded 
guilty to first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Probation Department prepares sentencing recommendations in all murder 
cases, but Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary is not bound 
by them. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum declined Wednesday to discuss the report 
but said he plans to argue for prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg, said her client 
"shouldn't be sent to prison." She argued at trial that Acosta is brain-damaged 
and was easily led by others to participate in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Ronald G. Brower, who is representing Kang, said he hopes O'Leary 
will agree with the Probation Department's recommendation for his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's defense attorney could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two assailants already have been sentenced. Robert Chan, 20, a 
onetime candidate for class valedictorian at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole 
for orchestrating the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Choe, 19, of Fullerton admitted his role in the slaying and agreed to 
be the prosecution's chief witness against the other teen-agers. In exchange, 
the Orange County district attorney's office prosecuted him as a juvenile, 
which means Choe will be released from the California Youth Authority when he 
turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Chan, all the youths were juveniles at the time of the killing. And 
all except Choe were tried as adults.

BROKEN PIPE LEAVES CITY HALL SOAKING WET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new City Council was figuratively and almost literally wet behind the ears 
early Wednesday when a water line broke at city hall, flooding offices and 
sending firefighters scrambling to clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaware that water was pouring into the main conference room and community 
development and finance department offices at the rear of the building, the 
newly sworn-in council labored steadily over its first meeting, a packed-agenda 
extravaganza that began Tuesday night and concluded at 2:23 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The broken four-inch line, which apparently spouted water for about half an 
hour starting at midnight, was discovered by City Manager Kenneth C. Frank, who 
alerted police and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 As calamities go in Laguna Beach -- a city plagued by landslides, mudflows and 
a massive firestorm over the past 14 months -- this latest misfortune 
registered a mere blip on the disaster scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Brandt, director of municipal services, said that city employees were 
able to get right to work when they arrived at their soggy offices Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of our first assessment, we don't see any computer damage or 
anything like that," Brandt said. "The main problem will be with drying or 
replacing the carpet, and that's what we're looking at now." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Laguna Beach County Water District, which immediately 
shut off the water, identified the broken water pipe and repaired it by noon 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found the break, put a clamp around it and everything's back in service," 
water district engineer Jim Nestor said. There was no immediate estimate for 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Verna L. Rollinger said council members were unaware of the problem 
until they realized community development director Kyle Butterwick, whose 
offices were among the hardest hit, had left council chambers and was unable to 
present an agenda item. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular business had been delayed Tuesday night for an emotional ceremony 
honoring departing council members Robert F. Gentry and Lida Lenney and Mayor 
Ann Christoph. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming council members Wayne J. Baglin, Steve Dicterow and Paul Freeman were 
greeted with cheers, balloons and an overloaded agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 As Tuesday rolled into Wednesday, the weary new council simply plodded on, 
finally calling a special meeting for Tuesday at 7 p.m. to complete its work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already had more than we could handle," Rollinger said.

MIRACLE OF BIRTHS; WOMAN DEFIES ODDS ASSOCIATED WITH RARE DISEASE -- TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For 13 years, Shelley Ybarra has been living with Wegener's granulomatosis, a 
rare, progressive disease that eats away normal tissue and has collapsed most 
of her respiratory system, making even a climb up a flight of stairs difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told Ybarra, who takes daily medication that can cause infertility, 
that she would never be able to have children. But the Irvine woman defied 
astronomical odds for the second time just after Thanksgiving when she gave 
birth to a healthy boy 15 months after delivering his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 According to experts with the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., 
fewer than 20 U.S. women with Wegener's disease have ever become pregnant, and 
fewer than 10 have succeeded in giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were completely shocked when we found out I was pregnant again," the 
27-year-old woman said. "We cried because we were so happy for this second 
miracle. But we were scared and not sure whether the baby would be healthy."

 Doctors gave Ybarra only a 50% chance of surviving either pregnancy and said 
her medication could jeopardize both children's health. When Ybarra and her 
second husband married two years ago, they considered adopting. But when the 
unexpected pregnancies came, they decided they were blessings worth the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought even if the baby wasn't going to be 100% healthy, we would still 
love it," said Ybarra's husband, Peter. "We felt this was a second gift from 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 An autoimmune system disorder, Wegener's granulomatosis affects an estimated 
two or three of every 100,000 people, according to medical authorities. It can 
cause inflammation in a variety of tissues, causing damage by restricting blood 
flow, primarily in the respiratory tract and kidneys. The disease can occur at 
any age among both men and women. It is not hereditary and its cause is 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious disease," said Dr. Michael Sneller, head of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "The body essentially attacks 
itself and is susceptible to infection." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ybarra was 14, she began suffering severe flu-like symptoms, such as 
persistent coughing and bloody noses. Because a treatment for Wegener's was 
discovered just 10 years ago, she shuffled between half a dozen doctors after 
her condition was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ybarra's condition worsened over the years, leading to temporary loss of 
sight, smell and taste. She later developed permanent arthritis, hearing loss 
and major lesions in her lungs that restricted her breathing capacity. She now 
wears hearing aids and becomes short of breath after merely walking to a 
neighbor's house.  
</P>
<P>
 "My trachea is so small, it's like breathing through a straw," Ybarra said 
with a soft wheeze in her voice.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have no immune system. People think I'm a germ freak because I wash my 
hands often and am very careful about sharing drinks. But I have to take care 
of myself and my children. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one else should shoulder my worries. I don't want to be a burden to my 
family," she added, while feeding her newborn son, Alex, who weighed 7 pounds, 
10 ounces at birth on Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple activities are tiresome and even impossible for Ybarra. No longer can 
she enjoy a swim at the beach or a bike ride through town.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I see the water and I just want to dive into it. I miss that. I 
can't even take walks around the park," Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shelley Ybarra is never short of energy and spirit, said her mother, Lynda 
Joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I even have a cold, I get grumpy. In Shelley Ybarra's condition, she is 
sick every day of her life. But she never complains. She lives every day to the 
fullest," Joy said. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent further damage to her weakened immune and respiratory systems, 
Ybarra takes Imuran, a drug that induces sterility in 60% of patients with 
Wegener's disease, NIH experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, Ybarra and her mother traveled between half a dozen 
hospitals, only to be told there was no hope for children and a future. But 
then, during her first marriage, Ybarra and her husband conceived a child. She 
lost the child 12 weeks later when she miscarried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that pregnancy was a fluke," Ybarra said.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the miscarriage, her first husband left her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ybarra said she has accepted the limitations the disease places on her. She 
continues to work two jobs -- as a sales representative for a label company and 
as an assistant at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian's clinic in Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 She met Peter Ybarra four years ago, and the couple married in 1992. Peter 
Ybarra said his wife's disease never stopped them from planning a family. They 
were set on adopting a child until 15 months ago, when Ybarra became pregnant 
with her first son, Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very doubtful about her first (positive) pregnancy. She had a lot of 
problems and could only breathe with half a lung for herself and her baby," 
said Dr. Craig Towers, a high-risk pregnancy specialist. "But it turned out to 
be a great success. She's someone I am always going to remember, because she 
probably will be the only Wegener's patient I will ever treat." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertain of how long her health will hold up, Shelley Ybarra said she can 
only live from day to day. She is both cautious and confident about her 
family's future.  
</P>
<P>
 "What scares me most is to know that I may completely lose my hearing and 
never be able to hear my kids call for me," Ybarra said, as her husband sat 
beside her, sobbing. "But having the children were the most joyous moments in 
my life. Things can only get better with these two kids in the world."

WEEDING OUT OF SIMPSON JURORS BEGINS; TRIAL: TWO ALTERNATES ARE ALLOWED TO 
LEAVE. THEN A LENGTHY CONFERENCE BETWEEN JUDGE AND LAWYERS BRINGS PROCESS TO A 
HALT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing in on the end of a process that began more than two months ago, the 
judge and lawyers in the O.J. Simpson murder trial completed their questioning 
of alternate juror candidates Wednesday and began weeding out the group of 
panelists who have come this far. 
</P>
<P>
 Two prospective alternate jurors were allowed to leave, and then Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito huddled with the attorneys in a long, private 
conference. After conferring for more than an hour, Ito told most of the 54 
remaining jurors and alternate jury candidates that they could go home for the 
day and return this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues that have come up, and I have to deal with, are relatively 
complex," Ito said. "I anticipate that I will spend the rest of the afternoon 
dealing with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not specify what the issues were, but a source close to the case said 
they were related to allegations that at least one member of the jury panel may 
have been guilty of misconduct -- a broad charge that can include anything from 
improper contact with attorneys to inadvertent exposure to publicity involving 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito closed his courtroom for the hearing and excused most of the 
panel for the day, he did ask five panelists to remain. The five included three 
members of the jury itself and two prospective alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, both of those potential alternates were excused as 
well, emerging from the secretive hearing with little comment on what had 
transpired. That left a pool of 40 under consideration for possible service. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanticipated hearing ground the process to a halt, as surprise 
developments have done time and again since jury selection began Sept. 26. 
Because of the latest glitch, the two sides failed to settle on a dozen 
alternate jurors who will be called into action if any of the panel's original 
12 members are excused between now and the end of the trial, in which the 
football Hall of Famer is charged with killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. Simpson has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and the attorneys will return to court this morning in the hope of 
concluding jury selection, which Ito has called the most difficult and delicate 
task confronting him as he oversees the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can finish that this morning, the judge and lawyers will move to 
consideration of several legal issues, one of which could alter the composition 
of the jury panel almost as soon as it is seated. Ito has scheduled a hearing 
for today to consider possible juror misconduct, apparently a continuation of 
the session that he began Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said in court earlier this week that "we may 
be losing someone from our panel of 12." 
</P>
<P>
 Although both sides have long feared that some panelists would be lost by the 
time the case is over, few had expected the attrition to begin so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the two sides could begin exercising their peremptory challenges 
for alternate jury candidates Wednesday, several panelists asked to be excused. 
One prospective alternate announced that she had written to the judge to 
explain why she should not remain on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 That woman, a 53-year-old telephone company employee from Compton, was one of 
the five panelists asked to stay after the rest of the group had been allowed 
to go home for the day. She ultimately was excused, declining to comment in 
detail as she left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stressful to me," the woman said. "This is for someone who doesn't have 
a life. I have a life." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said in court she recently had been approached by a friend who asked 
her why Judge Ito agreed to give a televised interview even as he was 
dismissing potential jurors for being exposed to media coverage of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably like my father: 'Do as I say to do, not as I do,' " the juror 
said she responded. She turned to Ito and added: "Sorry, judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito smiled and shrugged, declining to pursue the topic, which has become a 
source of embarrassment and has subjected him to withering criticism from a 
number of legal commentators. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wednesday's hearing did not conclude the jury selection process, it 
did provide each side with one last opportunity to speak to the jury candidates 
as a group -- all 12 of the original jurors and every potential alternate was 
in court -- and to emphasize particular elements of their cases that they want 
the jurors to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the jury selection process, prosecutors have tried to demonstrate 
to prospective jurors that circumstantial evidence need not be considered any 
less reliable than direct, eyewitness testimony. The prosecution case against 
Simpson is thought to rely heavily on circumstantial evidence such as the 
results of DNA tests that may link Simpson to the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 That testing has been under way for months, and at least one batch of tests is 
now all but complete, according to a Dec. 5 letter from Simpson lawyer Robert 
L. Shapiro addressed to Clark and Ito. In that letter, Shapiro wrote that PCR 
tests -- one type of DNA analysis -- have been completed at a Maryland 
laboratory and are "virtually complete" at a state Department of Justice 
laboratory in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tests probably will play a large role in the government case, and 
prosecutors have sought to impress upon jurors that circumstantial evidence 
from such results is in many ways just as reliable as eyewitness testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 To make that point, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman has occasionally 
employed a simple demonstration: On numerous occasions, he asked prospective 
jurors to watch as he held up a pen and then dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jury candidates could not see the pen hit the floor from where 
they sat, Hodgman noted that they could use their knowledge about the laws of 
gravity to conclude that the pen logically fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, however, Shapiro tried to subvert Hodgman's example by mimicking 
the demonstration. After dropping his own pen, Shapiro asked the jury 
candidates where it had landed. Several responded that it had hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shapiro reached down and emerged with a box, showing the members of the 
panel that the pen actually had landed in the container, not on the floor. 
Their misimpression, Shapiro said, illustrated the perils of relying on 
circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Clark dismissed Shapiro's demonstration as "this little trick" and 
accused Shapiro of trying to deceive the jury candidates. She also urged jurors 
to dismiss anything they have heard about the wildly speculative accounts of 
the murders that have dominated tabloid -- and some mainstream -- news coverage 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 When the attorneys reconvene in Ito's courtroom today, they hope to at last 
finish jury selection, a milestone that will allow the case to proceed to the 
next stage. Hearings on a jail visitation issue, as well as on the defense's 
objection to one prosecutor and on the jury misconduct issues, are set for 
today but could be delayed until Friday if they cannot settle on an alternate 
jury panel by lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides are trying to complete jury selection and discussion of those 
issues by week's end so that they can begin hearings next week on one of the 
case's most volatile topics. Defense attorneys have said Simpson never hit his 
wife and are objecting to the use of any evidence of "marital discord" by 
prosecutors trying to show that Simpson committed the June 12 murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors hope to submit at least some evidence of the relationship between 
the two. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, police went to Simpson's home, where they found him in the driveway 
and Nicole Simpson crying that he had shattered the window of her car. Four 
years later, Simpson pleaded no contest to charges of spousal battery, and in 
1993, police were summoned to Nicole Simpson's home when she called for help as 
a man she identified as her ex-husband was trying to force his way into her 
house.

REALTOR DESCRIBES TERROR AT KIDNAP TRIAL; COURT: PAULA HARRINGTON SAYS SHE WAS 
PARALYZED WITH FEAR FOR TWO DAYS WITH DEFENDANT, WHO SAID SHE JOINED HIM 
WILLINGLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Santa Clarita Valley woman testified Wednesday at the trial of a man accused 
of kidnaping her, saying that far from accompanying him willingly, she was so 
terrified that she pleaded for a few minutes' warning if he was going to kill 
her so she would have time to recite the Lord's Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be praying when I died," Paula D. Harrington told a jury as 
friends and relatives wept with her in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 During almost three hours of testimony, the former real estate agent said her 
alleged kidnaper, Timothy Daniel Shue, maintained tight control of her every 
move during the two days they were together by threatening her with a gun and 
with what she called "the look" -- which she described as a penetrating stare 
as he barked detailed instructions on her behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue's defense has been that she accompanied him of her own volition. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington testified that she was virtually paralyzed with fear as she 
obediently shopped and withdrew cash for Shue and submitted to sex with him. 
She said she never tried to escape, although she thought of it constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in shock, I was so scared," Harrington said. "It was in slow motion, 
one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington disappeared June 29 and was found two days later, bound and gagged 
but unharmed in a Gila Bend, Ariz., hotel. Shue, a convicted armed robber from 
Michigan, was arrested July 6 after showing off his handgun to an Ogden, Utah, 
stripper. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, 38, was charged with kidnaping Harrington, now 27, and using a firearm 
during the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Harrington's identification of Shue as her kidnaper, he left a 
fingerprint in their Arizona hotel room and he gave FBI agents a detailed 
confession, prosecutor Daniel P. Collins said during opening statements Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a surprise defense move, Shue's attorneys told the jury of 10 men and 
two women that an unhappily married Harrington had been a "willing companion" 
on a two-day fling aimed at teaching her husband a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 She had second thoughts only after Shue told her he was on parole, and she 
made up a tale of abduction and rape -- having him tie her up after their last 
night together -- to protect her reputation, said Deputy Federal Public 
Defender Neison M. Marks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trial's first day of testimony Wednesday, Harrington gave her side of 
the story in a dramatic account often punctuated with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the false name of Steve Sterling, an affable Shue pretended he was 
interested in buying a house and lured her -- she was then a real estate 
saleswoman -- to a remote Val Verde property, Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 After touring the home twice and complimenting the sunny master bathroom, Shue 
suddenly pulled a gun and growled at her: "Put your hands up, bitch!" 
Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 He hog-tied her, forced her into the rear compartment of his Jeep, and left 
with her on a surreal trip east, saying he had a fatal brain tumor and wanted 
to do some traveling before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 They stopped in Hacienda Heights, Redlands, Indio, the Salton Sea and Yuma, 
Ariz., before he finally spared her life and left her in Gila Bend, Harrington 
testified. Alternately fierce and tender, Shue threatened to kill her and 
anyone who tried to help her, Harrington said, yet he wiped her tears with a 
washcloth and bought her watermelon-flavored bubble gum, among other small 
kindnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his promises to free her as soon as she got him some money, Shue 
barricaded Harrington within a Best Western hotel room in Redlands their first 
night together, and he raped her after ordering her to drink champagne and 
model a pair of black fishnet stockings, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 She also told the jury she was terrified of being impregnated by Shue and wept 
bitterly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me, 'Did I hurt you?' " Harrington recalled. "And I said no, he 
didn't hurt me physically. He'd hurt my soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington also said she no longer works as a real estate agent because she is 
afraid to be alone with strangers. Her testimony was to continue today, with 
cross-examination by the defense.

VETS PROTEST VA HOSPITAL'S PROGRAM CUTS; HEALTH CARE: ABOUT 50 PICKET AGAINST 
SEPULVEDA'S TRANSFER OF SUBSTANCE-ABUSE AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Waving American flags and hand-made signs, about 50 veterans demonstrated 
outside the Sepulveda Veterans Administration medical center Wednesday to 
protest cuts in substance-abuse and psychiatric programs made after the complex 
was badly damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials last winter decided to demolish the Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center -- Sepulveda rather than spend an estimated $188 million to rebuild the 
431-bed facility. The hospital emergency room was closed and a number of 
inpatient programs were transferred to the larger West Los Angeles veterans 
medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 The VA plans to replace the Sepulveda center with a $53-million ambulatory 
care center that will offer a range of medical services, including outpatient 
surgery. Another $48 million will be spent on seismic improvements and repair 
work at Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 But many San Fernando Valley veterans complain it is hard for them to get to 
West Los Angeles and that the care is not as good there. They also worry that 
lives may be jeopardized by not having full emergency services at Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials at both medical centers insisted that no one's health has been 
harmed or jeopardized by the changes at Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not feel that lives have been endangered because we no longer have 
beds," said Dollie Whitehead, Sepulveda's associate director. 
</P>
<P>
 After the January earthquake, Sepulveda's inpatient programs in mental health 
and drug and alcohol abuse were transferred to West Los Angeles. Sepulveda 
continues to provide outpatient care in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But veterans who protested Wednesday said they faced overcrowding, staff 
indifference and canceled appointments at West Los Angeles, the biggest of the 
171 hospitals operated by the VA nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treat you like a number out there," said Dan Tinder, 45, a Vietnam 
veteran from Reseda who has been treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. 
"You're a nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrie E. Gogerty, a Van Nuys resident who served as an Army private in 
Saigon and was treated for alcoholism at Sepulveda, said its drug and alcohol 
recovery programs had an excellent reputation before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But without Sepulveda's weeklong detoxification program and related services, 
she said, Valley-area veterans who want to get sober may not be able to do so, 
a situation that could lead to continued substance abuse and some deaths, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogerty said many veterans with drug and drinking problems do not have cars 
and are in no condition to find their way to the West Los Angeles complex in 
Brentwood, about 16 miles south of the Sepulveda medical center along the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was such a wreck I couldn't find my way from my kitchen to the bathroom, 
let alone from Van Nuys to Brentwood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like you get on the freeway and drive there. . . . These people are 
down and out. They're homeless. They're wet-brained and incompetent. They've 
been sleeping under underpasses. They don't have the wherewithal for 
transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Gogerty said that while Sepulveda's substance abuse programs were on locked 
wards and involved intensive counseling and group discussions, the same 
programs at West Los Angeles are less structured, allowing addicted veterans to 
slip out and continue their drinking or drug-taking. 
</P>
<P>
 VA spokeswoman Harriett Bordenave acknowledged there is a two-week waiting 
list for veterans wanting to enter substance abuse programs at West Los 
Angeles. But she said veterans are receiving adequate care there. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Davis, consumer affairs officer at the West Los Angeles complex, said 
that while the hospital has flubbed some appointments with Valley-area 
veterans, "I don't get the sense it's a large problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs at West Los Angeles are 
just as comprehensive as at Sepulveda. Although West Los Angeles patients are 
not locked in, they can be dismissed from the program if they are inebriated, 
Bordenave said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bordenave also denied there is a lack of transportation for veterans between 
the Valley and West Los Angeles. The VA runs shuttles carrying 15 patients per 
week between the two facilities, and such rides are open to any Sepulveda 
patient, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously voted to hire a consultant to investigate whether 
cable television fees are too high. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday authorized spending $2,900 to hire a cable TV consultant 
who will examine records to see if local subscribers are paying "the lowest 
rate possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 Federal Cable Television Act allows cities with cable franchises to 
regulate the cost of "basic programming." 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation director Ron Kenny told the City Council that interpreting data 
from a cable firm about basic programming requires a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information is highly technical and requires advanced math," Kenny said. 
A consultant can interpret the technical data and determine whether a city's 
cable subscribers are paying too much for the basic level of service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is served by Copley/Colony Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action also authorized officials to negotiate with the cities of 
Cypress and Lakewood for a possible joint audit of Copley/Colony. BILL BILLITER

 Joe Erickson was unanimously elected as the city's mayor, replacing Sandra L. 
Genis, and Gary Monahan and incumbent Peter F. Buffa were sworn in as council 
members at this week's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Humphrey, who served on the council for four years, stepped down, leaving 
the council chambers to the tunes of two Scottish bagpipe performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey, a pharmaceutical salesman, was replaced by Monahan, the manager of 
Henry and Harry's Goathill Tavern, who garnered the second most votes in 
November's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey said he left his seat to spend more time with his family and his 
business.

 Buffa, who is now in his third term, was unanimously elected vice mayor, a 
position the outgoing Humphrey previously held.

<P>
 Will B. King, a Costa Mesa resident, suggested during a public hearing that 
the five-member council be expanded to seven. He said he thought the city was 
big enough to have a seven-member council and pointed out that under the 
current council, if one council member misses a meeting, there are only four 
members to vote on what could turn out to be an important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Genis, in a post-meeting interview, said Costa Mesa cannot have seven 
council members because it is a general law city, not a charter city. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter cities are generally older and have more flexibility under state laws 
while general law cities are governed by the state, Genis said. TOM RAGAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; TOYS REWIRED FOR KIDS WITH DISABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wielding solder guns, blow dryers and foam rubber, parents and staff at the 
Lowman Special Education Center became amateur electricians Wednesday as they 
learned to rewire battery-operated toys for use by disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee and doughnuts went almost untouched as more than 50 adults, assisted by 
the North Hollywood firefighters who donated many of the toys, operated on 
barking, tail-wagging pups, helicopters, and police cars with multicolored, 
whirling sirens.  
</P>
<P>
 Workshop participants used remote foot switches to bypass the toys' on-off 
switches. The new switches, much like the foot pedal of a sewing machine, are 
easier to operate for children who have limited use of their arms or hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The small, flat black box, which has had its spring removed, needs only slight 
pressure to activate the toy. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4-year-old boy with cerebral palsy cried excitedly as he pressed his head 
against the device attached to his wheelchair. Transfixed by the blinking 
lights of the race car in front of him, he seemed frightened by the noise, but 
cried more when he lost pressure and the car went silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Hartell, Lowman's principal, said the toys are bridging more than the 
practical issue of accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an important cognitive and esteem-building experience in the 
cause-and-effect lessons of simple play, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A child who is severely disabled, or isolated by their disabilities, can 
press the switch and say, 'I've done something -- and it made something 
happen.' It opens up a whole new world for them," Hartell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The curriculum at Lowman, which is part of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, is functional rather than academic, Hartell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are trained in movement, trying to develop the strength to hold 
themselves in proper posture, "to focus outward," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And these toys give them a reason to be interested in their environment, give 
them a link, teach them that they have some control, some independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Kober, whose 4-year-old daughter, Carly, has been a student at Lowman 
for a year, waited anxiously -- almost nervously -- to wire a bow-tied brown 
puppy. "I am trying to pay attention," Kober said. "I am hoping to be able to 
do this on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Kober's developmentally delayed daughter is content playing with stuffed 
animals, but Kober would like for her to have more stimulating toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so hard to find challenging toys that she can manipulate herself," she 
said. "And the ones that are specially made are very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 With the wires cut and spliced and the final piece of copper soldered into 
place, Carly's puppy barks while it walks, flopping its ears, then sits up and 
begs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Frank Rimkus, a 16-year volunteer at the center, "It is always a 
challenge to develop something that pleases both the students and the 
teachers."  
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's workshop, by the looks on their faces, it seemed everyone had 
risen to the challenge. L.D. STRAUB

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MAYOR TO URGE QUAKE VICTIMS TO SEEK HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles business owners can expect a letter early next week from Mayor 
Richard Riordan urging victims of the Northridge quake to apply for federal 
disaster aid before the Jan. 20 application deadline, the mayor's office said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan representatives said the city plans to send 212,000 letters to 
businesses containing phone numbers and addresses of federal disaster agencies 
and city departments that can provide low-interest disaster loans and other 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters were drafted after Riordan and city Controller Rick Tuttle 
questioned whether the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency had done enough to help businesses recover from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters also include the city's new bilingual toll-free help line 
(1-800-CITY-AID) to answer questions about most available quake-relief 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also issued a warning Wednesday that the city's free quake-debris 
removal program will end Jan. 17. He urged residents with debris to call the 
city for a pickup by Dec. 30. The number is 1-800-498-2489. HUGO MARTIN

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; THEY ENRICH THE LIVES OF 
RETARDED 'KIDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sit in Dixie Henrikson's office for a short while with the constant stream of 
staff, volunteers and "kids" going in and out, and you might think the 
Activities for Retarded Children in North Hollywood is just one big family. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "One huge zoo," said Henrikson, who 29 years ago was ready for "the golf 
course and the bridge table" when she gave birth to her daughter, Debbie, who 
was born with Down's syndrome. Instead of retiring, Henrikson and Mary 
Schallert started ARC 25 years ago, and both women say the organization has 
enriched their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps you young," said Schallert, whose daughter, Suzie, is mentally 
retarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Schallert is associate director of the agency, and Henrikson is 
executive director. But the two women run the agency together. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrikson and Schallert met in 1969 at Studio City Park and decided to create 
their own programs so their children could build friendships and have 
activities that other children have. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, ARC, which formally incorporated in 1975, serves 120 members, with a 
Saturday camp that includes tennis, swimming, softball and other sports, as 
well as camping trips, parties and dances.  
</P>
<P>
 Henrikson also conducts the English Hand Bell Choir, a popular group during 
the holidays. The choir has 16 mentally disabled members, who -- though of 
adult age -- are still lovingly called "kids" by Henrikson and Schallert. A 
fund-raiser with the choir is scheduled for Sunday at Campbell Hall School in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who might reject the idea of a choir of mentally retarded children and 
adults would be surprised at the group's skill. At a major construction firm's 
Christmas party, the employees' initial skepticism was overcome as soon as the 
bells started ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a dry eye at the end of the first number," Henrikson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Henrikson uses a large sheet of paper with the musical notes written out as 
she directs the choir. As she points, the choir member with the bell for that 
note rings it. 
</P>
<P>
 The choir has performed for major Christmas events in Beverly Hills and has 
been on television.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, Henrikson and Schallert were known to the children as "Aunt Dixie" 
or "Aunt Mary," although now most have outgrown using those names. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew up with the kids," Henrikson said. Her 29-year-old daughter, Debbie, 
is a member of the choir. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a second family to me," said Nilo Choudry, a Culver City mother 
whose 23-year-old son, Zak, plays softball in ARC's Saturday program.  
</P>
<P>
 She said ARC has made a big difference in her and her son's life since they 
joined the group 10 years ago. "People tell me he's more verbal and more 
outgoing. I think a lot of it is because of (ARC)." 
</P>
<P>
 There is something enjoyable about working with people who do not mentally 
grow beyond the age of a child, Henrikson said. "You're in Peter Pan land for 
all your life."  
</P>
<P>
 But both women say their "kids" aren't mere innocents; they have well-rounded 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're nice people," Schallert said. "Even if they did something that wasn't 
nice, you would know why." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're fun and loving and emotional," Henrikson said, after one ARC member, 
a woman looking forward to her 29th birthday, came in to set the plans for the 
celebration.  
</P>
<P>
 Birthdays are very important at the agency. "It's bigger than Christmas as far 
as they're concerned," Henrikson said. "The little things are so important. 
They still are little kids." 
</P>
<P>
 So, even if the two women do not have typical retirements, they are pleased 
their children have had better lives because of the agency they founded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've had a better life than I had as a kid," Schallert said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL TRUSTEE CHIEF EXPECTED TO KEEP POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maureen Aschoff tonight is expected to become the first Orange Unified School 
District trustee since 1961 to be elected to a second consecutive term as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 But she will first take some criticism from Trustee James Fearns, who said he 
is furious over maneuvering that has polarized the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was in San Diego, unbeknownst to me . . . we found that Maureen is 
going to be the next board president again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearns said he opposes Aschoff's presidency for a number of reasons. "Under 
her tenure this past year, the board has been mired in rancor and has seen 
little direction," he said, reading from a statement prepared for tonight's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member board divides into a majority group comprising Aschoff, Max 
Reissmueller, Martin Jacobson and Bill Lewis, and a minority including Fearns, 
Rick Ledesma and Robert H. Viviano, the board's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Aschoff said the board's majority has lobbied her for two months to accept the 
president's seat again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, basically, the majority of the board has confidence and trust in 
me," she said. "I agree that when I took over the presidency last year, we had 
turmoil and conflict and it was some job to sit in that hot seat. . . . I 
personally think we have had a good year." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson said Aschoff is the most competent to hold the job because she keeps 
board members informed and does "not abuse the power of the office." LESLEY

 About two dozen young volunteers on Tuesday cleaned up an elderly woman's 
house that police said had been trashed recently by local gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Edna Unland, 70, sought the help of police and code-enforcement officials 
after coming home from a vacation in Northern California last week to find her 
house on Havenwood Street badly damaged, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Dave Abrecht said that walls of the three-bedroom house were 
ripped off, doors and walls were spray-painted, and the woman's clothes and 
personal belongings were dumped on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost unlivable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrecht said the gang members apparently were invited by Unland's 34-year-old 
daughter, Rosella Smith. Smith, who was arrested on outstanding warrants, said 
she did not invite the gang to the house. "Why would I invite people to trash 
the house?" said Smith, who has been released from custody. "It doesn't make 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrecht said police are still investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers, consisting of Explorer Scouts and children from the 
neighborhood, cleaned up piles of debris on the front yard, gathered clothing 
strewn on the floor and put away the accumulated trash. 
</P>
<P>
 In half an hour, a large bin provided by the city was filled with trash, 
including some discarded furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti on doors and on the walls remained, but Unland, who has lived in 
the house for more than 20 years, said she was happy for the help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too old to do this on my own," she said. BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has narrowly rejected the appointment of a popular community 
activist to the Community Redevelopment Commission, prompting one councilman to 
charge that city politics tainted the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 3 to reject the appointment of Ana Y. Vasquez, who ran 
an unsuccessful campaign in November to unseat Robert L. Richardson.She 
received 44% of the vote to his 56%. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Richardson, Miguel A. Pulido Jr., Patricia McGuigan and Thomas 
E. Lutz opposed the appointment. Council members Lisa Mills and Tony Espinoza 
voted in favor, as did Ted R. Moreno, who nominated her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, Moreno angrily charged that an obviously popular nominee was 
rejected for purely political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder why you would vote against this. The people felt this nominee should 
have some role in city government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido responded that council members "have their own prerogatives to vote yes 
or no."  
</P>
<P>
 Moreno may nominate someone else to the seven-member commission, a city 
spokeswoman said. JON NALICK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; WRECKING BALL TAKES DOWN HEALTH CENTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services began tearing down the 
San Fernando Health Center on Maclay Street earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The center had been vacant since the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged the facility 
beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 When the wrecking ball stops swinging and the dust clears -- in about 45 days 
-- construction crews will build a 10,000-square-foot temporary replacement 
building at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 A permanent structure will be built there in three to five years, county 
health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake-induced closure, the center's 45 physicians and nurses have 
worked out of several different health facilities in the northeast San Fernando 
Valley, handling an estimated 4,000 patient visits each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult ambulatory care and immunization clinics are in trailers at the Los 
Angeles County Courthouse parking lot in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The pediatric and sexually transmitted disease clinic staff treat patients at 
the Pacoima Health Center, and the tuberculosis clinic operates out of Olive 
View-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary replacement structure should be operational by spring, officials 
said. TIM MAY

 On Saturday, 15 tons of snow will fall on a small patch of Van Nuys as part of 
a holiday celebration run by the H.E.L.P. group. 
</P>
<P>
 H.E.L.P. -- which stands for Housing and Hearing, Education, Language and 
Learning, Psychology and Psychiatric Services Group -- is an association of 
nonprofit agencies that help children with special needs, from those who have 
been abused and neglected to those who have learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred disabled children from all over Los Angeles will be at the 
10th annual Holiday Family Carnival and Winter Wonderland, a fund-raising event 
for the H.E.L.P. group. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival -- which includes Santa Claus and a Hanukkah house -- will be 
held from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at 13130 Burbank Blvd. in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to the carnival, which will include a 35- by 50-foot 
snow-covered play area, rides, games, clowns and holiday trees for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Discounted toys will be sold at a "Toy Town." 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be celebrity guests from television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a special day for these children," said Patti Hartmann, 
community relations coordinator for H.E.L.P. "We just wanted to come up with 
something that was new and fun for the kids."

 In an intensely emotional ceremony, three City Council members relinquished 
their jobs Tuesday night after being lauded for their accomplishments -- from 
keeping a housing tract out of Laguna Canyon to creating a park just for dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their final controversial year in office -- a year clouded by a 
ferocious firestorm 14 months ago -- Robert F. Gentry, Lida Lenney and Ann 
Christoph were given a send-off that brought some on the council and in the 
audience to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry, who was first elected in 1982, captivated the audience as he recalled 
the experience of being Orange County's only openly gay elected official during 
a period when AIDS was gaining a stranglehold on the nation and on Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years earlier, Gentry announced from the same platform that his longtime 
companion Gary Burdick had died of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The label of controversy has been with me wherever I've been," Gentry said, 
"and it's primarily been because I'm openly gay." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenney, who founded the Laguna Canyon Conservancy in the late 1980s to stop a 
housing project from being built in the canyon, was praised by residents for 
her vigilance in protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for giving us the courage to dream, the strength to endure and the 
conviction to act," said Carolyn Wood, the conservancy's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Lenney nor Gentry ran for reelection. Christoph failed in her bid to 
maintain her seat after serving one term. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood shifted dramatically once the trio stepped down and new council 
members Wayne J. Baglin, Steve Dicterow and Paul Freeman were sworn into 
office. There was an explosion of applause, the release of balloons and a 
spontaneous "Happy Birthday" serenade to Dicterow, who turned 40 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new council's first action was to vote Kathleen Blackburn, now the lone 
female in the group, into the mayor's seat. LESLIE EARNEST

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NEW CARNIVAL OPERATOR IS POSSIBLE FOR O.C. 
FAIR 
</P>

 Orange County Fair officials have plans to finalize a three-year contract with 
a new carnival operator to provide rides at the fair through 1997, but a 
protest by the company that has provided rides for the past 10 years may stall 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospective operator, Ray Cammack Shows of Laveen, Ariz., has operated the 
midway for the Los Angeles County Fair for 10 years.It would replace B&B 
Amusements, which held the contract in Orange County for a decade and is 
protesting the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 B&B has a week to outline its complaint to the state. A hearing then will be 
scheduled, which could delay the contract awarding process by up to several 
months, said Jill Lloyd, a fair spokeswoman. Owners of B&B, of Yuma, Ariz., 
were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed deal, the fair would get a smaller percentage of receipts, 
but the tentative contract includes a guarantee that Cammack operator will 
provide $200,000 a year in improvements for the fair, probably starting with 
the Kiddie Carnival area, fair spokeswoman Pam Heck said. 
</P>
<P>
 B&B's 1994 contract paid 45% of its first $100,000 in receipts to the fair; 
43% on the second $100,000 of receipts, and 40% of any receipts over $200,000. 
The company did not have to pay for general fair improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, B&B grossed more than $2 million on the carnival rides -- $1.2 
million for itself and $999,000 for the fair, Heck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cammack would pay for the improvements plus 35% of the ride gross receipts up 
to $1 million, 25% of ride receipts over $1 million and 40% of all pre-sale 
carnival tickets. HOLLY J. WAGNER and DIANE SEO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; IMPERIAL HIGHWAY PROJECT ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has given tentative approval to a plan to widen Imperial Highway 
despite objections from residents and a city planner's report that county 
studies of the environmental impact of the project were inadequate and 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy, emotionally charged public hearing on Tuesday, the council 
voted 5-0 to move ahead on designing portions of the project that will not 
affect the volume or speed of traffic on Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also left the door open to building the entire project, which 
includes six lanes of traffic between Rose Drive and Yorba Linda Boulevard and 
sound walls ranging from six feet to 16 feet along portions of the road. The 
project was proposed by the Orange County Transportation Authority and will be 
paid by a countywide half-cent sales tax established by Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has repeatedly asked OCTA to do an environmental impact 
study, the agency says one is not needed. But a city planner, in a memo to the 
city engineer dated Aug. 30, points out numerous errors and oversights in the 
county's initial study that was used to justify not doing an environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial study for the . . . project is insufficient in three ways," the 
memo states. "The initial study is not consistent with (state) guidelines. It . 
. . fails to completely identify all potential areas of impact (and) it fails 
to properly mitigate potential impacts."  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Schwing also criticized the study for failing to address the 
gridlock caused by daily morning trains just south of the intersection of 
Imperial Highway and Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial study gave only passing comment to the worst intersection in the 
area," Schwing said. "They're going to route four lanes of traffic down 
(Imperial Highway), then come to a sudden stop when a train comes through. It's 
beyond logic." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CITY COUNTS SIGNATURES ON RECALL PETITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of a movement to oust the entire five-member Agoura Hills City Council 
marched triumphantly into City Hall on Wednesday bearing petitions they said 
contained about 3,400 signatures, more than enough to set in motion the first 
phase of the recall process. 
</P>
<P>
 The action forced the city to count the signatures to determine whether the 
recall group is correct. City officials, who began counting about noon, said 
Wednesday night they won't be finished until today. 
</P>
<P>
 The petitions were to be stored in a vault in City Hall overnight, and the 
count was to resume this morning, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall group needs to turn in at least 2,405 signatures -- or 20% of the 
city's registered voters -- to force a recall election, according to the city 
clerk's office.  
</P>
<P>
 After the signatures are counted, they will be sent to the Los Angeles County 
clerk/registrar-recorder's office to be checked for validity, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere was tense but cordial as the recall group -- accompanied by 
news photographers and reporters -- entered the lobby of City Hall, where they 
were met by City Clerk Pat Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know exactly how we proceed from here," said an apparently nervous 
Barbara Murphy, the recall group's leader, clutching a box of petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have five staff members standing by waiting to count the signatures," said 
Manning, as she led the group into another room where the counting was to take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning then asked recall group members to leave the room so that the counting 
could get under way. She invited them to watch from a window. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall leaders, who have said they fear city officials will tamper with the 
petitions, took her up on her offer. Murphy's husband, Joseph Henry Murphy, 
peered through the window, refusing to take his eyes off the scene inside. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the council members were present as the group turned in the 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the counting began, Barbara Murphy said she heard a report that 
city officials had refused to include in the count some of the names on the 
petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real concerned, because we were told they were not allowed to mark the 
petitions, or to scratch out any names," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tedious process," Manning said. "We're doing what I was told to do" by 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's group, Citizens Against New Local Taxes, launched the recall drive 
last summer, after the council to a person approved a 4% tax on electricity, 
gas and telephone service to help close what the city says is a $1-million 
deficit. The recall group says the actual deficit is far less and that the city 
could have balanced the budget without the tax.  
</P>
<P>
 One City Council member, Fran Pavley, reiterated on Wednesday her claim that 
the recall effort is being funded by outside interests and managed by a paid 
professional consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for a homeowner who seeks public office to compete with 
paid outside consultants who do nothing but gather signatures," she said. 
"Literally, thousands and thousands of dollars have been spent on getting paid 
signatures." FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; 2ND OPINION SOUGHT ON LOCKHEED CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has narrowly agreed to hire an out-of-state 
consulting firm to give the city a second opinion on the merits of Lockheed 
Corp.'s plans to clean up underground chemical contamination with a system that 
would shoot toxics into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday, with members Susan Spanos and Robert Bowne 
dissenting, to hire the Peartree Group of Kansas to study Lockheed's proposed 
vapor extraction system (VES), which would be built on land the company owns at 
Victory Place and the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 After a public outcry over fears of cancer risk, Lockheed withdrew its 
applications for permits to build the system last month, and the council 
appropriated $50,000 to hire Dames & Moore, a consulting firm from Sacramento, 
to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But a second consultant was picked because many residents said they believed 
Dames & Moore, which had done consulting work for Lockheed in the past, could 
not be trusted to give a fully objective appraisal of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peartree has no past or present dealings with Lockheed and is known for its 
aggressiveness," said Jeff Strobach, one of about 10 residents who urged the 
council to hire the Kansas firm. "Although (Dames & Moore) state that they have 
no conflict of interest, they have worked for (Lockheed) in the past on 
numerous occasions." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said they trusted Peartree to act as the "citizens' advocate" 
on the issue, pointing to the company's proposals to study alternative methods 
to cleaning up toxics in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Bowne and Spanos said they opposed hiring the company because of doubts about 
its expertise in vapor-extraction technology. 
</P>
<P>
 If built, the system -- known by many residents as simply the "smokestack" -- 
would force air into the ground, pump it through carbon filters and out an 
exhaust pipe extending 50 feet skyward.  
</P>
<P>
 The process would remove about 2,000 pounds of chemicals per day from the 
soil, but it would also allow about 40 pounds of cancer-causing chemicals to 
enter the air each day.  
</P>
<P>
 Emissions from the plant would raise the cancer risk from air pollution in 
Burbank from about 1,300 in 1 million people to about 1,309 in 1 million, 
according to city reports. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; IMPROVEMENTS TO BEGIN ON STUNT ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stunt Road will be improved in the unincorporated area near the city of 
Calabasas, Los Angeles County officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, to be administered by the county Department of Public Works, 
includes construction of a corrugated steel pipe drainage ditch to replace an 
existing undersized ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 "By improving drainage to take the water runoff away, the road will be more 
stable," said Joel Bellman, press deputy for Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids for the project, approved last month by the Board of Supervisors, will be 
taken beginning Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in February, 1995, the project should take 35 working days and be 
completed in March. Once work begins, traffic on Stunt Road may be reduced to 
one lane for both directions during daytime hours and be controlled by flag 
operators. JEFF SCHNAUFER

 Bernie P. Kilcoyne this week became president of the Brea Olinda Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilcoyne takes over for Susie D. Sokol, who led the board during the recent 
grade-changing scandal in which hundreds of Brea Olinda High School students' 
grades were illegally altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope (the scandal) is behind us," Kilcoyne said. He said his top priority 
will be to replace the principal at the high school, do periodic checks on the 
high school's transcript recording practices and focus on ways to improve 
counseling services for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilcoyne, who was board president in 1990, has served on the board for seven 
years and was unanimously selected to be the new president. He was appointed in 
1987 and won election and reelection in 1988 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Barbara R. Paxton, who won reelection in November, was chosen vice 
president and Todd Spitzer was named clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, new board members Kenneth A. Kegel, Teresa Hampson and Carol L. Norum 
were sworn into office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Daucher, Frank Davies and Leonard MacKain stepped down. They did not seek 
another term.

 The three former board members were hailed by the board as dedicated public 
servants with great integrity. MIMI KO

 After nearly 16 years on the Glendale Board of Education, Sharon Beauchamp 
said Tuesday she is setting her sights on what some school districts consider 
the root of all their problems: state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauchamp, who is completing her fourth term as a school board member, 
announced that she will not see reelection in the April election in which the 
board seats she and Elena Hubbell curently hold will be up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Hubbell said she plans to run in 1996 for the state Senate seat long 
held by Newton Russell, who will be forced to leave office due to term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 If she wins the Republican nomination and is elected to the Senate, Beauchamp 
said she will "continue to be an education advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "I strongly believe education is a life-long process and is the 
root of our existence. Lack of education is the basis of most of our crime and 
violence, as well as most of our social (problems)." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauchamp also reflected on the changes that occurred within the district's 
makeup during her tenure as a board member. Enrollment grew from about 19,000 
to 29,000 students; the budget grew from about $39 million to about $126 
million, and the percentage of minority students rose from about 9% to about 
70%, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 She also called the Glendale district "one of the most outstanding school 
districts in the state and the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always been in the forefront of any situation that has arisen," 
Beauchamp said. STEVE RYFLE

 Carolyn Nash was appointed mayor Tuesday, but the move was overshadowed by an 
emotional farewell to Gary L. Hausdorfer, a 16-year City Council veteran and 
South County political figure who decided to not run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 As more than 100 people in a packed council chamber watched, Hausdorfer choked 
up with tears while thanking friends, supporters and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Hausdorfer said that his experience in public life had been filled with 
rewards but also a few frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say I lost interest," Hausdorfer said. "No, I never lost 
interest. I lost patience sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I do it all again? In a heartbeat," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the occasion marking the end of a local era were the 
city's five former mayors and Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, who praised 
Hausdorfer for his work in a program aimed at steering children and teen-agers 
away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said that Hausdorfer was always willing to help, citing the time he 
spoke at a memorial service for a sheriff's deputy who was slain on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hausdorfer and fellow outgoing Councilman Jeff Vasquez stepped down from 
the dais, Wyatt T. Hart, David M. Swerdlin and Gil Jones were sworn in to 
four-year terms. Like Hausdorfer, Vasquez chose not to run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart and Swerdlin, both first-term councilmen, won seats along with Jones in 
the Nov. 8 election. Jones is serving his second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash, who was elected in 1992, won the unanimous backing of her colleagues to 
succeed Collene Campbell as mayor for the next two years. Campbell has two 
years left on her council term. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, a former member of the city's Planning Commission, was appointed to 
serve as mayor pro tem.JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; LA PATA FIRM TO HALT COMPOSTING 
ACTIVITIES

 A local composting plant has voluntarily scaled back operations in response to 
a flurry of complaints about bad odors. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, La Pata Greenwaste should have the last of its giant piles of 
composting material removed from the site, said Ken Wishnick, divisional vice 
president of Houston-based Browning-Ferris Industries, which owns La Pata. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've decided that it's the right thing to do at this point in time because 
it's the only way to know conclusively if we are the source of odor in the 
area," Wishnick said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak this summer, the business took in an average of 200 tons of green 
waste per day, mulched it, then put it in huge rows to make compost. 
</P>
<P>
 But since October, residents who live in upscale homes have been clamoring for 
the plant to shut down or relocate. The site is east of the city on La Pata 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishnick said the company doesn't plan to abandon the outdoor plant, which for 
now will continue to mulch -- but not compost (allow to decompose). The 
material will be trucked to the company's Irvine facility for composting or 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Henshaw, supervisor of the solid waste program for the county's 
Environmental Health Department, said that the company has not been ordered to 
curtail operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can still compost as far as we're concerned," Henshaw said. "We'll just 
see if they can keep it under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim RuthStiver, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, said the number of complaints has dropped recently.JEFF BEAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; ALL-GIRL SCHOOL WINS MOCK TRIAL CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Watch out Marcia Clark, there's a gang of 12 high school girls hot on your 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The mock trial team from Louisville High, a private all-girl school in 
Woodland Hills, won the Los Angeles County mock trial competition, qualifying 
them for the California State Mock Trial Competition next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Michael Telesca, a government and history teacher, said Louisville has 
won the state title two out of the last three years and is confident that this 
year's team has a good shot at first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they perform like they did in the last couple of rounds, they have the 
opportunity of doing really well," Telesca said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mock trials are sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation, a 
nonprofit educational organization. The scoring is not based on the verdict but 
on the performance of the team members, Telesca said. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the foundation issues the fictional case that each team will both 
prosecute and defend throughout the school year. This year's is a murder case, 
where the defendant -- a battered woman -- is pleading not guilty due to 
self-defense, Telesca said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 52 teams in Los Angeles County have fought the case in eliminating 
rounds for the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville, taking the side of the defense, won the county competition over 
Polytechnic High School in Long Beach after five rounds of mock trials during 
the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who heard the McMartin 
Preschool case, in which school staff members were charged with sexually 
abusing children, judged the final competition. MAKI BECKER

2 SUE HUNTINGTON BEACH FOR CHANGE IN ZONING; COURTS: WOULD-BE DEVELOPERS OF 
COASTAL PROPERTIES SAY MOVE TO PROTECT WETLANDS HAS MADE THEIR HOLDINGS 
WORTHLESS. CITY OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, DENY IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two would-be developers with interests in several large properties near the 
ocean have sued the city, claiming that recent zoning changes designed to 
preserve coastal wetlands have made their holdings worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it amounts to is an attempt by the city to confiscate our property for 
public benefit without compensation," said Robert London Moore Jr., president 
of the Mills Land and Water Co. His company owns 23 undeveloped acres near 
Pacific Coast Highway and holds options on another 28 acres just south of Beach 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the city as holding our valuable coastal land as hostage in an 
environmental controversy that has been going on for years," said Moore, whose 
company hopes to develop shops and a possible restaurant on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's lawsuit, filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court, was 
joined earlier this week by another suit by the estate of Daisy Piccirelli, 
which has a financial interest in about 45 acres near Pacific Coast Highway and 
Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Both suits ask that the zoning change -- dubbed a "coastal conservation 
suffix" and most recently amended Sept. 6 -- be set aside as an 
unconstitutional violation of property rights and that the city be prohibited 
from enforcing it. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials deny that the zoning change is unconstitutional or violates 
anyone's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Huntington Beach senior planner Scott Hess, the controversy stems 
from efforts by the city beginning in the early 1980s to cooperate with the 
California Coastal Commission, whose goal is to protect 232 acres of prime 
coastal real estate stretching along Pacific Coast Highway from Beach Boulevard 
to the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Hess said, a study conducted by the California Department of Fish and 
Game determined that some of that land contained viable wetland areas. To 
protect those wetlands, he said, the City Council subsequently adopted the 
coastal conservation zoning that superseded existing industrial and residential 
zoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new zoning, Hess said, landowners are barred from using their 
properties for anything but such ocean-dependent industrial activities as 
aquaculture or power generation, habitat restoration, nature study trails and, 
in some cases, light mineral extraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Before using the land for anything else, he said, an owner must demonstrate 
that the use would not affect wetlands or, if it did, agree to provide some 
sort of environmental mitigation. "He always has that option," Hess said, 
referring to Moore's company. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lawsuit, however, Moore argues that the zoning regulation "effectively 
negates all of the economically viable uses of the property," thus forcing the 
company to "bear the entire burden of preserving wetlands and open space on 
behalf of the public without payment." He also describes the land in question 
as a "wasteland," devoid of viable wetlands for 50 years or so.

MISSION PRESIDENT TO TRANSFER; EDUCATION: JACK FUJIMOTO, LEADER OF YOUNGEST 
SCHOOL IN COLLEGE DISTRICT, WILL LEAVE SYLMAR CAMPUS TO SPEND AT LEAST A YEAR 
DOWNTOWN TO HELP RAISE FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mission College President Jack Fujimoto will be transferred Downtown for at 
least a year to help the financially ailing Los Angeles Community College 
District find desperately needed public and private funding, district officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of Fujimoto's departure from the Sylmar campus will be made 
today at a districtwide meeting at Mission College, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 William E. Norlund, vice president of academic affairs at Pierce College in 
Woodland Hills, will replace Fujimoto as interim president at Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Fujimoto's transfer comes as the nine-campus district, the nation's 
largest two-year college district, seeks critical sources of outside funding -- 
including federal grants -- in the wake of state budget cutbacks, declining 
enrollment and other financial stresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fujimoto's departure will leave Mission College -- the district's youngest 
and smallest campus -- -- without steady leadership at a time when enrollment 
is down nearly 19% from its peak in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The college's enrollment dwindled to fewer than 6,000 this fall, in part 
because of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear exactly when Fujimoto, 65, will begin his new assignment, which 
was characterized as "temporary" by district officials. Fujimoto, who is 
considered an expert at finding and cultivating a variety of sources for 
education funding, has said he wants the status of his new position to be 
reviewed regularly.  
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Neil Yoneji, Fujimoto, Norlund and other top district 
administrators were attending a district retreat Wednesday and were unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Mission College professors have expressed concern that the change will 
delay a planned 40-acre expansion of the college and other projects -- 
including construction of the much anticipated $11-million library and learning 
resource center. Work began on that facility in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 But others praised the move, saying it is a crucial step toward shoring up 
funding gaps and expanding the financial reach of the college district. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the new reality for the world's largest community college district -- 
that we have to look outside the state for sources of funding," said Charles 
Dirks, legislative advocate for the American Federation of Teachers union and a 
political science professor at Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack is perfectly suited for the job," said Dirks, who added that he will be 
working closely with Fujimoto to generate federal funds for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirks said Fujimoto is adept at maneuvering within the complicated web of 
federal grant programs, and noted his previous success in obtaining federal 
"amnesty" funding for the college's immigrant student population. The grant 
program allowed undocumented immigrants to learn English and critical job 
skills, while helping them become U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto's contacts within Gov. Pete Wilson's administration also are viewed 
as an asset to the district. He served as president of Sacramento City College 
in 1979, becoming the first Asian-American to preside over a community college 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But the president's departure from the college is a blow to some community 
leaders, who said that Fujimoto brought a measure of stability, sensitivity and 
creativity to the job that will be hard to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take away a leader of his stature, it leaves a big gap," said Ed 
Kussman, president of the local chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People and a member of the college's advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have definite problems and resentments between different minorities in 
this area," Kussman said. "Jack established himself as a fighter for all 
groups, and started important development programs for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Norlund, a physics professor who still teaches classes at Pierce, is 
characterized by educators as a hands-on administrator experienced in both the 
academic and business aspects of running a college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack was extremely politically oriented," said Dale Newman, president of the 
Academic Senate at Mission College.  
</P>
<P>
 Newman participated in a selection panel that reviewed candidates for the 
interim presidency. "I see Bill as being here more often," she said. "Jack was 
in Sacramento a lot, batting for the college. Bill seems genuinely excited 
about coming here, and I think he's attracted by the technological capacity 
we're building."

POLICE RELEASE DRAWING OF POSSIBLE KILLER; CRIME: AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE MAN 
MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SERIES OF ROBBERIES NEAR THE 72-YEAR-OLD VICTIM'S VAN 
NUYS HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police believe that they are "just a telephone call away" from finding at 
least one man who savagely beat and killed a 72-year-old woman in her Van Nuys 
home two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives on Wednesday released a composite sketch of the man they think 
killed Aliza Levi on Oct. 11 after breaking into her house. They don't know the 
man's name or if he had an accomplice, but they think that the man, who they 
believe is a transient, may also be responsible for a series of robberies near 
Levi's home in the 7900 block of Norwich Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi's daughter Iris Levi, 44, says she wants the man caught so justice can be 
served and, in the process, learn the answers to her haunting question: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did he have to kill her? Why?" she asked. "He could have just tied her up 
and taken what he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Aliza Levi surprised a burglar at 12:10 p.m. while her husband was out running 
errands. The man beat her and stabbed her repeatedly as she screamed and 
struggled for about three minutes, police said. Her death marked the second 
time in a week that a Van Nuys senior citizen was slain at home, killings that 
shocked the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Levis had returned from one of their frequent trips to Europe that week. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglar stole a distinctive black deck-style shoe with a reptile-like 
design, roughly a size 9, from the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police assembled the description of a man seen carrying a shoe like that after 
the slayings. He is described as a Latino, 140 to 150 pounds, 5-foot-5 to 
5-foot-7, 25 to 28 years old with a scar on his left cheek and a bluish-green 
tattoo of a snake on his right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started out on this, all we had was a shoe," Detective Roberta Moore 
said. "We've made a success in putting a face to that shoe." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are offering a $25,000 reward for information that leads to the 
arrest and conviction of the killer or killers.

POLICE UNION PLANS PROTEST AGAINST BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY; POLITICS: PROTECTIVE 
LEAGUE FEARS COUNCIL CANDIDATE WILL CONTINUE HER HUSBAND'S 'ANTI-COP' POLICIES. 
SHE CALLS THAT SEXIST. 
</P>

<P>
 Saying they fear she will be a "political puppet," officials of the union that 
represents the Los Angeles Police Department's rank and file said they plan to 
demonstrate against Barbara Yaroslavsky as she kicks off her campaign to gain 
her husband's vacant City Council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Protective League is targeting Yaroslavsky because union leaders 
blame her husband, Zev, for delaying labor contract talks last year when he was 
on the council. They also say they fear she will continue his "anti-cop" 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said they will send at least 50 off-duty officers to picket in 
front of a fund-raising event tonight at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Harkness, director of the league, said Barbara Yaroslavsky does not have 
the experience to fill the seat and union leaders fear she will only continue 
her husband's policies if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to tolerate her running for office," he said. "We don't want 
to do business with people who turn their backs on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky called union leaders sexist for assuming she is unable to 
have a political opinion independent of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "To assume that a woman would follow blindly in the footsteps of her husband 
is outrageous," she said. "This is the '90s. The 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 The planned protest signals the beginning of a heated race to represent an 
affluent and politically powerful district that stretches from Sherman Oaks to 
the Westside. The primary is scheduled for April and a runoff election will be 
held in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has already backed Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino for the 
post. Also running for the seat are Michael Feuer, the former head of 
Bet-Tzedek, a legal services agency; Jeff Brain, former president of the 
Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce; and Roberta Weintraub, a former Los Angeles 
school board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkness said Barbara Yaroslavsky has never approached the union to offer to 
explain her positions on various city issues and he criticized her campaigning 
as a police supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the union will continue protesting her candidacy at future 
political events. "I don't have any problem following her around the city of 
Los Angeles when she tries to convince people she supports the Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Yaroslavsky said she has approached union president Danny Staggs 
to explain her ideas and has yet to get a response from the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am more than willing to talk to anyone on the leadership of the league," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the union's opposition, Barbara Yaroslavsky said she supports the 
Police Department and backs Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to bolster the force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm committed to public safety," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Zev Yaroslavsky, who often clashed with police during his 19 years 
on the council, assumed his new post as a member of the County Board of 
Supervisors.

HIT-RUN VICTIM IDENTIFIED; WITNESS TO INCIDENT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police on Wednesday identified an 81-year-old woman killed by a hit-run driver 
and said they were looking for a woman who briefly chased the fleeing killer. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead woman was identified as Daisey Story, 81, who was struck by a pickup 
truck Sunday on Sepulveda Boulevard in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the driver stopped briefly and then drove off, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police are looking for a woman who had been at a Thrifty Mart down 
the block and followed the fleeing pickup driver onto the southbound San Diego 
Freeway in her van, said Detective Jodi Wakefield. "I desperately need to talk 
to her," Wakefield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are also looking for another witness, a man who was driving behind the 
pickup and swerved to avoid hitting the fallen Story. 
</P>
<P>
 Story was on her way to the supermarket to buy ground beef for her dog at 5:30 
a.m. that morning in a regular ritual, Wakefield said. But this time, instead 
of crossing Sepulveda at the Devonshire Street crosswalk, she jaywalked and was 
hit. "She was visible, though," Wakefield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup was described as black or dark blue Ford Ranger with a chrome panel 
on the tailgate, a tinted rear window and a California license plate that 
included the letters and numerals 4G4 or 4X4. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver stopped momentarily, speaking with what sounded like an Armenian or 
Iranian accent while asking a witness to dial 911, Wakefield said. He followed 
the witness into a store and left as the man began to call for help, Wakefield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Story died at Holy Cross Medical Center four hours later.

 Authorities are seeking public assistance in identifying a man found shot to 
death on Thanksgiving in the 2500 block of South Garnsey Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A shell casing was found beside the body, which was lying on the side of the 
road in a residential neighborhood, police said.Investigators believe he might 
have been shot at the scene, where he died at about 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to identify the man have led authorities through a maze of missing 
person reports and fingerprint records to no avail, said Cullen Ellingburgh, 
supervising deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a positive identification," Ellingburgh said, "it's hard to find out 
who did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators described the victim as Latino between 40 and 50 years old with 
black hair, brown eyes and a small mustache. He was about 128 pounds and about 
5 feet 5 inches tall, Ellingburgh said. He had a star-like scar on the left 
side of his lower torso and another scar on his chin, Ellingburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wore a faded white T-shirt with multicolored stripes, blue pants and brown 
leather shoes. He also wore a silver metal band with a wave design on his left 
hand, Ellingburgh said. His pockets were empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information should call (714) 647-7410. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated case, La Palma police distributed flyers Wednesday at 
Orangethorpe Avenue and Valley View Street to request information about the 
hit-and-run death of a 73-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Harrington of La Palma was struck by a truck about 5 p.m. Nov. 30 while 
crossing Orangethorpe Avenue in the southbound lanes, police said. She was died 
at UCI Medical Center. Anyone with information should call (714) 523-4552.

 A 3-year-old passenger was killed Wednesday when his grandmother crashed her 
car into a utility pole, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old Fullerton woman drifted off the road on Rosecrans Avenue near 
the Ralph B. Clark Regional Park about 12:40 p.m., Police Sgt. Neal Baldwin 
said. The boy was strapped into a child safety seat but the car struck the pole 
on his side, Baldwin said.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman was hospitalized at UCI Medical Center in Orange and was expected to 
live, Baldwin said.

ASIAN FAMILIES INCREASINGLY BECOMING TARGETS OF ROBBERS; CRIME: IN ONE 
INCIDENT, FIVE RELATIVES ARE HELD CAPTIVE IN HOME AS THIEVES TAKE CAR AND 
$20,000 IN VALUABLES.

 The strangers at the door asked for her cousin Jae by name, so Connie let them 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, she and Jae were on the floor, duct tape over their mouths, as 
armed thieves rifled through the house, tearing drawers from bureaus and 
ripping paintings from the walls and shouting out demands, "Where's the money?" 
"Where's the jewels?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought we had money in our pillows, in our mattresses, because we are 
Asian," 21-year-old Jae recalled in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked that his family's last name not be printed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jae said the robbers captured three other family members as they came home 
during the hourlong takeover Monday afternoon. They then locked the family in a 
bedroom closet and drove off in Jae's black 1994 Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say home takeover crimes are becoming an increasing hazard for Asian 
families in the San Fernando Valley, although they are not as prevalent as in 
the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you get more Asians in the Valley . . . they are being targeted," said Los 
Angeles Police Detective Jim Tiampo of the department's Asian Crimes Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the four men and one woman who robbed Jae's home in the 
15400 block of Lassen Street are Asian gang members, Tiampo said. The gangs 
usually rob for money, targeting Asian families who "traditionally keep cash or 
jewelry" at home, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves frequently rehearse the actual heist, Tiampo said, and 
occasionally date girls who live in the house to scout for valuables. When they 
strike, they typically hold residents at gunpoint, sometimes pistol-whipping 
their victims into submission. 
</P>
<P>
 The family robbed Monday was more fortunate than many because no one was 
harmed, police say. Jae and Connie were put in a closet, along with their aunt 
and cousin who were met at gunpoint when they came home. An uncle, in his 60s, 
also came home at that time. When robbers could not fit him in the closet, they 
bound and gagged him, then left him under a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves took about $20,000 in valuables, telling the family not to call 
police for an hour. The family escaped by breaking down the closet door. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandits took Jae's Accord, license plate 3HPR124. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiampo says the thieves are most likely from outside the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are predators; they will go out of town to do their crime," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jae was still stunned at the robbery as he sat Wednesday in his living room, 
which overlooks busy Lassen. "It was in broad daylight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family had just moved to the house from Granada Hills in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope my parents move to a condominium or an apartment building," Jae 
said. "Those seem just safer, security-wise. A home is so open." LOS ANGELES

CITY SUGGESTS REVISIONS TO MASTER PLAN; DEVELOPMENT: COMMISSION WILL HEAR 
PROPOSAL TO DROP BUILDERS' 'TRIP FEES' RELATED TO GROWTH ALONG VENTURA 
BOULEVARD CORRIDOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Commission today hears suggested revisions to the 
master plan for the future of Ventura Boulevard, with city officials saying 
deep budget cuts won't harm the way the San Fernando Valley's main street will 
look 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 That's at least partly because some of the current budget projections turned 
out to be in error. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier, higher estimate set off a multitude of legal quarrels with 
developers of new projects, who were hit with assessments to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hear suggested changes from the departments of 
transportation and planning for dealing with expected development along the 
corridor that runs 17 miles from Studio City to Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the proposed revisions will be considered by the Planning and Land 
Use Management Committee of the City Council, then the full council. No date 
has been set for those meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The main subject to be discussed today is a proposal to eliminate "trip fees" 
-- assessments that boulevard developers had to pay based on the number of car 
trips that city officials estimated their developments would generate. They 
would be replaced by much lower fees based on the square footage of new 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed change follows the discovery that the original $222-million 
budget for improvements to the boulevard was almost $140 million too high, 
according to the transportation department. The surplus was attributed to an 
error in calculation, outdated projections of land acquisition costs and street 
widening plans later deemed unworkable or unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the planning department has scaled back projections for new 
development. Previously, planners had expected builders to create 8.6 million 
square feet of development by 2005, but now they expect only 4.1 million square 
feet by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 With less development expected, there will be less need for measures to deal 
with its effects, such as increased traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now suggested to reduce the budget to $77 million, and it will be 
difficult for those using the street years from now to tell the difference, 
transportation officials predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed changes, new turn lanes would still be added at 
intersections, relieving traffic congestion. Trees, special paving and benches 
would still be put in along the boulevard, creating a more pedestrian-friendly 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan has not substantially changed," said Robert H. Sutton, deputy 
director in charge of community planning. "The plan has been corrected to 
reflect both cost restructuring and errors, and it is hoped that this change 
will help us make the plan work better." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes have not disarmed the plan's critics. On one hand, some 
developers contend that they were forced to pay excessive trip fees under the 
previous system, which discouraged development. On the other, community leaders 
expressed concern that the proposed budget cuts will result in too little being 
done to ameliorate the effects of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee that helped the 
city draft the original plan adopted in February, 1991, predicted gridlock on 
the boulevard if the number of street widening projects is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I see is a chopping down of the fees to let the developers off the hook," 
he fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning department says the revised plan would result in widening 19 of 
the originally planned 30 intersections, although the transportation department 
says 25 would be widened. The proposed plan also cuts the budget for shuttle 
buses and public parking, while maintaining full funding for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board, 
which is now overseeing the plan, also said the proposed budget cuts have gone 
too far, particularly in funds to create additional parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain, who was responsible for alerting the transportation department to an 
arithmetic error it made that inflated the original budget by $73.6 million, 
agreed with Sutton that most of the plan remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Gaines, an attorney representing six property owners who have appealed 
their trip fees as being excessive, has said he believes that the new fees are 
still too high and that they will continue to discourage development on the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 As of November, 1993, 38 boulevard property owners had appealed $8.4 million 
of the $12.5 million in trip fees that had been imposed.

VALLEY LAWMAKERS SPLIT ON CAUCUS CUTS; CONGRESS: THE GOP PLAN TO HALT FUNDING 
TO 28 ORGANIZATIONS WOULD AFFECT EVERY MEMBER OF THE REGION'S DELEGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Republican plans to cut off funding for more than two dozen special-interest 
caucuses on Capitol Hill -- from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to the 
Congressional Hunger Caucus -- will affect every member of the San Fernando 
Valley's congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley lawmakers, however, are divided on the merits of the plan, which would 
do away with with 28 of the so-called "legislative service organizations" now 
operating with taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) supports the reform, even 
though the research group known as the House Republican Study Committee, of 
which he is a member, would lose its funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look at what's best for the country," McKeon said Wednesday during 
a break in meetings of Republican lawmakers. "We have to change as many things 
as we can for the better during this transition. . . . If something is really 
important, it will still happen. You don't need government money to fund 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with its several dozen committees and subcommittees, where the bulk of 
government work is handled, Congress has 140 caucuses that specialize in 
everything from fine arts to footwear to minor league baseball. Of those, 28 
are funded by dues paid by lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan unveiled this week -- which is designed to save $5 million and 
reduce staff by 96 people -- the caucuses could continue to exist, but only if 
they are not funded from members' office accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Republican proposal say some of the caucuses targeted to be 
disbanded serve valuable roles in delving into issues outside the confines of 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Republicans are trying to keep the Democrats from having the 
ability to get the information we need to see what they're up to," said Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 He also questioned the cost-cutting nature of the proposal, since the funding 
for the caucuses had been coming from members' office budgets and not any 
separate fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's the business of the Republican leadership how we deal with 
our office budgets," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) is one active joiner -- he has at 
least 11 caucuses to his name -- who nonetheless supports the bulk of the 
Republican proposal. He says the more important caucuses will find funding 
elsewhere, while those that are not needed will disband. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman contends that the Democratic and Republican study groups, which 
research legislation for members of their respective parties, fill such an 
essential role for lawmakers that they should continue to receive funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things I don't like about changing the majority in the 
House," Berman said in an interview, "but there are some reforms being made 
that make some sense, and this may be one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) also sees pluses and minuses with 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some good to it and some bad," he said. "Anytime you take an 
across-the-board action like this, there are casualties among groups that don't 
deserve to be hurt. In general, these are real valuable organizations. They 
help Congress do its work better. They provide valuable research help." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he was not certain whether some of the more substantive groups 
could be saved when the full House takes up the matter next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's going to happen," he said. "As you know, this is all new 
to us. Our Republican friends are proposing a lot of changes -- some of them 
quite good and some of them not so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the caucuses on the chopping block are the Congressional Arts Caucus, 
which encourages federal funding for the arts and counts Berman, Waxman and 
Beilenson as members; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which Berman has 
joined as an associate member to reach out to Latinos in his district; and the 
Environmental and Energy Study Conference, on which Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) and Beilenson sit. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead said he has found the two groups he joined useful for keeping track 
of issues, but he nonetheless supports the GOP proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time that we have committed to reducing government, I think it is 
appropriate to forgo some of these legislative luxuries," Moorhead said through 
a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups targeted to lose their funding include the Congressional Travel 
and Tourism Caucus, Congressional Border Caucus, Congressional Narcotics Abuse 
and Control Caucus and Federal Government Service Task Force.

 Two bodies found in widely separated desert areas were identified Wednesday as 
those of a missing Lancaster couple, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Carlos Guevara, 26, was found alongside 50th Street East near 
Palmdale Boulevard on Nov. 30 by patrolling sheriff's deputies, Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of his wife, Delia Guevara, 26, was found the same day in the desert 
community of Yermo in San Bernardino County by someone walking a dog along 
Interstate 15, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Carlos Guevara was shot several times, dumped in the 
Antelope Valley and set on fire. Authorities would not say how Delia Guevara 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guevaras were reported missing Saturday by a friend who became concerned 
when neither of them showed up for work. The couple was last seen Nov. 29, 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia worked as an assistant manager at a Palmdale fast-food restaurant and 
her husband worked at the Best Buy store near the Antelope Valley Mall, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A murder investigation began when deputies -- acting on the missing person 
reports -- found a bullet lodged in a wall of the Guevaras' home in the 42000 
block of Alep Street, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's maroon 1994 Pontiac Grand Am is still missing, Erickson said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; JURY DEADLOCKS IN 2ND MURDER TRIAL; COURTS: 
PROSECUTORS ACCUSE A MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR STUART MILBURN OF STRANGLING 
CO-WORKER VERONICA ESTRADA. A HEARING ON A POSSIBLE THIRD TRIAL IS SCHEDULED.

<P>
 A second trial of a Canyon Country martial arts instructor accused of killing 
a female co-worker has, like the first, ended in a mistrial because of a 
deadlocked jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors on Wednesday voted 7 to 5 in favor of acquitting Stuart Edward Milburn, 
27, of first-degree murder in the death of Veronica Estrada, 29, also of Canyon 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Milburn strangled Estrada last December out of 
jealousy over her professional achievements in the martial arts field. 
Investigators said Estrada was killed while walking home along a dark road. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn's first trial ended in September with jurors voting 8 to 4 to convict. 
</P>
<P>
 While the jury in the first trial deliberated for a month, the second jury was 
declared deadlocked by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles Horan after 
only five days of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on a possible third trial is scheduled for Dec. 27, but defense 
attorney Darryl Mounger said he hopes the judge will throw the case out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are automatically set for a retrial, but now the judge is going to have to 
decide if (prosecutors) can ever get around the physical evidence and the 
weakness of their case," Mounger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn remains in custody without bail. Mounger said his client was 
"certainly displeased that he did not get a not-guilty verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty caused by the deadlocked juries are making life hard for 
people on both sides of the case, said Deborah Luck, a Canyon Country resident 
and close friend of Milburn and Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair to Stuart because he's been in jail for nine months," 
she said. "I feel very badly for her family because I think it'd be a lot 
easier to live with a decisive verdict one way or the other, because that gives 
you some closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a hung jury you always have people who believe he did it and 
people who believe he did not do this," she said. "No one will be satisfied 
because no one will really know." 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor in the 
second-degree black-belt division and she was named instructor of the year at 
Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country, where she primarily taught 5- to 8-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her partially clothed body was found in bushes near Soledad Canyon Road on the 
morning of Dec. 16. An investigation by sheriff's deputies led to the arrest of 
Milburn in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz presented three witnesses who said they saw a man resembling Milburn at 
the murder scene about 8:15 p.m., the estimated time of the killing. Other 
witnesses testified that Milburn changed his story about where he was that 
night and that he felt he deserved the instructor of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mounger presented a taekwondo student who said she saw Milburn at the 
studio sometime after 8 p.m. The defense also focused on Estrada's boyfriend, 
Eddie Hockaday, contending the couple had argued that evening and that Hockaday 
had motive and opportunity to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in the first trial said they dismissed Mounger's theory that Hockaday 
committed the murder, but considered the prosecution's case weak because of the 
uncertainty of the identifications made by eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger said members of the second jury declined to comment to lawyers or 
reporters, after Horan warned them their comments would likely be published. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn faces a minimum of 25 years in state prison if retried and convicted 
of first-degree murder.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SCHOOL DISTRICT'S BOUNDARY PLANS UNVEILED; 
EDUCATION: NEWHALL BOARD'S 28 PROPOSALS TO RELIEVE OVERCROWDING RUN THE GAMUT 
BETWEEN SIMPLE AND BAFFLING. MANY STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO TRANSFER.

<P>
 The 28 proposed new educational boundary plans for the local school district 
come in simple, complex and downright baffling -- and Mindy Braun doesn't like 
any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Her two children would be moved to a different school next fall no matter 
which of the plans, unveiled by the Newhall School District's board at its 
meeting Tuesday night, are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun, in an interview after the meeting, said she doesn't want her children 
moved because they would be away from many long-time friends. She said she 
remembers how bad things were when they switched schools after she moved four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very traumatic," she said. "I had my fourth-grader come home every day 
and cry because he had no friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed boundary changes are necessary to relieve overcrowding at 
existing six elementary schools while providing enough students for the new 
Stevenson Ranch Elementary School, opening this fall in a large housing 
development just west of the city limits, said Supt. J. Michael McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said that 283 students who live in the Stevenson Ranch complex will 
attend the new school, but about 225 students have to be transferred from Santa 
Clarita to provide it with adequate attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The areas we have concentrated on are neighborhoods where the children are 
already on buses, or are closer to Stevenson Ranch than other neighborhood 
schools," he told the crowd of about 75 parents who gathered at Wiley Canyon 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Although debate at past meetings on the topic has been heated, the two-hour 
presentation and discussion Tuesday was low-key, with most audience members 
talking among themselves in low tones and taking notes during the presentation. 
There were, however, plenty of emotional discussions afterward, outside the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is most people want it to be somebody else," said Pauline 
Bell, a Valencia resident who said her three children appear unlikely to be 
transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, members of the district's board of trustees said that three of 
the 28 proposals will be seriously considered. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Transferring about 275 children in the Valencia Summit neighborhood to 
Stevenson Ranch because they are closest to the new school. This is the 
simplest plan, according to McGrath, although some minor modifications may be 
needed to accommodate school scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transferring students currently in the Lakeshore and Fairways neighborhoods 
from Meadows Elementary School to the new school, and adjusting the boundaries 
of some nearby neighborhoods to make up for the loss at Meadows. McGrath said 
this is "probably the least desirable alternative" because the financially 
strapped district would have to pay for an extra bus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transporting students who already take the bus in East Newhall across town 
to Stevenson Ranch, while making several other neighborhood adjustments. 
McGrath said this plan makes "fair game" of any student taking a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of the boundary changes could be felt even by those not living in 
altered areas. All three proposals include a provision that would force 
students who took advantage of an open enrollment policy to attend Meadows 
Elementary School -- one of the most acclaimed in the district -- to return to 
the school closest to their house. 
</P>
<P>
 The only parent to address the board was Malcolm Snead, a Valencia resident 
with two elementary-age children, who criticized the district for opening a 
school in an area without enough students to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very disappointed in the way this was done, with the lack of a coherent 
model," he told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 A new school within the city limits would be best, agreed board President 
Gonzalo Freixes, but not financially feasible because the district would have 
had to pay for both the site and the school. He said the land for the Stevenson 
Ranch location and some additional funding was provided by Dale Poe Development 
Co., the housing project developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members also said that rapid growth is expected at Stevenson Ranch 
during the next several years, which will fill the school to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Two public meetings are scheduled during the next week to enable parents to 
respond to the proposals. The first is at 7 p.m. Monday at Wiley Canyon 
Elementary School, the second is at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Valencia Valley 
Elementary School.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SCHOOL TRUSTEE RESIGNS, 9 APPLY TO REPLACE 
HIM; EDUCATION: GARY DEREVERE, ELECTED LAST YEAR DESPITE DROPPING OUT OF RACE, 
SAYS HIS JOB INTERFERED WITH HIS OBLIGATION TO DISTRICT.

<P>
 Gary DeRevere is finally off the Sulphur Springs Union School District's 
governing board, and this time voters can't do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
 DeRevere, 43, was elected to the board last year even though he had withdrawn 
from the race and stopped campaigning one month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,300 Santa Clarita residents voted for him anyway, giving him the third 
open seat on the district board. DeRevere accepted the post after three weeks 
of contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
 But DeRevere has now resigned because, as he feared would happen, his job as 
an electrical contractor has kept him from giving enough attention to the 
elected post. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, trustees will be interviewing candidates to find a replacement for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine residents have applied for the open seat. They are homemaker Suzanne 
Duncombe, financial analyst Les McClafferty-Helley, animated film director Paul 
Strickland, computer salesman Steven Sturgeon, environmental specialist Douglas 
Varner, telecommunications manager Amnon Wilde and law enforcement officers 
Edward Henneberque, Benjamin Ruth and Winthrop Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 DeRevere's winning the election was even more surprising because he had 
strongly favored the state school voucher initiative, which was buried by a 2-1 
margin statewide. He at first thought he could serve in the post while 
maintaining his contracting business. 
</P>
<P>
 But after resigning, he said the business has been struggling of late, forcing 
him to lay off employees and sell his truck. He said he had no time to attend 
candidate forums, debate district issues or participate in a pre-election 
interview for a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 DeRevere said he regretted having to step down from the post and possibly 
disappointing people who were counting on him. He had no advice for whoever 
takes over his post, but said it would be helpful if they possessed strong 
administrative skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is to care about the kids," DeRevere said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees hope to appoint a new board member before their next formal meeting 
on Dec. 14.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; THIEVES DUMP $10,000 IN COMPUTERS BUT KEEP 
CANDY WORTH UP TO $6,000; CRIME: EQUIPMENT STOLEN FROM SWEET IMPRESSIONS 
SHIPPING COMPANY IS FOUND IN GOOD CONDITION, BUT POLICE STILL SEEK SUSPECTS.

<P>
 The thieves who broke into a local candy shipping business over the weekend 
apparently had a major sweet tooth, but no use for computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than $10,000 worth of computer equipment discovered missing from 
Sweet Impressions Inc. was found Monday a few miles away in the Newhall 
Municipal Court parking lot, said Eric Schwartz, the company's vice president. 
The computers had been wrapped in white plastic and left in a corner of the 
lot. They were undamaged, except that their hard disks had been erased. 
</P>
<P>
 The several hundred pounds of candy taken during the burglary, however, was 
nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really doesn't make any logical sense," Schwartz said. "I'm really blown 
away by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he found the glass front door of the Valencia Industrial Center 
business smashed when he arrived for work at 8 a.m. Saturday. All five office 
computers, the candy and other items had been stolen, he said. Two adjacent 
businesses had also been broken into, but little was reported missing from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he knew right away he had been the victim of a bizarre burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took the shipping invoices out of the computer printer and neatly 
stacked them," Schwartz said. "They didn't ransack the place. They treated us 
with some respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet Impressions designs packages that are filled with candy and other food 
to be shipped to hotels and other commercial agencies, he said. Among the items 
stolen were various types of candy worth from $4,600 to $6,000, and about 
10,000 bulk mail stamps worth 10 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newhall Municipal Court employee arriving at work about 8 a.m. Monday found 
the computers, said Detective John Mundell of the Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station. The employee immediately notified deputies at the sheriff's 
station next door to the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say maybe it's a remorseful thief," Mundell said. "It sounds strange, 
but there have been cases where someone has stolen a car and found out it 
belonged to someone like an old lady because they found her purse in there 
somewhere, and a few days later the stuff in it is mailed back to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is the burglar or burglars had a buyer for the stolen 
merchandise, but the deal fell through, he added. He said the suspect or 
suspects may have chosen to get rid of the computers rather than be caught with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mundell said there are no suspects and that police are still seeking the 
burglar or burglars, remorseful or not.

CITIZEN GROUP CLAIMS BALLOT DISCREPANCIES IN VENICE RACE; ELECTION: SUPPORTERS 
OF CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE SUSAN BROOKS ARE ASKING THE COUNTY TO EXAMINE 
INCORRECT ADDRESSES ON PRECINCT ROSTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens group claimed Wednesday that about 300 voters in Venice cast 
ballots even though the addresses for them on precinct ballot rosters were 
wrong or in some cases, were for residences that have been vacant for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee for Election Integrity, which includes former workers or 
supporters of South Bay congressional candidate Susan Brooks, called on the Los 
Angeles County registrar-recorder to investigate their claims to see if any 
instances of fraud can be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, citing voter irregularities, has not conceded in the 36th 
Congressional District race against Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), who won 
the ballot count by 812 votes. The district runs from Venice to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is very clear that these irregularities are on a much larger 
scale than anyone in a position of responsibility is willing to admit," said El 
Segundo Councilman Liam Weston, who is leading the effort by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's campaign spokesman, Roy Behr, dismissed the efforts as politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have yet to provide a shred of evidence that the alleged irregularities 
would have changed the outcome of the election by one vote," he said. "These 
are run-of-the-mill, standard issues that come up in every campaign across the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Weston, however, cited a specific discrepancy involving an address written by 
a voter at a Venice precinct as an example of the possible irregularities his 
group has found. Next to her signature on the ballot roster, the voter gave her 
address as 659 San Juan Ave. But the home has been vacant since 1991, according 
to its owner, who appeared at a news conference Wednesday with Weston in front 
of the shuttered building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not concluded anything at all at this point," Weston said. "I am not 
suggesting anyone has done anything illegal. I am suggesting that 
irregularities exist that should be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the news conference was Harold Ezell, a key supporter of Proposition 
187, which denies a range of public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell, who is now leading the Voter Fraud Task Force, charged this week that 
77% of the precincts in Harman's district contain "questionable returns." In a 
separate study, he cites instances where the vote counts kept by precinct 
workers did not match the certified count of the Los Angeles County registrar 
of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Orange County has to file for bankruptcy, the Los Angeles County registrar 
ought to file for bankruptcy because of the way they handled this election," 
Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Weston's group found the 300 cases after canvassing about 1,200 
homes in seven Venice precincts, Weston said. Workers tried to contact voters 
over the phone, through the mail and at their homes to determine where they 
lived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call them 300 mysteries," Weston said. "It's not empirical evidence. It's 
the best evidence that we gathered." 
</P>
<P>
 The 36th Congressional District contains 547 precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County registrar-recorder spokeswoman Marcia Ventura said that 
they have so far found no evidence of voter fraud. And she said that neither 
Weston's group nor Ezell's task force has filed a formal complaint with the 
office.

OFF THE CUFF; THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR TALKIN' ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A s the store manager of Howard & Phil's Western Wear in the Brea Mall, Brett 
Owens is jazzed that he gets to work in Wranglers, a cowboy shirt, boots and a 
Stetson. Another thing, Owens can listen to his kind of music without anybody 
thinking he's a hick.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's finally catching up to my style of dress and music," says Owens, 
41. "I went the suit-and-tie route in my younger years and was never 
comfortable. I've traveled all over the world in my boots and in some places, 
like Istanbul, I got some odd stares. But now I'm comfortable, and it's 
acceptable."  
</P>
<P>
 Boots are his specialty. He knows how to fit 'em and how to care for 'em.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allows people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I love my boots. Right now I'm wearing Lucchese cowhide, the 1883 style, which 
is the first year Lucchese made boots. I have six pairs of boots. Once you buy 
one, you want more. Some of my customers tell the story that their closet space 
is getting smaller because their boot collection is getting bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 You shouldn't wear the same boot every day, because it's not good for the 
leather. If properly cared for, a good cowboy boot will last for years. That's 
where the value comes in. A hundred years ago, a pair cost a month's pay. In 
relation to that, cowboy boots are not that expensive today. The average 
leather boot is $200. 
</P>
<P>
 The two biggest things you need to know to take care of a boot is: You need to 
condition the exterior leather and use a cedar boot tree when you're not in it. 
The worst things for your boots are water, salt and acid -- the composition of 
sweat. Cedar draws these out of the leather. If you don't put a good 
conditioner on the exterior, a year or two down the line the boots are going 
down the drain. That's a shame, because they could last many, many years if 
taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't have a typical client. I look across the store right now, and there's 
a guy who's very high up in the gas company buying boots and a couple of 
younger guys looking at biker boots. It's across the board. I've got boots that 
run $2,000 a pair and boots for $100, depending on what they're made of and who 
makes them. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a gentleman in his late 60s who always loved cowboy boots but couldn't 
wear them because he couldn't get a proper fit. His foot was stepped on by a 
horse when he was a teen-ager, and he could never get boots to fit him right. 
I've been able to fit him, and he's bought three pairs now. 
</P>
<P>
 Boot fits differently than a shoe. A boot is measured in the length of your 
arch, not the length of your foot. 
</P>
<P>
 A boot should feel like a slipper that covers your whole foot. If you're 
trying on a boot that's too tight and a salesperson tries to tell you that it 
will fit better when you break it in, walk away. That's baloney to say that it 
will feel more comfortable. A boot should feel comfortable when you first put 
it on, and it should become more comfortable as you break it in. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is that different skins by the same maker and in the same size 
will fit differently.  
</P>
<P>
 I mostly sell exotic skins: lizards and ostrich. The animals used for these 
boots are all farmed. There are no endangered animals used. California has 
restrictions on what kinds can come into the state -- python is illegal in 
California; sea turtle is illegal here, and elephant is illegal everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always heard the saying, "They died with their boots on," and honestly I 
don't know what that means, but I have a possibility. A hundred years ago, 
there was no left or right foot boot. One fits all. When a cowboy got his 
boots, he'd step into the water trough and get them wet, then wear the boots 
until they shrunk and conformed to his foot. I think the reason they died with 
their boots on is they couldn't get them off.

CLOSET RX; USE YOUR BRAIN TO PICK YOUR POCKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 A purse would solve a lot of problems for some guys. They have their slacks 
pockets stuffed with a fat billfold, mobile phone, assorted papers, receipts 
and a fist-sized ring of keys. But while toting around a handbag may be 
practical, it's also a way to get some odd looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, your pockets should not to be used at all. By parking your hand, or a 
big wallet, in a pocket, you're stretching the fabric, ruining pleats and 
spoiling the look of a good trouser. So how do you carry all you need and keep 
looking neat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Reduce what you carry," says Chrissy Simmons of Brooks Bros. in Newport 
Beach. "Many men are carrying smaller, thinner billfolds. These have their 
license and one or two credit cards; then they carry a money clip in their 
front pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional credit and business cards can be stored in a locked briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try not to put anything in your back pocket," says clothing buyer Bill 
Rigioni of Huntington Beach, "you can wear down the fabric around a fat 
wallet." 
</P>
<P>
 A big key ring can cause some unsightly bulges, unless you can carry a key 
fold or case. These keep your keys in a flat position. If you have a car alarm 
transmitter, try hooking it up to one of the case rings, but don't try to 
enclose it in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many of your storage problems can be solved by always taking your 
sport or suit coat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inside pockets of your jacket are designed to handle a wallet or 
checkbook," Simmons says. Remember that side pockets are meant to be 
non-functional. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pocket that's meant to be decorative is on your shirt.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it's come from the cleaners, it's often starched closed," Rigioni says. 
"It should stay that way all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Store a pen in your front slack pocket or on the inside of your jacket. 
Sunglasses can be worn with a chain or cord that lets you hang them down when 
you step inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, those symbols of modern society -- the cellular phone and beeper -- 
can also present storage problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "The latest phones on the market are very slim," Simmons says. "They're 
another item for your jacket pocket, but a thin model can also be put in your 
slacks if you're not wearing a jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 While their clips make beepers easy to latch onto a waistband, use the 
thinner, buzzing-style that fits in your slacks.  
</P>
<P>
 "Few things ruin the look of a nice outfit than a big, black beeper on your 
waist," Simmons says.

YOUNG 'BLUE EYES' DOES IT HIS WAY -- WELL, SORT OF; POP MUSIC: FRANK SINATRA 
JR. SOUNDS REMARKABLY LIKE HIS FATHER, WHICH SEEMS TO DELIGHT HIS LISTENERS. 
BUT THE SIMILARITY HAS ALSO WORKED AGAINST HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If it looks like a Sinatra, and it talks like a Sinatra, and it sings like a 
Sinatra, it's got to be . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Right, a Sinatra. No electronic duets, no manufactured videos. Just a real, 
live Frank Sinatra. But, in this case, a real, live Frank Sinatra Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although the face is a little more moon-shaped than the classic, gaunt 
look of the elder (at least in his younger years), and the macho style has been 
replaced by a gentle amiability, the sound -- that ineffable Sinatra sound -- 
is almost uncannily similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to have people say I sound like Frank Sinatra," said 
50-year-old Frank Sinatra Jr. Tuesday afternoon while doing an audio check for 
a performance with his band that evening at the Moonlight Tango Cafe. "Don't 
you think that Noel Blanc is happy that his father, Mel Blanc, taught him how 
to do the voices of Bugs Bunny and all those other characters? I mean, Frank 
Sinatra is one of the great performers in pop music history. Why shouldn't I be 
delighted to carry on his tradition?" 
</P>
<P>
 If the size and look of the sold-out crowd for Sinatra's two sets offered any 
indication, a lot of patrons also were delighted that he's carrying on the 
tradition. The sidewalk outside the club was jammed with customers jostling to 
get in, cars were double and triple parked, and the palpable sense of urgency 
must have been very comparable to that in New York City's Times Square during 
Sinatra Sr.'s Paramount Theatre appearances in the early '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moonlight Tango, with its mirrored walls, crowded tables and scurrying 
waiters, already has the feel of a World War II-era nightclub. With a 20-piece 
band crammed onto a tiny stage, Sinatra singing such tunes as "Lover," 
"Lollipops and Roses" and "Girl Talk," and a well-dressed, overflow crowd 
dotted with Hollywood celebrities, the evening had a real deja vu quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one important distinction I make, though," added Sinatra Jr. "It's OK 
if people say I sound like Frank Sinatra. I just don't want them to think I am 
Frank Sinatra." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a distinction the younger Sinatra has been trying to make for most of his 
life. In 1963, with his singing career just getting under way, he was kidnaped 
for ransom. Despite the ultimate conviction and jailing of the kidnapers, the 
case tended to underscore Sinatra's visibility in the public mind, not as a 
performer in his own right, but as the offspring of a far more famous 
entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 His quest for professional independence was further muddled by his persistent 
similarity to the elder Sinatra's sound and rhythmic phrasing. It was all right 
for singers such as Steve Lawrence, Jack Jones and others to do their own 
versions of the classic Sinatra style. The public, to some extent, and the 
critics, in particular, seemed less accepting of the son's far more 
legitimately earned extension of his father's music. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently -- for the last seven or eight years -- Sinatra Jr. has been 
largely slowed by his work as his father's orchestra conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do about 24 weeks a year with him," he said. Sinatra Jr.'s own bookings are 
placed "in between the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he dedicates so much time to creating a supportive musical 
environment for his father, Sinatra looked puzzled by the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because he needs me," the good Italian son finally replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not so surprising a response from Sinatra, whose admiration for his 
father appears limitless: 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say? He's phenomenal. I tell young singers today, 'Listen 
carefully, because you're never going to hear that kind of singing again.' And 
it took a real devotion. He had a sound in his head that he wanted to hear, and 
he kept working and working until he got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the superficial similarities, the younger Sinatra's own approach to 
his music is focused differently -- less self-centered and a clear reflection 
of a more guarded personality. He was quick to specify, both via individual 
conversation and in his announcements to the audience, that he does not work as 
a singer with accompaniment but as one member of a 20-piece musical 
organization. It is a statement that Sinatra Sr., who has been the unquestioned 
center of attention of every musical situation since his early days with Tommy 
Dorsey, would probably never have made. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sinatra Jr. means what he says. His arrangements, many of them modeled 
after the complex orchestrations of the Sauter-Finnegan band, gave equal 
billing to his talented players. His tunes -- one of which featured his harpist 
-- were chosen for their appropriateness as big band jazz numbers as much as 
for their value as vocal pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Most curious of all was the manner in which he used his voice. Blessed with a 
superb natural instrument, Sinatra treated it in strikingly casual fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, concentrating on making announcements, interacting with the audience 
and leading the ensemble, he simply tossed away his vocals -- just another solo 
from one of the musicians. At other times, especially during his warm reading 
of "More Than You Know" and a duo with guitarist Ron Anthony (Sinatra Sr.'s 
longtime accompanist) on "Lollipops and Roses," the inimitable Sinatra sound 
and phrasing took over. 
</P>
<P>
 His up-tempo vocals had the feel of a horn player, cruising across the top of 
the rhythm, dipping in and out of the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me," Sinatra said, "the arrangement should fit in the cracks, not the 
voice. The voice goes with the rhythm section; you make yourself one of the 
rhythm players. I really feel that the old show-biz adage is true: If you can 
get your audience to tap their toes on the swing tunes, you're halfway home." 
</P>
<P>
 In his better moments, and there were many, Sinatra's singing was every bit 
the equal of some of his father's best work. Heard in isolation, without the 
distracting presence of historical references and family predecessors, he would 
have to be considered one of the finest, jazz-based vocalists in contemporary 
mainstream music. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the Moonlight Tango jam-packed because of the quality of Frank Sinatra 
Jr.'s singing, or because of the sheer magic of the Sinatra name? It's hard to 
say. Either way, the listeners got to hear a rare evening of quality, 
jazz-oriented music. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're wondering about the Heidi Fleiss/Frank Sinatra Jr. gossip, 
here's Sinatra's final word: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how all this stuff gets started. Heidi Fleiss I befriended 
because she and I went through something of the same nature. And when word 
reached the tabloids, bless their little hearts, they decided here was 
something they could make money with. They even had it in one of the papers 
last weekend that she and I were going to run off to Vegas and get married. 
That's a lot of horse dump. Do you know what would happen if she left L.A. 
right now? They'd lock her up and throw the key away. She knows that and so do 
I." 
</P>
<P>
 Case, hopefully, closed. 
</P>
<P>

TOP OFFICIAL AT SOUTHWEST MUSEUM QUITS; ART: DIRECTOR THOMAS H. WILSON CITES 
FAMILY OBLIGATIONS IN ANNOUNCING HIS RESIGNATION, BUT ALSO EXPRESSES 
FRUSTRATION OVER THE LACK OF COMMUNITY AND CIVIC SUPPORT TO HELP THE 
80-YEAR-OLD INSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing family commitments and professional frustrations, Thomas H. Wilson has 
resigned as director of the Southwest Museum. The surprise announcement was 
made at a board of trustees meeting Wednesday morning at the historic museum in 
Highland Park, which houses one of the world's finest collections of Native 
American art in a beloved but woefully inadequate facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's resignation is effective Jan. 2, but he will be retained as a 
consultant during a search for his successor, according to Thomas E. Holliday, 
president of the museum's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 46, has presided over the 80-year-old institution since July, 1992, 
during a troubled period when the trustees considered proposals to move the 
museum and its fragile and enormously valuable collections to a 
better-equipped, more modern facility in Southern California. Yielding to 
pressure from community groups and from Mayor Richard Riordan -- who made a 
public promise in November, 1993 to help refurbish and expand the museum on its 
present site -- the board decided to keep the museum at its historic home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Wilson chided Riordan and community groups for 
failing to follow through with support. Wilson said that nothing has come of 
the mayor's promise to appoint a Blue Ribbon committee to spearhead the 
renovation and expansion. The museum needs at least 25,000 square feet of 
additional space, he said, adding that problems of inadequate parking and 
access must also be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he emphasized that personal reasons compelled his decision. "Whenever you 
make a major decision in life, it always involves a complex mix of causes and 
effects," Wilson said, explaining that the primary reason for his departure is 
a desire to join his wife and two high-school-age children who have remained at 
his home in Westchester County, N.Y., during his 2 1/2-year sojourn in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these frustrations, Wilson said he is pleased with his accomplishments 
during a "transitional period." In addition to considering 80 proposals to move 
the museum and deciding to expand on the present site, he has overseen several 
improvements. An effort to restore the museum's old elevator and tunnel 
entrance is under way. An ethno-botanical garden opened over Thanksgiving 
weekend, and a simulated archeological site is under construction outside the 
museum. During his tenure, the museum has presented 25 exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition spaces have been repainted and carpeted, Wilson noted. In 
addition, the staff has completed a survey of the museum's holdings and drafted 
a conservation plan. With the help of the Ahmanson Foundation, the textile 
collection has been moved off-site for study and conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the Southwest's problems are specifically related to its 
antiquated building and vast collections, the museum shares concerns of other 
arts institutions in Los Angeles, Wilson said. Attendance has fallen at many 
local museums and the Southwest is no exception, he said, noting a drop in 
attendance from 75,000 in the fiscal year of 1992-93 to 60,000 in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Public and private support of arts institutions has also decreased during the 
recession, he said. Noting that monies formerly earmarked for the arts have 
been shifted to such deserving causes as social services, he said, "It is time 
for some soul-searching about what arts institutions mean to the city and its 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Museums are very fragile institutions," Wilson said. "I hope that as the 
economy recovers in Los Angeles, corporate and foundation support will return 
in a high-profile way. Without these arts institutions, we may have people with 
healthy bodies but without healthy souls." 
</P>
<P>
 Board president Holliday said he regrets Wilson's resignation but that he is 
sympathetic to the departing director's desire to return to his family. Trustee 
Daniel E. Wolfus will head the museum's search committee for a new director. A 
managing committee of trustees, chaired by Richard Gilman, president emeritus 
of Occidental College, will fulfill the director's day-to-day functions in the 
interim, Holliday said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, an anthropologist who has held administrative positions at the Center 
of African Art in New York and the National Endowment for the Humanities, said 
he does not have another position lined up. "I will consider a variety of 
options," he said, "but museums are my first love." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southwest Museum becomes the second major institution locally to be 
without a director, joining the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where the top 
post has been vacant since August, 1993.

FOX TAKES AIM AT BOOSTING SUNDAY PRIME-TIME LINEUP; TELEVISION: NEW PROGRAMMING 
CHIEF JOHN MATOIAN JUGGLES THE LINEUP, PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The new programming chief at Fox indicated Wednesday that he was not 
immediately planning a dramatic shift in direction for the network, but instead 
will try to bolster its existing prime-time schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first public comments since being named to the position in September, 
Fox Entertainment Group President John Matoian also expressed hope that Fox 
would have a late-night show by the fall of 1995 and said the network is moving 
forward with the development of a newsmagazine for next year but backing off 
from its production of made-for-TV movies about living celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Matoian told a news conference that he was particularly concerned with the 
Sunday night situation. Although Fox outbid CBS for the NFL's Sunday afternoon 
football package this season, the acquisition has not boosted prime-time 
ratings. Two new Sunday series, "Fortune Hunter" and "Wild Oats," drew dismal 
ratings and were canceled soon after they premiered this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be lying if I said it wasn't disappointing," Matoian said, saying 
that the audience "immediately rejected" those shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Jan. 8, repeats of "The Simpsons" will air at 7 p.m., followed at 
7:30 p.m. by the debut of a new version of the classic secret agent spoof "Get 
Smart," with original cast members Don Adams and Barbara Feldon. New episodes 
of "The Simpsons" will continue to air at 8 p.m. At 8:30 p.m., Fox has 
scheduled "House of Buggin," a new sketch comedy show starring John Leguizamo. 
"Married . . . With Children" will stay at 9 p.m., to be followed at 9:30 by 
"Dream On," a comedy previously seen on cable's HBO pay service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Encounters: The Hidden Truth" will have its last regular broadcast in the 
Sunday 7 p.m. slot on Dec. 18. "The George Carlin Show," which currently airs 
at 9:30 p.m. Sundays, will be off the air as of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shift will be the switching of the teen drama "Party of Five" with 
"Models Inc." Beginning Jan. 2, "Models Inc." will move to Mondays at 9 p.m., 
following "Melrose Place." On Jan. 4, "Party of Five" will air Wednesdays at 9 
p.m. behind "Beverly Hills, 90210." Both pairings should prove more compatible, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Matoian said that Fox had entered into a multi-picture agreement with Hallmark 
Entertainment to produce original family-oriented movies for the network. 
"'Hallmark Entertainment Presents" will premiere in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 With the poor performance of made-for-TV movies about Roseanne Arnold and 
Madonna on the network this season, Matoian said Fox would be backing away from 
developing movie biographies of celebrities. "I don't think the audience wants 
to see people play real people," he said. "Also, these movies were not about 
people who had enough untold stories to intrigue people to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fox still plans to broadcast movies about Mia Farrow and football legend 
O.J. Simpson, who is on trial for the murder of his ex-wife and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Matoian, who said he was having "the best time of my life" at Fox, formerly 
was president of the Fox Family Films division of 20th Century Fox. He 
previously had been at CBS, where he had been senior vice president for movies 
for television and miniseries, heading the division that made such films as 
"Gypsy," "To Dance With the White Dog" and "David's Mother."

CITIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS FACING MANY 'WHAT IFS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The 600 employees of Orange County's sanitation district got paychecks 
Wednesday -- and word that they might not get their next one. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, a routine order for 8,000 gallons of gasoline for school buses 
was turned down. The vendor would part with 1,000, but no more, because of 
uncertainties surrounding Orange County's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim stopped hiring. Stanton halted all major projects. The renovation of 
La Habra's elementary school was put on indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking everyone to batten down the hatches. We won't be spending a 
nickel we don't have to," Huntington Beach Treasurer Donald Watson said. "If 
this were a household, it'd be kind of like putting meat and potatoes on the 
table, but not getting to have the apple pie." 
</P>
<P>
 Across Orange County on Wednesday, officials in cities, school systems and 
special districts sought to calm worried staffs and constituents even as they 
struggled to come to terms with an economic landscape that was drastically 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most officials said they have the funds to meet immediate payrolls, buy 
supplies and honor commitments to vendors but expressed concerns about the 
future, especially if their money remains frozen for long in the county's 
troubled investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the county's city managers and city attorneys huddled in an emergency 
meeting Wednesday afternoon, working out strategies for coping with the crisis 
brought on by Orange County's decision Tuesday to file Chapter 9 bankruptcy. 
The group, which will meet again today, is considering hiring a single law firm 
to represent its interests as it attempts to recoup its investments from the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the county Department of Education also spent all day behind closed 
doors with two attorneys from a Riverside firm that specializes in bankruptcy 
and bonds. The California School Boards Assn. and the state Department of 
Education also have been asked to help and will send representatives to a 
meeting this afternoon of the county's 31 superintendents and finance officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the child of the county, and the children have to be taken care of. 
It's as simple as that," said Paul Possemato, superintendent of the Laguna 
Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most disturbing aspects of the current situation, many officials 
said, is that they have had little communication with county authorities and, 
one day after the bankruptcy filing, have only limited knowledge of what impact 
it may hold for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just entered a whole new world and it is a little scary," said Gerard 
Goedhart, assistant city manager of Los Alamitos. "It makes us nervous when we 
don't have any communication with the county. We're not panicked at the moment, 
but we would like more information from the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly tainted by their association with the once-respected county 
government, many cities that had invested in the troubled bond pool saw their 
own credit ratings tumble Wednesday. Standard & Poor's rating service announced 
that as a precautionary measure it had placed participants in the county fund 
on a lowered status known as "credit watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities and agencies also announced Wednesday that they had taken steps 
to stop investing revenues in the county fund. At least two cities, Orange and 
Mission Viejo, have asked the county to send city property tax payments 
directly to them, not to the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Transportation Authority officials announced Wednesday night 
that they had stopped depositing Measure M sales tax receipts in the fund. The 
measure, passed in 1991, authorized a half-cent sales tax to pay for transit 
and freeway improvements throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are significant and serious issues. We are proceeding cautiously and 
professionally. We're doing everything possible to maintain the integrity of 
our transportation program," said Stan Oftelie, chief executive officer of the 
transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as some city officials sought to curtail payments to the fund, others 
worried about the impact of the bankruptcy on the county's disbursement of city 
property taxes that are due Saturday, questioning whether those funds also 
might be frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, warned Huntington Beach city treasurer Watson, chaos could result for 
many cities -- like his -- that count on the money for operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without that, Huntington Beach is entering an era of severe 
belt-tightening, he said, since it had counted on withdrawing $3 million to $6 
million a month for operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to find other ways to keep ourselves afloat," he said. "Anything 
that can be put off will be. We will continue to meet our payroll, our 
obligations to our vendors, but we will not take on new and additional 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, City Manager David Ream said the city's day-to-day operations 
will not be affected, but he was troubled about the possible impact on such 
major projects as a $100-million city jail and police administration building 
now under construction in the civic center. 
</P>
<P>
 With the structure 20% completed, "we will definitely need some answers within 
the next 30 to 60 days to determine whether these projects will go forward," 
Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim, which has $169 million invested in the county pool, said it is 
delaying capital improvement projects and instituting a hiring freeze until the 
full impact of the county's bankruptcy is known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city is going to be reasonably safe," City Manager James D. Ruth 
said. "The best thing that can happen is if everyone remains calm and we work 
through this together and not panic." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also said that despite Orange County's financial woes, they 
will continue negotiating with the Angels to build a new stadium, and the group 
working to keep the Rams in Southern California will continue pursuing 
construction of a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a wide-ranging proposal to prevent the Rams from fleeing to St. 
Louis or Baltimore in 1995, the Save the Rams task force last summer offered to 
renovate Anaheim Stadium, a $60-million project that would have been funded, in 
large part, by revenue bonds, which are guaranteed by taxpayers but paid for 
with stadium revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 But the local group recently began exploring the possibility of building a new 
football stadium, as part of a lavish sports and entertainment complex, on the 
Anaheim Stadium lot, a project that would cost about $200 million but would be 
financed by area corporations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a pretty strong plan in the works that I can't say too much about, 
but it's all based on private financing," said Frank Bryant, president of 
Irvine-based Traveland U.S.A. and a Save the Rams member. "It might also 
include (financial) input from the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Bryant said county funds or bonds would not be needed for the project, 
he believes the county's bankruptcy filing will make it even more difficult to 
save the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact will be more psychological than real," Bryant said. "Other NFL 
owners might not think we're as good an area as we were before. I'm sure the 
Rams will be skeptical, but luckily county funding was never part of any 
guarantees we gave the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ruth said a master planning study of the stadium area might be 
delayed, that won't slow discussions with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new stadium would be contingent on whatever impact (the bankruptcy filing) 
has," Ruth said. "But we intend to proceed with negotiations and try to resolve 
any issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the Walt Disney Company, who have proposed a $3-billion 
expansion for Disneyland, said they planned to meet with Anaheim officials next 
week to discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to speculate on what the impacts might be," said David Malmuth, 
vice president of Disney Development. "We remain very optimistic about 
long-term business projects and doing business with Anaheim and Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the city's $172-million urban face lift of the area surrounding 
Disneyland will continue for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, meanwhile, reassured by the county's promise late in the day 
to process payroll as normal Friday for 28,000 school employees, said they 
believe Orange County's bankruptcy filing will stabilize the financial crisis 
and allow them to continue business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many administrators spent the day in crisis management, fielding phone 
calls from anxious employees, vendors and community members and scrambling to 
understand the complex, unprecedented legal and financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the worst parts of this whole debacle is the lack of information," 
said Paul Reed, deputy superintendent of Irvine Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Most districts were not communicating directly with the county treasurer's 
office, but going through the Department of Education instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Wenkart, the county Department of Education's attorney, said Wednesday 
the private attorneys were researching all options available to school 
districts to free them from the legal requirement that all their money be 
funneled through the county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it mean? What's the effect of the bankruptcy? What are our 
options?" Wenkart said, summarizing the questions he'd been asking the experts 
all day. "We've got a lot of ideas, but I can't comment on those." 
</P>
<P>
 In other districts, administrators attempted to calm employees with memos 
promising on-time paychecks and to reassure vendors wondering whether they 
would be paid for providing services. Several districts called emergency board 
meetings for the coming days to brief trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Steele, an administrator in the Saddleback Valley Unified district, 
said principals were told that essential spending would be approved. La Habra 
Supt. Rich Harman said the remodeling plans for Las Lomas Elementary -- in the 
works for years -- were in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 And Possemato, who runs the Laguna Beach school system, said the district 
might consider filing bankruptcy itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at all the options, I think it becomes necessary for us to protect 
ourselves. I think school districts will look at that option," he said. "That's 
not alarmist, that's just trying to find the answers. For superintendents, 
trying to hold the fort down here, it's very difficult for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But after marathon meetings and long hours of telephone briefings, most 
administrators were still urging a united front and a wait-and-see attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember a quote of FDR's that 'the greatest thing we have to fear is fear 
itself,' " Saddleback Valley Supt. Peter A. Hartman said. "The fear of the 
unknown is always something that isn't productive."

ORANGE COUNTY OFFICIALS URGE CALM AS CRISIS FALLOUT SPREADS; FINANCES: WEARY 
LEADERS SEEK TO REASSURE INVESTORS, EMPLOYEES AND RESIDENTS AFTER BANKRUPTCY 
FILING. SOME CITY AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS MAKE PLANS IN CASE SITUATION WORSENS.

 A day after Orange County declared bankruptcy to ward off creditors, its weary 
leaders appealed for calm and sought to assure the investment world, county 
employees and dozens of agencies with billions of dollars tied up in its frozen 
investment fund that civic life could go on. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the county made those pleas, however, city and school officials began 
calculating that they soon might run out of money if they cannot claim money 
from the fund; some planned for the inevitability of their own bankruptcy 
filings if the crisis deepens. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tense and nervous. I wish they would send me our $24 million," 
said Saddleback Community College District Chancellor Robert A. Lombardi. "The 
only thing I can add is we're trying to operate without getting everybody 
scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors were insistent Wednesday that all county and school 
payrolls would be met and that no one's taxes would be raised because of the 
financial turmoil. The fate of some major projects -- such as new courthouses 
and a possible stadium project in Anaheim -- remained uncertain, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to assure the residents of Orange County and the world investment 
community that Orange County has the wherewithal to resolve this situation in 
an orderly fashion," said Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as one of the nation's wealthiest counties reeled from the news that it 
had defaulted on a $1.2-billion loan, stumbling into the biggest municipal 
financial collapse in history, the aftershocks continued: 
</P>
<P>
 * City managers from across the county held an emergency session to plot 
strategy and hire their own bankruptcy attorney. Anaheim, with $169 million in 
the fund, froze all hiring and halted capital improvement projects. Orange 
County Water District officials said they will not be able to meet their next 
payroll in two weeks unless they can tap into the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxpayers flooded county offices to ask whether they still had to pay 
property taxes due Monday -- as, indeed, they must. One man was so irate on 
seeing the framed photograph of former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron 
hanging on a wall that he threatened to come back with a gun if the photo was 
not taken down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laguna Beach Unified Supt. Paul Possemato said that some school districts 
may follow the county's lead and file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. La 
Habra City School District officials said they would likely put on hold a 
$1.5-million elementary school expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Washington, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said he would 
consider raising interest rates again in January to forestall inflation. That 
could prove another blow to the county's investment holdings, which tumbled in 
value as interest rates soared. Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey said he was 
closely monitoring the county's situation and watching for reaction in the 
world market. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal agency that oversees 
futures and commodities markets, announced that it would step up its efforts to 
investigate Wall Street firms that place local governments, such as Orange 
County, in risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipal bond values slumped nationwide as investors responded fearfully to 
Orange County's bankruptcy. Mutual fund companies said there was no rush on the 
part of individual investors to sell California municipal bond funds. But 
federal regulators said some fund parent firms plan to buy Orange County bonds 
now in fund portfolios, to calm public jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders reported that some Orange County bonds and bonds of municipalities 
were being priced in the market at just 50 to 80 cents on the dollar Wednesday 
-- but that virtually no bonds were actually changing hands at those prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Standard & Poor's Corp., a major credit rating agency, followed through on 
its pledge to lower the county's bond rating to below investment grade status. 
That will make the cost of borrowing exorbitant for county government. The 
rating agency notified cities, schools and special districts with money in the 
fund that they had been put on negative credit watch, the usual step before a 
downgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Payments were briefly delayed for Orange County vendors, though officials 
said check processing would resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 * There were no hearings on the county's twin bankruptcy filings -- one for 
itself, one for the investment pool. Challenges to the filings are expected 
from taxpayer groups and some of the giant investment banks that lent money to 
the county, but none materialized Wednesday. Pointing Fingers 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rogers, a longtime member of a county taxpayers's association, hired an 
attorney to contest the bankruptcy court cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way this county is insolvent," Rogers said. "Absolutely no way." 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, county officials lashed out at the federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission, which is investigating the county's portfolio for possible 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner said he believes the SEC, which the 
county had begged for help in freezing its investment fund short of a 
bankruptcy filing, wanted a "meltdown" of the pool so it could pressure 
Congress for power to regulate the municipal securities market. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the SEC is concerned, we're not responsible for the financial 
condition of this county," said William McLucas, head of enforcement for the 
agency. "It's absolutely absurd. Somebody must have been smoking something or 
dropped in from planet Mars." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Chief Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider pointed blame for 
the financial disaster squarely at Citron, who resigned Sunday. "The 
responsibility for managing the pool lies with a separately elected official -- 
and that was Bob Citron," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 A management team of county department leaders and major investors was being 
assembled to review the county's future investments. Officials said the 
county's 18,000 workers will be updated on their employer's fiscal health 
through an electronic phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is not broke," said bankruptcy attorney Bruce Bennett, who is 
working with the county to devise a financial reorganization plan. "The county 
is not going out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Street investment bankers said Wednesday that the Chapter 9 filing 
could have been prevented, but that some major brokerages had lost faith in 
county leaders and saw no support coming from state lawmakers in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wall Street was dying for leadership on this," said one investment banker who 
spoke on the condition that he not be named. "The logical place for it to have 
come from was Sacramento, but we saw nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The banker also said there was discord within the Wall Street community. CS 
First Boston Corp. -- which precipitated the bankruptcy by calling in $1.2 
billion in loans to the county -- took its action without consulting Merrill 
Lynch & Co. or Morgan Stanley & Co., the county's other big lenders, this 
banker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's failure to make a $1.2-billion payment to First Boston prompted 
the firm to sell $2 billion in securities it held as collateral, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a combination of them getting increasingly nervous and also 
frustrated with their inability to get to the decision-makers in the county," 
the banker said. "But I also think they just panicked." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Nomura Securities in New York was said to have called in loans it 
had made to the county, after its parent firm in Japan ordered its U.S. 
managers "to get out," a Wall Street source said. Nomura was said to have put 
$500 million in county securities up for sale Wednesday afternoon. Trying to 
Assess Losses 
</P>
<P>
 One question the county has yet to answer is how big a loss it took on the $2 
billion securities sale by First Boston. Wall Street sources estimated that the 
loss would have been about 20%, meaning that the county realized a $400 million 
loss on its portfolio. Until Tuesday, the county had lost money only on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch continued to say it will stand by the county and that it has not 
withdrawn $2 billion in credit extended to the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But the giant firm's supportive position may soon become a burden, some Wall 
Street executives said, because Merrill Lynch is unlikely to single-handedly 
take on the job of financing the county's portfolio if other firms continue to 
walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, officials of Smith Barney Inc., which has $800 million in 
credit outstanding to the county fund, said they were not contemplating any 
liquidation of Orange County holdings pledged as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 But the firm added that it believed it has the right to liquidate its position 
if the county fails to make timely payments -- regardless of the Chapter 9 
bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the automatic stay under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code 
does not apply" to its loan, Smith Barney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 9 freezes a government's assets, protecting them from creditors, but 
allows the agency to retain control of its money and continue running its 
government as attorneys and financial advisers untangle the financial mess. 
</P>
<P>
 But filings like Orange County's -- which are extremely rare -- can also lead 
to a host of fiscal woes, including a ruined credit rating that can prevent 
local governments from selling bonds to raise money for public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts believe that even with the Chapter 9 filing, Orange County 
will not escape lenders, like First Boston, which move to sell the county's 
collateral if loan payments are not made on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in cities, school systems and special districts countywide sought to 
calm worried staffs and constituents, even as they struggled to come to terms 
with an economic landscape that appeared drastically altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials said they have sufficient money to meet immediate 
payrolls, purchase supplies and honor commitments to vendors but expressed 
concerns about the future, especially if their monies remain frozen for long in 
the county's troubled investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were a household, it'd be kind of like putting meat and potatoes on 
the table, but not getting to have the apple pie," said Huntington Beach City 
Manager Donald L. Watson. "We're asking everyone to batten down the hatches. We 
won't be spending a nickel we don't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said ongoing projects that are 
dependent upon money invested in the fund -- such as the expansion of the Santa 
Ana Freeway and the building of the San Joaquin Hills toll road -- may be in 
more jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the money is invested in the fund, right now, for those large projects, 
for the time being there won't be a distribution," he said. Asked how long the 
"time being" would last, Bennett said he was unsure. Rescue Plans Explored 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America officials, who loaned the state billions of dollars this year 
so it could overcome a budget deficit, are flying from San Francisco to Orange 
County today to meet with officials from the county and Orange County 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think very important resources are coming forward to help," said Steiner 
about the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Sacramento and Orange County expressed frustration with each 
other for not preventing the crisis. County leaders accused state 
administrators of not coming to the county's aid, despite repeated pleas for 
loans and even a bailout. State leaders say they were rebuffed in their 
attempts to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the state Department of Finance said it was still too early to 
tell what aid the state could provide, but suggested one scenario that recently 
occurred to avert a financial crisis in Merced County. In that case, state 
officials agreed to let the county defer payments to the state for some 
programs, most notably a contract with the state Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the day's turmoil, bankruptcy lawyer Bennett said: "I really can't 
point to any particular thing that is the next step" in the still unfolding 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 No hearings are yet scheduled in Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we're devoting all of our efforts right now to finding sensible 
solutions for the (county's investment) problems," he said. "That's the most 
important thing that I'm working on, that's the most important thing that 
everybody else is working on. The highest priority is forming a plan to get the 
county out (of this crisis)."

WARNING CAME TOO LATE FOR PRECARIOUS FUND; CRISIS: CITRON AIDE SAW DANGER AND 
THREATENED TO QUIT. BANKRUPTCY MOVE FOLLOWED COUNTY'S FRANTIC BAILOUT SEARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a defining moment in what would become the county's worst financial 
crisis. In early November, Orange County Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe met 
with his since-departed boss, Robert L. Citron, and threatened to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said Wednesday that Raabe was worried about Citron's 
management of the gigantic bond portfolio that contained billions of dollars 
invested by more than 185 municipalities and government agencies. Raabe feared 
a cash flow crisis, and he thought the pool was in serious jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few days before, the Irvine Ranch Water District had sent the county 
treasurer a letter expressing similar concerns about the bond portfolio. Citron 
did not flinch. It was as if he was in denial, official sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unraveling had clearly begun. On Tuesday, county government -- its options 
apparently exhausted and its financial SOS to the state and the Clinton 
Administration unanswered -- filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in 
United States history. 
</P>
<P>
 The fateful decision to seek protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code was reached after a long and frustrating attempt by county leaders, 
attorneys and major investors to salvage the bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just trying to hang in there and make a bad situation better and get 
some control of it," Steven E. Lewis, the county's auditor-controller, said of 
the effort to cope with financial crisis. "We went everywhere looking for help. 
In the end, I don't think we had much choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe's threat to resign was a watershed event for county officials, who 
shortly thereafter began to take seriously the prospect that Citron's 
aggressive investment strategy had placed investors and local governments 
squarely in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron and Raabe, sources said, met with County Administrative Officer Ernie 
Schneider to discuss the pool's problems. Schneider formed a management team of 
county officials to review the status of the $20-billion portfolio. Then, 
during the first few weeks of November, Schneider individually briefed members 
of the county Board of Supervisors and revealed that the fund had liquidity 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Citron, Schneider nor Raabe could be reached for comment Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews this week, county supervisors all said they had no idea how 
severe the bond portfolio's troubles were until the weekend before the 
bankruptcy petition was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The speed with which these events have transpired is of shocking 
proportions," said County Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez. "It's a difficult challenge 
that we now face. My reaction was of tremendous shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's investment strategy relied heavily on using the investment pool's 
U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds as collateral to borrow short-term at low 
interest rates, and investing the borrowed funds in mid-term corporate bonds 
and securities that pay a higher rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy could yield large returns while interest rates remained low and 
stable. But it could backfire when interest rates rise, as they have since the 
first of the year. When interest rates go up, bonds and securities purchased 
when there were lower interest rates lose value. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's problem is magnified because Citron leveraged the fund almost 
3 to 1, by putting up $7.5 billion in bonds as collateral for loans that 
enabled him to buy $20 million worth of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron has admitted that he did not foresee, as other investors have, the 
rapid increase in interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve Board, which 
has been concerned about the prospect of inflation as the economy continues to 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to his next-door neighbor, Dan Miller, Citron still defends his 
actions as county treasurer. "I have nothing to be ashamed of," Miller quoted 
Citron as saying. "I did nothing wrong. And I'm feeling pretty comfortable with 
myself." Miller said Citron told him he could repeat the comments to the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-November, the outlook for the fund worsened when the Federal Reserve 
Board raised interest rates 0.75%. The move prompted one fund investor, Peer 
Swan, the president of the Irvine Ranch Water District, to ask Citron to pay 
out $100 million of the $400 million his agency had put into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 This triggered further scrutiny of the fund's cash position. The review 
discovered that the portfolio's cash balance had dropped rapidly from $2.2 
billion during the months before to $350 million by Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 1, rumors swept through Wall Street that the county's investment pool was 
suffering from cash flow problems. The unfounded reports sent shock waves 
through the financial markets where municipal securities are traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Before day's end, county officials disclosed that the investment pool 
containing $20 billion worth of bonds and securities had plunged in value at 
least $1.5 billion -- more than 20% of the pool investors' total stake. Raabe 
and Citron were adamant that the fund investors could ride out the downturn if 
they stuck together. 
</P>
<P>
 In the week since the staggering drop in value was revealed, Orange County 
officials, investors and financial advisers frantically worked to stave off the 
worsening financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Top county administrators and members of the Board of Supervisors held 
marathon meetings to unravel the situation and sort out their options. They 
have been awakened in the middle of the night by sheriff's deputies to attend 
special closed-door sessions to figure out what to do as the financial crisis 
deepened. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said that during one stretch he worked 35 hours straight. Others have 
put in longer hours, like Raabe, who was appointed Citron's temporary 
replacement after the treasurer resigned and who reportedly toiled four days 
with little rest. "We have been working day and night," Lewis said. "It has 
been a killer as far as the amount of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, investigators from the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission pored over the portfolio's books and contemplated appointing a 
receiver for the fund. Vasquez said the Securities and Exchange Commission 
consulted with former Gov. George Deukmejian about the possibility of being the 
county's receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the crisis had become too much for Citron to bear. He offered to 
resign. One county official said that Schneider personally drafted Citron's 
resignation letter and drove to his house in Santa Ana to have him sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the source, Citron "broke down." 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Scott, head of the county's General Services Agency and a close friend of 
Citron, visited Citron after his resignation. "He's doing considerably well 
under the circumstances," Scott said. He is "going through a healing process. 
That might take a little time." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Citron's departure was made public. That same day, the SEC told the 
county it would not get involved in a receivership. At that point, the county 
made pleas to state and federal representatives to help them solve their 
liquidity problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to the state and even the Clinton Administration," Lewis said. "They 
didn't do enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, county officials worked behind the scenes trying to decide 
whether to sell the entire bond portfolio, albeit at a tremendous loss. The 
county shopped around for a number of Wall Street firms to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't imagine the pressure we were under," County Supervisor William G. 
Steiner said, referring to the proposed liquidation of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner and Supervisor Roger R. Stanton were concerned about liquidating the 
fund without consulting with investors in the portfolio. While the county found 
a firm interested in liquidating the entire fund, officials were busy 
consulting with some of the larger investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a whole big room full of people in New York City with computers 
ready to go and sell it in five minutes," said Steiner. "It was a huge decision 
for us to make." 
</P>
<P>
 The county decided not to sell when it could not determine how much the 
investment was worth. It appeared that the only option left was bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 a.m. the next day, sheriff's deputies and county officials rousted the 
Board of Supervisors from their sleep for an emergency briefing to deal with a 
growing default situation. 
</P>
<P>
 While board members met in closed session throughout the day, Orange County 
defaulted on 10 to 12 loans used to buy bonds in the fund. CS First Boston, a 
Wall Street investment bank, and other Wall Street firms then seized about $2 
billion in bonds and put them on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wall Street firms had made loans to the fund, which were secured by bonds 
and holders of the county's municipal debt. Lenders can look to their 
collateral for repayment if defaults occur. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Thomas R. Riley said officials were left with no choice 
after a number of investment bankers declined to roll over or renew $1.2 
billion of existing financial instruments called reverse repurchase agreements. 
The action resulted in a default of the agreements with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know where we were going. We didn't know whether we were going to 
be able to operate the county in a manner that would be acceptable to us."

FED CHIEF HINTS AT NEW RATE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in congressional testimony that 
suggested the likelihood of further interest rate increases, said Wednesday 
that inflationary pressures are mounting even though consumer prices have risen 
little in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodity prices "have been rising rapidly for nearly two years," Greenspan 
told the Joint Economic Committee, and lately "prices of intermediate supplies 
have accelerated." 
</P>
<P>
 Because demand is "strong, finished goods producers may soon attempt to pass 
on their higher costs," the Fed chairman said, warning that business officials 
and consumers alike are always hypersensitive to any signs of renewed 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys and the financial markets themselves show "some nervousness about the 
resolve of anti-inflation policies," Greenspan acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sign of governmental vigilance against inflation, the incoming 
chairman of the Joint Economic Committee said congressional Republicans will 
try to revise the law spelling out national economic goals to exclude 
unemployment and include only prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) said Republicans want the so-called Humphrey-Hawkins 
law, which now urges a combination of low unemployment and low inflation, to 
have only a single target: consumer price inflation of no more than 2% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation measured by the consumer price index is running at a modest 2.6% a 
year, but the bond markets have set long-term rates at a substantial 8% as a 
hedge against future price increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed cannot afford to ignore the markets, which "may be telling us 
something about deep-seated changes in expectations," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank has raised rates six times this year, and its policy-making 
Open Market Committee will meet Dec. 20 amid expectations that another hike 
could be in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) asked Greenspan not to be the Grinch who stole 
Christmas by hiking rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 The normally dour Fed chairman laughed, but refused to hint what action his 
committee might take at the next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we will do," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarbanes, persisting in his literary allusions, said "Let's hope you're not 
going to be Ebenezer Scrooge." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan insisted during more than two hours of testimony and questions that 
the Fed would not let down its guard against a resurgence of inflation, because 
further inflation could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "As people begin to expect higher inflation, their actions to protect the 
purchasing power of their wages and profits add to the impetus toward 
accelerating prices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experience suggests that these expectations can be turned around only slowly 
and with some cost to the economy's performance," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed chairman and his colleagues feel confident that they can continue in 
their efforts to combat inflation because their actions thus far haven't 
endangered the robust round of business expansion now under way. Output has 
grown more than 4% during the past year, and unemployment is at a four-year 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impressive performance of the American economy continues," Greenspan told 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 His claims were supported by the Fed's "beige book," a periodic survey of 
economic conditions in the nation's 12 Federal Reserve districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The report issued Wednesday said that "retail sales in most districts have 
improved, with nearly all districts reporting strong sales early in the holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing activity is continuing to increase further in most districts, 
especially in durable goods industries, and the service sector is continuing to 
show strength." 
</P>
<P>
 The report from the West was less enthusiastic, noting only a "slight pickup 
in growth" in California. However, it said business leaders "generally remain 
optimistic" in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the depressed aerospace sector, manufacturing activity in California 
remained at high levels, the economic report found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, prices are rising for paper products, plastics, chemicals, steel 
and construction materials, the report noted, and there is some tightening in 
labor markets, particularly in the Midwest.

NEWS ANALYSIS; REPUBLICAN LAPSES BLAMED FOR SPEAKERSHIP IMPASSE; POLITICS: 
EXPERTS SAY GOP'S BRULTE FAILED TO CONSOLIDATE POWER. HORCHER'S MAVERICK WAYS 
WERE UNDERESTIMATED.

<P>
 Just a month ago, buoyant, even cocky, Republican legislators gathered in the 
Capitol to applaud themselves for a surprise election triumph that provided 
them a wafer-thin Assembly majority. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two decades out of power, they were ready to divide the spoils 
of victory and anoint as Speaker Jim Brulte, an obscure but politically savvy 
Southern California GOP legislator starting just his third term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least for now their dream of taking power has slipped away -- and some 
political professionals say the Republicans blew their opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Brulte could muster support from only 40 of his 41 members and 
wound up in a stalemate with veteran Democratic Speaker Willie Brown, a 30-year 
Assembly veteran and longtime GOP nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the euphoria of the past month, the untested Brulte showed that he knew how 
to win elections but not necessarily how to translate that success into 
political power. As Monday's vote approached, he and his fellow conservatives 
apparently failed to realize that GOP gains in the Assembly still did not add 
up to a Republican speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brulte eventually may become Speaker, what emerged from interviews is 
a story of Republican miscalculation, overconfidence and unwillingness to 
engage in old-fashioned political deal-making to persuade fence-sitting 
Democrats to abandon Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians around the intrigue-charged Capitol say Brulte also failed to 
understand the intricacies of putting together a solid majority, that a 
prospective leader needs a few extra votes in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to know the rules before you play the game," said one GOP Assembly 
staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Brulte, he said, did not 
have a backup plan when Republican Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) sided with 
Brown, resulting in a 40-40 stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brulte spokesman Phil Perry said, "We knew the rules. . . . The fact 
they turned a Republican had nothing to do with the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Newly sworn-in Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, a Democrat from West Los Angeles, 
said the deadlock is less a result of Brown's cunning than the product of 
Republican bumbling. Brulte, she said, took too much for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen nothing but Republicans tripping over their own feet," Kuehl said. 
"They are tripping over their own assumptions, and their own mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Republicans misjudged just how deeply hurt maverick Horcher was 
after years of slights directed at him, especially by right-wing members of his 
own party, according to legislators. Horcher bolted and voted for Brown, and he 
is now the target of a recall attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also underestimated Brown's strong grip on the loyalties of his 
own members and failed to remember that the San Franciscan had won and retained 
the speakership with GOP backing over his record 14-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has thrived in his position by becoming known as a "members' Speaker" 
for both Democrats and Republicans -- remembering birthdays, driving colleagues 
home and even intervening on behalf of legislators' children embroiled in legal 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 It has allowed Brown and his followers to keep power, which means control of 
hundreds of Assembly staff positions, committee chairmanships, office 
assignments, the legislative agenda and millions of dollars in special interest 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Brown emerged as the state's second-most-powerful officeholder 
after the governor and one of the nation's leading African American 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Monday, Brulte seemed on the verge of toppling Brown, telling his 
backers not to fret and that he had secured the support of Horcher and some 
wavering Democrats. But it turned out that the Rancho Cucamonga legislator only 
had 40 votes in the 80-member house, prompting questions even from Republican 
loyalists about how Brulte had failed to capitalize on his stunning election 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of pro-business Democrat Joe Baca, who like Brulte represents 
the growing Inland Empire. Shortly after the Nov. 8 election, Brulte made a 
pitch for Baca's support over lunch at a Black Angus in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca gave the following account: The two discussed what committee chair Baca 
might secure under a Brulte speakership -- but not as a reward for his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 When Baca sought a major prize, such as the budget writing committee or the 
Rules Committee, Brulte ruled those out. Baca, a former phone company 
executive, had a third choice -- the Utilities and Commerce Committee 
chairmanship -- but Brulte told him he had offered that post to Republican 
Mickey Conroy of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte tried to steer Baca to a lesser assignment, but it was rejected. Baca 
wound up seconding Brown's nomination as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte could not be reached for comment. His spokesman, Perry, denied Baca's 
account, contending that the Democrat "pretty much said he was for sale to the 
highest bidder." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) said Brulte and his fellow 
Republicans were not willing to win Democratic votes at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is true," he said, "that the Republicans aren't willing to break principle 
to cut deals as much as Willie Brown is." Before his recent election to the 
State Board of Equalization, Andal was in the Assembly GOP leadership's inner 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 In his view, there is a simple explanation for the collapse of Brulte's 
strategy: Horcher's willingness to cut a deal with Brown. Horcher has denied 
getting anything in exchange for his support. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is ever going to try and buy or sell my vote," Horcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle of Garden Grove, who last year was GOP caucus 
chairman, denied that staunch conservatives had tied Brulte's hands, making it 
impossible for him to negotiate with Horcher or moderate Democrats such as Baca 
or Sal Cannella of Ceres. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle said Brulte did not make any promises, even to his own members. "He 
played it close to the vest," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Baca, Pringle said, he doubted that Baca would have been willing to 
provide the decisive vote for Brulte. "I've yet to see that he would have been 
the 41st vote for a committee chairmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Some moderate Democrats described seemingly halfhearted attempts by Brulte to 
reach out to them when it looked like he had the 41 votes he needed to be 
Speaker. However, Cannella, one Democrat whose politics are not far from those 
of Republicans, said he was surprised that Brulte made no effort to contact him 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannella said he had heard rumors that Brulte had boasted of lining up his 
vote. Several Republicans called him, he said, to find out whether he was one 
of four or five Democrats who Brulte predicted would cast their lot with him. 
</P>
<P>
 To win the speakership fight, Cannella said, Brulte needed to reach out to 
large numbers of Democrats, something he and his fellow Republicans failed to 
do. "I think it has to do with egos," Cannella said. The election results "gave 
Mr. Brulte a distorted picture on how the Republicans were going to take over 
the house. That feeling of triumph . . . overshadowed his need to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end, Brulte tried to woo at least one wavering Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose) recalled that after the election 
he had several conversations with Brulte. Cortese said he would not have cast 
the decisive vote for Brulte but would have considered providing him with an 
extra margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be brokering my own future rather than remaining part of the loyal 
opposition," said Cortese, who is considering a run for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, on the way to the Assembly floor, he stopped to talk to Brulte and 
asked him if he had 41 votes and "he said, 'I've got them. I've got them locked 
up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cortese asked whether Horcher was aboard. Brulte responded, "Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking proof, Cortese asked Brulte "to bring in Horcher to confirm that." But 
Brulte demurred and told Cortese to vote his own way. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Cortese bumped into Brown in the same hallway and asked 
the Democratic leader to produce Horcher. Brown made good on the promise, 
arranging a meeting with Horcher, who indicated he was in Brown's camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortese is still shaking his head at Brulte's inability to round up all his 
members. "He had no cushion, and he told me going into the chamber he had no 
other Democrats. And when I passed him on the floor, I commented quietly, 'You 
don't have Horcher,' and he shook his head no."

COLUMN ONE; MAD AND GLAD OVER NAFTA; AS SUMMIT DELEGATES GATHER TO PONDER THE 
HEMISPHERE'S ECONOMY, THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE TRADE ACCORD'S FIRST YEAR. SO 
FAR, IT HAS SPARKED CONTROVERSY, CONFUSION AND SOME SURPRISING OPPORTUNITIES.

<P>
 If you want to know how sticky free trade can get these days -- literally -- 
just ask the guys at Burlington Northern Railroad about the green goop. 
</P>
<P>
 The brouhaha erupted earlier this year, when Mexican officials decreed that 
U.S. corn shipments be dyed green. Trade deal or no, this was business: The dye 
helps Mexicans track American corn in their restricted market, and the rule 
stands, despite American complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cases, the corn colored the inside of the rail cars green," said 
Rusty Jesser, a spokesman for Burlington Northern, explaining why the railroad 
will no longer carry the gooey grain. 
</P>
<P>
 As heads of state from North and South America gather Friday in Miami to 
consider closer economic ties, a towering precedent will loom over their 
summit: the North American Free Trade Agreement, now approaching its first 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 By many gauges, free trade has been good medicine for the North American 
economy and an instructive lesson for the entire hemisphere. Yet a close look 
at one year's experience with NAFTA shows how profoundly the world of commerce 
can vary from the world of political rhetoric and cold statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the burning fears nor extravagant expectations sparked by the pact 
have been borne out since it took effect Jan. 1. (It will, of course, take 
years to determine NAFTA's true effect on jobs, industries and the economies of 
North America.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some rules have led to controversy, red tape and confusion, with the 
green-corn flap as only one example. Others have opened up surprising 
opportunities. Tomato farmers in Florida are mad. Sausage exporters in Illinois 
are glad. And amid the fears of organized labor, union jobs in a Whittier 
factory have expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The nitty gritty of international trade, in other words, has proved to be a 
much quirkier process than the idealized image that emerges from global 
summits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people thought NAFTA meant 'Put the stuff in my truck and cross the 
border,' " notes Ross E. Porter, a customs adviser, recalling how one 
frustrated American merchant finally gave up on shipping low-cost bathing suits 
into Mexico after a series of delays. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that easy, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as delegates gather in Miami, the NAFTA experience offers some points to 
keep in mind as they sketch an economic future for the hemisphere: 
</P>
<P>
 * NAFTA's greatest significance is symbolic, its very existence a security 
blanket for American executives spooked by Mexico's uncertain business culture. 
The reductions in import taxes, however sweet, are less important than the 
reductions in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to pick a country (with vast potential), Mexico is the one," 
declares Richard J. Heckmann, chairman of U.S. Filter Corp. in Palm Desert. 
"But without NAFTA you're scared to death of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Free trade isn't free. Mexican avocado growers, U.S. cherry farmers and 
Canadian peanut-butter makers are a few of the parties unhappy with 
restrictions imposed by their next-door neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 * NAFTA's short-term benefits, while real, may be exaggerated by the economic 
recovery that is stimulating exports and investment throughout North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the pact is far-reaching: Tariffs are being phased out over the 
next 15 years, as the three neighbors try to make their business laws and 
standards much more harmonious. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the real action is concentrated in Mexico, an economy of breathtaking 
potential that only now is edging toward the free-market practices of the 
United States and Canada. The post-NAFTA hassles of doing business in Mexico 
pale in comparison to the not-so-old days when bureaucratic caprice turned 
export efforts into a helter-skelter gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the flavor, consider the seemingly mundane matter of clothing labels. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. exporters used to wonder, "Did labels have to be attached? Did they have 
to be sewn on? Did they have to be stuck on? Could you put them side by side 
with the freight? There were as many different answers as there were ports of 
entry," recalls Porter, marketing manager at Porter International in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade deal should ease the confusion by answering those nettlesome 
questions: "With NAFTA the red-tape burdens are sometimes a problem -- but at 
least they're dependable." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout North America, investors and executives are teaming up in joint 
ventures, scrambling for product distributors across the border and exhibiting 
a fresh interest in neighboring countries. Trade among the three nations is 
galloping at record levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eleven months ago we had only four people in Mexico," says Carlos J. 
Valderrama, director of Latin American operations for the Carlsmith Ball law 
firm in Los Angeles, which advises clients on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican 
border. "Now we have 16." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing business in other countries is not always for the faint of heart. Trade 
provisions can have pull-your-hair-out complexity -- and none is more important 
than the rule that products must be made in North America to qualify for lower 
tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound simple? At Alesis, a Los Angeles manufacturer of studio electronics 
equipment, the made-in-North America proviso has triggered a time-consuming 
research project devoted to figuring out if a digital audio tape recorder with 
hundreds of components passes NAFTA muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "When NAFTA passed I jumped for joy, thinking we wouldn't have to pay duties 
in Mexico, and we'd be even more competitive," recalled Mark Frederick, 
international sales manager for the company. "When we looked at the paperwork, 
I was really disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the growing demand by Mexican musicians for Alesis' ADAT audio 
tape recorder underscores a larger point about NAFTA: It is a catalyst to an 
ongoing process. International trade inside North America is burgeoning anyway. 
"We've been growing in Mexico 30% to 35% the last few years -- NAFTA or no 
NAFTA," Frederick points out. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, however, NAFTA is of paramount importance, a reassuring sign that 
the United States and Mexico have committed themselves to a new relationship. 
The commitment, rather than the fine print, is what prompted these executives 
to take a fresh look south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rewards are starting to flow back. "Mexico was last on my list of 
places to go," concedes Raymond W. Cohen, a vice president with Diagnostic 
Monitoring Systems, a maker of medical software in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Before NAFTA, that is. This year, the Orange County firm projects that Mexican 
sales could reach $50,000 -- up from zero in 1993. "Specifically because of 
NAFTA, I said, 'This is a good time for us to do some business in Mexico,' " 
Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that trade wrangles have vanished into the past. U.S. restrictions on 
avocados have angered Mexicans, and Mexican restrictions affecting apples, 
cherries and plums have frustrated Americans. Florida's tomato growers were 
infuriated earlier this year by what they considered massive dumping of 
low-cost tomatoes from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget the Canadians: They want to ship a lot more wheat, sugar and 
tobacco to the United States than U.S. officials allow. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all that, trade is humming. Even U.S. corn exports to Mexico are up 
dramatically (almost tenfold) under NAFTA, despite the green-dye rule that aims 
to keep corn for animal feed separate from corn for consumers -- protecting 
Mexico's highly subsidized corn industry in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to look at Mexico as a good customer," says Richard R. Calhoun, 
an assistant vice president with Cargill, a giant grain company in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one year after organized labor lost a furious fight to stop NAFTA, 
the employment impact looks modest in a U.S. economy that has 115 million 
non-farm jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department has approved special benefits for only 13,496 casualties 
of the trade accord so far. Requests have been received from 286 companies in 
40 states, including 17 firms in California. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Clinton Administration claims a gain of 100,000 jobs, the Joint 
Economic Committee of Congress estimated a net loss of 10,000, and some insist 
that the jobs deficit is much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The harshest criticism goes beyond numbers, however. NAFTA, its opponents 
maintain, has given employers a potent new lever to use on workers and 
politicians, in effect letting them say: Don't make waves or we'll shift 
production to Mexico. While no massive shifts have occurred so far, the game is 
in its early stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the serious critics of NAFTA said was that this would be part of a 
general downward trend in labor standards and environmental conditions," said 
Dean Baker, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute in 
Washington. "And everything we've seen bears this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts are more enthusiastic. Free trade, goes the mainstream thinking, 
is bringing North Americans a greater choice of goods and services, making the 
entire continent more productive and providing a downward pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any trade agreement some people will lose their jobs and some people will 
gain jobs," said Kurt E. Karl, an economist with the WEFA Group near 
Philadelphia. "The big news is that prices go down and consumers are the 
winners." 
</P>
<P>
 Well-paid union workers should be at the top of the losers' list, according to 
common wisdom. Yet in another of NAFTA's anomalies the real world of business 
offers various examples to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 At U.S. Filter, a major manufacturer of water-treatment systems, 1994 has been 
a banner year for Mexican business: a sewage treatment system for the city of 
Cuernavaca (in which the California company is investing $20 million) and water 
systems at a new Chrysler plant and the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 And all that work has prompted a flurry of hiring north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "The engineering is done in Pittsburgh. The construction is done in Whittier 
and Rockford (Ill.) And the installation is in Mexico," explains Heckmann, 
company chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whittier plant, for instance, has added about 30 employees this year, 
largely because of the demand from Mexico. They are mostly welders and assembly 
workers who belong to the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and are 
paid on average $13 an hour plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans "need our help, and we need their business," said Heckmann, a 
fervent NAFTA supporter who travels to Mexico once a month. "To me it's the 
perfect combination." 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies, meanwhile, prefer to furnish Mexican customers with products 
made in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Amir A. Moghadam, owner of a lingerie factory, looks forward to rising sales 
in Mexico for his Parisa label. But he believes it pays off to keep the sewing 
machines right outside his office in Van Nuys where he can walk to the floor in 
seconds if a problem emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's telling me to go there and open up a factory, but I have no 
intention," said Moghadam, president of AFT Apparel International. 
</P>
<P>
 As some see it, post-NAFTA ferment is leading inevitably to even more ferment, 
as the process of trade liberalization settles over increasingly large regions 
of the Western Hemisphere and the whole world. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast is for new headaches, new opportunities and an increasingly 
integrated global economy, dramatized by the Summit of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a new status quo," declares Van R. Whiting Jr., a senior fellow at 
UC San Diego's Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies. Rather, he continued, NAFTA has 
sparked "a continuing process of new problems and solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Heard, executive vice president of the National Corn Growers Assn. -- 
which continues to protest the green-dye requirement -- puts it simply: "The 
only people that you don't have trade problems with are the folks that you 
don't trade with." BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect Jan. 1, phases out 
over the next 15 years tariffs and other barriers to the movement of goods, 
services and investment among the United States, Mexico and Canada. The pact 
creates the world's largest trading bloc, covering more than 360 million 
people.

AS COUNTY'S CREDIT RATING SLIDES, SO MAY ITS IMAGE; FALLOUT: SOME FEAR THAT 
BANKRUPTCY, OTHER FINANCIAL PROBLEMS MAY TAG THE AREA AS BEING UNTRUSTWORTHY. 
</P>

 Gil Ferguson, who spent 10 years in the Assembly representing the Newport 
Beach area, says he knows what they're saying in Sacramento about Orange 
County's declaration of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying, 'You expect Watts to bail you people out?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is too good here," Ferguson said. "The county is simply too wealthy for 
anyone to feel sorry for us. I think if there's been any change in our image, 
it's that we might be rich, but we're not too smart." 
</P>
<P>
 As county officials struggle to pick up the pieces of its risk-laden 
investment fund, which appears to have lost at least $1.5 billion, or about 20% 
of its capital, the county's image is going to be important, say some experts 
in municipal management. 
</P>
<P>
 "How it's handled right now and from now on is very important for damage 
control," said Terry Clark, coordinator of the University of Chicago's Fiscal 
Austerity and Urban Innovation Project, the largest study of municipal 
management in history. "If they handle it poorly, the effects could be 
long-range." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Baldassare, a UC Irvine sociologist who has been polling attitudes 
about Orange County for 12 years, says he fears that long-range damage has 
already been done to the county's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might not know what derivative or leveraged mean, but they know what 
bankruptcy means. When you tell them a county has gone bankrupt, you're sending 
a message of severe distress." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the most spectacular message so far, but not the only one. Downright 
embezzlement at major institutions has popped up with embarrassing frequency in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * In March, Clyde E. Weinman, director of Irvine Temporary Housing, which 
aided the homeless, was sentenced to prison for stealing almost $450,000 from 
the charity by forging nearly 600 checks. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1993, Steven D. Wymer went to prison for defrauding small municipalities 
in Iowa, Colorado and California. He promised that his firm, Institutional 
Treasury Management of Irvine, could invest their spare funds safely but with 
high profit. The largest victim, the Iowa Trust Fund, lost $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1992, Stephen Wagner, director of business support services for the 
Newport-Mesa Unified School District, admitted stealing about $4 million from 
the district over the previous six years. His lavish lifestyle included luxury 
cars, a gold-plated grand piano and a diamond-studded tuxedo. A grand jury 
estimated that loss of the money Wagner embezzled forced the district to lay 
off 59 teachers and 150 other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County became the unofficial capital of the savings and loan scandals 
in the 1980s when Lincoln Savings & Loan, headquartered in Irvine, failed and 
its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., was indicted and eventually convicted. Other 
Orange County S&Ls also failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The same decade made Orange County the "boiler-room fraud capital" of the 
nation, according to congressional testimony, as swindlers sold phony 
investments in oil, minerals and coins over the phone. An Orange County 
prosecutor told Congress about 200 fraudulent boiler rooms in Orange County 
that grossed up to $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this the true Orange County -- people mad to hustle the big bucks and 
ignore the risks? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not, said Baldassare, but it is going to make many people believe it 
is true, and that is understandable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible, really," Baldassare said. "I understood how New York got 
into trouble (in 1975) -- it wasn't raising revenues to pay for more expensive 
social services -- but how do you explain that one of the wealthiest counties 
in the nation is now bankrupt? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've crossed the line here. Many people are going to look at it and it's 
going to be what they suspected about Orange County. People are out there 
taking huge risks with other people's money. I think a very negative image has 
been created. In the Eastern media, we may be painted in broad strokes." 
</P>
<P>
 This is bound to affect outsiders, Baldassare said, because "people are going 
to think about moving here in the future and investing their lives and 
businesses in this area. People don't want to be thinking about whether the 
school will have enough money to keep the doors open. There are plenty of 
places in the nation where the daily business of government is taken care of 
without having to ponder a lot of risks." 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst image problems, he believes, are going to be self-image 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here were just getting to the point they were getting more confident 
about finances, coming out of the recession, further away from the feeling of 
the (Los Angeles) riots," Baldassare said. "Now this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Political images are at stake as well, said the University of Chicago's Clark. 
Orange County had become "a national model for what we call the 'new fiscal 
populists,' who have turned away from Reagan Republicanism. They run against 
high spending and irresponsible management but they tend to be liberal on 
social issues. For them, this is disastrous. It's not what was supposed to 
happen on their watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Johnson, a former Orange County business executive who is now 
administrator of the federal General Services Agency, says Washington doesn't 
know what to make of this spectacular event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of a government going bankrupt is a little off their radar 
screens here. Few of them have experienced the excitement of running out of 
money. It's an intellectual concept that haven't experienced." 
</P>
<P>
 If Orange County is concerned about its Washington image, Johnson said, "the 
real issue is not what's happened but what the county does about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the lasting images will be forged starting now. How the county will 
react to the crisis is more likely to determine how the county is viewed in 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of San Diego is a stellar example. They created the Board of Fiscal 
Overseers, back when Pete Wilson was mayor. It would monitor all major fiscal 
policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County could create something like that, a blue-ribbon panel that 
could assess specifics and suggest policy. It would take some of the spotlight 
off the county board and administrators and defuse the blame. It's a classic 
technique, and it works, if it's done right." 
</P>
<P>
 But Baldassare's suggestion for damage control is more basic. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own feeling is that what little confidence there was out there is going to 
be shattered by an event like that and it's going to a be a long time before 
Orange County voters' confidence is restored in their local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far there's very little of what's most needed: an apology. The public 
wants local officials to take care of the school and pick up trash and make 
sure things were working all right. I think the public will be looking for 
apologies."

FRANCE ASKS U.N. TO DRAFT PLAN FOR BOSNIA PULLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT and CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring negotiations to end the Balkan crisis at a "total impasse," the 
French government said Wednesday that it has asked the United Nations and NATO 
to draw up a detailed withdrawal plan for the 24,000 U.N. peacekeepers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told the National Assembly here that the 
U.N. force, which includes 5,000 French troops, "has done everything it can" to 
end the conflict peacefully. And he said an evacuation would be a "high-risk 
operation that will require reinforcing troops on the ground first." 
</P>
<P>
 Juppe acknowledged that "the decision which we are being forced into will mean 
war, more unhappiness and more suffering," adding that he feared the Balkans 
will be "set ablaze" in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign minister's gloomy assessment, which followed a flurry of visits to 
European capitals to discuss the crisis, came as NATO said it will ask member 
states how many troops they could supply to a mission to evacuate U.N. 
peacekeepers. A force of at least 20,000, and perhaps many more, would be 
required to withdraw the U.N. Protection Force, alliance officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With pressure mounting for a withdrawal, mission officials in the former 
Yugoslav federation discovered Wednesday that they had lost even the ability to 
retreat, as a partial pullout from embattled Bihac collapsed before it got 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 The thwarted attempt to "temporarily redeploy" half of the 1,200 Bangladeshi 
troops out of Bihac stemmed from a decision made within the U.N. military 
hierarchy in Zagreb, Croatia, sources there said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Juppe has blamed the United States for inflaming the conflict 
with talk of lifting a U.N. arms embargo that has kept the Muslim-led Bosnian 
government from defending the country against a 32-month rebellion by heavily 
armed Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Juppe's forecast that no settlement is likely, Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic told a news conference at his headquarters in Pale, just east 
of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, that he is prepared to resume stalled 
negotiations in view of "new interpretations" being made by the five-nation 
Contact Group of a plan offered in June on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Juppe and other politicians from countries contributing troops to the 
peacekeeping force have recently suggested that the Bosnian Serbs should be 
allowed to join their conquered territory to neighboring Serbia. That right of 
confederation was denied them under the original plan drawn up by the Contact 
Group, which is composed of the United States, Britain, Russia, France and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic tied his rebels' return to negotiations to a lifting of U.N. 
sanctions on allied Serbia, but his hints of assisting the U.N. peacekeepers in 
an unhindered evacuation were likely to appeal to those now scrambling for a 
way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Troop-contributing countries, including many from NATO, have been alarmed by 
the surge in hostile actions against U.N. peacekeepers, mostly by the Bosnian 
Serbs, who hold nearly 350 troops hostage and have thousands of others 
surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb gunmen in Banja Luka did resolve the most serious of the hostage 
situations Wednesday when they released a sick Jordanian military observer, 
Maj. Zaid Hussein Fayed, after a Russian officer volunteered to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs had reneged on a promise they made Monday to release the major, who 
has been bedridden with a heart ailment since Nov. 30. Instead, on Tuesday, the 
rebels seized a Spanish captain offered in his place as well as a Czech major 
supervising the hostage swap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordanian and the Czech were released late Wednesday, said U.N. mission 
spokesman Paul Risley. With the Russian, there are now four captive military 
observers in Banja Luka. 
</P>
<P>
 Systematic humiliation of the U.N. peacekeeping force has intensified 
withdrawal planning, officials at U.N. mission headquarters in Zagreb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The provocations prompted mission commanders to propose evacuating half of the 
undersupplied Bangladeshis, who are caught between attacking Bosnian Serb 
forces and Croatian Serb rebels seeking to starve and freeze them out of the 
U.N. "safe area" they were deployed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 But a U.N. request to bus out 600 soldiers over six nights -- 100 soldiers a 
night -- failed to gain support from any of the factions that could endanger 
such a withdrawal, one U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the cooperation of the armed forces that surround them, neither 
withdrawal nor redeployment would be possible, as has been made clear by the 
weeks-long blockade by Croatian Serb gunmen preventing Dutch troops from 
reinforcing the Bangladeshis in Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to withdraw half of the Bangladeshi battalion was described by 
mission spokesman Michael Williams as a move under consideration because of the 
poor state of provisions. The troops have little food and no fuel and are 
confined to quarters because of a lack of winter coats and defensive weapons -- 
shortages aggravated by the Croatian Serb blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration level at mission headquarters in Zagreb has been palpable, as 
civilian and military leaders examine their escape routes and find them all 
wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can decide to do anything we want. We can decide that pigs can fly, but 
unless they sprout wings it's not going to happen," spokesman Risley said of 
the Bihac reduction that mission headquarters wants but cannot achieve. "We can 
decide whatever we want, but the reality is that we have very limited options." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Western diplomat from a troop-contributing country said the mission 
is working feverishly with NATO on emergency pullout plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a mess. You're going to have women and children blocking the 
roads with their bodies. We are not going to be able to simply drive out of 
here," said the envoy. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.N. official familiar with the withdrawal planning said a number of 
scenarios have been prepared for, including a swift and surreptitious retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 "A hasty withdrawal plan is one that takes place in the worst of environments, 
where two things are of importance: speed and stealth," the official said. 
"Under a hasty withdrawal plan, you make no attempt to save equipment. . . . 
The priority is to save the lives of peacekeepers and allow for their safe 
evacuation." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most thorough contingency planning has failed to chart a secure 
course out of the deteriorating Bosnian conflict, especially in places like 
Bihac where the Serbs clearly want U.N. troops out of the way while the poorly 
defended government supporters want to hold on to what is at least a 
psychological shield. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb gunmen and the Croatian Serb rebels collaborating in attacks on 
Bihac would probably facilitate a U.N. withdrawal "with conditions," the U.N. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they would gladly provide safe passage out through the occupied 
Krajina region of Croatia for the Bangladeshis as long as they take with them 
their armored personnel carriers, weapons, radios, communications equipment and 
other gear of military value. The Krajina Serbs are also expected to demand 
that all U.N. troops leave, rather than just half, removing the main impediment 
to a Serbian conquest of the Bihac pocket.

QUAKE TEAM DOWNPLAYS CODE FLAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of engineers commissioned by the state to examine the effects of the 
Northridge earthquake has found that in many cases, failures of design, 
construction and inspection caused more damage than building code deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the widespread calls for tougher codes immediately following the Jan. 
17 earthquake, case studies of 27 buildings yielded evidence that much of the 
typical damage could have been prevented by inexpensive measures to better 
enforce the current code, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faults pinpointed in the study included missing joint reinforcement, gaps in 
wood framing, discrepancies between a designer's assumptions and actual field 
conditions and a design with incomplete paths for the distribution of seismic 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also shows that retrofitting helped prevent damage in some cases 
and not in others, depending on how well it was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn in part from that study, recommendations being presented to the state 
Seismic Safety Commission today in Sacramento will focus primarily on how to 
ensure that the code is followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the recommendation is that quality control, doing what we do, but 
doing it better is the fundamental recommendation, rather than change the 
code," said L. Thomas Tobin, executive director of the Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe a good portion of the damage in the earthquake was due to a 
failure of quality control, either through design by the engineer or architect 
or plan checking, construction or inspection," Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposals will be a requirement that architects and engineers 
identify all seismic features in their plans and that local building officials 
specifically inspect those features. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the commission staff will recommend that the architect or engineer 
personally inspect the project during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get the best pair of eyes out on the job, the individual who 
designs the building," said Fred Turner, the commission's staff structural 
engineer. "Quite often, when you get out in the field, you may see the 
opportunity for improvements, oversights in design. You can resolve 
construction difficulties. You can even learn so your construction process is 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 The study was coordinated by consulting engineers Rutherford and Chekene of 
San Francisco, which retained other engineers for the 27 case studies. A draft 
was shown to the Seismic Safety Commission in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Its findings, incorporated into staff recommendations that are expected to be 
adopted early next year, shed light on some of the most spectacular -- and 
unexpected -- building failures. 
</P>
<P>
 The team investigating the Bullocks department store in Northridge Fashion 
Center, for example, found that it was designed with "an inadequate lateral 
system consisting of discontinuous shear walls" which, in effect, bounced up 
and down independently, punching through the concrete floor beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers concluded that had the earthquake lasted longer, the Broadway 
department store in Northridge Fashion Center could have collapsed because of 
the failure of columns around the escalators. 
</P>
<P>
 Those columns, which were not part of the building's seismic apparatus, were 
unable to sway with the exterior frame and broke instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other problems at the Broadway, masonry walls were poorly fastened 
to the building frame, because of the difficulty of grouting such walls, 
causing them to move independently. 
</P>
<P>
 One code deficiency was noted in the separation of the Broadway's roof from 
its walls. The engineers said the forces were great enough to have caused the 
failure even if the 1970 building had been designed to current code. 
</P>
<P>
 The incompatibility between seismic and load-bearing systems noted at the 
Broadway was also responsible for the collapse of the Cal State Northridge 
parking structure, the report said. Non-seismic columns breaking in the 
interior of the garage pulled the exterior frame inward. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cases, engineers found that retrofitting proved ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 The team investigating the Broadway in Topanga Plaza said a retrofitting 
project helped to keep damage within the design criteria of the building, but 
that "the inadequate attachment of the original construction walls to their 
foundation reduced the total resistance provided and led to significantly 
greater damage than would otherwise have occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Bullocks at Northridge Fashion Center, an engineer singled 
out an inadequate retooling of the plan improvised just after the 1971 Sylmar 
earthquake, while the building was under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra shear walls were added, but consisted of "shotcrete," concrete sprayed 
between existing columns, rather than fastened to them, causing the 
discontinuous load path. This means that the walls could shake individually 
rather than transfer the seismic forces through the building. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most perplexing findings was that damage often could not be 
explained by current seismic theoretical models. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-story Holiday Inn in Van Nuys, for example, was most heavily 
reinforced in the lower floors based on the assumption that they would be 
subject to the greatest seismic forces. However, damage to the red-tagged 
building was concentrated on the fourth and fifth floors. The same pattern 
showed up in the Sherman Oaks Towers, a 12-story concrete frame building whose 
fifth floor was most seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, staff structural engineer for the commission, called it 
"disconcerting" that the actual performance of buildings -- including some that 
should have failed but didn't -- cannot be replicated by currently accepted 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can say that the general performance objectives of the building code were 
met," Turner said. "The troubling aspect is we can't answer the question why." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said one recommendation will be to promote more research on the 
behavior of buildings under seismic stress. Nevertheless, he said, more and 
quicker improvements in building safety will be realized by "ensuring that we 
have a better handle on quality control and attention to detail."

BOTH SIDES ASSAIL LUNGREN MOVES ON PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: WITH KEY COURT 
HEARING LOOMING, MEASURE'S BACKERS SEEK STRONGER DEFENSE. FOES SAY DISTRIBUTION 
OF TEMPORARY ORDER BLOCKING PROVISIONS WAS DELAYED. 
</P>

 As the state attorney general's office prepares to defend Proposition 187 at a 
critical court hearing next week, its performance was attacked Wednesday by 
partisans on both ends of the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the anti-illegal immigration initiative, which won by an 
overwhelming margin in last month's state election, asked Wednesday to enter 
the case as "friends of the court," declaring that they are displeased with the 
representation of Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the initiative needs to be defended, and we are not satisfied with 
the work done so far by Dan Lungren," said Ron Prince, who headed the Save Our 
State campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lawyers seeking to scuttle Proposition 187 charged that Lungren's 
office and other state agencies have failed to abide by terms of a federal 
court order requiring that copies of that order, which temporarily blocks the 
initiative, be promptly distributed to health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they say, many health providers have only recently received copies of 
the executive action signed by Gov. Pete Wilson nearly a month ago stating that 
the initiative approved by state voters Nov. 8 should be put into effect as 
soon as legally permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most generous interpretation is that they have been dragging their 
heels," said Mark D. Rosenbaum, legal director of the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Southern California. "At minimum, it has sowed enormous confusion in 
the area of health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. signed the restraining order Nov. 21, the 
state did not send out copies to health care facilities until this week. The 
order states that "a verbatim copy of this order shall be promptly sent" to 
state employees and all health care facilities responsible for implementing the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the attorney general's office participated in the drafting 
of the restraining order, but a spokesman said the office did not begin moving 
forward on distributing notices until Nov. 28, the day an official copy of the 
court order arrived in the mail. Later that day, spokesman David Puglia said, 
the office sent an overnight copy to the Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was prompt," Puglia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health Services did not finish mailing copies to 90,000 
health care providers until a week later, said spokeswoman Shannon Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not acting in bad faith and it was not delayed," Bowman said. 
"Notifications take time. (Besides), most people it went to already were aware 
there was a restraining order." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187 said they have received queries from health 
providers who received the governor's executive order after the restraining 
order was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time the state of California acts regarding 187 in such a way that it 
creates confusion, it lends fuel to the fears of people," said Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund attorney Vibiana Andrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer will decide whether to 
issue a preliminary injunction blocking implementation of Proposition 187 until 
its legality is determined in extensive court hearings. The proposition would 
ban illegal immigrants from public education, non-emergency health care and 
social welfare services. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a brief filed on behalf of more than 50 pro-187 individuals and 
organizations, Santa Monica attorney Richard Knickerbocker asked the court to 
be allowed to submit legal briefs and participate in oral arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Others joining in the brief include Prince's campaign co-chairs, Barbara Kiley 
and Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia), the California Coalition for 
Immigration Reform, the American Federation of Police and the Voice of Citizens 
Together. The pro-187 camp is concerned that Lungren is not adequately pursuing 
the defense of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Puglia said Lungren's office will not oppose the friend-of-the-court motion, 
adding that the criticism of Lungren "is to be expected." 
</P>
<P>
 "If any organization wants to convince the court that they be allowed in, 
there has to be some showing that their perspective is perhaps not entirely 
100% the same as those on the same side," Puglia said. "So it's the way the 
game is played." More on Immigration

EXPERTS WARN OF STRONGER QUAKES IN STATE; SAFETY: ONE CALLS JAN. 17 TEMBLOR 'A 
NEAR MISS' FOR L.A.'S HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS. SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION MEETS 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of a state Seismic Safety Commission report to the governor on 
construction safeguards in the wake of the Northridge earthquake, several 
leading scientists reiterated warnings Wednesday that stronger temblors will 
occur in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pointed message delivered at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical 
Union, Tom Heaton of the Pasadena field office of the U.S. Geological Survey 
said the Northridge quake had represented "a near miss" for Los Angeles' 
high-rise buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaton said state authorities should be aware that the strongest shaking Jan. 
17 was under the Santa Susana Mountains, "where the tall buildings weren't." He 
said it is highly likely that there will be quakes in the Los Angeles Basin 
that will be stronger, last longer and be even more centrally located. 
</P>
<P>
 The seismologist noted that cracks had appeared in steel-framed buildings in 
the Northridge earthquake, and suggested that construction codes be 
strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after Heaton's remarks, another scientist, Caltech's Egill 
Hauksson, expressed concern that the building code standards recommended in the 
upcoming Seismic Safety Commission report may not be strong enough to weather 
major quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission meets in Sacramento today. Its report to Gov. Pete Wilson is 
more than three months late. At a meeting last month, members suggested that 
they might not recommend certain revisions of state building codes that they 
thought might be too costly. Regardless of those recommendations, scientists 
here Wednesday said that there is a definite prospect of larger and possibly 
more frequent earthquakes in the urban areas of Southern California and the San 
Francisco Bay Area, where the damage would be heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 James F. Dolan of Caltech noted that studies of past quake records indicate 
that there have been fewer quakes in the last century than would normally be 
expected in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be that big quakes either come in clusters, or that Southern 
California is in a "centuries-long interseismic period between much larger, 
less frequent events," Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 His data suggests that there have been no quakes between magnitude 7.2 and 7.6 
generated within the Los Angeles metropolitan area since 1800, when record 
keeping began. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mori, the scientist in charge of the Geological Survey's Pasadena office, 
estimated that a Northridge-size earthquake, now measured at magnitude 6.7, 
might occur in the Los Angeles region about once every 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnitude 7 earthquakes are to be expected in the Los Angeles Basin, he said, 
and the motions generated from them could put dangerous strains on high-rise 
buildings if they were centered in built-up areas.

JUDGES OVERTURN ARIZONA'S 'ENGLISH-ONLY' LAW; COURTS: VOTER-APPROVED STATUTE 
APPLIED TO STATE EMPLOYEES DOING GOVERNMENT BUSINESS. APPEALS PANEL RULES IT 
VIOLATES 1ST AMENDMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Declaring that "the diverse and multicultural character of our society is 
widely recognized as . . . among our greatest strengths," a federal appeals 
court in San Francisco struck down an Arizona law that ordered state employees 
performing government business to speak and write only in English. 
</P>
<P>
 USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said the ruling is quite significant 
because "it is the first decision overturning a state English-only initiative." 
He said Wednesday's decision harked back to a landmark 1923 U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling that toppled a post-World War I Nebraska law prohibiting the teaching of 
German in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-0 decision, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 
"official English" statute, enacted into law by voters as Article 28 of the 
state Constitution in 1988, violates the 1st Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote that the court recognizes "the 
importance of promoting democracy and national unity and encouraging common 
language as a means of encouraging such unity," the two primary justifications 
advanced by the law's proponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot agree, however, that Article 28 is in any way a fair, effective, or 
appropriate means of promoting those interests. As we have learned time and 
again in our history, the state cannot achieve unity by prescribing orthodoxy." 
</P>
<P>
 Judges Betty B. Fletcher and Thomas Tang joined in the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The direct effect of the provision is not only to restrict the rights of all 
state and local government servants in Arizona, but also to severely impair the 
free speech interests of a portion of the populace they serve," the judges 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very bright day for all Arizonans who believe in free speech, not just 
our Hispanic community," said Phoenix attorney Robert J. Pohlman, who 
represented the people challenging the law. "We always had confidence that the 
law would be struck down as overbroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnaby W. Zall, a Washington attorney who represented Arizonans for Official 
English, said he was disappointed in the ruling: "We believe Article 28 of the 
Arizona Constitution . . . doesn't violate the 1st Amendment rights of Arizona 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Zall noted that there are 19 states with official English language laws. "This 
decision will obviously have some effect on those laws or on the passage of new 
laws." But he added that it was too early to tell how broad the impact would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 19 states -- California and Hawaii -- are in the 9th Circuit and 
therefore covered by the ruling. A section was added to the California 
Constitution by ballot initiative in 1986 establishing English as the official 
language of the state. However, Wednesday's ruling refers to the provision as 
"primarily symbolic." It imposes no bar on the use of other languages and does 
not affect their use in the functioning of state government. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling will not affect private employers, Chemerinsky noted. In June, the 
U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for private employers to enforce 
English-only rules for their bilingual workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 7-2 vote, the high court refused to hear an appeal of a decision in a San 
Francisco case that held that requiring workers to speak English on the job 
does not violate federal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the Supreme Court left in place a 9th Circuit decision, which 
concluded that where workers can speak both English and Spanish, requiring them 
to converse only in English at work may be an "inconvenience for some" but it 
"does not impose a burden significant enough to amount to the denial of equal 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Chemerinsky said Wednesday's decision is clearly distinct from the earlier 9th 
Circuit case because private employers have the right to impose greater 
restrictions on the speech of their employees than the government can. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona law was challenged two days after it was passed by voters. 
Maria-Kelley F. Yniguez, an insurance claims adjuster in Arizona's Risk 
Management Division, sued in federal court in Phoenix, contending that the law 
violated her 1st Amendment rights by making her "afraid to speak Spanish at 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Yniguez said she needed to speak Spanish to deal with people who filed medical 
malpractice claims against the state. Prior to the law's passage, Yniguez 
communicated in Spanish with monolingual Spanish-speaking claimants, and in a 
combination of English and Spanish with bilingual claimants. Because state 
employees who fail to obey the Arizona Constitution are subject to employment 
sanctions, Yniguez ceased speaking Spanish on the job after the law passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining her as a plaintiff in the lawsuit was Jaime P. Gutierrez, a state 
senator from Tucson. Gutierrez said that if the law were upheld, he would be 
violating his oath to uphold the Arizona Constitution every time he spoke to a 
constituent in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Paul G. Rosenblatt in Phoenix found in their favor and 
issued an injunction prohibiting the law from going into effect, setting the 
stage for a lengthy appeal process leading to Wednesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel noted that the Supreme Court previously accorded 1st 
Amendment status to choice of language in a very different context -- a case 
overturing the conviction of a California man who uttered an obscenity about 
the draft during the Vietnam War. The Supreme Court ruled in that case that 
California could not excise "one particularly scurrilous epithet from public 
discourse." 
</P>
<P>
 "Under Article 28, of course, the state is not singling out one word for 
repression, but rather entire vocabularies. Moreover, the languages of 
Cervantes, Proust, Tolstoy and Lao-Tze, among others, can hardly be described 
as 'scurrilous,' " Reinhardt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said there was no basis in the record to support proponents' 
assertion that any broad societal interest, such as "protecting democracy by 
encouraging 'unity and political stability,' " would be served by the law. 
Moreover, the judges found that there would be negative consequences if the law 
were allowed to stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The practical effects of (the law's) de facto bar on communications by or 
with government employees are numerous are varied. For example, monolingual 
Spanish-speaking residents of Arizona cannot, consistent with the article, 
communicate effectively with employees of a state or local housing office about 
a landlord's wrongful retention of rental deposit, nor can they learn from 
clerks of the state court about how and where to file small claims court 
complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said the law's impact would be "especially egregious because it is 
not uniformly spread over the population, but falls almost entirely upon 
Hispanic and other national origin minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 They added: "Since language is a close and meaningful proxy for national 
origin, restrictions on the use of languages may mask discrimination against 
specific national origin groups, or more generally, conceal nativist 
sentiment."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WILLIE BROWN'S UNLIKELY TURN AS FOLK HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a two-day tragicomedy starring Willie Brown as the unlikely hero. All 
the laughing was at Republicans, the gang that couldn't count straight. The 
tragic character was Paul Horcher, the man without a party. Or political sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's brilliance was not a shocker. The twist was that Brown, long a public 
villain, suddenly became a folk hero. People love a good comeback tale. Joe 
Montana in the fourth quarter. George Foreman, oldest heavyweight champ. 
</P>
<P>
 We open with GOP leader Jim Brulte boastfully predicting a quick knockout of 
the overmatched Brown. We close with Republicans cowering in caucus, not daring 
to venture within the old wizard's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie the magician. He turns 39 Democratic votes into 40 when Horcher deserts 
the GOP, declares himself an independent and votes to keep Brown as Speaker. No 
knockout this day. It's a 40-40 draw. 
</P>
<P>
 The second day, a chief clerk whose parliamentary rulings had thwarted and 
angered Brown suddenly calls in sick, suffering from stress. Brown -- "the 
senior member" -- takes over as parliamentarian and presiding officer. 
Republicans run. Without a quorum, the magician can't turn himself back into a 
Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Time for an intermission. Next act: Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So where does all this stand, the greatest speakership fight of all time? The 
greatest, at least, since Willie Brown won the last momentous fight 14 years 
ago. Certainly it's bigger than the great fight he lost six years before that. 
</P>
<P>
 The point here is that Brown is a veteran brawler. As he said after his famous 
1980 triumph, "Now this little black kid can count." Brulte, the untested 
challenger from Rancho Cucamonga, obviously hadn't learned to count by Monday's 
vote. That much we know. And really little else. 
</P>
<P>
 Where we stand is that Brulte won the first round, the Nov. 8 election when 
Republicans presumably picked up enough Assembly seats for control. Brown won 
the second round when Horcher defected and the clerk got sick. And about the 
only other thing we know is that everything else is guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know for sure why Horcher, representing a conservative district in 
the east San Gabriel Valley, sided with Willie Brown of liberal San Francisco. 
Or why the clerk, a Brown protege, disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 We can guess, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I'm Pollyannaish, but I think the clerk legitimately got sick. And not 
just because he produced a doctor's note. It makes for a better story to 
envision Brown taking him for a ride and suggesting a vacation. But the clerk 
is an uptight guy. And on Wednesday, after several hours of presiding over a 
tense House, he was verbally abused by some of the most verbally gifted 
Democrats. I'm guessing he got a pretty good headache. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for Horcher, how can anyone assess irrationality or deal with an irrational 
man? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a lawmaker who betrayed his party colleagues two years ago by accepting 
Brown's offer of a coveted committee vice chairmanship while the GOP caucus was 
fighting to get another Republican appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's somebody, ironically, who in a Senate race this year accused his 
conservative opponent of being a lackey for Brown. A politician who refused to 
return the telephone calls of a governor trying to lobby for a Republican 
Speaker. But somebody who assured a friend he'd "be there for the governor" on 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A dazed-looking man who showed up Monday with two press releases -- one 
explaining why he'd deserted the GOP (the right wing has taken over), the other 
(soon discarded) saying why he'd voted for Brulte. Whose top aide promised a 
Brulte liaison that Horcher would be the GOP leader's 41st vote. A turncoat who 
minutes later during the roll call shouted "Brown" and banged his fist on the 
desk -- instantly igniting a local recall movement. 
</P>
<P>
 What did Brown promise Horcher? Nothing, they both insist. And I believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 My guess is that Brown -- despite the magician mystique -- did very little to 
win this round. The most important thing he did was name Horcher to that 
committee vice chairmanship and so ruffle Republicans that they angrily treated 
their colleague like dirt for two years. A sullen, bitter Horcher finally took 
his revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 While Republicans were giving Horcher the silent treatment, Brown was playing 
him like Itzhak Perlman on a Stradivarius. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what we don't know is whether in the next act Willie Brown will revert to 
being a villain, making it easier for some Democrats to vote against him. 
Whether Jim Brulte will learn to count. And just how tragic Paul Horcher will 
become.

ACTING DIRECTOR NAMED TO TOP JOB AT LIVERMORE LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting on the recommendation of University of California President Jack W. 
Peltason, the UC Board of Regents on Wednesday appointed a new director of the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the government's premier nuclear 
weapons research centers. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Bruce Tarter, 54, an astrophysicist who has served as the lab's acting 
director since April, was named to the $186,600-a-year post effective 
immediately. He replaces John H. Nuckolls, who resigned after an internal 
review panel found "serious management shortcomings" during his five-year 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarter's appointment comes at a time when the U.S. Department of Energy is 
striving to make contractors such as the Livermore lab more accountable, 
tightening management practices and adopting stricter performance standards. 
Moreover, the facility is still adjusting to the dramatic reduction in funding 
for nuclear weapons research brought about by the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarter will be running an institution he knows very well. He joined the lab in 
1967 -- the year he got his Ph.D from Cornell University -- and he has held 
several high-level positions during his 27 years there. He was chosen after a 
nationwide search that attracted more than 80 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference at the UC system headquarters in Oakland, Tarter appeared 
to address some of the ongoing concerns about the lab, saying, "We have 
continuing national security responsibilities and will fulfill them and satisfy 
the sponsors of our work." 
</P>
<P>
 Peltason called Tarter a dynamic leader and praised him for the work he had 
done as acting director "to begin framing the future of the Livermore 
laboratory in response to the changing scientific and technical needs of the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
 For two generations, the University of California has overseen the 
laboratories that design, test and ensure the safety of the nation's nuclear 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Energy pays the UC system $30 million a year to manage 
Lawrence Livermore, which has 7,300 employees and an annual budget of almost 
$900 million, as well as Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and 
Lawrence Berkeley, which does no classified research. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to make its contractors more accountable, the Energy Department has 
recently begun requiring more efficient business practices. In one sign of 
closer scrutiny, the U.S. General Accounting Office has peppered the university 
and its Livermore facility with a series of stinging audits. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, auditors discovered that university managers and Livermore 
officials could not find more than 10,000 classified documents -- including 
material on nuclear weapons and laser design. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate investigations, the auditors discovered that Livermore had 
diverted millions of dollars earmarked for nuclear waste cleanup to independent 
research projects.

BILINGUAL EDUCATION GROUPS PROTEST CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A change in state policy that, if adopted, would allow local school districts 
to teach some students in English rather than their native language has 
outraged advocates of bilingual education, prompting them to organize a protest 
at the State Board of Education meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 The state board is considering dropping the state's policy requiring districts 
to teach students subjects such as history or math in what is known as their 
primary language. The state's bilingual education law expired seven years ago 
but rules are still being enforced mandating instruction in students' first 
language "when necessary" for them to keep up with their peers in other 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 One change to be discussed by a state board committee today would allow 
California's local school districts to abide by the looser federal mandates for 
teaching bilingual students. Those rules allow districts to choose from several 
teaching methods as long as it can be proved that children who are not fluent 
in English are continuing to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion is being interpreted by the California Assn. for Bilingual 
Education and many other bilingual education proponents as a preemptive strike 
against Spanish and other languages inspired by the anti-immigrant sentiment of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping the primary language requirement would be "a real step back," said 
Silvino Rubinstein, an administrator with the Montebello school district and 
director of legislative affairs for the bilingual education association. 
</P>
<P>
 She said researchers have found that effective bilingual education programs 
use a variety of methods, such as English as a second language and English 
language immersion, as well as instruction in the student's first language. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one of those components is no longer a requirement, there's no guarantee 
that we will have a clear direction of what a good bilingual program is," 
Rubinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of bilingual advocates and parents from Los Angeles, Pasadena, 
Montebello and other school districts around the state plan to travel to 
Sacramento to protest any changes in the state's policy before the school board 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But board President Marion McDowell of San Carlos said that Thursday's meeting 
is to hear from the public, not take action. In a letter to legislators 
concerned about the issue, she wrote that "we will likely consider a range of 
options before we take action, if we take action at all." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a fifth of California students grow up in homes where English is not 
the main spoken language. The first language of more than 400,000 Los Angeles 
County students is Spanish and 100,000 or so speak one of 43 other languages. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary language approach required by the state means that school 
districts have to try to find teachers who are fluent in every language from 
Arabic to Vietnamese. Well over $300 million in state and federal funds will be 
spent this year on bilingual education in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie J. Franco, who oversees the bilingual program for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, said the district operates under a master plan that 
would be unaffected even if the state board changed its policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said such a policy change could reopen a discussion of the district's 
approach. "Some in the community who don't understand will call board members 
and say (primary language instruction) is optional, so why do you have to have 
it in Los Angeles," Franco said.

GORBACHEV AIMS FOR YELTSIN'S JOB 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev made clear Wednesday that he wants 
to replace Boris N. Yeltsin as Russian president, possibly in 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pay a lot of attention to that subject, and I cannot exclude that," he said 
when asked at a news conference about running in the country's 1996 balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev, in the United Arab Emirates for a conference on information 
technology, resigned as president of the Soviet Union as it broke up in 1991, 
leaving Yeltsin as president of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev -- who has sharply criticized his former ally Yeltsin -- said he 
would promote new democratic reforms, freedom of choice and a mixed economy.

AMERICAN ALBUM: FOR NAPLES (FLORIDA), 'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY; THE BOOMING 
GULF OF MEXICO RESORT TOWN PUTS ON ITS HAPPY FACE AS AMERICA'S TOP CEOS FLEE 
THE WINTER COLD AND GO SOUTH TO PLAY. 
</P>

 Along Gulf Shore Boulevard, the shutters are coming down from the windows of 
waterfront mansions. Private jets line the tarmac at Naples Airport, wing to 
wing. And last month soprano June Anderson kicked off the Philharmonic Center's 
winter season with selections from Puccini and Bizet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was marvelous," said local arts maven Myra Janco Daniels, president of the 
Naples Philharmonic. "We do have a wonderful world here." 
</P>
<P>
 For the fortunate few who can afford to live in this elegant city nestled 
along Florida's southwest coast, these are the days. As the daytime temperature 
drops into the comfort zone and the moneyed snowbirds return from the North to 
open their winter residences, about the only concern of some here is whether 
Naples really did lose the unofficial title of America's golf course capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Golf Foundation recently reported that with the addition of a 
couple of new courses, Myrtle Beach, S.C., now counted only 147 people per golf 
hole -- compared to Naples' 194. But no one here is panicking. There are 48 
golf courses now ready for play, and more are being built. 
</P>
<P>
 "By a lot of people's definition, this is the best place in Florida -- safe, 
clean and well-mannered," says John Ayres, a hotelier who heads the Naples 
Visitors Bureau. "Weather, golf, shopping, the arts -- we've sort of got it 
all, in a very first-class little package." 
</P>
<P>
 A stroll through the downtown area provides an insight into what Naples is 
about. Art galleries, pricey boutiques, banks and stock brokerages predominate. 
There are no pawn shops or discount outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the well-manicured, tightly zoned facade are some impressive numbers. 
According to Kiplinger's Florida Business Letter, only two cities in the United 
States have a higher percentage of households with incomes over $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city ranks first in Florida in the cost of housing, with the average home 
selling for almost $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With no budget motels, Naples also has the highest average hotel room rate in 
Florida, about $200-a-night in season. And as everyone here knows, more active 
and retired CEOs of Fortune 500 companies have winter homes in Naples than in 
any other resort city in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who come from big product companies -- General Motors, Ford, 
General Electric, Pillsbury," says Daniels, who relies on these residents to 
help underwrite the Philharmonic Center's annual $11.6-million budget. "I think 
maybe only Aspen gives us a run." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five years ago, Naples was home to no more than 15,000 people, an 
out-of-the-way resort noted for a turn-of-the-century fishing pier that reached 
1,000 feet into the Gulf of Mexico. The pier is still there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Naples has boomed under the crush of wealthy industrialists and corporate 
executives, especially those from the Midwest hunting for a balmy winter 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
 The year-round population of Naples is only 20,000, swelling to almost double 
that in the winter months. But surrounding Collier County has boomed, from 
80,000 residents in 1980 to more than double that today. 
</P>
<P>
 While growth in the Naples area has slowed, from 7% a year in the 1980s to 
4.5% last year, the boom has caused management problems, with particular 
concern about water quality and preservation of the fragile Everglades 
ecosystem that extends over most of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the main issue: How do we keep our quality of life as we grow? How do 
we keep Naples' charm and cleanliness?" asks Bill Neron of the county's 
Economic Development Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The answers, Neron suggests, are tough zoning laws and a citizenry protective 
of the good life they enjoy. "Private citizens donate money for public 
landscaping," he says, "so the ambience of Naples is such that when you drive 
through the community, you say, 'Wow! The whole area is beautiful.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, most of the thousands of service industry workers here cannot 
afford to live in town and must commute from other areas in Collier County. 
"With the growth of hotels and tourism, we have created a lot of 
service-related job," Neron says. "And we're trying to diversify by attracting 
some clean, high-tech industry. But it's tough to compete with Ft. Myers" and 
other cities to the north.

 Tourism has always been the major industry in the Naples area, and the outlook 
for this year is for "the best season we've ever had," Ayres says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer, when temperatures climb back into the 90s and nary a breeze 
ripples the Gulf of Mexico, the population of Naples drops by about 35%, nearly 
15% of the local businesses close and the hotel rates plummet into the range of 
merely expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 It is quiet in Naples in the summer, and that's just how Paul Thomas likes it. 
"The main thing is, I feel secure here," says Thomas, who comes home on the 
weekends from a tourist directory business he owns in Hollywood, Fla. "A year 
ago in Miami Beach, I was held up at gunpoint, robbed of my credit cards and 
watch, hit on the head and thrown in Biscayne Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want excitement, Miami Beach is the place. But if you want to retire, 
or peace of mind -- Naples."

 FAMILY FRIENDLY: Seeking to begin their emphasis on "family values" at home, 
incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and fellow Republicans are 
establishing a Family Friendly Advisory Commission to create a House schedule 
that will allow lawmakers to spend more time with spouses and children. Among 
the ideas being explored are convening only on Tuesdays through Thursdays to 
give those who live in their districts more time at home, starting and ending 
sessions earlier in the day to give those who live in Washington more time with 
families, and planning breaks to coincide with school vacations. "I think it's 
terribly exciting," said Janis Berman, wife of Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and a member of the bipartisan panel. "The culture here is 
workaholic, totally alien to working Americans. This is truly going to make a 
difference."

 SMOKIN' MAD: Although the tobacco industry has been under siege of late, there 
are signs it still has some clout on Capitol Hill. R.J. Reynolds succeeded in 
overcoming complaints by the American Lung Assn. concerning the tobacco giant's 
appearance at Occupational Safety and Health Administration hearings on the 
issue of second-hand smoke. OSHA has proposed a ban on smoking in all 
workplaces because of health risks from secondhand smoke. The tussle began when 
the lung association tried to scuttle RJR's plan to have its scientists and 
engineers appear jointly at the hearing, rather than testifying individually. 
RJR thought the joint appearance would be more effective, while the lung 
association thought the mass appearance would deflect tough questioning. When 
the objections arose, RJR withdrew from the hearings. But after closeted 
discussions with OSHA, RJR prevailed. Its experts will appear together Jan. 
17-19.

 CLINTON IN '96: Democratic sources say the White House is hoping to persuade 
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown to leave his post and become chairman of 
President Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign. Brown, the first African American 
chairman of the Democratic Party, has the added attraction of being close to 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has threatened to run against Clinton. There also 
is talk that Clinton's campaign manager will be Harold M. Ickes, White House 
deputy chief of staff who, like Brown, once served as an adviser to Jackson. 
But given Ickes' liberal bent, some wonder how his involvement would square 
with the President's effort to slide to the political right.

Samuels, assistant secretary for tax policy, will probably stay. The only 
senior staffer likely to leave is Josh Steiner, Bentsen's chief of staff.

 FRIENDLY FIRE: Two prominent GOP senators who tried to launch an attack on the 
President's defense budget this week ran into some heavy flak -- from their own 
side. Sens. John W. Warner (R-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) held a press 
conference to unveil their own plans for budget changes. But they neglected to 
clear the package with Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), the incoming chairman of 
the Armed Services Committee. After Thurmond found out from reporters, he 
issued a press release that began: "Sens. McCain and Warner did not consult 
with me prior to the public release of their defense priorities."

ZEDILLO CONFRONTS CHIAPAS REBELS TODAY; MEXICO: NEW PRESIDENT WILL VISIT 
SOUTHERN STATE FOR INAUGURATION OF GOVERNOR. GUERRILLAS ARE DETERMINED TO HALT 
CEREMONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after taking office, President Ernesto Zedillo today confronts 
guerrillas threatening to renew a long-simmering rebellion as well as thousands 
of protesting peasants converging on the capital of the deeply divided and 
nearly lawless state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels and peasants are determined to halt the inauguration of Gov.-elect 
Eduardo Robledo Rincon, candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI), who they say was elected by fraud Aug. 21, the same day the 
president was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo has said he is equally determined that Robledo will take office, 
returning a sense of order to this impoverished state that many contend has 
become ungovernable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the nightmare," were the opening words of a communique to Zedillo 
released Tuesday by the charismatic rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos. 
While Marcos stopped short of declaring war, the sentiment building in recent 
weeks has swollen the numbers in the state's 16 refugee shelters from 2,800 in 
early August to 4,094 at the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
 Peasants in rebel-held territory fear a return to the violence that shook 
Mexico during the first 12 days of January. At least 145 died in the fighting 
that began New Year's Day when the guerrillas, calling themselves the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army, after the turn-of-the-century Indian revolutionary 
Emiliano Zapata, briefly occupied four county seats near the Guatemalan border, 
demanding democracy and better living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the fearful peasants, soldiers at a checkpoint on a road out of 
this state capital toward rebel-held territory have erected a Christmas tree 
made of lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Chiapas does become a nightmare is likely to be determined largely by 
today's developments. Those events will set the tone for Zedillo's relationship 
with hard-line opponents, from protesters to the Zapatistas, who have observed 
an uneasy truce with the government since mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of protests in several states, Zedillo's predecessor, Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, took a conciliatory line with opposition parties, 
installing interim governors and promising new elections -- though those have 
yet to take place. That set a precedent, some observers say, for winning 
elections in the street rather than at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The new president has shown his willingness to work with other parties by 
appointing a right-wing opposition party member as attorney general and by 
meeting Tuesday with legislators of all parties. However, he has indicated that 
he is less amenable to negotiating with angry crowds blocking statehouses to 
prevent inaugurations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot make right supposed wrongs by committing other wrongs," Zedillo 
told the 500 Mexican congressional representatives during his meeting with 
them, referring to post-electoral conflicts in Chiapas and Tabasco states. 
</P>
<P>
 To show his support for Robledo, the president is expected to attend the 
inauguration, whose exact location was still uncertain late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As this morning's ceremony neared, the two sides appeared to be at a 
stalemate. About 2,000 peasants have arrived here, determined to prevent the 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel, 26, a peasant leader from the village of San Ignacio el Gringo, near 
the border with Oaxaca on the north, said he had joined the five-day march to 
the capital "because we want the governor we elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of those interviewed, he refused to give his last name for fear of 
reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 As groups of protesters arrived, they marched along the capital's palm-lined 
boulevards in orderly rows under police escort and settled into the main plaza 
in front of the Statehouse. Unarmed police guarded the building with barricades 
that looked like bicycle racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day Wednesday, protesters waved fists in the air and chanted 
slogans such as, "If there is no solution, there will be a revolution," when 
television cameras approached, then dispersed to find shade when crews left. 
</P>
<P>
 Amado Avendano, the defeated candidate for governor, rejected Robledo's offer 
of a seat in a coalition Cabinet and repudiated as "bluster" a statement issued 
by authorities after his weekend meeting with Interior Minister Esteban 
Moctezuma Barragan. The six-point statement was said to ensure a peaceful 
transition of power and to permit peaceful protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Avendano stood with Marcos and other armed guerrillas at a news conference for 
about 170 reporters in the remote village of Aguascalientes when the rebels 
said the inauguration of Robledo would mean an end to the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The period of peaceful resistance in Chiapas ends the moment that Mr. Eduardo 
Robledo is inaugurated and usurps state executive power," the ski-masked, 
pipe-smoking Marcos said. "Beginning when Eduardo Robledo takes office, 
anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Avendano will be recognized as governor in rebel-held territory, which 
includes parts of three huge rural counties, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Robledo has said he would resign if the Zapatistas put down their arms. But 
the rebels have consistently refused to do that, saying weapons provide their 
only leverage in dealing with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas have already broken off peace talks with the government. They 
had threatened a return to violence if they believed the Aug. 21 elections to 
be fraudulent, as they now say they do, and if Zedillo was inaugurated Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of those dates created panic in the state," said Jose Luis Albores, 
president of the local Chamber of Commerce. "We are a short way from a 
collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo told Congress on Tuesday that he recognizes that the violence in 
Chiapas is the product of desperation caused by injustice, abandonment and 
misery. Despite generating much of Mexico's oil, natural gas and hydroelectric 
power, Chiapas is among the country's poorest states, and its poor are 
overwhelmingly Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must attack the violence at its roots, in injustice and poverty," Zedillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he also warned, "We can only build peace if everyone is willing to 
negotiate, which means giving up something." More on Chiapas

CORRUPTION TRIAL OF EX-PRESIDENT OPENS IN BRAZIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello went on trial for 
corruption Wednesday amid predictions that he will be found not guilty for lack 
of proof. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court trial began with Justice Ilmar Galvao summarizing the cases 
for and against Collor, who resigned two years ago during a scandal that shook 
Latin America's largest country. 
</P>
<P>
 Collor, 45, faces one count of passive corruption stemming from an alleged 
multimillion-dollar influence-peddling scheme. He could be sentenced to eight 
years in prison if found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Passive corruption is defined as soliciting or getting "undue advantage" for 
oneself or others because of one's public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers said prosecutors probably lack enough proof to convict Collor 
despite two years of investigation and more than 60,000 pages of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight other people are accused in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of Collor, who took office in 1990 vowing to clean up his country's 
politics, was seen as a strong boost for democracy and honest government in 
Brazil, which emerged from a 21-year military dictatorship in 1985.

ARAFAT PLEDGES TO FIGHT TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAELIS; MIDEAST: HIS RESPONSE TO 
U.S. PUSH MEETS THE JEWISH STATE'S MINIMUM DEMAND FOR PULLING TROOPS FROM WEST 
BANK CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, responding to a firm push from U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, promised Wednesday that his self-rule 
government will do all it can to stop terrorism against Israelis, meeting 
Israel's minimum demand for pulling its troops out of West Bank cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking to have very quickly elections, but at the same time we are 
putting into consideration the needs of security for the Israelis, and we are 
ready to discuss it in detail with them," Arafat said, as Christopher stood 
next to him in the seaside headquarters of the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization chairman's carefully worded pledge was 
prompted by Christopher, who said Tuesday that Israel cannot be expected to 
withdraw its West Bank occupation force until the security of Israelis is 
assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials have hinted that they will delay or cancel the pullout if a 
recent spate of terrorist incidents continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the peace agreement approved by Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israel is required to withdraw its troops from 
Palestinian cities and towns in advance of Palestinian elections. Israel and 
the PLO are negotiating in Cairo over the date and the conditions for the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli Cabinet, meanwhile, debated for a second day the future of Jewish 
settlements in the West Bank after Israeli forces are pulled back, but the 
ministers were apparently divided over whether to uproot the communities, many 
of them small and isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher traveled in a bulletproof car on the two-hour trip from Jerusalem 
to Gaza to hold a meeting of just under an hour with Arafat. U.S. officials 
said Christopher's visit was intended to help Arafat reverse his plummeting 
popularity with the Palestinian public, although the officials conceded that 
Washington has no friends and little influence among anti-Arafat extremists. 
Nevertheless, both the United States and Israel believe that the success of the 
peace process is linked to Arafat's political strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO chairman is beset by festering problems, including friction with 
Israel, a shortage of funds for self-government and bloody conflict between his 
police and anti-Arafat Islamic fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to Gaza again today to demonstrate the importance the United States 
attaches to the success of the Palestinian self-government," said Christopher, 
who returned to Jerusalem afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlining Arafat's security pledge, Christopher said the PLO chairman "made 
it clear that he understands the responsibilities and commitments that he has 
undertaken in the (peace pact) and that he intends to carry out those 
responsibilities against terror and violence." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said later that the Israelis realize that the 
Palestinian police cannot wipe out the terrorism that the Israeli police and 
army have been unable to stop for decades. However, the official said, Israel 
wants to be assured that the authority will do all it can to deal with the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's visit to Gaza came less than a week after the World Bank and 
other international aid donors agreed at a U.S.-sponsored conference to give 
the Palestinian Authority more than $100 million to balance its budget through 
March 31. In exchange, Arafat agreed to reforms designed to ensure that the 
money would be properly spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher later said the session was "the best meeting I've ever had" with 
Arafat, a U.S. official said. The official added that Arafat was upbeat about 
his negotiations with Israel pending a meeting today with Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres. Arafat meets Saturday in Oslo with Rabin as he and the 
prime minister receive the Nobel Peace Prize for their peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. officials said Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad assured 
Christopher that they will end a spate of pessimistic assessments of their 
U.S.-mediated peace talks. In recent weeks, both officials have complained that 
the negotiations are nearing a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that creating a more pleasant and calm atmosphere, with fewer 
bombastic pronouncements, will allow for the return of an atmosphere that will 
provide a chance for furthering the process," Rabin said after a morning 
meeting in Jerusalem with Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said Christopher's meetings Tuesday in Damascus, Syria, had nudged the 
two sides a bit closer to a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher returns to the United States today without going back to Damascus 
to report on his meetings with Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin has emphasized repeatedly that no Israeli settlement would be removed 
under the agreements signed so far with the PLO, but other ministers told the 
Cabinet session that communities that pose security risks, either for the 
residents or the troops guarding them, should be moved.

3 VIE TO HEAD JAPAN'S NEW OPPOSITION PARTY; ASIA: INFIGHTING MAY UNDERCUT NEW 
FRONTIER'S CHANCES TO GIVE THE COUNTRY A STRONG TWO-PARTY SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fissures within a new opposition party that might give Japan a two-party 
system rose to the surface Wednesday when talks to choose a leader by consensus 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, three candidates -- former Prime Ministers Toshiki Kaifu and Tsutomu 
Hata, and Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the middle-of-the-road Democratic 
Socialist Party -- filed to run for leadership of the New Frontier Party in a 
vote that will be held today. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight parties joining to form the new party have about 180 representatives 
in the lower house -- roughly 20 fewer than the Liberal Democrats who now 
govern in coalition with the smaller Socialist Party. That would make the New 
Frontier legislators the largest opposition force in Japan's modern political 
history. But the divisions in their ranks point to a troubled future, 
regardless of who wins the leadership contest. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the candidates waited until just before the Wednesday deadline to 
file. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro Ozawa, who in June, 1993, led a mass defection from the Liberal 
Democrats that broke the party's 38-year lock on the national government, was 
named Frontier's new secretary general when no rivals filed by the deadline. As 
campaign director and chief fund-raiser, he is expected to act as Frontier's 
chief strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, the splintering of the opposition helped to sustain 
the Liberal Democrats' seemingly unbreakable grasp on power until the Ozawa-led 
rebellion. Between 1955 and 1993, no opposition party ever held more than 167 
seats in the 511-member lower house. The Socialists, who head the current 
coalition government, won that many in a 1958 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Minoru Morita, a respected political commentator, predicted that Frontier's 
infighting and its failure to offer clear policy alternatives would allow the 
Liberal Democrats to regain sole control of government in the next general 
election. He predicted that vote would probably be held simultaneously with a 
regular upper house election in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists, who abandoned all their traditional policies to ally 
themselves with the Liberal Democrats in what the Frontier Party has called an 
"illicit union," will lose seats by the dozens, opening the door to a Liberal 
Democratic victory, Morita predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Morita said, both the Liberal Democratic and the New Frontier parties 
reflect within their ranks the deep divisions of Japanese politics: whether 
Japan should be an open or a closed society and have a small or a large 
government. Consequently, neither party can enunciate clear policy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public apathy toward politics, as a result, has soared; 55% of the voters say 
they support no political party, the commentator added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata said he decided to force a vote on the Frontier leadership despite a week 
of talks aimed at naming Kaifu by consensus because "an election is democracy's 
social contract to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa, Hata's onetime political ally and usually an advocate of 
decision-making by majority vote rather than by back-room deals, disagreed this 
time. Since he and Hata belong to the Renewal Party, Ozawa favored Kaifu, a 
recent defector from the Liberal Democrats, as leader to provide a balance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Hata-Ozawa falling out, both the Buddhist-backed Komei 
(Clean Government) Party, the second-largest group in the new party, and 
Yonezawa's Democratic Socialists announced measures to keep their separate 
identities within the new party -- as if to preserve a fallback position should 
the Frontier Party break up. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, two lower house members of the Democratic Socialist Party, including 
its former chairman, Keigo Ouchi, said they will not join Frontier when it 
stages its inaugural convention Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi, who led the party into the first anti-LDP coalition in August, 1993, 
complained that Frontier lacks a unified political philosophy. He charged that 
"the new party is destined to become a party of the Soka Gakkai," a Buddhist 
laymen's group that founded and controls the Komei Party. 
</P>
<P>
 There is widespread public aversion to the Soka Gakkai's exercise of political 
power.

BRITAIN'S MAJOR BATTLES TO KEEP GOVERNMENT ON TRACK AFTER SETBACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister John Major, smarting from a surprise parliamentary defeat over 
a key element of the budget, fought Wednesday to pick up the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 He sanctioned a rise in interest rates to limit the impact of the defeat on 
the British pound, consulted with senior ministers to chart a new course for 
his government and urged business leaders to help him tackle the thorn in his 
side -- "Euroskeptic" rebels in his Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissident members of the party punched a $2.35-billion hole in the 
government's budget Tuesday by helping to carry an opposition Labor Party 
motion against an increased tax on home heating bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke held a half-hour meeting with Major 
on Wednesday to discuss tax increases and spending cuts that will be announced 
today to plug the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Major also met with Richard Ryder, the minister responsible for maintaining 
discipline among Conservative members of Parliament, to discuss how to avoid 
further House of Commons humiliations. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the eight MPs expelled from the Conservative parliamentary party last 
week for refusing to back Major in a vote over increasing Britain's 
contributions to the European Union helped engineer Tuesday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the vote on the tax, four abstained and three voted against it. The tax is 
deeply unpopular because of its impact on the poor, sick and elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's defeat left Major looking more than ever like the lame-duck head of 
a minority administration doomed to lurch from crisis to crisis until the next 
election, due by mid-1997.

JUDGE BLOCKS OREGON LAW ON ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A law that would have made Oregon the first government in the nation to allow 
doctor-assisted suicides for the terminally ill was blocked by a federal judge 
Wednesday, a day before it was to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan in Eugene issued a temporary restraining 
order, saying he wanted to hear arguments on whether the law is constitutional. 
He scheduled a Dec. 19 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's voters approved Measure 16 on Nov. 8. National Right to Life and 
other opponents immediately began legal assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure 16 allows terminally ill patients to request life-ending medication if 
a doctor determines that the patient has less than six months to live. The 
patient must ask for the drugs three times, including once in writing, get a 
second doctor's opinion and wait 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for a temporary restraining order was filed by James Bopp, a Terre 
Haute, Ind., lawyer and a nationally known opponent of assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing this so that people will not kill themselves," Bopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the assisted-suicide law predicted that it would withstand court 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The allegations raised by the opponents are complicated and numerous, but 
they will not be successful," said Eli Stutsman, a Portland lawyer who 
represents the Oregon Right to Die campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is the first of its kind. Doctor-assisted suicide is allowed in the 
Netherlands, but it remains technically illegal in that country, and doctors 
are guaranteed immunity from prosecution only if they follow strict guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon health officials were still trying to work out many details of the 
measure. Those included how assisted suicides would be listed on death 
certificates and how long someone has to live in Oregon to establish residency 
and be eligible for assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many doctors and pharmacists around the state were trying to 
decide whether to participate and, if so, which medications and dosages should 
be prescribed. Some doctors also have said it is impossible to predict 
accurately how long a patient has to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's deputy attorney general, Tom Balmer, said the state was prepared to 
defend the law on grounds that it meets all constitutional requirements.

FUROR SENDS 'MUSHROOM CLOUD' STAMP BACK FOR REDESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Postal Service indicated Wednesday that it will bow to White House 
pressure and redesign a proposed "mushroom cloud" stamp that it had planned to 
issue next year to commemorate the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued late Wednesday, the service said it is "mindful of the 
sensitivities on this issue" and is "taking into consideration the views of the 
Department of State and the White House, as well as other groups and 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our stamp program was designed to recognize significant people and events in 
American history -- not designed to generate controversy," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carefully worded statement was issued on the 53rd anniversary of the 
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The announcement came after the White House, 
concerned about protests from Japan that the design was insensitive, sided with 
Tokyo and intervened with the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta called 
Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. on Wednesday to tell him of the 
President's concerns about the stamp. On Tuesday, the State Department had 
called for withdrawal of the controversial design. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed stamp, part of a sheet of 10 such commemoratives to be issued in 
1995 to mark major turning points in World War II, contained a picture of a 
nuclear mushroom cloud, with the legend: "Atomic bombs hasten war's end, August 
1945." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States dropped its first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6 of that 
year in an effort to speed the end of the war and avert thousands of additional 
U.S. casualties. Three days later, it dropped a second bomb on Nagasaki. A week 
later, Japan surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the proposed stamp drew a formal diplomatic protest from Japan, which 
pointed out that the first bomb had killed an estimated 140,000 Japanese, while 
the one dropped on Nagasaki killed some 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some later critics of the U.S. decision to drop the bomb have charged that the 
estimates of likely U.S. troop casualties from a U.S. ground offensive in Japan 
were inflated, and that Washington decided to use the nuclear weapon primarily 
to frighten the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers told reporters on Wednesday that the 
White House did not object to the idea of commemorating the bombings, but said 
officials thought that the artwork depicting the nuclear mushroom cloud was a 
poor choice for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree that the atomic bomb helped speed the end of the war but, again, 
there could be more appropriate ways to depict that event," Myers said. "A 
different artwork would perhaps be more appropriate," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the fact that the White House had chosen to make known its 
displeasure on Pearl Harbor Day was not expected to go over well with veterans, 
some of whom already have been dismayed over Clinton's handling of the military 
and his efforts to avoid the draft in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Lew Wood, spokesman for the American Legion, said Wednesday that while his 
group did not have a "specific position" on the A-bomb stamp, he recalled that 
the government did not back Japanese objections to an earlier stamp, in 1991, 
commemorating the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is always entitled to his opinions," Wood said. But he added 
that it was "ironic that a decision such as that would be made on this (Pearl 
Harbor) day." More than half the Legion's members are World War II veterans.

SHOCK JOCK HOWARD STERN STOPS CALLER'S SUICIDE LEAP; MEDIA: MAN PHONED IN 
THREAT FROM EDGE OF BRIDGE. RADIO PERSONALITY SAYS HE DECIDED TO 'KEEP THIS MAN 
LAUGHING' UNTIL AUTHORITIES COULD ARRIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shock-radio personality Howard Stern, contacted by cellular phone by a man 
threatening to leap from the George Washington Bridge, kept the man talking 
during his Wednesday morning show until police could seize the would-be jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I determined this was a jumper, I said: 'I have to keep this man 
laughing . . . until the cops get there,' " Stern told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who better to help someone who is psychologically disturbed than Howard 
Stern, who himself is psychologically disturbed?" he joked as police officers 
offered congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Emilio Bonilla, 29, walked to the middle of the bridge, climbed 
over a railing and called Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me thank you for calling in," Stern told Bonilla. "I always wanted to 
help someone who was about to jump off a bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 As a national radio audience listened, the two spoke for several minutes as 
Bonilla threatened to plunge into the Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mentioned the fact I had a movie coming out and he would miss it if he 
would die," Stern said. "It caused him to laugh. But it also caused him to say: 
'Hey, wait a second. Maybe I should stay around for the movie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At another point, Stern told Bonilla: "You may think life's a bed of roses, 
but it's not" and pleaded with him to get "tuned into anything in life" with "a 
little hobby or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Authority Police Lt. Stanley Bleeker, who was listening to the drama, 
sent officers to the scene. They found that Helen Trimble of Brooklyn, another 
listener, had stopped her car and had wrapped Bonilla in a bearhug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard this man talking, saying he was looking at a police helicopter," 
Trimble said. " . . . I was looking on the bridge for a man talking on a 
cellular phone. He was easy to pick out. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped my car in the middle of the bridge and put a hug on him. He was 
shaking, and he was talking to you, and his face would lighten every once in a 
while," she later told Stern. "I don't know what you were saying to him. But he 
would lighten up and slowly, slowly, he started to relax a little bit more. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Bonilla, a New Yorker, was very distraught and was taken to a 
local hospital for psychiatric evaluation. He was charged with cocaine 
possession and reckless endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates 
the bridge, said there was no evidence that what occurred was a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, Stern wondered whether the call was a joke and he asked 
listeners on the bridge, which links New York City with New Jersey, to honk 
their horns. One driver beeped his horn, verifying the seriousness of the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is tremendous pressure on an individual when someone is pleading with 
you to give them a reason to live," Stern said at the news conference. "Through 
my calm, through my collected way, I was able to keep my wits about me and, of 
course, save the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern also said the incident should convince the Federal Communications 
Commission, which has fined him $1.67 million for indecency, of what a great 
guy he is.

MICHIGAN SENATE VOTES BAN ON KEVORKIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Michigan Senate, seeking to prevent Dr. Jack Kevorkian from counseling 
terminally ill people about suicide, approved a permanent ban against the 
practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary ban expired last month when a state commission failed to reach a 
consensus.Since then, legislators have been working to come up with a permanent 
ban to prevent Kevorkian from participating in any additional suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian's attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, called the bill "laughable" and said 
the Legislature is ignoring the wishes of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian has helped 21 people commit suicide since 1990. He faces two murder 
charges stemming from assisted suicides in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure must also be approved by the Michigan House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban sets a penalty of four years in prison and a $2,000 fine.

FORMER WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL CHIEF FACES THEFT CHARGES; PROBE: BILLY R. DALE IS 
ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLING MORE THAN $68,000. ASSOCIATES SAY HE IS THE VICTIM OF A 
WITCH HUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The former head of the White House travel office was indicted on theft charges 
Wednesday in an investigation that is also reviewing the conduct of two friends 
of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy R. Dale, the former travel office director who was a career civil 
servant, was charged by a federal grand jury with embezzling more than $68,000 
over a six-year period, using funds deposited by news organizations for 
reporters to travel with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates of Dale, 57, who is expected to plead not guilty, said the case is 
bound to shed light on internal workings of the Clinton White House and on what 
some said is a "political witch hunt" aimed at Dale by Clinton associates who 
had business or personal interests in the travel office. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department sources said their inquiry into Clinton supporters Harry 
Thomason and Catherine Cornelius is "still open." Complaints about the travel 
office by Thomason, a Hollywood producer, and Cornelius, a distant cousin of 
the President, led to last year's firing of Dale, a longtime employee of the 
travel office, and six others on grounds of poor management and possibly 
improper conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Dale nor his attorney, Steven C. Tabackman, was available for comment 
Wednesday. But Tabackman said recently that an indictment of Dale was expected 
"for something he simply did not do." Other sources close to Dale said that 
while his record-keeping may have been sloppy, he never converted money 
belonging to others to his own use. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the fired travel office employees were later rehired, and separate 
inquiries by the White House and the General Accounting Office raised questions 
about the White House's handling of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Dale have charged that Thomason owned an air-charter business that 
wanted a share of the White House travel business, and that Cornelius had 
expressed desires to run the White House travel operation. In his trial next 
year, for which no date has been set, Dale's attorneys are expected to portray 
both as "heavies" who ultimately caused Dale's legal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. Bennett, Thomason's Washington lawyer, said Wednesday that "Mr. 
Thomason is not the target of any investigation. He did absolutely nothing 
improper and had no interest in getting the travel business." Cornelius could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers declined comment on the indictment 
but pointed out that the Administration had revamped the travel office last 
year and cooperated with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements to reporters, Tabackman has suggested that his client was made a 
scapegoat because presidential aides were embarrassed by the furor that arose 
over the firing of Dale and others. He has vowed to question everyone allegedly 
involved in the dismissals, including Thomason, Cornelius and possibly First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Republicans have said they may hold hearings on the matter next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale, who faces a maximum possible punishment of 20 years in prison if 
convicted of the two-count indictment, began converting travel funds to his own 
use in February, 1988, the grand jury charged. Prosecutors believe that Dale 
used media money to help build a house, but his friends insist he kept a 
petty-cash fund only to take care of unexpected requests of the White House 
press corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale kept his petty-cash records in a black notebook and an envelope that now 
are missing, associates said.

CHARGES OF NAZI AID COULD COST CITIZENSHIP

<P>
 The Justice Department moved to strip an Ohio real estate agent of his U.S. 
citizenship Wednesday on grounds he allegedly persecuted Jews and others while 
serving in the Nazi-sponsored Lithuanian Security Police during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing captured records in the Lithuanian Central State Archives, the 
department's Office of Special Investigations, which hunts Nazis in this 
country, charged that Algimantas Dailide, on at least one occasion, 
participated in the arrest of Jews who had escaped from ghettos around Vilnius, 
Lithuania's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The records show that those Jews were jailed, the government said, noting that 
in such cases Jews routinely were executed or otherwise punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Dailide, 73, still owns and operates a small realty business in 
Brecksville, a suburb of Cleveland. Messages left for Dailide were not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
 But WJW-TV in Cleveland showed a videotape of Dailide's wife, Ruth, saying her 
husband had done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was a teen-ager; he was a student," she said. "He had to take care 
of his mother. He didn't do anything. My husband, he is innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Cleveland, the government said 
the Lithuanian Security Police, or Saugumas, acted as a subordinate component 
of the German Security Police and Security Service and had duties that 
paralleled those of the Gestapo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saugumas assisted Nazi occupying forces in enforcing the persecution of 
Vilnius Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 If it succeeds in stripping Dailide of U.S. citizenship, the government then 
would move to deport him.

9 NEW ORLEANS OFFICERS INDICTED ON DRUG, GUN CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine New Orleans police officers were indicted Wednesday on federal weapons 
and drug charges, and a federal prosecutor called corruption in the police 
department "rampant and systemic." 
</P>
<P>
 The nine officers are alleged to have taken part in and protected a complex 
drug-trafficking ring -- actually part of an FBI sting -- and accepted more 
than $97,000 in bribes, according to the grand jury indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 20 other officers could have been implicated in the drug ring if 
the yearlong FBI investigation had not been cut short to protect the safety of 
undercover agents, U.S. Atty. Eddie Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognized that because we were dealing with police officers as suspects 
we were going to have to carefully plan and execute each stage of the 
operation," FBI agent Neil Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire operation was conducted under a heavy blanket of tight security," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several years, more than 30 other New Orleans officers have been 
arrested and convicted for such crimes as bank robbery, bribery, theft and 
sexual offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would describe corruption in the New Orleans Police Department to be 
pervasive, rampant and systemic," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans Supt. of Police Richard Pennington, who took over in September 
after leaving the Washington, D.C., Police Department, said he is continuing 
the investigation and more charges could be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Marc Morial said he wants to see a a complete change in the way the 
Police Department's internal affairs division operates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be on a holy war. We are going to clean this department up," 
Morial said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI set up an undercover network of agents who acted as cocaine couriers 
and drug dealers. The agents contacted police officers who then provided 
security for the drug ring, often while in uniform and on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers protected the storage and movement of more than 130 kilograms of 
cocaine kept in a New Orleans warehouse, the grand jury indictment alleged.

POLL FINDS STRONG SUPPORT FOR GOP GOALS; POLITICS: TIMES MIRROR SURVEY FINDS 
LUKEWARM BACKING FOR TERM LIMITS AND CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT. SOME SPENDING HIKES 
FAVORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With an activist, Republican Congress poised at the reins, most Americans 
strongly support many of the GOP's top priorities, including crime control, 
welfare reform and further deficit reduction, according to a Times Mirror poll 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the survey found only tepid support for other items in the Republican 
"contract with America," such as term limits and a capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the contract calls for major increases in defense spending, the 
public for the most part wants funding levels to be maintained -- 44% favored 
maintaining current levels, 31% favored increases and 23% favored cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 And in some areas, significant majorities actually want spending to be 
increased -- such as for crime-fighting (71%), public education (64%) and AIDS 
research (55%), according to Andrew Kohut, director of the Times Mirror Center 
for the People & the Press, which sponsored the survey. The center is run by 
Times Mirror Co., which is the owner of the Los Angeles Times and other 
newspaper, broadcasting and publishing enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll had some distressing news for President Clinton, with 66% of 
Democrats surveyed saying they would like to see others challenge him for the 
1996 nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Clinton personally had a favorable rating of 51%, with an unfavorable 
rating of 46%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp differences over national priorities emerged when gender and political 
affiliation were factored into the survey, with Republicans and men favoring 
welfare reform and deficit reduction and Democrats and women favoring health 
care reform and stricter handgun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, while not in the GOP contract, 
also had strong public support, with 53% in the poll favoring such a law in 
their state. Such a referendum was overwhelmingly approved by California voters 
in November, and 58% in the Times Mirror poll said they followed the 
Proposition 187 controversy either "very closely" or "fairly closely." 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide poll was conducted Dec. 1-4, under the direction of Princeton 
Survey Research Associates. It involved 1,511 adults and has a margin of error 
of three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, 78% cited crime as the most urgent issue facing Congress, 
followed by welfare reform (66%), deficit reduction (55%), a school prayer 
amendment (33%), term limits (33%), and a capital gains tax cut (27%). 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the GOP's sweeping gains last month, more Americans now think 
of themselves as Republicans (35%) than as Democrats (30%) -- "a reversal of 
the usual ordering," Kohut said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The GOP is riding high with the public in the afterglow of its big election 
victory," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In the poll, 57% said they are happy with the sweeping Republican victory, 52% 
approved of the GOP's legislative agenda and 62% believed that the new Congress 
will be successful in "getting things done." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Kohut said, public esteem for the Democratic Party was at "an

THREE DEPLETED FISHING GROUNDS ORDERED CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three prime fishing grounds off New England were ordered closed by the U.S. 
Commerce Department on Wednesday in an effort to rebuild depleted stocks of 
cod, haddock and flounder. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency order, which will take effect Monday, shuts off about 6,600 
square miles of ocean to virtually all commercial fishing until March 12.The 
order could be extended after that date. 
</P>
<P>
 The closed areas include waters in southern New England and parts of Georges 
Bank, traditionally the region's most bountiful and important fishing area. 
</P>
<P>
 The order exempts fishermen whose by-catch, or the fish caught along with 
their prime catch, includes less than 5% cod, haddock or flounder. Such 
vessels, however, are few. 
</P>
<P>
 The order also bans New England fishermen, except those who catch very little 
cod, haddock and flounder, from using nets with mesh sizes smaller than six 
inches in other areas. The larger mesh allows juvenile fish to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 In New England, fishermen who have been struggling for years to make a living 
off depleted stocks reacted with alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starving now," said one, Christo Stamopoulos. Another, John Pereira, 
predicted the order would force desperate fishermen to work illegally in 
Canadian waters.

CIA SETTLES VETERAN AGENT'S SEX BIAS SUIT; DISCRIMINATION: SOME SUBORDINATES 
RETALIATED TO HER CHARGES OF A 'PERVASIVE ATMOSPHERE OF MACHISMO' WITH CLAIMS 
THAT SHE WAS A DRUNK AND A SEXPOT. SHE'S TO RECEIVE $410,000. 
</P>

<P>
 The CIA has agreed to settle a sex discrimination lawsuit brought by a veteran 
senior female agent under which the agency will pay her $410,000, plus attorney 
fees and court costs, sources involved in the matter said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement does not concede the assertions of gender discrimination" 
that the agent made against the agency or its individual officers, the CIA said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, CIA Director R. James Woolsey said that the role of intelligence in 
the national security is "critical" and "we must focus on the future, not on 
litigation based on events of several years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Toensing, attorney for the agent who was listed in court papers only 
as "Jane Doe Thompson" but identified by several sources as Janine M. Brookner, 
said: "They agreed to pay her a substantial amount of money. The facts speak 
for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 In her suit, Brookner, 53, charged that the CIA is marked by a "pervasive 
atmosphere of machismo and sexual discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 She alleged that subordinates at the CIA's Jamaica station, where she was 
assigned in 1989 as station chief to clean up a problem-wracked outpost, 
retaliated with charges of their own against her that led to an investigation 
by the agency's inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 The subordinates charged she was a drunk and a sexpot, accused her of cheating 
on her overtime slips and of misusing a CIA helicopter assigned to Jamaica for 
drug operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Brookner eventually found herself discredited by the agency and assigned to 
make-work projects in a windowless cubicle at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement to settle followed daylong discussions Tuesday at the Justice 
Department, which represented the CIA in the litigation. The CIA statement said 
Woolsey's goal, in agreeing to the Justice Department settlement, was "to 
achieve closure on Ms. Thompson's claims against the CIA and put this case 
behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Toensing, however, said: "I think we presented them with facts that persuaded 
them it was better to settle than to proceed to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 She declined to elaborate, but another source familiar with the discussions 
said the new information involved the CIA's investigation of Brookner. 
</P>
<P>
 Brookner's suit was expected to go to trial by March. U.S. District Judge 
Albert Bryan Jr. this week postponed argument of pretrial motions in the case 
set for Friday pending presentation of the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, Brookner will retire from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement apparently has no direct effect on separate negotiations by the 
CIA to head off a class-action lawsuit by nearly one-third of the agency's 
female case officers in its directorate of operations, or clandestine division, 
who contend that the agency has discriminated against women. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Woolsey said he was committed to ensuring an environment of 
fairness for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am committed to this not only because it is the right thing to do for 
employees, but because I believe we do our mission far better when we draw on 
the talents of a diverse work force," Woolsey said.

<P>
 A man perched on his balcony fired about 100 rounds of ammunition at officers, 
cars and pedestrians before police shot and killed him Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the shootout, cars and pavement were riddled with bullets -- one 
patrol car was hit 34 times -- but no bystanders or officers were injured, 
police spokeswoman Stephanie Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found an arsenal in the shooter's apartment, including 
rifles, shotguns and pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kristian, 54, who had a history of mental illness, was wearing a 
bulletproof vest when he began firing on officers who arrived at his oceanfront 
condominium, police said.

CONSTRUCTION CRANE PLUNGES 28 STORIES, KILLS THREE

<P>
 Three men were killed Wednesday afternoon when a crane being lowered from an 
unfinished hotel tower broke loose and fell 28 stories to the parking lot, 
dragging a second crane with it, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the accident occurred, construction was winding down on a high-rise 
addition to the Riverside Resort hotel and casino in this Colorado River gaming 
outpost near the borders of California, Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 A 320-foot free-standing crane was lowering another crane from the top of the 
hotel tower when "down they came," said Robert Leinbach, spokesman for the 
Clark County Fire Department. "The free-standing crane killed the three people. 
The top portion of the other crane is now embedded in the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the men were in separate cars when they were struck; the third was 
walking in the parking lot.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CHECKS WILL CLEAR, SAYS COUNSEL ON BANKRUPTCY; 
FALLOUT: ALL ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND ALL THE THINGS THAT CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES 
EXPECT ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDED, LAWYER SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Sitting at the center of the largest government bankruptcy crisis in American 
history is a 36-year-old attorney with a Harvard law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett has spent his entire career working for Stutman, Treister & 
Glatt, a small Los Angeles firm known nationwide as leaders in bankruptcy 
cases. Reared in a New York suburb, Bennett went to Brown University before 
Harvard and has lived in Los Angeles since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett started Wednesday before sunrise. He spent most of the day with a 
phone at his ear, talking to politicians and business people around the world 
who have a stake in Orange County's bankruptcy crisis, and was shuttled from 
briefing to briefing in Orange County's Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, he answered a few questions about the Chapter 9 filing. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the county's current cash flow situation? 
</P>
<P>
 The checks that are out there now are going to clear. The employees are going 
to get their checks on time, and they're going to clear. The retirees are going 
to be paid, and their checks are going to clear. The vendors that are rendering 
services now are going to continue to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 All essential services, and all the things that citizens expect and that 
businesses expect, are going to continue to be provided. All of the 
ordinary-course activities of the county are going to continue. That means 
people are going to have to be paid to do (them). 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from bond issues for the widening of Interstate 5, the building of the 
San Joaquin Hills tollway and other major projects are tied up in the fund. 
What will happen to them? 
</P>
<P>
 If the money is invested in the fund, right now, for those large projects, for 
the time being, there won't be a distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 How long is 'the time being?' 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to incoming tax revenue? 
</P>
<P>
 It will all be collected and used for appropriate governmental purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of court hearings, what is the next step? 
</P>
<P>
 There are no hearings presently scheduled. There will be hearings. As of now I 
can't tell you which one will be next, what it will be about or when it will 
be. I really can't point to any particular thing that is the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, we're devoting all of our efforts right now to finding sensible 
solutions for the problems (with the investment portfolio). That's the most 
important thing that I'm working on, and that's the most important thing that 
everybody else is working on. The highest priority is (developing a) plan to 
get the county out (of the investment crisis). 
</P>
<P>
 What are the differences between Chapter 9 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings 
in terms of payouts from the fund? 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chapter 9, the debtor -- the county -- retains control of all of its 
assets, retains its governmental powers and retains other things. There are a 
large number of important and fundamental differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a creditors' committee formed under Chapter 9 like there is in 
Chapter 11? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there is a creditors' committee. It's up to the United States trustee, 
but it will generally consist of five to 10 of the largest creditors. The U.S. 
trustee has some discretion to include a smaller creditor if they think it will 
provide a different perspective, but generally it's the largest creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 How does the filing affect the county investment fund? Does the fund stop 
making interest payments to investors? Can collateral calls be made on the fund 
by its lenders?  
</P>
<P>
 As of now, by and large, the bulk of the lenders are not attempting to 
liquidate the collateral behind repurchase agreements, and they are not doing 
so because of . . . an automatic stay that is imposed by the bankruptcy filing. 
For the time being, we've stopped making payments, other than the payments that 
are necessary to deal with payroll and other essential requirements of the 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the bankruptcy filing enable the county to raise taxes or other revenues 
that otherwise would have been prohibited by state law? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a very premature issue. Nothing like that is even contemplated yet.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; ASKING FOR HELP; ADVISERS: ORANGE COUNTY TURNS TO 
A NEW YORK FIRM FOR EXPERTISE IN HANDLING ITS IMPERILED FUND. THE HOLDINGS MAY 
BE SOLD PIECEMEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 From the pink-walled offices of a building adjacent to Grand Central Station, 
two women who helped pioneer the use of the complex investments known as 
derivatives -- which ultimately helped force Orange County into bankruptcy -- 
are frantically attempting to unwind problems in the county's troubled 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a tornado rocked through here," an exhausted Leslie Lynn Rahl said 
Wednesday afternoon, a day after her latest client became the largest local 
government in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahl, 44, and her partner, Tanya Styblo Beder, 39, formed Capital Market Risk 
Advisors Inc. in July to help clients work out problems stemming from risky 
investments gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the fledgling firm faces an unenviable assignment: helping Orange County 
salvage as much as possible of its investment portfolio, which has lost $1.5 
billion or more in value this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone can do this -- it's these two women," said Grover McKean, a senior 
vice president with Lazard Freres & Co. in Los Angeles, the investment banking 
firm that helped devise a rescue plan for New York City in the mid-1970s and is 
putting together a proposal for advising Orange County. "They really know their 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Rahl and Beder are considered experts in risk management. Their company 
typically advises banks, mutual funds and large corporations on how to avoid or 
control losses from derivatives -- investment contracts that derive their value 
from an underlying stock or index linked to such things as interest rates, 
commodities or foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining the exact current value of Orange County's troubled investment 
pool -- most recently estimated to be worth $18.5 billion, down from $20 
billion on Jan. 1 -- and the status of particular bonds in the pool will be 
Capital Market's first priority, according to sources close to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm would not disclose the portfolio's current value or detail specific 
strategies to be taken in its bankruptcy workout proposal. But sources close to 
the situation say the Capital Market plan probably will involve a systematic 
liquidation of the bond portfolio. The county would sell individual assets from 
the pool over the next few months, rather than attempt to find one or more 
buyers for the entire investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their options after such a large county bankruptcy are rather limited," said 
Robert Lamb, a public finance professor at New York University's Stern Business 
School. "They will have to help the county operate under bankruptcy and 
determine what bond repayments are scheduled and the potential to make those 
payments." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb cautioned against hurriedly liquidating the county's assets; selling the 
county's bonds all at once, he said, could get "the worst price." Capital 
Market should determine which of the portfolio's bond assets are the 
healthiest, he said, and sell those, using the proceeds to pay the school 
districts and other participating agencies that will need to make regular 
withdrawals from the fund to finance their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Schwartz, chairman of the International Assn. of Financial Engineers 
in New York, said Rahl and Beder are experts in tracking down the value of each 
derivative transaction in a troubled investment pool and then making 
recommendations on how to proceed, having advised large mutual funds and other 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very good at valuing the securities down to the last penny," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahl, who has a bachelor's degree in computer science and an MBA from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, established Citibank's risk management 
department in 1983 and started her own firm seven years later. Beder, a product 
of Yale University and of Harvard University's graduate business school, calls 
herself a "founder" of the derivatives market. She began her career in 1977 
with the investment banking firm CS First Boston, eventually becoming that 
firm's derivatives specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 It was CS First Boston's moves Tuesday to seize collateral from Orange 
County's pool that triggered the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Beder told a congressional hearing on derivatives that although 
"derivatives play a valuable role in the market," every user of the product 
should have "specific, written policies regarding their use." 
</P>
<P>
 Both partners said derivatives are not to blame for losses suffered by Orange 
County. They say it is the way derivatives are used and monitored that creates 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and others, they suggest 
that prudent steps be followed, such as clear policies when using derivatives, 
a real understanding of the structure of the complex deals and making sure the 
securities are properly valued.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; TERMINOLOGY OF TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a conservative area, Orange County went for some sexy investment vehicles. 
Here's a look at some of the phrases you'll hear in connection with OC's fiscal 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives: Deals so complex that their creators' personal computers aren't 
big enough to handle the calculations. Orange County worked with various 
investment bankers, including Merrill Lynch and CS First Boston, to create 
investments whose values were derived from the direction of interest rates, and 
in this case the direction was headed down. Unfortunately for the county, 
interest rates did a U-turn in February, and the derivatives went south. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverse Repos: Short for reverse repurchase agreemtns. Using a security as 
collateral on a loan and using the loan to purchase another security. As long 
as the interest rate on the loan is lower than the yield on the security, the 
investor can use the difference to enhance his return. Reverse repos take 
advantage of the difference between the yield on a bond -- say, 6% -- and the 
loan rate on the borrowed cash, say 4%. The investor can purchase a security, 
use it to borrow against to buy another security, pay interest on the loan and 
come out ahead. The two-point difference means that a pair of securities at 6% 
each will yield 8%, as long as the loan rate stays lower than the bond yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Inverse floaters: Securities whose interest payouts and value fall as interest 
rates rise. Investors who buy them are betting that interest rates will fall.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; WITH A SNEER IN THEIR HEARTS, PUNK ROCKERS PLAN A 
BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 15 years, Orange County officialdom has fought the county's indigenous 
punk rock movement -- by treating early '80s punkers as if they were a gang 
movement, by revoking or denying club and theater permits and generally by 
recognizing punk for the disorderly force it is and acting accordingly as 
guardian of the public tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 But hey, no hard feelings, said John Pantle, a concert promoter on the local 
punk scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Pantle announced a "Save the County" concert intended to 
demonstrate solidarity -- in a sneering, punk sort of way -- with the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors in its time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlining the concert at the Ice House in Fullerton on Feb. 3 will be Greg 
Ginn, the former Black Flag guitarist whose respected punk/alternative label 
SST Records is based in Los Alamitos. Also booked are DFL, FYP, Nonsense and 
Massengill. Pantle promises to set aside "a very, very small percentage of the 
proceeds" to help bail out the county government, which filed for bankruptcy 
protection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Pantle says, he will send invitations to the members of the 
Board of Supervisors in hopes that they will check out the show and see the 
possible advantages of putting some county money into punk rock -- as opposed 
to, say, the high-risk bond investments that got the county into its little 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of Orange County's best natural resources is teen-age angst , anger and 
resentment," Pantle said on the phone from Los Angeles, where he books acts 
into the House of Blues. "That's a very valuable resource that has yet to be 
tapped." 
</P>
<P>
 From the sound of it, his tongue was either firmly in cheek, or sticking out. 
</P>
<P>
 Pantle said he is willing to show the supervisors some tricks of the punk 
promotion trade to help get them started: "The government has done so much to 
help the music, by burying it underground, that it's only natural we should 
help in their time of need."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; MUNICIPAL BOND LEXICON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Municipal bond: Also known as "munis" Debt instrument issued by state or local 
agency, with consent of the voters. Proceeds support general needs or special 
projects. to encourage investors, these bonds are exempt from federal income 
taxes and most from state and local taxes in the state or municipality where 
the bond is issued.Munis are not insured unless the issuing government or the 
investor buys it from a private underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue bond: One of two main categories of munibonds. These are backed by 
revenues generated by a specific project or agency. Money from a toll road 
falls into this category. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond Rating: A way of assessing the likelihood of a bond issuer going into 
default. Ratings range from the top, AAA, where default is highly unlikely, to 
D, default likely. Anything rated B or below is not considered investment 
grade, and some institutional investors are prohibited from purchasing these 
securities. Before the current crisis, Orange County's rating was blue-chip 
AAA. 
</P>
<P>
 General obligation bonds. The other main type of munibond. These are backed by 
the issuer's power to levy taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual Fund: Investors' money is pooled and used to purchase stocks, bonds, 
options, commodities or other securities. Municipal bond funds are popular 
because of their history of relative safety and tax-advantaged status. 
</P>
<P>
 Leverage: Increasing the return on an investment without increasing the 
investment, which is usually done with borrowed money.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; GREENSPAN INDICATES COUNTY WILL NOT GET FEDERAL 
HELP; CONGRESS: FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD CHAIRMAN SAYS PAPER LOSSES OCCUR 
THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY AND THAT THE MARKETS 'ARE ADJUSTING WELL TO THAT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's bankruptcy after its huge losses in the value of derivatives 
investments are part of a "bumpy process" that reflects this year's major slump 
in bond prices, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on 
Wednesday, indicating that there are no plans for federal intervention to help 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of billions of dollars of paper losses throughout the 
economy" and the markets are "adjusting well to that," he told a hearing of 
Congress' Joint Economic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Greenspan was saying that Orange County lost a huge bet that 
interest rates would remain stable or decline in 1994. When interest rates rose 
steadily this year, those who bet the wrong way -- individuals, banks, business 
or county investment funds -- lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of losses," Greenspan said. "They are coming due all year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed chairman and other financial regulators view derivatives as a 
legitimate, highly sophisticated way to balance risk in today's rapidly 
changing financial markets. Derivatives are investment contracts whose values 
are based on the performance of an underlying security, interest rate or market 
index. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) issued a 900-page staff report on the 
potential dangers of derivatives and proposed a bill requiring the Securities 
and Exchange Commission to establish suitability standards for derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was ignored when Leach was the ranking minority member of the House 
Banking Committee. But he becomes chairman next month and said he intends to 
hold hearings on derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different earthquake than we were all expecting from Southern 
California," Leach said Wednesday, referring to the Orange County bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite possible there may be some other cases, but it's extremely 
unlikely there will be anything this large," Leach said. "This was simply 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan was pressed hard at the hearing by Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who 
charged that the "federal government has not acted as an adequate watchdog over 
the derivatives market." 
</P>
<P>
 There is "considerable risk out there," Wyden told Greenspan. "I would implore 
you the government beef up its . . . role." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) said he will offer legislation barring banks from 
trading in derivatives for their own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenspan, unimpressed by Dorgan's recitation of risks to banks, noted 
dryly that real estate investments can also by considered highly risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually all derivatives are a zero-sum game," said Greenspan, meaning that 
the losses by some investors are balanced by the winnings of others. He added: 
"I don't consider it to be something which gives me great concern."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; JUDGE CHOSEN FOR CASE HAS BACKGROUND IN 
SECURITIES; COURTS: JOHN E. RYAN, A DECORATED NAVY PILOT, DRAWS HIGH PRAISE 
FROM BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM RUTTEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John E. Ryan, the federal judge selected to preside over the largest municipal 
bankruptcy case in U.S. history, is a 53-year-old former corporate attorney and 
decorated Navy fighter pilot with a background in securities cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who sits in the Santa Ana branch of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court's hectic 
Central Division of California, has built a reputation for cost-consciousness 
and efficiency in eight years on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really going to help," said Orange County bankruptcy attorney Richard 
Marshack, whose firm is expected to represent several of the public entities 
with claims on Orange County's investment pool, "is that Judge Ryan has a 
securities background, which is very unusual for a bankruptcy judge. He's also 
the best manager of a case and of a docket we have here. The public will 
benefit from his ability to manage this case efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, a native of Boston and the son of a Harvard-educated attorney, graduated 
from the Naval Academy in 1963. He became a fighter pilot and served two tours 
in Vietnam, where he flew 250 combat missions and won the Air and Navy 
Commendation medals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Ryan left the Navy as a lieutenant commander to enroll in Georgetown 
University's law school. After graduation in 1972, he joined the prestigious 
Boston law firm of Hale & Dorr, where he specialized in helping troubled 
companies salvage their positions through new public offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I got a feeling for bankruptcy law," Ryan told an interviewer in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, after moving to California, Ryan got an even closer look at the 
process while serving as an officer with Oak Industries, a once high-flying 
satellite television firm that teetered on the edge of bankruptcy after 
catastrophic losses and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation in 
the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The company survived, but Ryan returned to the practice of law in San Diego in 
1983. Three years later, he was appointed to the federal bench by 
then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan gets high marks from many of the lawyers who have appeared before him. In 
particular, they cite his even temperament and his use of money- and 
time-saving devices such as telephonic conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "He listens to both sides with courtesy and very rarely loses his temper," 
said William Burd, an Orange County bankruptcy attorney. "When I've appeared 
before him and he's ruled against me, I've always understood why. That's 
critical for a litigant. He carefully considers the evidence and applies the 
law. . . . He's intellectually honest." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an excellent choice," said Nanette D. Sanders, a bankruptcy 
lawyer with the Irvine firm of Snell & Wilmer. "He's experienced with larger 
cases, including what we in bankruptcy law call 'operating cases.' That is, one 
that involves the day-to-day workings of some sort of business enterprise. He 
loves jury trials, which is unusual for a bankruptcy judge. He's interested in 
listening and figuring out what the real equities are in a case. Given the 
nature of the Orange County fund, that's important. There will be a lot of 
conflicting claims and you have to be sensitive to them. He will be, but I 
don't envy him the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who is married with three daughters and lives in San Diego County, was 
out of the state Wednesday and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1991 interview, he said of his workload in the Orange County Bankruptcy 
Court: "We have a lot of entrepreneurs here who are willing to take risks."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; LEGAL FIRM IS A LEADER IN MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCY 
CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They have handled bankruptcy cases for the Broadway's parent company, huge 
public utilities and Standard Brands Paint Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Stutman, Treister & Glatt of Los Angeles, one of the premier bankruptcy 
firms in the nation, will represent Orange County in federal bankruptcy 
proceedings as special reorganization counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our firm will quarterback the reorganization efforts," said Kenneth N. Klee, 
the firm's senior partner. Bruce Bennett will serve as lead lawyer for a team 
of six to 10 other lawyers in the firm. But, Klee said, "there certainly will 
be more than that from other firms." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bankruptcies are rare, but Stutman, Treister & Glatt has been 
involved in many of the larger cases, including the collapse of the Washington 
Public Power Service and the Richmond, Calif., school district case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County case is "not only large in terms of dollar numbers, but the 
complexity of the issues represents a challenge for us," said Klee, who was one 
of the principal architects of the 1976 revision of Chapter 9 and was involved 
in the drafting of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, which further amended the 
rules for municipal filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1947, Stutman, Treister & Glatt has represented numerous 
interests in bankruptcy and reorganization cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to working with Broadway's parent (called Carter Hawley Hale 
stores when it sought bankruptcy protection in 1991), Standard Brands, and 
Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, the firm recently filed three new cases 
for firms seeking court protection: Tune-Up Masters, House of Fabrics and Maple 
Plaza, which owns a large building in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 On the creditor side, clients have included Pennzoil in the Texaco bankruptcy, 
and creditors' committees in litigation over Resorts International and Del 
Taco. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has 30 attorneys, all of whom specialize in corporate reorganization, 
bankruptcy and insolvency law, in addition to commercial litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Long an innovator in its field, Stutman Treister has successfully concluded 
many of the most complex and difficult out-of-court restructurings, prepackaged 
Chapter 11 plans and Chapter 11 reorganizations in the nation. It also has a 
long history in the rehabilitation of smaller, closely held businesses, 
including family businesses, real estate partnerships and entertainment 
entities.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; POLITICAL POSSE IS LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR SOMEONE 
TO BLAME FOR CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was not 24 hours after Orange County had declared bankruptcy and already 
everybody south of Seal Beach seemed to be lining up to audition for the role 
of Pontius Pilate. If half the political Establishment was busy running for 
cover, the other half was rounding up a posse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotta fix the responsibility . . . and certainly there should have been 
more oversight at the county level," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington 
Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of confusing facts in this case, much fiduciary mumbo jumbo 
about bonds and derivatives that the average voter does not pretend to 
understand. But one thing is crystal clear -- there will be political hell to 
pay for this one, and for a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 There is already talk of lawsuits. An anti-tax crusader demanded that the 
county supervisors "resign summarily." Republicans seized on the fact that 
now-resigned Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron was a Democrat. The 
Democrats seized on the fact that Citron was supervised by a five-member board 
that is 100% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing longer than the list of creditors may be the list of people who 
"should have known." 
</P>
<P>
 "How about the county chief executive officer? Shouldn't he have known?" one 
prominent politico mused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't the governor do something to keep everybody calm?" another 
wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They better find out if they have insurance against misfeasance in office 
because they might have made themselves personally liable," Tom Rogers, San 
Juan Capistrano rancher and co-founder of Citizens Against Unfair Taxation, 
said of the county supervisors. "This is an unholy mess. These people are 
thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 For about 20 years, Citron's investment wisdom made money for the county and 
others who dived into his investment pool, and everyone raked it in without 
question. When the train crashed, all the wrath at first was aimed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 But stunned observers are looking further: "Who let this happen?" is on 
everybody's lips. 
</P>
<P>
 "You let one Democrat in office and he screws it up for everybody else," 
Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "And pardon me. Shouldn't the Orange County Register and Los Angeles 
Times have seen this coming?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What was Citron, a financial dictator?" Mark Petracca, associate professor of 
political science at UC Irvine, retorted sarcastically. "In a county where the 
Republican Party can do anything it wants, they put a Democrat in sole charge 
of this enormous pot of money? . . . Where the hell was the oversight?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dissecting Citron's actions appeased the angry mob for about a day. Then he 
resigned. "He did the honorable thing," Petracca said. "For the first time in a 
quarter-century an elected official resigned without the posse behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Citron out of the way, the wrath of the masses has to go somewhere 
and plenty of politicians are scurrying for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Frapwell, assistant director of budget and finance for Kern County, 
pooh-poohs the finger-pointing, saying the blame belongs to everyone who 
happily lapped up the profits for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I find most remarkable is that people (in the fund) can't believe 
the treasurer was investing in all this stuff," he said. "If they didn't know, 
they should have. His pool has been outperforming every other pool in the state 
of California for years, and the only way you do is that by going into risky 
investments." 
</P>
<P>
 The scariest part of all this may be less the bankruptcy than the microscopic 
look it provides at what is actually done with taxpayers' money -- invested in 
arcane funds later denounced as high-risk. 
</P>
<P>
 These kinds of financial details are almost never disclosed to the public and 
when they are it is like discovering that the Magnificent Oz is really just 
that little old guy behind the curtain. It's more than the citizens want to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 One political pundit said: "They might as well have bought lottery tickets. 
But as long as they were winning, nobody cared." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are investigating why Citron used Merrill Lynch for all his 
business and whether money was being funneled to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that the Republicans on watch when it happened will pay dearly at 
the polls next time around. Others predict that deep party loyalty will save 
their political hides in Orange County, hearth and home to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 One prominent Democrat said: "Around here, nothing ever happens to the 
Republicans (at the polls). It's a tradition."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; GOVERNOR SAYS LITTLE OF CRISIS; CAPITOL: OTHERS IN 
SACRAMENTO ALSO TAKE PAINS TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Orange County was experiencing the financial equivalent of a major 
earthquake Tuesday, Gov. Pete Wilson was here tending to the ceremonial 
lighting of the Capitol Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
 When the county was forced to declare bankruptcy because of its deepening 
financial crisis, Wilson did not comment beyond a simple, one-sentence 
statement his press office issued earlier in the day saying the governor would 
work to "identify the alternatives" needed to help the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Other state officials -- including Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown and Controller Gray Davis -- likewise had little to say as the county's 
problems worsened this week. Instead, most took pains to note that they had no 
real jurisdiction over the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't a flood, firestorm or other typical disaster. Faced with a complex 
and unprecedented investment temblor in a wealthy county, state officials 
weren't doing much more than monitoring the fiscal aftershocks and scrambling 
to figure out what, if anything, they could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Many wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Wilson's silence) were to continue, it would be very alarming," said Del 
Weber, president of the California Teachers Assn. and an Orange County 
resident. "It would suggest they're not taking control of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said the bankruptcy will have "a major impact on the state." He said 
Wilson "has got to play a role. There is no solution possible to protect the 
rest of the state unless the governor intercedes." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of even some soothing words from the governor or other top Republican 
officials was particularly surprising, given Orange County's status as a GOP 
stronghold that has long delivered a mountain of votes at election time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he has his advisers weighing the alternatives, especially since 
Orange County is far more important to him than it is to the few surviving 
Democrats," said Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer, who suggested that the 
state consider a temporary loan to help Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Orange County municipal officials also voiced criticism of Wilson and 
other state leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little outraged," Costa Mesa Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle said. 
"Perhaps people were too busy running for reelection rather than looking for 
solutions to problems that were brewing. It's very frustrating for all of us to 
realize the state has done nothing yet." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Wilson again was saying little. He met with his top staff 
members to discuss dispatching a team of financial experts to get a handle on 
the crisis. After a lengthy meeting, officials had no plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has no line authority to oversee the investments of local 
governments," said Sean Walsh, Wilson's spokesman. "We're working with state 
officials to assist in determining the scope and magnitude of this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did, however, take time to talk on the phone with Orange County 
Supervisor William G. Steiner. "The governor said he wanted to be very 
supportive," Steiner said. "He's looking at mobilizing state resources to help 
the county." Steiner said the governor was not specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials, meanwhile, were confident that Wilson was doing the right 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor is taking a measured approach," Mission Viejo Councilman William 
Craycraft said. "There's a great deal to be uncovered in the next few days. Any 
reaction right now might be premature."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; OTHER PUBLIC FUNDS USE RISKY STRATEGIES; FINANCES: 
BUT FEW INVEST AS AGGRESSIVELY AS ORANGE COUNTY. CASH NEEDS MAY FORCE SAN DIEGO 
COUNTY TO SELL SOME HOLDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many California municipalities use some of the same financing techniques that 
brought down Orange County's investment pool, according to interviews with 
local treasurers, investment officers and market observers. 
</P>
<P>
 But no other California municipality appears to face losses as drastic as 
Orange County's, in part because few, if any, use these techniques for 
speculative purposes to the same degree as Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every city and county in California that keeps an investment fund -- 
and that's most of them -- would show a loss of between 1% and 5% of face value 
if forced to sell their holdings today. San Diego County, perhaps the most 
aggressively invested large county in the state after Orange County, would show 
a 10.7% loss if forced to sell its $3.3-billion portfolio at today's market 
prices, said county Treasurer Paul Boland. 
</P>
<P>
 The market losses by San Diego County and other municipalities would occur 
because the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds -- which provide the 
bulk of the localities' investments -- have dropped in market value as interest 
rates have risen. And rates have been rising inexorably all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is under water when interest rates rise," said George Jeffries, 
chief investment officer for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 But because most local investment officers adhere to a policy of holding their 
securities to maturity -- the date when the issuers pay them back in full -- it 
is rare for municipalities to show a real loss. Most municipalities polled 
Wednesday by The Times said they do not anticipate having to realize those 
losses because their cash flow is more than enough to cover any possible needs. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, again, is among the exceptions. To avoid a cash crunch similar to 
Orange County's, Boland said that he plans to raise as much as $500 million -- 
bringing the county fund's total available cash to $1.2 billion -- by selling 
some losing securities, taking profits on others and retaining some investment 
gains that would otherwise be distributed to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those steps will cut the fund's investment return from 5.8% so far this year 
to 4.6%, Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the risk factors in the portfolio is that as much as 25% is invested in 
structured securities similar to those that comprised as much as $8 billion of 
Orange County's $20-billion portfolio; many of them are securities whose 
payouts and values drop as interest rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego holdings' average maturity is about three years, also at the 
high end of the range for California localities. Moreover, as much as 10% of 
the fund's capital comes from voluntary investors -- municipalities and special 
districts that could withdraw all or part of their money on short notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their pulling out could be a problem," Boland said, although there is no 
indication that anyone has done so. One reason Orange County sought bankruptcy 
protection was to prevent such withdrawals from its voluntary investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Market experts say fears that other municipalities played the investment 
markets as wildly as Orange County -- and thus may be subject to similarly 
catastrophic losses -- may hurt the market for all California municipal 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect there may well be other municipalities in California that have 
indulged in similar activities," said DeWitt Bowman, former chief investment 
officer for the California Public Employees Retirement System. "I hope we're 
not looking at the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 Many municipalities say they are occasional users of such devices as reverse 
repurchase agreements, in which an investor pledges a bond as collateral to 
borrow money; in certain cases the deals can grind out a slight additional 
investment return. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County used these "reverse repos" as cash generators to make further 
investments, building its portfolio into a massive -- and losing -- bet on 
interest rates. County and city treasurers interviewed Wednesday said for the 
most part they entered these deals sparingly and almost always backed them up 
with opposing deals that would cover any potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Market participants around the state say localities fall into two groups: 
Small cities and counties with scant resources for investment, and large ones 
with plenty of spare cash to place in the market. In each category some are 
known as more conservative than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Los Angeles city and county are known as particularly conservative 
investors, market participants say. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the city of Los Angeles' general pool of about $3 billion, about 25% is in 
securities that mature over the next five weeks, said Henry Davis, chief 
investment officer, including at least $200 million that will mature over the 
next 30 days. The city also sedulously avoids reverse repurchase agreements and 
other complex strategies aimed at improving investment return by assuming 
greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the county, Jeffries says his portfolio of about $6 billion has an 
average maturity of slightly over one year and that 41% of his holdings mature 
within 60 days.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SHOCK OF RECOGNITION; SAN JOSE OFFICIALS STUNNED 
TO SEE THEIR ERRORS REPEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former San Jose city officials who weathered that city's bond fiasco a decade 
ago find it utterly amazing that Orange County has been brought to its knees by 
reverse repurchase agreements -- the same high-risk investments that nearly 
bankrupted San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stunning to me that this could happen in 1994 in view of that 
experience," said Jerry Newfarmer, a Cincinnati-based management consultant who 
was San Jose's city manager during the crisis. But, he added, "it's very easy 
to get caught up in the psychology that rate of return on investment is a 
measure of success." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned under 
fire Monday, heeded the lessons of a decade ago and focused on portfolio safety 
and liquidity, Orange County would not be in Bankruptcy Court proceedings, 
Newfarmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in 1984 Citron was one of the staunchest critics when San Jose decided 
to bail out of its bond portfolio, even though that action helped contain the 
city's losses to $60 million and save it from bankruptcy, recalled Les White, 
who was San Jose assistant city manager at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the crisis, San Jose sued its auditor and the 13 brokerage 
firms that it believed had sold city officials "a bill of goods by convincing 
them these were transactions in which they could not lose money," said San Jose 
City Atty. Joan Gallo. 
</P>
<P>
 0 one of them was Merrill Lynch, the firm with which Orange County did most of 
its ill-fated investing. The Merrill broker working with San Jose was Michael 
Gus Stamenson, with whom Citron conducted his high-risk transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Orange County treasurer has done is absolutely unconscionable," 
Newfarmer said Wednesday. "The one thing you do not do with public monies is 
speculate with them." 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose learned that harsh lesson in 1984. For at least two years before 
then, San Jose finance officials had followed the advice of prestigious 
brokerage firms and invested heavily in the reverse repurchase agreements -- 
complex transactions that involve borrowing against a fund's holdings in the 
hope of increasing returns as interest rates fall. The strategy basically tied 
up an increasing proportion of San Jose's assets in long-term investments. 
While interest rates cooperated, the city treasurer and the finance director 
won kudos for achieving high rates of return on long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the fall of 1983, rates took a U-turn, and the city's investment 
strategies began to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 While poring over monthly reports, White said he noticed that the city -- 
despite a $325-million portfolio -- was reporting zero earnings. Close scrutiny 
revealed that the city had been shoveling much of its money into the high-risk 
reverse repos, which had begun to lose money as interest rates rose. The 
concern was that the city would have no cash to cover its operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In late May, 1984, the situation became so dire that, after secret weekend 
consultations with a bevy of experts, San Jose extricated itself by selling 
$106 million in bonds, allowing it to raise enough cash to pay off immediate 
debt. The hasty action held San Jose's losses to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch settled the San Jose case out of court for $750,000, a pittance 
compared to the $6.6 million that Paine Webber paid after being found culpable 
by a San Jose jury. E.F. Hutton, also found guilty, agreed to pay $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the debacle, San Jose "put into effect very conservative 
systems," Gallo said. "We don't leverage."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; THE $20-BILLION BET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's investment fund went from $7 billion to $20 billion -- then 
dropped. Where did the money go? Here is a review of the lending cycle that led 
to the current fiscal crisis, and a roundup of what the fallout may be. THE 
GAMBLE THAT WENT BAD 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County figured that interest rates would continue to fall. They didn't. 
Breaking down Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's 
investment strategy to a basic level, here's what happened: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Towns, schools districts and other agencies contribute to an investment 
fund, using proceeds from municipal bond offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Citron invests the money in such things as government bonds. For $1 
million, for example, he buys a bond that would pay the fund, say, 6% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 3) He then offers that $1 million bond as collateral to an investment banker 
such as Merrill Lynch, which gives him about $1 million more to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Now, collecting interest on two bonds -- purchased with his original $1 
million and the borrowed $1 million -- he has increased the payout of interest 
beyond the initial 6%. He assures the Orange County Board of Supervisors that 
the county is getting outstanding returns on investments. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Storm clouds form as bond interest rates charged by lenders begin to rise. 
Now every one to three months or so, Citron has to pay a higher rate on his 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Soon, the interest rate he is paying on his loans approaches what he is 
being paid on the bonds purchased earlier, thus slashing his investment return. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Meanwhile, the value of the bonds is dropping as interest rates jump. The 
bankers come to him and say those bonds, which he used as collateral to buy 
other bonds, are not enough to support the loans. They demand additional money 
to back them up, and that threatens to deplete the county's cash balance. 
DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and a bankruptcy attorney sought to calm the fears of 
investors, employees and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * A top county official said a tax increase is not being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bankruptcy began having a practical effect. Cities halted projects and moved 
to limit spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * Legality of bankruptcy filing faced potential challenges from Wall Street 
and a home-grown taxpayer group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipal bond markets nationwide were shaken as investors feared troubles 
like those in Orange County could show up elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Reserve Board governor said the central bank is closely tracking the 
Orange County crisis to weigh the chances of a breakdown in the financial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Government officials around the country re-examined their own investment 
portfolios for similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County's credit rating sank from top-notch to poor and a default 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief said agency will step up policing 
of exotic investments, called derivatives, that were traded by Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified that problems 
associated with derivatives are "a necessary price that we have to pay for a 
valuable addition to our financial system." FUTURE CONCERNS 
</P>
<P>
 Officials connected with various proposed and existing projects around the 
county acknowledge the possibility of major obstacles but for now they're 
reserving judgment: 
</P>
<P>
 * Toll roads: Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is building three toll 
roads in Orange County, says projects appear to be safe in the short term but 
uncertainty and fear color the long-term picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Westcot: Walt Disney Co. officials say it is too soon to comment on the 
future of their proposed Disneyland expansion but they remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 * New baseball stadium: Anaheim officials say they will continue to negotiate 
with the California Angels on extending their lease and building a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * New football stadium: Save The Rams organization claims new stadium for the 
Rams, whom they are trying to keep in Orange County, is still possible but 
would have to be largely dependent on private funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jails: Sheriff spokesman says too early to tell if future construction 
projects will be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County Transportation Authority: Officials say there are no plans to 
scale back bus service or halt any of the agency's freeway construction 
projects, including the El Toro Y reconstruction. But problems would occur if 
money is frozen long-term in the county investment fund. WHAT THE CRISIS MEANS 
</P>
<P>
 Schools 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Wednesday they felt reassured that the bankruptcy filing would 
stabilize the county's financial situation without jeopardizing their 
day-to-day operating funds, and that they expect their employees to be paid as 
normal. But at least one school district, Laguna Beach Unified, may consider 
joining the county in filing for bankruptcy protection. School officials have 
had little direct contact with the county treasurer's office, and instead are 
being briefed by the county Department of Education, where they will meet this 
afternoon. Many individual districts are consulting bankruptcy and bond 
experts. California School Boards Assn. and the state Department of Education 
have also been asked to help. 
</P>
<P>
 County bondholders

 Chapter 9 proceedings specifically protect the income promised to certain 
types of bondholders. Best off are holders of revenue bonds. Income pledged to 
pay interest and principal on these bonds must be paid directly to bondholders. 
The funds cannot be taken by the county to pay other bills. General obligation 
bond holders become general unsecured creditors -- they get paid after county 
employees, some suppliers, bankruptcy attorneys and federal debts. There may be 
some delay and possible reduction in interest payments on some issues, but 
experts maintain that outright default would be a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities 
</P>
<P>
 Most officials say they have enough money to meet immediate payrolls, purchase 
supplies and honor obligations to vendors but worry about the future, 
especially if their money remains frozen for long in the investment pool. 
Anaheim on Wednesday halted planned capital improvement projects and initiated 
an immediate hiring freeze. Santa Ana's day-to-day operations are not affected, 
but officials worry about the possible impact on such projects as a $100 
million new city jail and police administration building, now under 
construction. And officials in several cities, including Huntington Beach, are 
concerned about whether they will continue to receive property tax 
disbursements scheduled for later this month. Other cities were more sanguine. 
Irvine City Manager Paul Brady says his city has enough liquidity to cover all 
operating expenses for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 County retirees 
</P>
<P>
 Payments to the county's retired workers will be made on time, officials say. 
Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said definitively that all 
day-to-day operations, including retirement payments will continue. "The checks 
that are out there now are going to clear," Bennett said. " . . . The retirees 
are going to be paid, and their checks are going to be clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say there will be no interruption in services or tax 
increase. Bankruptcy filing will enable officials to find sensible solutions 
for the county's investment problems, while maintaining all day-to-day 
services, they say. "The filing is strictly related to the financial issue at 
hand, the bonds," said Sandy Sternberg, county spokeswoman. "We have other 
revenue. . . . Government as usual is the best way to describe it." Taxpayers 
still must pay their property taxes, which must be postmarked by 5 p.m. Dec. 12 
to avoid a late penalty. That is an extension of two days because the normal 
deadline, Dec. 10, is a Saturday. County employees jobs are safe and they will 
be paid on time, say county officials. "People are going to be paid. You've got 
to get that out there," Sternberg said. "The county's got money. People are 
going to get paid. Services are going to continue. The average guy out there 
isn't going to notice the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 County vendors 
</P>
<P>
 County vendors who receive regular payments from the county will be paid on 
time, said Bennett.

WHITEWATER PROBE TARGETS EX-S&L CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawyer for James B. McDougal, President Clinton's former business partner, 
said Wednesday he has been notified that his client is a target of the 
Whitewater investigation and that he believes independent counsel Kenneth W. 
Starr is nearing an indictment of the former owner of the failed Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Wednesday, McDougal's attorney, Sam Heuer, said McDougal, the 
Clinton family's former partner in the Whitewater real estate venture, was 
notified Tuesday in a three-paragraph letter that he is now officially a target 
of Starr's probe.Such letters are commonly sent by prosecutors preparing to 
seek a grand jury indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer said prosecutors invited McDougal to come in for an interview, but the 
lawyer added he is doubtful that McDougal, who was cleared in an earlier case 
involving a Madison Guaranty real estate deal, would bargain with Starr's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel would likely try to use McDougal's explanations of 
Madison Guaranty real estate deals to expand his investigation, not clear his 
client, Heuer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they'd love to make a deal with McDougal," Heuer said. But he said 
that even if McDougal knew of any criminal activity, "I'm not sure it would be 
significant enough for their needs. It looks to me as if we're heading toward a 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, Clinton's successor in Arkansas, on Wednesday 
reacted angrily to press speculation that he is on the verge of indictment in 
the Whitewater matter. He said he has not been informed he is a target.

SEN. SIMPSON BREAKS RANKS WITH GOP ON AID TO IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Alan Simpson, one of the most influential Republican voices on 
immigration matters, opposes cutting off federal benefits to legal immigrants 
and limiting education for illegal immigrants, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like they don't understand what a permanent resident alien is," 
Simpson told the New York Times, criticizing GOP proposals to cut off aid to 
immigrants living in the United States legally."The only thing they can't do 
that you and I can is vote. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the newspaper, the Wyoming senator expressed views that 
run counter to the main tenets of the House Republicans' plans for immigration 
reform under their "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said he is opposed to denying public education to illegal immigrants, 
a major provision of California's Proposition 187, which was passed by voters 
last month but has been put on hold by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he plans to seek the repeal of a 1966 federal law that gives 
Cubans preferential treatment in getting permanent resident status, according 
to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Simpson has called for the number of immigrants allowed into the 
United States to be lowered from 675,000 people a year to 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He also favors a national identity card system.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CITRON IS 'HEARTBROKEN' OVER FILING, FRIEND SAYS; 
OFFICIAL: EX-TREASURER-TAX COLLECTOR IS FRUSTRATED HE CAN'T HELP O.C. SORT 
THINGS OUT, NEIGHBOR ADDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Former Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron remained largely 
sequestered inside his Santa Ana home Wednesday, refusing to talk with 
reporters. But he insisted through a neighbor that he is not hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "No he isn't hiding. Not at all," said Dan Miller, who is executive director 
of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority and lives next door to Citron. "In fact 
he went to a USC alumni dinner last night (Tuesday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, one of a handful of people with access to Citron these days, said 
Citron "accepts the situation as it is and doesn't think that any discussions 
with the press will resolve anything at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 But Citron, who resigned over the weekend, is "heartbroken" that Orange County 
was forced to file for bankruptcy protection, Miller added. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is also frustrated that he is unable to help sort things out. He feels 
very anxious about sitting at home, unable to step in and help. But he is 
confident that things will get better," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he and other Citron friends have been encouraging him to speak out 
and blunt the barrage of criticism he has been subjected to for the past week. 
But the former official, who shunned the limelight during his 24 years as 
county treasurer-tax collector, is adamant about remaining unobtrusive, even in 
the face of partisan attacks from some Republican critics. When he resigned, 
Citron was the lone elected Democrat in county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a dedicated public servant for 30 years, answering only to county 
administrators, and he's not going to change," Miller said. "All these people 
who are calling for his head forget that for 14 years his investment strategies 
were generating earnings for (the county-run investment portfolio) when other's 
earnings were static." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has had lengthy conversations with Citron since the financial 
crisis began last week, said his friend's biggest concern these days is 
"adjusting to the fact that he isn't going to work in the mornings anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a guy who never took vacations during the 30 years he worked for the 
county," Miller said. "His work was his life."

O. C. IN BANKRUPTCY; AREA BUSINESSES FACE WORRISOME PROSPECTS; IMPACTS: 
UNCERTAINTY REGARDING PUBLIC PROJECTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF TAX HIKES AND HIGHER 
COUNTY BORROWING COSTS COULD AFFECT BUILDING AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Orange County's bankruptcy came frightening prospects for business. 
Suddenly, area executives faced uncertainty about upcoming public projects, 
possible tax increases, higher borrowing costs and a huge blow to Orange 
County's prized public image. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was certain Wednesday what to make of the bankruptcy. But there was no 
lack of attention to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., the county's largest landowner, said only that executives "are 
watching the situation closely and will continue to do so." But for now, said 
spokeswoman Dawn McCormick, company managers including Chairman Donald Bren do 
not believe there is anything "constructive or beneficial they could say about 
the bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Others expressed shock or dismay at the financial crisis, but most said they 
believed the trouble could be resolved and that the county will stage a 
complete recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials helped bolster that optimism by assuring suppliers and 
vendors that the county would continue making most scheduled payments, along 
with providing regular public services, such as police and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable that this could happen," exclaimed Larry Webb, president of 
Greystone Homes' South Coast division, which has 600 homes under construction 
in Orange County. "I thought the county's economic decline had bottomed out. 
Now I need to wait and see what happens when the dust settles." 
</P>
<P>
 Home builder Kathryn Thompson was more sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Orange County still has ample funds and strength," she said. "The 
bankruptcy was a prudent course of action to gain breathing room. I think that 
we all will get through this if we don't panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Developers, including the giant Irvine Co., could be hurt if the bankruptcy 
curtails local governments' future ability to issue bonds to finance the road 
and sewer construction needed to support real estate construction. 
</P>
<P>
 At the company's publicly traded Irvine Apartment Communities subsidiary, 
chief financial officer Dick Moran said he fielded a number of calls from 
investment analysts in New York concerned about the bankruptcy's impact on the 
subsidiary's stock and on other publicly traded stocks and bonds tied to Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consistent theme" in their questions, he said, "is whether there would be 
significant tax increases to make up for (revenue) shortfalls" because higher 
taxes would put many Orange County companies at a competitive disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our hope that this is a onetime financial event that is much like a 
natural disaster . . . and then the economy reasserts itself and recovers," 
Moran said. "I suspect people will realize it is an isolated financial 
catastrophe that will never occur again." 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Osgood, president of Los Angeles builder Kaufman & Broad Home Corp.'s 
Orange County division, said his sales staff had received calls all day from 
buyers and potential buyers worried about what the county crisis would mean to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can they raise my taxes?" was a big concern, he said, adding that his staff 
has been assuring callers that "there is really nothing the county can do to 
raise taxes because of Proposition 13," which requires a two-thirds vote in the 
general election to increase property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said in a news conference late 
Wednesday that no tax increase is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Osgood worries, however, that the bankruptcy will give Orange County such a 
black eye in the financial community that many of the cities and special 
agencies that issue bonds to build schools, roads, sewers and water systems 
will find it difficult to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Such bonds aren't linked directly to Orange County's credit, he said, "But 
they do carry the county name. And in the short run, who is going to touch 
anything that says O.C. on it? I think the work will go ahead, but it will be 
more expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Economists who specialize in watching Orange County say that the county's 
inherent strengths remain and that the long term looks bright. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chapman University, where the economic research center staff was 
frantically reworking a 1995 forecast scheduled to be released today, economist 
Esmael Adibi said Wednesday that the bankruptcy will hurt, but shouldn't derail 
the county's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the whole impact of the bankruptcy, all the losses, is realized in 
one year it wouldn't stop the recovery," Adibi said, adding that the combined 
total of all goods and services produced in Orange County next year is 
projected at nearly $83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 While many in the business community declined to speculate about the impacts 
of the county's bankruptcy so soon after the filing, others were generally 
optimistic: Expect some economic pain in the short term but have confidence for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are concerns about the bankruptcy's impact over the next few 
months on major economic factors like home sales and business expansions and 
relocations. "We have a substantial image problem on our hands," said Anil 
Puri, head of the economic department at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disneyland, where officials have been discussing a major expansion that 
hinges on substantial public improvements in the surrounding area, spokesman 
John McClintock said park officials and executives at the Disney Development 
Co. "remain optimistic" but didn't want to "speculate on the possible impacts" 
of the bankruptcy filing. If the bankruptcy cuts off funding for proposed 
freeway improvements and construction of publicly financed parking structures, 
however, the entire $3-billion park expansion could be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fluor Corp., the international engineering and construction services firm 
in Irvine, spokeswoman Deborah Land said officials had concerns that some of 
the larger projects being proposed for the county could be canceled, including 
a new football stadium for the Rams, the Disney expansion and a new county 
courthouse. Fluor was considering bids on all of those projects and now, she 
said, "we may never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce DeVine, chief economist for the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, said his immediate concern is how the crisis will affect the 
14,000 businesses that supply the county with everything from toilet paper to 
skilled technicians and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a bankruptcy, they have the ability to suspend debt payments," DeVine 
said. "They don't have to, but they can, and the question is how they will 
prioritize their debt and who will get paid and who won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said Wednesday that all 
payroll and day-to-day operations will continue as normal. Retirees and vendors 
who receive regular payments from the county will also be paid on time, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The checks that are out there now are going to clear," Bennett said. All of 
the ordinary-course activities of the county are going to continue. That means 
people are going to have to be paid to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett said that ongoing special projects such as the expansion of 
Interstate 5 and the building of the San Joaquin Hills toll road, which are 
dependent upon money currently invested in the fund, may be in more jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the money is invested in the fund for those large projects, for the time 
being there won't be a distribution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aaron Lovejoy, president of Ultratech Resources in Santa Ana, said he has 
no worries about being paid. 
</P>
<P>
 He dispatched his usual crew of three workers Wednesday to county offices 
under a contract to maintain county computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the full faith and confidence that the county is going to pull out of 
this," said Lovejoy, whose firm does about $3 million in sales a year. The 
bankruptcy was particularly chilling news in construction union halls around 
Orange County. Union members have largely survived the recession because of 
jobs on public works projects. But the future of many of those projects is in 
question and union officials worry that the construction industry's fledgling 
recovery could sink back into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than worrisome, it's distressful," said Mike Potts, area 
representative for the Building and Construction Trades Council. He said that 
about a third of the 30,000 construction union members in Orange County found 
employment this year through the publicly funded projects, such as the ongoing 
$100-million Santa Ana jail project. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison and Pacific Bell say they probably will treat the 
highly unusual filing by the county as if it were simply another bankruptcy by 
a large corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 County agencies maintain nearly 800 separate electric accounts and the 
county's overall monthly bill is about $1 million. SCE meter readers are 
canvassing the county to determine how much the county owed when it declared 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, when a big corporate customer declares Chapter 11 bankruptcy, SCE 
protects shareholder and ratepayer interests by asking the bankruptcy court 
judge to approve a hefty cash down payment equal to two months' billings, said 
SCE attorney Steve Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell, which is also a general unsecured creditor in the county filing, 
also generally demands a cash security deposit equal to two months' worth of 
telephone bills. "We usually send a letter right away and ask for that deposit 
within 20 days," Britton said. He declined to disclose the size of the county's 
average monthly telephone bill.

 Many Orange County residents reacted with frustration and anger at the 
county's financial crisis. Here is a sampling of comments received from readers 
invited to telephone the newspaper's TimesLine number with their comments.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, (resigned County Treasurer-Tax Collector) Robert Citron has to 
take the major hit on this, but I believe that in any government system there 
is supposed to be a system of checks and balances. I would like to know what 
happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Mr. Citron did not do this all by himself. My own stockbroker told 
me that he would never, ever recommend derivatives to any of his clients, nor 
would he ever trade in them himself. What is a county government doing trading 
in one of the riskiest financial instruments there is, with our money?"

 "What I saw with the County of Orange is really no different than what I've 
seen with a lot of individuals throughout the 1980s. People thought they were 
geniuses when it wasn't that difficult to make money. . . . This county is 
notorious for people who overspend their budget on themselves. . . . I think 
that what happened with the county is really almost a metaphor for the way 
people live and play in Orange County."

 "This bankruptcy is Orange County's loss and we must pay the price for it. We 
have no right to go to Sacramento or Washington for a bailout. Citron was our 
elected treasurer and all five supervisors, also elected, had the power to 
investigate his office. None of these democratically elected officers did their 
job, but that is our fault, not Washington's or Sacramento's. If we're going to 
tell other people to be responsible for their own lives, and not ask for 
welfare or a handout, then we in Orange County must be responsible too. This is 
our loss. We'll have to pay for it through higher taxes, and that's just too 
bad, but that's the way it is."

 "Now that we have this crisis, the thing to do now is to look forward and not

unnecessary to begin with."

 "Two things the citizens of Orange County can be assured of: First, Citron's

 "This Orange County crisis is very unfortunate. I can't believe that Mr. 
Citron. I thought one of the first principles of investing was to diversify and 
not put all your eggs in one basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very, very unfortunate, but I suspected something was going on. I have 
been fighting with the county tax assessment office in terms of what they have 
assessed my house for. They came up with a ridiculous 7% increase in my house 
value, which I can't believe (particularly) in a falling real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder if these guys, because they knew there was some trouble, are going 
after some of the taxpayers in the county with these ridiculous assessments. I 
have to believe that I am one of many people here in the same boat."

 "The direct fault or cause of the bond failure is the Federal Reserve Board. 
Its chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the Federal Reserve Board should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cause of the failure of the bond fund was a three-quarters of a point 
increase in interest rate of short-term interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that Citron could not move the bonds or change the structure of 
the fund after that. . . . If he tried to adjust the fund or do anything of 
that type, it would have caused a direct market crash and he had no ability to 
sell those bonds. I do not feel that it was directly his fault, but that it is 
definitely the fault of the Federal Reserve Board and Alan Greenspan."

 "It's fairly outrageous that one man can be left unsupervised to gamble with 
$20 billion, and it really is tantamount to going to Las Vegas and putting a 
bet on red or black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it curious that no one has ever mentioned, up until this year, that 
all Orange County tax bills were to be made out to Robert Citron, rather than 
the Orange County Tax Assessor. . . . I would suggest that your readers would 
have some questions if the IRS asked us to make our federal tax payments to 
Bill Clinton instead of the IRS. I think it is a reflection of the total state 
of mind of the county and its lax management of its affairs and the failure to 
observe basic Business 101 principles."

large risks with public funds to earn such a meager return when there were more 
traditional investments available. In the opinion of the Wall Street experts 
that have been quoted in The Times, they said the portfolio of Orange County 
was frightening. Anything that would frighten a Wall Street veteran was 
something that Orange County shouldn't have been investing in."

 "I fully believe that the total Board of Supervisors should be asked to 
resign. That is a drastic move, but this is an amazingly devastating situation 
and I really do believe that the Board of Supervisors is responsible for this 
-- maybe not directly, but certainly indirectly because of (its) control of the 
county tax assessor's office."

 "The thing that suffers the most is our county's infrastructure, i.e., the 
schools, transportation system, the building libraries, all the things that are 
essential for the long-term growth of our community. This, coinciding with the 
numerous bank failures here in Orange County and across the nation, reflects a 
wanton disregard for sound financial planning on the part of our leaders here 
in the Orange County community. I think it is negligence. . . . Who is going to 
pay for it? Hopefully, those people who earned the most amount of money from 
these fraudulent dealings will pay. But I'm sure it won't be; it will be the 
average American. The state and federal government, I am sure, will be called 
upon to help bail out the county for its criminal negligence."

 "Time and time again, it is proven that slick politicians no longer have a 
place in local, state or federal government. We need to start electing people 
(who) have sharp pencils, not sharp tongues. It seems that Gov. Wilson had some 
trouble finding something to say (Tuesday). How about this, to those 
supervisors responsible for the problem: 'Your letters of resignation must be 
on my desk by 5 p.m. tonight'? . . . Rather than worry about who is 
responsible, again I say get rid of them all, and wouldn't this be a great time 
for Ross Perot?"

 "I believe not only Bob Citron should resign, but I think that this should go 
to the top -- this includes the supervisors, including (Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F.) Riley. Riley himself and everyone on his board should all 
be removed. Every member of the various cities, school districts and water 
districts who put their monies in the county fund investment -- I believe that 
those people should all take responsibility and they should also resign, and I 
don't believe the taxpayers should have the total burden of just coming up with 
extra money to fill in."

O. C. IN BANKRUPTCY; COUNTY WORKERS TRY HARD TO KEEP IT BUSINESS AS USUAL; 
REACTION: FEW CONCEDE ANXIETY ABOUT SECURITY OF THEIR JOBS OR PAYCHECKS. 'WE'VE 
GOT STUFF TO DO,' ONE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Perhaps because it had been unthinkable for so long, county employees refused 
Wednesday to contemplate their employer's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 From clerks and tax collectors to landfill supervisors, few were panicked and 
most expressed an unshakable faith that their pensions and paychecks are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got stuff to do," said Townsend Price, an auditor with 14 years of 
service for the county. "We're not sitting around talking about it all day." 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone has got to push the papers," said Lisa Williams, a clerk in the 
county auditor's office. "I'm telling you, my job is not in jeopardy. . . . If 
this place shuts down, I'll still have my job, because someone has got to push 
the papers. " 
</P>
<P>
 Among workers trying to take in some lunchtime sunshine at the Santa Ana Civic 
Center, most said they were anxious only about the media attention they've been 
receiving. Others admitted to a measure of sadness at seeing a man they 
admired, Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, resign under a cloud after 
24 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 But few conceded any apprehension about the future, despite the official 
frowning and uncertainty surrounding the county's once buoyant investment fund, 
whose losses prompted the county government to file for bankruptcy Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried," said Floried Weigel, who said she works, ironically, in the 
"unsecure division" of the tax collector's office, which handles certain kinds 
of private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Orange County Employees Assn., a union representing 11,000 
county employees, from clerical workers to building inspectors, said the 
morning was quiet, with only a few frantic members calling to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence was so high, in fact, that business remained brisk at the county's 
employment office, where clerks had processed 35 job applications by midday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Budzinski, for instance, stopped by the office to pick up an application 
for the vacant position of "correctional services technician." Budzinski wasn't 
certain what such a title implied. But he was sure of one thing: Sooner or 
later, the county would fill the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're always hiring," he said, confidently. "The money's got to come in 
from somewhere. I don't see how they really could stop hiring." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, the clerk in the auditor's office, has been trying to tell everyone 
the same thing. Having studied economics at Grambling State University, she 
told many fellow workers that the county's bankruptcy filing was economic 
strategy, not defeat. But what if the strategy delays her paycheck, or 
endangers her pension? 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll give me an IOU, pay me later. Who cares?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Gertrude Bornhoff, an accountant's assistant: "I'm born in World War II, 
in Germany, so I've been through many things. We cannot change it, and we 
cannot jump into conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Bornhoff and others kept their upper lips stiff -- even while the 
occasional colleague went limp with worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here as a temp, hoping to get my foot in the door," said Cathy Keodara, a 
clerk in the assessor's office who recently left a full-time job to join the 
seemingly stable county government. Taking long, nervous drags from her 
cigarette, she scolded herself while her more fatalistic friends looked on: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sacrifice your stability to go into something even more rocky," Keodara 
mused, staring at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's life," said her friend, Byung Kim, a deed clerk munching a piece of 
dried seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't even in the dumps at the Frank R. Bowerman Landfill in Irvine, a 
place supervisor Gary Brown said is filled to the brim with bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Orange County, man," he said. "We hang tough." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can make it through a recession," said an office worker at the landfill 
who would not give her name, "we can make it through this." 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll pull out of it," Brown said of county leaders. "I think so."

O. C. IN BANKRUPTCY; WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified: The district will not place any more money in the county 
investment pool, Supt. James A. Fleming said. "I would like to see that money 
go elsewhere, whether a depository or other agency outside Orange County. . . . 
I think it would be mistake to put any more money into that fund. . . . If they 
declare bankruptcy, in my mind everything stops." He also said he hopes to 
receive state financial assistance, if necessary. "If we don't have any money, 
we can't operate schools. . . . I hope that Gov. Pete Wilson and the 
Legislature wouldn't let it happen because the school districts are innocent in 
this." he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Unified: "We've survived many a crisis and this is just one of 
them," district spokesman Alan Trudell said. "The important thing is that kids 
are still learning in the classroom." Trudell said district officials have been 
told by the County Department of Education that employees will be paid. Unlike 
other school districts in Orange County, the Garden Grove district has no debt, 
having already paid off its bonds, Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Unified: "Forecasting what is likely to happen next is nearly 
impossible due to the dearth of real information available on the financial 
condition of the county treasury," school board President Tom Burnham said. He 
hopes to get more information at today's meeting with officials from the county 
and the Orange County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Unified: "We're the child of the county, and the children have to 
be taken care of, it's as simple as that," Supt. Paul Possemato said. The 
district mailed 144 checks to vendors Wednesday, but Possemato said no more 
checks will be written until assurance is received from the County Department 
of Education that all checks will be honored. District officials will ask the 
county today( to deposit new property tax revenue in an account separate from 
the bankrupt pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Unified: "We've received notice that the county supervisors 
approved payroll for classified staff this week. Everything we've heard is it's 
business as normal," district business manager Ron Murrey said. "With the 
supervisors declaring bankruptcy . . . we're hoping it will stabilize the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Unified: Supt. Robert L. French said, "I feel confident that things 
will work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified: Employees are "just asking what is happening with the 
bankruptcy," said Gaylen Freeman, assistant superintendent/business services. 
"We're indicating that we've been told . . . things will flow as they have in 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Union High: "Obviously this has put us in a very dire situation and 
it's extremely unfortunate that we are mandated to put our money in a certain 
area and then have a situation like this occur," said Rita Newman, assistant 
superintendent/business services. She believes that county supervisors will 
release money for the district payroll. "If they don't," she said, "we are 
trying to get together a contingency plan to pay classified people some amount 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Joint Union High: "I would like to see that (tax revenue for 
schools) not be commingled with the pooled money. . . . I would not like to see 
it mixed with the pool of assets in bankruptcy," said George West, assistant 
superintendent/business services. West has received calls from employees and 
retirees, as well as vendors worried about whether they will be paid. He said 
he has been assured by the county that payroll checks will be issued for 
classified employees this week, but has been given no long-term guarantees. 
"There's a lot of concern out there," he said. "I'm telling (callers) we don't 
have enough information to give them a good answer, but we have always honored 
(our debts) in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Union High: Assistant Supt. Patricia Koch said, "We need to 
be calm. We need to be watchful. We need to do everything we can to assist in 
resolving this problem as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Elementary: "I don't know about (meeting payroll in) coming 
weeks, but we're covered for this week," said Jack Sarnicky, assistant 
superintendent/business administration. "We met with school employees this 
morning because we intend to keep them in the loop. . . . They were very 
cooperative and understanding." He added that the district's financial 
situation "is really dependent on what happens in the next few days. We're 
trying to figure out what is happening and hope it works out."  
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park: The district is cutting back on all unnecessary spending while 
taking a "wait-and-see attitude" on how the county investment crisis will 
effect district operations, Supt. Jack Townsend said. The district has held up 
plans to replace office computers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Centralia: Paul Burkart, director fiscal services, is counting on the county 
to disburse funds to the district despite the bankruptcy action. "If we do not 
get releases from the county treasury, we will not be able to meet payroll, but 
I believe we will. . . . I don't have any other funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress: Supt. William Eller said he hopes to learn whether the district will 
be able to meet payroll and other expenses in coming weeks when he meets this 
afternoon with officials at the County Department of Education. However, he 
expects that the district's share of tax revenue will continue to be deposited 
in the county investment pool. "I think the bankruptcy action will protect that 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley: Supt. Robert Sampica's most immediate concern is to make 
Friday's payroll for 308 employees. "I feel very positive that the Board of 
Supervisors will do everything to support the school districts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City: "We will be able to pay payroll and current 
obligations. All indications at this point say we're OK," said Jerry Buchanan, 
assistant superintendent. He said that school officials are still counting on 
revenue to be collected by the county next week, with property tax payments due 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra City: "Our employees are asking where is my next paycheck coming from 
and when, and that really hurts because our district has been prudent to 
maintain good reserves and now we're subject to a major problem," Supt. Rich 
Harman said. He expects to learn today from the county if money will be 
released from the county-operated investment fund for district payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View: "From my viewpoint it is business as normal," said Assistant 
Supt./Business Patricia L. Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster: "My assumption is that this is a paper loss," Deputy Supt. 
Barbara Winars said. "Despite the bankruptcy filing, the county is sound." She 
said that county officials assured her that all school districts will continue 
operating as usual, despite the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Community College: "I think people are tense and nervous," said 
Robert A. Lombardi, district chancellor. "It appears that at least this week, 
we'll get the payrolls done, then we'll have to figure it out day to day. I was 
told that one vendor refused to deliver today unless we paid with a check. We 
did." Lombardi said the district intends to deposit $15 million of tax revenue 
this month into the state treasury and keep it out of the county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified: "The employees are wondering whether they are going 
to get paid. . . . We're telling them that we are waiting for the County Board 
of Supervisors to release the funds," Supt. Peter Hartman said. He contends 
that if there are problems getting county funds, the state is obligated to make 
up the shortfall.

O. C. IN BANKRUPTCY; MOST CITIES OK IN SHORT TERM, FEAR EFFECTS ON FUTURE GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim, $169 million: 
</P>
<P>
 The city has halted nearly all capital improvement projects and imposed a 
hiring freeze until the full impact of the county's bankruptcy is known. "The 
best thing that can happen is if everyone remains calm and we work through this 
together and not panic," City Manager James D. Ruth said. City officials will 
continue their negotiations to build a baseball stadium for the California 
Angels. The future of the $3-billion Disneyland expansion is not known, but 
both Disney and Anaheim officials remained optimistic Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea, $9 million: 
</P>
<P>
 None of the city's operating budget is affected by bankruptcy, assistant city 
manager Tim O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not money we need today," O'Donnell said. "If the county's credit rating 
goes down, that's a concern to us. But, we are very confident that this is 
being managed appropriately and any damage will be short-term." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park, $18 million: 
</P>
<P>
 "The average citizen is not going to feel any impact," said Steve Dunn, the 
city's fiscal services manager. "We'll be able to pay our bills and our 
employees in the long term. We don't have any cash flow problems because of 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa, $2.6 million: 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy will have no immediate impact on the city, said City Manager 
Allan L. Roeder. The city on Nov. 17 had filed with the county a request to 
withdraw the balance of city's funds and was told the request would be 
processed in 30 days. "If we are unable to recover those funds, we will take 
whatever action is appropriate," Roeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, $5.85 million: 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Darrell Essex said Wednesday that the bankruptcy will not affect 
city services. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point, $16 million: 
</P>
<P>
 "No existing projects or projects in the immediate future will be affected," 
said Rita L. Gelder, the city's director of finance and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley, $6 million, with another $24 million invested in the county 
pool by the city redevelopment agency: 
</P>
<P>
 The $6 million the city invested in the county pool is unappropriated and, if 
frozen by the county bankruptcy, will not interrupt city services, said City 
Treasurer Elizabeth Fox. She said the $24 million the city redevelopment agency 
has invested with the county also is not needed immediately, but was intended 
to be used over the next 10 years for capital improvements, such as streets, 
sewers and roads, to enable new development. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, $18.3 million: 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James L. Armstrong said: "The short term is that the city has 
plenty of liquidity to handle city operations, paying employees and vendors, 
etc." A meeting of all the cities and finance directors is planned so that 
officials will get "a little more on the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach, $43.5 million: 
</P>
<P>
 The city depends on making regular withdrawals of about $3 million to $6 
million each month from the investment pool, but "will try to find other ways 
to keep ourselves afloat," City Treasurer Donald L. Watson said. He stressed 
that the city will have no problems meeting its payroll and other obligations 
but will be looking to delay or cancel any unnecessary expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, $208 million 
</P>
<P>
 "Because not all of the city's funds are in the Orange County investment pool, 
the city of Irvine is able to meet all of its obligations, whether they be 
payroll, interest payments on bonds, or capita projects," Mayor Michael Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra $8.2 million: 
</P>
<P>
 Said City Manager Lee Risner: "We still will be able to pay salaries. It will 
not break us. It will bend us. We will have to make some modifications. We do 
not anticipate laying anyone off. We do not anticipate any shortfalls on paying 
our bills on time and or salaries on time." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills, $900,000: 
</P>
<P>
 The $900,000 represents only 15% of the city's long-term reserves. "Having 
those assets frozen a year or two doesn't have any impact on our operations," 
Assistant City Manager Don White said. "Obviously we want to have all of that 
money back and we will be working to make sure we recover all of the 
principal." 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma, $5 million: 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Pamela Gibson, who had expressed confidence that the county would 
honor a request from La Palma to withdraw $500,000 to pay for capital 
improvement projects, was wondering Wednesday if the city might have get the 
money from the state investment pool instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, $2 million: City services will not be interrupted because the 
funds placed in the county pool were reserves not necessary to pay for 
day-to-day operations, said Assistant City Manager Gerard Goedhart. He said he 
expects to take some loss on the $2 million as a result of the bankruptcy, but 
hopes it won't be drastic. "We just entered into a whole new world and it is a 
little scary," Goedhart acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo, $18 million: 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the crisis should have no immediate impact on day-to-day 
operations, but asked the county Wednesday to have all payments from property 
taxes sent directly to the city, not into the troubled county pool. Assistant 
City Manager Dan Joseph said the city does not yet know whether the financial 
crisis could affect plans to build a new $18-million library. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach, $54 million: 
</P>
<P>
 The city doesn't expect that payroll or services will be interrupted, said 
City Manager Kevin J. Murphy. He said while the city will have to scrap plans 
to use the fund money to finance construction of an $18-million ground-water 
project, it will be able to complete the project on schedule by using funds 
from other reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange, $28 million: 
</P>
<P>
 "This will not have any bearing on our operations. . . . At the present time, 
I know of no projects that would be affected, certainly not this fiscal year," 
said James Evans, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia, $20.7 million: 
</P>
<P>
 The city expects no immediate impact, as long as it receives an interest 
payment of about $200,000 as scheduled from the county Dec. 13. Most of its 
operating revenues are invested in the state pool, not the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente, $34.6 million: 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Michael W. Parness said city officials were working "feverishly" 
to determine what the bankruptcy means. "Right now the good news is that we 
have enough funds in other accounts to meet our short-term cash-flow needs," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, $55 million: 
</P>
<P>
 There will not be any short-term impact on city operations, City Manager N. 
David Ream said, but city officials are concerned about the potential effect on 
such projects as a $100-million city jail and police administration facility 
now under construction in the Civic Center. "In the short term, none of our 
projects will be curtailed or stopped, but we will definitely need some answers 
within the next 30 to 60 days to determine whether these projects will go 
forward," Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach: $2 million: 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Brown was relieved to learn Wednesday that Merrill Lynch had 
offered the county a credit line of $2 billion during this crisis. "That will 
take a lot of pressure off," he said. "That will permit the county to have cash 
for the school districts and the county employees, various payrolls that have 
to have ready cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, $3 million: 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Greg Hulsizer said that as a precaution, all major expenditures 
such as capital improvement projects will be put on hold. "We want to be 
assured that the funds will be available to us before we award any contracts," 
Hulsizer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin, $185,000 in interest: 
</P>
<P>
 The city withdrew $4 million out of the county pool in April because of a 
"philosophical difference" between the city's investment policy and the riskier 
one pursued by the county. "In the grand scheme of things, the money we have 
left in the fund is not going to impact us," City Manager William A. Huston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park, $1.3 million: 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, the city expects no effect on day-to-day operations, but says it 
might have to delay one capital project, a plan to spend $200,000 to widen 
Cerro Villa Drive. A final decision on that will be made in the spring, after 
the county presents its restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster, $100,000: 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work with the county. We are very positive that we will work our 
way out of this. We're rolling up our sleeves," City Manager Bill Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda, $13.5 million: 
</P>
<P>
 Said city Finance Director Vicki Baker: "The average person in Yorba Linda 
will see no effect from this. It will not affect any city operation or services 
or projects. We're not trying to artificially reassure people, but this was 
just one of our investments."

OFFICIALS ASSESSING IMPACT ON TRANSIT, PUBLIC WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Transportation Authority: "It's accurate to say we're under a 
cloud. In fact, we're quite clouded," said authority spokesman John Standiford, 
referring to the uncertainty over how the county's financial crisis will affect 
the giant transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's filing for bankruptcy protection froze about $1 billion that 
the transportation agency had invested in the county's troubled portfolio. Late 
Wednesday night, OCTA officials announced that they will discontinue depositing 
Measure M revenues in the Orange County Investment Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure M authorized a half-cent sales tax in the county to pay for a 
$3-billion, 20-year project to pay for transit and freeway improvements 
throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Water District: The district Wednesday was scrambling to obtain 
a copy of the county's bankruptcy petition and get outside legal advice to help 
it assess the impact of the county's bankruptcy on the district. "I don't think 
it will affect the employee payroll because we have other funds," said Clark 
Ide, the district's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sanitation District: The district was unable to make good on a 
$26-million loan due Wednesday because its money in the county fund was frozen 
by the bankruptcy. The district, however, did not default because Lehman Bros. 
agreed to pick up the loan. "We're OK. Everything is moving smoothly," said 
Gary Streed, director of finance for the district. "We're doing what we can to 
find other sources of money. We've got plenty of money. It's just in the wrong 
bank right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The district Wednesday met its $1-million biweekly payroll, but when payday 
rolls around again in two weeks there won't be any checks for the district's 
600 employees unless the county releases some funds, said district spokeswoman 
Corinne Berenson.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; INVESTORS WEIGH THEIR OPTIONS; MUNI BOND VALUES 
SLUMP BUT FEW TRADE AT FIRE-SALE PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Municipal bond values slumped across the country on Wednesday as investors 
responded fearfully to Orange County's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But mutual fund companies said there was no rush on the part of individual 
investors to sell California muni bond funds. Meanwhile, federal regulators 
said some funds' parent companies plan to buy Orange County bonds now in fund 
portfolios to calm public jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders reported that some Orange County bonds and bonds of the county's 
municipalities were being priced in the market at just 50 cents to 80 cents on 
the dollar Wednesday -- but that virtually no bonds were actually changing 
hands at those prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is trading at these levels," said Robert Gore, a muni bond trader at 
Crowell Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. Instead, most investors continued to sit 
on the sidelines, he said, with bond owners angry and frustrated but unwilling 
to let go of their securities at fire-sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Other California muni bonds unrelated to Orange County also fell in price, 
though most were down only moderately, and even then few bond owners were 
willing to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Major mutual fund companies, meanwhile, said they were getting an 
above-average number of calls from investors who own California muni bond 
funds, but that most investors were asking questions rather than redeeming 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's very little activity in terms of redemptions," said Steven Permut, a 
manager at the Mountain View-based Benham Group, which manages two California 
muni money-market funds and five California muni bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Haley, portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments in Boston, said there 
was "no noticeable cash outflow" from its California funds related to the 
Orange County crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mutual fund companies attempted to halt concerns about potential losses 
by reporting that their exposure to bonds of Orange County and its 
municipalities was minimal, generally comprising less than 5% of individual 
California bond fund holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some fund companies took the position that under Chapter 9 
bankruptcy rules, the Orange County bonds they own aren't technically in 
default. 
</P>
<P>
 The default issue is key for short-term muni money-market funds, because under 
Securities and Exchange Commission rules defaulted money-market securities are 
supposed to be quickly sold -- which could cause a loss for heavily exposed 
funds, threatening to reduce their share prices below the normally stable $1 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Barbash, head of the SEC's mutual fund division in Washington, said the 
agency has not taken a stance on whether Orange County bonds are officially in 
default, instead instructing mutual funds to make that legal determination 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbash also confirmed that the SEC has received inquiries from more than 
seven fund companies about having the parent companies buy questionable Orange 
County debt from their money market funds -- a move that would protect 
shareholders' investment and remove the stigma attached to ownership of Orange 
County securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam Investments said it bought $3.5 million in county notes held by its 
Putnam Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund, eliminating the fund's exposure to the 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several fund firms took the same step with "derivative" securities that 
threatened to cause problems for money funds last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benham's Permut said his firm doesn't see a need to remove the Orange 
County notes in its two California muni money funds. He said the holdings make 
up less than 2% of the funds' assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the muni bond market outside California, traders said prices of 
many longer-term bonds were down 1% to 3% on the day, reflecting investors' 
jitters that other financially troubled municipalities could follow Orange 
County into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's concerns were heightened by a report from Moody's Investors 
Service economist John Lonski, who said about 135 other local governments and 
eight state governments operate investment funds that have invested in 
derivative securities similar to those owned by the busted Orange County fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts believe many or most of those other funds' losses on their 
derivatives are probably small compared with Orange County's situation. The 
state of Texas, for example, said its state and agency funds have less than 5% 
of assets in derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wall Street is leery about the possibility of municipal investment fund 
losses heretofore masked by those investors' often-liberal accounting 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 As they did on Tuesday, some investors sought refuge Wednesday in the safest 
possible securities: short-term U.S. Treasury bills. The yield on three-month 
T-bills dropped to 5.80% from 5.93% on Tuesday as investors rushed into them. 
Longer-term T-bond yields, in contrast, rose slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing on the bond market were hints by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan about future interest rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before Congress on the strong economy, Greenspan gave no indication 
that the Fed might hold back on additional interest rate increases simply to 
help troubled institutional investors whose bond portfolios have been slammed 
by higher rates this year.

THRIFTY PAYLESS EXECUTIVE REPLACED 7 MONTHS AFTER FIRM LEAVES L.A.; MERGER: 
CHAIRMAN OF BI-MART STORES UNIT WILL LEAD COMPANY. SOURCES SAID FORMER CEO DID 
NOT CONSULT SUFFICIENTLY WITH BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief executive whose preference for Oregon over Los Angeles was cited as 
a major reason that Thrifty Drug transferred its headquarters and hundreds of 
jobs out of the city seven months ago has been replaced in an apparent clash 
with the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim McAlear, who headed the recently merged Thrifty and PayLess drug store 
chains, left the company because "the board of directors believed that a change 
of leadership was appropriate," a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty PayLess Inc., now headquartered in Wilsonville, Ore., would not 
elaborate. But McAlear's abrupt departure raised questions about efforts to 
meld the two drug store chains, whose merger took effect in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a clash of business cultures," said one source, adding that McAlear 
didn't consult sufficiently with the board. "McAlear's management approach 
rubbed board members the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 McAlear was replaced by Marty Smith, chairman of the merged company's Bi-Mart 
stores division. Smith has also become chairman of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger occurred after Kmart Corp., parent company of PayLess, agreed last 
December to sell the chain to Thrifty for $1.2 billion. The deal was engineered 
by Leonard Green & Partners, a Los Angeles-based investment firm that 
controlled Thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Green was chairman of the merged firm's board of directors during 
McAlear's tenure. Green has relinquished the chairman's title to Smith, but 
remains on the board of the company, which has about 1,100 stores in 11 Western 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlear and Green were not immediately available for comment. However, 
Jonathan Sokoloff, a principle at Leonard Green & Partners, said the changes 
were unrelated to the financial performance of Thrifty PayLess. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three months ended Oct. 2, the privately held Thrifty PayLess reported 
a 3.3% increase in revenue from stores open at least 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlear was a 30-year veteran of Kmart who joined PayLess in 1987. He is 
credited with improving pharmacy operations at PayLess, and his selection to 
run the merged firm was considered testimony to the stronger management talent 
at PayLess than at Thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
 However, his sudden departure is in keeping with a history of rapid management 
turnover that has plagued Thrifty, both before and after the merger with 
PayLess. Two executive vice presidents also left the firm late last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Leonard Green & Partners decided to close Thrifty's headquarters 
on Wilshire Boulevard and consolidate its main offices in Wilsonville partly 
because McAlear and his team operated PayLess headquarters in that city and 
wanted to stay there. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the merger, Thrifty had about 500 employees at its headquarters at 3424 
Wilshire Blvd. There are now about 250 employees remaining at that location, 
the site of some accounting, legal and data processing operations. The company 
plans to close down all operations at that site by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlear's role in establishing an Oregon headquarters for the merged company 
was the focus of friction between Green and Mayor Richard Riordan earlier this 
year. Riordan told reporters last March that Thrifty would be moving its 
headquarters to Wilsonville to accommodate McAlear. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Green maintained that they had made no decision on a headquarters 
site. One month later, Green announced the move to Oregon and claimed that 
Riordan did little to try and keep the company in Los Angeles.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE GUINEA PIGS FOR SCIENCE OF 
COMPLEX SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times.

<P>
 Know how to make a small fortune through innovative investments? Start with a 
large one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, the folks in Orange County don't find that joke quite so funny these 
days. But all these exotic derivatives and leveraged synthetics that got Orange 
County in trouble are really the products of the last major wave of financial 
innovations. They're the software spinoffs of financial theories that began 
seeping from academe into the investment world back in the early 1970s. In pure 
monetary terms, it's been the most significant technology transfer of the 
postwar era. Trillions of dollars, yen and Deutschmarks are traded on these 
equations. 
</P>
<P>
 But now technology is creating new playgrounds for theory. Twenty years ago, 
chess was the key experimental medium for artificial intelligence research. 
Today, as academic researchers look at "neural nets" that can be trained to 
detect data patterns and "genetic algorithms" that literally breed software 
solutions to complex problems, they're going to the most dynamic, versatile and 
data-rich research medium in the world: the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Neural network software doesn't merely execute commands, but actually 
constructs models of the world by establishing connections between seemingly 
disparate bits of data, in ways somewhat analogous to the living brain. 
Conversely, genetic algorithms literally evolve software according to Darwinian 
principles of fitness. As computer processors become more powerful and less 
expensive, "growing" solutions becomes practical. 
</P>
<P>
 And the stock markets, the bond markets, the options & futures markets and the 
foreign exchange markets are now becoming the E. coli and Drosophila of these 
areas of advanced computer research; what fruits flies and lab rats are to 
biology, financial markets are becoming for complex software. The markets offer 
a superb research domain to rigorously test pattern-recognition and 
solution-finding in complex systems. And, if the software works, you can make a 
few extra bucks along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the only medium for attack but it's certainly a key one," 
acknowledges USC Computer Science Professor Bart Kosko, who specializes in 
fuzzy logic research. "This will be a fast-growing area. . . . Look at the 
billions of dollars that have been spent on model-based techniques to analyze 
the markets -- like charts and the Black-Scholes Options Pricing equations. By 
contrast, these technologies let us play with 'model-free' techniques -- to let 
the data tell their own story if there is a story to be told. So I think it's 
obvious that there's going to be a lot of research in this area and that 
financial markets will be a major part of that research. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact," Kosko notes, "one of my students (has developed software) for 
prediction of gold market prices." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is another revolution going on but, never having done one of 
these things, I'm a little suspicious of it," asserts Peter Bernstein, founding 
editor of the Journal of Portfolio Management and author of "Capital Ideas," a 
history of the rise of the financial theorists on Wall Street. "The dream of 
having all this stuff measurable and predictable is an irrepressible dream." 
But Bernstein observes that the people developing genetic algorithms and neural 
nets "don't come from economics or finance, so I'm not really on their 
frequency." 
</P>
<P>
 Much as the Wall Street investment houses eventually lured big-name academic 
financial theorists to their firms to help design a new generation of financial 
instruments, they are now sending their "quants" to academic conferences on 
neural nets and genetic algorithms to cherry-pick ideas and recruit 
consultants. "It's what people talk about on the floor of these conferences and 
between the sessions," says Larry O'Brien, editor of AI in Finance, a magazine 
that was launched earlier this year. "Every trading house has their rocket 
scientists looking at this. It is the primary thing; it is the current Holy 
Grail." 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be weather; now they're using financial markets," observes Susan 
Webber of Jaquish Advisers, who has worked extensively with options traders. 
"Certainly, data capture has gotten a lot better. A few years ago, all that 
people had was end-of-day price data. Now we have prices all through the day 
so, if there are patterns to detect or parameters to define, there is a lot 
better data to work with. It's certainly a happy coincidence that financial 
markets make such a good research tool," she adds, "but, frankly, I don't think 
it's just a coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
 But the point that academics stress is that financial markets offer a 
tremendous resource for exploring new concepts in pattern recognition and 
software design. "It certainly has all the right characteristics of a 
challenging, worthy problem," says Stanford Consulting Computer Science 
Professor John Koza, author of "Genetic Programming," a best-selling text in 
the field. "It certainly has the potential to be self-funding." 
</P>
<P>
 But "no one knows if it is even possible to model these things or if the 
markets are so efficient or so chaotic that they don't matter. . . . I'm 
personally not doing anything in financial services but I know several people 
who are." However, Koza adds, "This may be one of those rare research areas 
where people prefer to publish their failed experiments rather than their 
successful ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Will a misguided neural net investment or a mutating genetic algorithm hedge 
help plunge a municipality into bankruptcy 20 years hence? It's far too early 
to say what the impact of these emerging software genres will be on financial 
investment. But recently, a computer chess program beat world chess champion 
Gary Kasparov in several games of speed chess. Could beating Warren Buffet be 
that much more difficult?

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; INVESTORS WEIGH THEIR OPTIONS; LEGAL ACTION 
AGAINST BROKERS IS INEVITABLE, EXPERTS PREDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Merrill Lynch and several other Wall Street firms, Orange County's 
bankruptcy filing may presage a lull before a legal storm that securities law 
experts say is all but inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage firm, played by far the biggest role 
in selling risky derivatives to the county's ill-starred investment fund. 
Losses led to the county's bankruptcy filing on Tuesday. Merrill reportedly 
earned $80 million in fees and commissions from its dealings with the fund. 
Merrill and other Wall Street brokerages also helped the county borrow huge 
sums to buy still more of the securities that plummeted in value as interest 
rates rose. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as is known, neither the county nor any of the other investors in the 
fund have filed suit against the firms. The identities of some of them still 
haven't been made public. Merrill strongly denies any liability and says the 
county was sophisticated enough to make its own investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But John C. Coffee Jr., an expert on securities law at Columbia University Law 
School, and others say suits seeking to force the firms to reimburse the county 
for its losses are extremely likely. They say much will depend on facts that 
have yet to be made public. But they say settlements and decisions in other 
cases suggest that, if sued, the brokerage firms face a significant risk of 
being forced to make good on at least part of losses now estimated to be well 
in excess of $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about possible suits comes amid new disclosures about Merrill's role 
in the Orange County fund. Sources close to Merrill told The Times on Wednesday 
that last May, senior executives from Merrill Lynch's headquarters in New York 
flew to Orange County to meet with county Treasurer Robert L. Citron to go over 
concerns about the fund and its investment strategy. The county's account with 
Merrill until then had been handled almost exclusively by Merrill's San 
Francisco office. The meeting came as Citron was running for reelection against 
John M.W. Moorlach, who had leveled major criticisms about the risks the fund 
was taking. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources declined to give details of the May meeting, or say what the 
outcome was. After the meeting, the fund made no major changes in its strategy, 
and Citron won reelection. Paul Critchlow, Merrill's chief spokesman, said he 
wouldn't confirm or deny that the meeting took place. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement read by Critchlow, Merrill said the county was sophisticated 
enough to make its own evaluation of interest rates, and said "Merrill Lynch is 
confident that in all of its activities with and on behalf of Orange County our 
company acted properly and professionally at all times." The firm also said it 
believed the bankruptcy filing was "unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street already has begun factoring in potential legal liability for 
Merrill: The firm's shares on the New York Stock Exchange have declined $3.375 
since the fund's losses were first disclosed on Dec. 1. It closed down $1.25 
Wednesday, at $35. Wednesday a Smith Barney analyst lowered her rating of the 
stock because of potential exposure to lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stamenson, a veteran institutional salesman in Merrill's San Francisco 
office, was the lead broker on the Orange County account. Stamenson, who 
reportedly earned over $5 million in annual commissions in recent years, has 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County was one of Merrill's leading customers for buying interest 
rate-sensitive derivatives, sometimes buying the entire amount Merrill had to 
sell. The fund bought nearly $4 billion of Fannie Mae securities from Merrill 
in 1993, including an entire $800-million issue in July of that year, sources 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 And Merrill helped "leverage up" the fund, along with other Wall Street firms 
enabling it to borrow large sums of money so that it could buy still more 
derivatives. The fund borrowed $12 billion, adding to the $7.8 billion in 
public money invested in it. Merrill, for example, underwrote new bonds for the 
county, the proceeds of which were immediately used to buy more than $1 billion 
in higher risk derivatives from Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though courts might consider the county to be a sophisticated investor, 
there are still plenty of legal theories about Wall Street firms' potential 
liability. Citron, who resigned Sunday, had a fiduciary duty to the fund and to 
the cities and agencies that invested in it; the firms could be accused of 
helping him breach his fiduciary duties by selling him risky securities and 
enabling him to worsen the situation by using borrowed money. Citron has 
declined comment about the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Coffee, the most chilling scenario for Wall Street is what 
happened in England four years ago, when 130 small cities speculated heavily in 
a type of derivative known as interest rate swaps. Britain's House of Lords 
ruled that the cities had no authority to buy such risky securities and 
therefore weren't responsible for the losses. That left the banks and 
investment firms that sold the securities to absorb over $700 million in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A case with striking parallels to Orange County occurred in West Virginia in 
the late 1980s. A state investment fund, which invested money of state agencies 
as well as other government entities that voluntarily invested, speculated 
heavily in treasury put-options, financed with "reverse repos" similar to those 
used by Orange County. The fund ended up losing over $100 million. The state 
sued the brokerages that sold the securities. Mary L. Wolff, a Memphis lawyer 
who represented the state, said the fund recovered about $28 million in 
settlements from Salomon Bros., Goldman Sachs, and several other firms, and won 
a judgment of $58 million against Morgan Stanley, which is currently being 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Bankers Trust was recently sued by two corporate clients for 
selling them derivatives that caused big losses. Gibson Greeting Cards and 
Procter & Gamble both filed suit. Bankers Trust agreed to settle with Gibson 
Greetings, absorbing about 70% of its losses, even though it contended that the 
company was a sophisticated investor that should have been fully aware of the 
risks.

 Despite its bankruptcy, Orange County's overall ability to raise revenue

FINANCIAL MARKETS; O.C. DEBACLE, INFLATION FEARS SEND STOCKS, DOLLAR LOWER

 Orange County's bankruptcy filing and inflation warnings from Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan rattled financial markets Wednesday, sending stocks and 
the dollar lower and long-term bond yields up. 
</P>
<P>
 As on Tuesday, some investors sold stocks and bonds and put their cash into 
short-term Treasury bills, considered a safe haven in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrial average lost just 10.43 points to 3,735.52, 
but that masked a heavy selloff in the broad market. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers outnumbered winners 15 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange and 18 to 10 
on the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks tumbled 6.96 points, or 
almost 1%, to 734.27. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Orange County's surprise bankruptcy filing late Tuesday cast a 
negative pall over the stock market, adding another element of concern to an 
already jittery market. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also was weakened, experts said, because currency traders fear the 
Orange County debacle could be a harbinger of troubles faced by much larger 
investors that made similar, highly leveraged bets on bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy new selling of bonds and stocks by investors forced to liquidate could 
depress the dollar anew, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 99.94 Japanese yen and 1.568 German marks, 
down from 100.08 yen and 1.572 marks Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors also weren't happy with Greenspan's testimony before the Joint 
Economic Committee of Congress. He said that economic growth has been stronger 
than expected and that consumer inflation could start to rise -- speculation 
that many analysts took to mean the Fed isn't through raising short-term 
interest rates to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, municipal bonds were down sharply in price nationwide, 
reflecting investors' concerns about the health of states, counties and other 
municipalities in the wake of Orange County's shocking bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury bond market was mixed. Yields on longer-term issues rose 
slightly, reflecting Greenspan's inflation warnings, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But yields on short-term T-bills dove for a second day, as investors sought a 
safe place to stash cash. The yield on six-month T-bills slid to 6.38% from 
6.52% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shares of major securities firms that are creditors to Orange County fell 
sharply on the bankruptcy news. Merrill Lynch dropped 1 1/4 to 35 and Morgan 
Stanley slumped 1 5/8 to 56 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, mutual fund giant Franklin Resources lost 7/8 to 35 3/4 after an 
Oppenheimer & Co. analyst downgraded the stock, citing Franklin's California 
municipal bond funds' potential exposure to Orange County and related bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many closed-end mutual funds that own California bonds dropped. MuniYield 
California Fund sank 1/2 to 12, Nuveen California Investment Quality Muni Fund 
dropped 1/2 to 14 and Nuveen California Muni Value Fund was off 1/2 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elsewere, Continental Corp. surged 4 3/4 to 18 3/4 following Monday's news 
that it is to be acquired by CNA Financial for $1.1 billion cash, or $20 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average fell 166.24 points to 19,174.23. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX average closed at 2,055.60, up 8.72 points, and London's 
FTSE 100 eased 3.6 points to 3,012.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crude oil prices fell to eight-month lows before recovering to end 
modestly lower. On the Merc, January crude oil closed 7 cents lower at $16.87 a 
barrel.

 FCC Asks for Further Data on Fox: Federal regulators escalated their 
investigation into the ownership of Fox Inc., saying they would seek further 
information from the network.The Federal Communications Commission's Mass Media 
Bureau said it has reached no conclusion, according to a copy of the interim 
order. The main issue is whether Fox's acquisition of the six TV stations that 
made up the foundation of its network violate foreign ownership limits, which 
prohibit a foreign company or individual owning more than 25% of a U.S. 
broadcast station. "We intend to comply fully and promptly with the 
commission's request," said Preston Padden, distribution president at Fox 
Broadcasting Co.

PILGRIM GROUP MUTUAL FUNDS TO BREAK UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of controversy that drained its assets, the Century City-based 
Pilgrim Group mutual fund company said Wednesday that it will disband. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm said its staff and six of its 10 funds, with assets of $1.15 billion, 
will be sold to Express America Holdings, an Arizona mortgage banker, for $28 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim CEO Palomba Weingarten will retain four other Pilgrim funds with $750 
million in assets -- Pilgrim Adjustable U.S. Government Securities Trust, 
Pilgrim Adjustable Rate Securities Trust, Pilgrim Short-Term Multi-Market 
Income Fund II and Pilgrim All-Americas Government Income Trust -- under a 
corporate name yet to be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Weingarten was censured last spring by the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers for ads that the NASD judged to be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Though penalties were reduced in September, the controversy surrounding her 
and the Pilgrim funds has caused business to fall off and prompted some fund 
shareholders to sell. Many industry analysts had speculated recently that the 
company would be sold.

ENROLLMENT IN HMOS RISES AT SHARP PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health maintenance organizations Wednesday reported the highest-ever yearly 
growth in enrollment and said that their increased emphasis on patient feedback 
was paying off with greater client satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 More than five million Americans joined HMOs in the 10-month period ended Oct. 
1, bringing total enrollment from 45 million in 1993 to more than 50 million, 
about one in five Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth of that growth, or more than one million people, took place through a 
more flexible option, called a point-of-service plan, which allows patients to 
opt out of a standard HMO for particular medical needs, according to data 
released by the Group Health Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization predicted that HMO enrollment in the coming year would rise 
to about 56 million. In 1982, less than 10 million Americans were covered by 
these health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, premiums for the average HMO member will decline about 1.2% in 
1995, the organization predicted. It said average monthly premiums will be $145 
for an individual and $392 for a family.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; JUSTICE DEPT. NASDAQ PROBE IS EXPANDED; INVESTIGATION: THE 
GOVERNMENT ASKS DEALERS FOR DETAILED TRADING RECORDS AND TRADERS' AND 
SUPERVISORS' COMPENSATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department stepped up its investigation of Nasdaq stock market 
dealers by asking the firms for detailed trading records stretching back nearly 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Securities firms that operate on the Nasdaq system said the federal agency 
wants records detailing their "payments for order flow," or the money paid to 
other dealers in exchange for securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department also wants traders' phone numbers and is asking whether 
the firms recorded their phone calls. Firms were asked to disclose traders' and 
supervisors' compensation and the total number of Nasdaq stocks the firms 
bought and sold each year. 
</P>
<P>
 People at the firms called the requests for information excessive and said 
they'd probably be narrowed as the investigation continues. Moreover, few firms 
record telephone conversations, and are not legally bound to maintain records 
dating back 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 30 large brokers that make markets in Nasdaq stocks recently 
received the civil investigative demands, which are 41-page documents. The 
demands signal that the government may be building a civil case against 
dealers, rather than a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is taking handcuffs out yet," said Robert Skirnick, an attorney whose 
firm is representing shareholders charging Nasdaq securities dealers with 
collusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The government could still pursue criminal charges against dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq officials declined to comment on the latest round of requests for 
information, which were first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.

THE ECONOMY; OUTPUT RISES AS LABOR COSTS STALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The indicators: The Labor Department reported revised figures on productivity 
and labor costs in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * What they did: Non-farm productivity -- output per number of hours worked -- 
rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.9%, higher than the 2.7% 
initially reported.Productivity rebounded from a 2.1% decline in the second 
quarter. The decline in the April-June period was the first since a 2% decrease 
during the first quarter of 1993 and the steepest since a 3.7% plunge in the 
first quarter of 1989. The report also showed that unit labor costs, which 
represent about two-thirds of the cost of a product, were unchanged, the best 
showing since a 2.4% decline in the last quarter of 1993. A modest 0.1% 
increase was initially reported. 
</P>
<P>
 * What it means: Some economists say increasing productivity reflects the 
benefits of corporate restructuring and re-engineering, as well as a response 
to competitive pressures. Stable labor costs at this stage of the business 
cycle are also seen as good news and may have been held in check because 
workers fear losing jobs if they demand higher wages or more costly benefits, 
say economists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highlights: Unit labor costs were held down despite an inflation-adjusted 3% 
increase in hourly compensation, compared to 0.7% in the second quarter and a 
rise of 6.1% in the first. Total business productivity, including farming, was 
up 3.5%, compared to a 2% drop in the second quarter. Manufacturing output -- 
nearly 20% of U.S. business sector employment -- rose 3.6% in the third quarter 
after increases of 5.6% in the second quarter and 6.4% in the first.

 Metallica Settles Suit: The Grammy-winning hard rock band settled its 
three-month-old lawsuit against Time Warner's Elektra Entertainment after 
renegotiating a lucrative pact that will keep Metallica at the label well into 
the future.Filed in September, the litigation followed a corporate shake-up 
orchestrated by Warner Music Group Chairman Robert Morgado, which in August led 
to the resignation of Robert Krasnow as Elektra chief. At the time, Metallica 
blamed its suit on Morgado. Drummer Lars Ulrich said Morgado reneged on 
Krasnow's promise to restructure the band's deal. The dispute was resolved with 
the aid of Doug Morris, the newly appointed chairman and CEO of Warner Music 
U.S.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; Q & A; LIGHT 
AT END OF TUNNEL FOR SOME BONDHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Things may not be as bleak as they seem for holders of some bonds and bond 
mutual funds that may be affected by Orange County's bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 9 proceedings, unlike other types of bankruptcy, specifically protect 
the income promised to holders of certain types of bonds, bankruptcy experts 
note. Meanwhile, managers of California tax-free funds maintain that investor 
yields are unlikely to be significantly affected by Orange County's woes, even 
if the county eventually defaults on some of its debts. Asset values may take a 
small hit, but most big funds say the long-term impact will be modest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does a Chapter 9 filing protect bondholders, and which bondholders does 
it protect? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This section of the federal bankruptcy code specifies that income pledged 
to pay interest and principal on revenue bonds -- those issued by utilities, 
transportation authorities and special purpose districts -- must be paid 
directly to bondholders. The county may not use these dedicated funds to pay 
other bills, said Bennett Murphy, bankruptcy partner at the Los Angeles law 
firm Latham & Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about holders of general obligation bonds? Are they protected too? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. They become general unsecured creditors, which means they get paid 
after county employees, some suppliers, bankruptcy attorneys and federal debts 
are paid, Murphy says. The good news on this front is that Orange County is 
likely to need to borrow in the future. If it defaults on its bonds now, its 
borrowing ability will be severely hampered in the future. There may be some 
delay in paying interest on some issues, but experts maintain that defaulting 
would be a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about California tax-free bond funds? How badly are they going to be 
hit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Preliminary estimates are that the vast majority of funds have minimal 
exposure, generally between 1% and 2%, and that most of that is insured or 
backed in some way.  
</P>
<P>
 Using data from April, no fund has more than 12% of its assets in bonds 
potentially affected by the bankruptcy, said Donald Phillips, publisher of 
Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
 In April, the most exposed funds were STI Classic Investment Grade, Merrill 
Lynch California Limited Maturity, Alliance Municipal Income and Franklin 
California Tax-Free, according to Morningstar. Portfolios have changed, 
however. In fact, Merrill Lynch says that currently there is no direct exposure 
to Orange County in its Limited Maturity fund. Other funds also may have 
reduced or added exposure since then, Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, all Merrill Lynch funds combined own a total of $71 million in 
Orange County bonds. All the bonds are "credit enhanced," with either private 
insurance or escrow funds available if they are not paid, adds Kathy Keary, a 
Merrill spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin says it does have a significant number of Orange County bonds, but 
the vast majority of its bonds are also backed by insurance or letters of 
credit. Only $25.6 million of the affected bonds are uninsured, a Franklin 
spokeswoman said. Those uninsured bonds are divided among three portfolios -- 
the California Tax Free Income fund, the California Tax-Exempt Money fund and 
the Franklin Tax-Exempt Money Fund -- and the uninsured exposure amounts to 
significantly less than 1% of each fund's assets, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you say a bond is "credit enhanced," does that mean that there is no 
chance that it will go into default? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. What it means is that a second entity -- either a bank, insurer or 
escrow firm -- is holding or has pledged funds to pay principal and interest on 
the debt. If the bond goes into default the bank, insurer or escrow company 
will be obligated to pay bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the other big mutual funds? What's their exposure like? 
</P>
<P>
 A: T. Rowe Price says it has absolutely no Orange County paper in its money 
market funds. The company's California Tax-Free Bond Fund has 0.6% of its 
assets in revenue bonds issued by a county department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity Investments' California Tax-free fund has 0.7% of its assets in 
Orange County bonds. More than half of that amount is in insured issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Scudder, Stevens & Clark says all of its Orange County bonds are privately 
insured, however, it has some Costa Mesa bonds -- and Costa Mesa had $7 million 
invested in Orange County's investment pool. But Costa Mesa has assured Scudder 
that the city is in good shape and will have no trouble paying on its bonds 
because of the Orange County debacle, says Jeremy L. Ragus, portfolio manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreyfus Corp. says its Dreyfus/Laurel tax-exempt money market fund holds 
precisely one Orange County general obligation note, and it accounts for less 
than 1% of the fund's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanguard says its high-yield fund has 1% of its assets invested in the bonds 
of an Orange County transportation agency. Otherwise, Vanguard's exposure to 
Orange County's credit woes are negligible, says Paul Flynn, portfolio analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are any multiple-state muni funds affected? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Literally hundreds of funds are affected, Morningstar's Philips said, but 
the degree to which they are affected is negligible. 
</P>

 "This is one of those times that you really see a benefit to investing through 
mutual funds rather than buying bonds on your own," Phillips said. "Fund 
managers diversify away a lot of the credit risk. While you certainly wouldn't 
welcome a default in any event, it's not as big a deal for fund investors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will yields and net asset values drop on the funds that are affected? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Thanks to bond insurance and other credit enhancements, not by much. Net 
asset values of municipal bond funds declined across the board on Wednesday, 
largely due to fears that risky derivative securities could also bedevil other 
city, county and state investment portfolios. Many industry experts expect the 
market to bounce back, however. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: I've been taking a beating all year on my bond funds and this is making me 
worried that the principal values in muni funds are not that secure. Is it time 
to bail out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Individual events can spook the markets and play havoc with daily 
trading prices. But investors shouldn't be concerned about day-to-day events. 
Instead, periodically examine your portfolio and ask: Am I properly 
diversified? Are my investments well suited to my goals? Are the investments in 
my portfolio performing as expected, given current economic and market 
conditions? If the answers are yes, sit tight. You'd be foolish to change a 
viable strategy because of a single event. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you say a bond is "credit enhanced," does that mean that there is no 
chance that it will go into default? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. What it means is that a second entity -- either a bank, insurer or 
escrow firm -- is holding or has pledged funds to pay principal and interest on 
the debt. If the bond goes into default the bank, insurer or escrow company 
will be obligated to pay bondholders.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DO RATINGS AGENCIES SHARE BLAME FOR FIASCO?; WALL 
STREET: QUESTIONS ARE BEING RAISED AS TO WHETHER MAJOR CREDIT-RANKING SERVICES 
ARE RELIABLE JUDGES OF MUNICIPAL INVESTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's financial disaster has raised questions about whether major 
Wall Street credit-rating agencies are reliable judges of municipal 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings on $1.58-billion worth of Orange County bonds were slashed to 
non-investment grade levels Wednesday by Standard & Poor's Corp., and Moody's 
Investor Service lowered its rating on some of the county's sanitation 
districts commercial paper to "not prime." But several municipal bond investors 
called it too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our members have called us wondering where the rating agencies were. 
It's a logical question," said Betsy Dotson, an assistant director with the 
Government Finance Officers Assn. in Washington. "Some of these losses may have 
been avoided if the rating agencies had spotted problems earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pace was feverish in downtown Manhattan Wednesday as rating analysts 
struggled to extract information from unavailable authorities. Reportedly, 50 
Moody's analysts were poring over records, while others at the company were 
preparing to fly to California to meet with Orange County officials. At 
Standard & Poor's, the pace was equally chaotic as it also prepared for 
meetings today. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard P. Larkin, a managing director with Standard & Poor's in New York, 
said he couldn't think of another municipal bond issuer that had ever fallen so 
rapidly from investment grade ratings of "AA" to "C." He said Orange County's 
bankruptcy filing took everyone by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't foresee it," he said. "And though we knew bankruptcy was a legal 
option, we didn't think it was a real possibility. The county crossed a very 
big line yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from both companies said they hoped to get some answers today. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just so much information to collect, but hopefully, tomorrow we will 
get more," said David Brodsly, a director with Moody's in San Francisco. "We 
are carefully reviewing the information provided to us by the county in the 
past. I'm certain this will have a tremendous impact on the municipal market 
going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rating analysts said they were reassured by Orange County in September, when 
they were told there was more than $1 billion in cash on hand in the county's 
investment portfolio. In retrospect, officials said, they should have asked for 
more information.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of soul-searching going on," said one rating official who asked 
not to be named. "It's like when you're in a crowd and someone gets shot, you 
always wonder if you could have done something to prevent it. This is a huge 
event that is going to affect our careers and our business for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the rating agencies say that even as the Orange County fund started 
to lose $1.5 billion in value this year, the agencies maintained their high 
ratings on debt sold by Orange County and 180 other cities, school districts 
and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Moody's gave Orange County a glowing review this summer on a bond 
issue, without pointing out all the risks in the county's investment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I told you we put every issuer through the wringer when it 
comes to their investment strategy. . . . I think we will all start to ask more 
questions," said Amy Doppelt, senior director at Fitch Investors Service in New 
York, another nationwide bond-rating service. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch does not rate Orange County bonds.

 No Economic Recovery Seen for Russia in '95: Economic prospects for Russia are 
gloomy, with little chance of any recovery in production, employment and living 
standards in the next year, according to a United Nations report.The report by 
the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe said the forecast for other former 
Soviet states was even worse, but that economic revival in most East European 
countries would continue. The U.N. blamed the depth of the recession on a 
"restrictive but incoherent monetary policy," which had led to sharp cuts in 
domestic demand. The ECE put Russia's unemployment rate at 12%.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; ISLANDS ARE SMOKIN': INDONESIAN CIGARETTE MAKER'S STOCK 
IS RED HOT; ASIA: H.M. SAMPOERNA, THE COUNTRY'S MOST PROFITABLE MAKER OF KRETEK 
, IS WORTH ABOUT $2.2 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tropical dampness hangs heavily in the morning air. The spicy-sweet aroma of 
clove permeates the factory floor. Fingers fly in a blur as women -- women are 
preferred throughout Asia for factory work involving fine motor skills -- 
produce 300 to 400 cigarettes filled with cloves and strong tobacco an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Asia, few companies are at once as exotic and as dynamic as H.M. 
Sampoerna, the most profitable maker of kretek , Indonesia's unique cigarettes. 
It's a huge business, as evidenced by the smoky fragrance that pervades the 
streets of the world's fourth-most populous country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampoerna ranks as one of the most sophisticated and fastest-growing companies 
in this booming region, an example of the tough local competition that U.S., 
European and Japanese multinational firms are finding as they invade Asia's 
lucrative markets. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a flourishing company that must occasionally summon priests to its 
factories because cigarette rollers sometimes become seized by a fear of ghosts 
-- a burst light bulb once sent thousands of workers fleeing. And workers are 
organized into villages and sub-villages headed by "village chiefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the company raises money on the Eurobond market and employs Madison 
Avenue-style advertising and market research. And its stock is red-hot: based 
on the recent price on the Jakarta stock exchange, the company is worth about 
$2.2 billion, only slightly less than General Dynamics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampoerna's sales have risen at a compound rate of 50% a year since 1990, 
propelled by clever marketing and fast-rising consumer incomes. It is only 
slightly slowed by a government-backed clove monopoly organized by Tommy 
Suharto, President Suharto's youngest son, that charges about four times the 
world price for clove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put it this way," 47-year-old company President Putera Sampoerna, said 
with a shrug, referring to the clove monopoly. "My five-year plan became a 
seven-year plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Putera's grandfather, Liem Seeng Tee, established the country's first 
brand-name product, a kretek called 2-3-4, or Dji Sam Soe (pronounced 
"jee-sum-soo"), which is Hokkien Chinese for the three numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The founder gave 2-3-4 a prestige image that has proven a gold mine. With its 
high-quality ingredients, the brand is widely viewed as a smoke to be savored 
like a fine cigar. It commands twice the price of an average kretek -- about 
$1.05 a pack, a hefty sum in a country where per-capita annual income is around 
$700. Poor Indonesians who can only afford to buy 2-3-4 by the stick sometimes 
pay extra for an empty 2-3-4 pack, so they can look and feel more prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 The product is extraordinarily unhealthy. A unfiltered stick of 2-3-4 -- which 
is still made today with the same tobacco-clove blend that Liem used eight 
decades ago -- contains about 60 milligrams of tar, compared with 26 milligrams 
for a regular unfiltered Lucky Strike and 16 milligrams for a king-size, 
filtered Marlboro. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the brokerage firm Jardine Fleming observed in a recent report, "there 
is no goal to deter smoking" in Indonesia. That's partly because the government 
has more urgent health problems, such as malaria and typhoid, and partly 
because "the kretek industry is simply too important for the overall Indonesian 
economy." Kretek makers employ more Indonesians than anyone except the 
government, and pay more tax revenue than any industry other than oil and gas. 
(Sampoerna has made one bow in the direction of public health by introducing 
the first low-tar, low-nicotine kretek , called A-Mild.) 
</P>
<P>
 Putera took over from his late father in 1980. Highly westernized -- he spent 
much of his youth in Australia and the United States -- he inherited a company 
steeped in traditional Indonesian ways of doing business. He radically revamped 
Sampoerna's business strategy away from its historical orientation as a pure 
manufacturer that left marketing up to independent distributors. As Indonesia's 
economy began to take flight in the late 1980s, Putera recognized the need to 
make the company much more market-driven. 
</P>
<P>
 The company -- which had never advertised until 1990 -- developed a campaign 
three years ago aimed at capitalizing on 2-3-4's premium image by asking 
smokers the question: "Do you remember the first 2-3-4 you ever smoked?" 
</P>
<P>
 One man featured in glossy magazine advertisements recalled being rewarded 
with a 2-3-4 the day he shot his first boar. "My father patted me on the back 
and said, 'Today you are a man -- you deserve a 2-3-4.' " Another ad featured a 
man who climbed a famous Javanese mountain at 16, and rewarded himself at the 
summit by lighting up the stick of 2-3-4 he had brought with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampoerna's share of Indonesian cigarette sales shot up from around 4% in 
early 1992 to just under 10% at the start of 1993, and rose even further this 
year to nearly 15% in June, according to Survey Research Indonesia. Profits 
from sales of the high-margin 2-3-4 have grown so fast that Sampoerna's 
earnings this year are projected to reach $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's quite a window of opportunity for any consumer product company in 
this market," said Putera, adding quickly, "except cigarettes."

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN TRAVELING 
ABROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passage of a new international trade agreement is likely to accelerate foreign 
travel by U.S. business people, many of whom have little experience abroad and 
could be particular targets for criminals ranging from pickpockets to 
kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign deals are already resetting company priorities. A recent American 
Express survey found that private companies now spend 13% of their travel and 
entertainment budgets abroad, up from 8% in 1990. The survey also showed that 
40% of U.S. businesses now have overseas offices, compared to 35% in 1992. Even 
smaller companies -- those spending less than $100,000 a year in travel -- now 
spend more of it overseas. The survey showed 13% now have operations abroad, up 
from just 8% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most business people approach international travel with the same 
expectations of safety as they do in the United States, says John Morrison, 
director of risk management services for Paul Chamberlain International in Los 
Angeles, a security consulting firm. Although some places, such as Japan and 
parts of Europe, are safer than the United States, other destinations pose a 
greater risk of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, some ways that travelers can increase their security. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important strategy for reducing the risk of attack, whether it's 
aimed at grabbing you or your wallet, is to "maintain a circle of awareness," 
Morrison says. Too often in public places, Morrison sees people talking on 
phones with their wallets and calendars out and their luggage strewn around. 
Keep all your bags close by you at all times, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And this may sound like an echo from childhood, but travel in groups and don't 
go anywhere with strangers if you can avoid it. If possible, arrange to have 
someone you know (or whose identity you can verify) from the company you are 
visiting, meet you at the airport. When making business appointments, always 
arrange to meet in a restaurant or other public location with people around. 
Don't conduct business in hotel lobbies, however, because they are frequently 
targets of surveillance by criminals looking for "marks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along with your circle of awareness, it's important to keep as low a profile 
as possible, Morrison says. Make sure your luggage doesn't have any flashy 
American symbols or flags, and don't rent or drive a car that would draw 
attention. High-visibility executives should consider using assumed names when 
booking airline tickets to avoid broadcasting their travel itineraries to 
potential criminals, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The same applies if you are traveling for a highly visible U.S. company, says 
Stacey Ravel Abarbanel, author of "Smart Business Travel -- How to Stay Safe 
When You're on the Road," (First Books Inc., 1994). She recommends registering 
under an assumed corporate name if you are traveling in a country where your 
real company name might invite anti-American sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein, don't carry your passport facing out in your front breast 
pocket or in your hand, she said. You don't want people to be able to easily 
identify your citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Some American business travelers even carry fake passports with a pseudonym 
"documenting" their citizenship in a small country to present in the unlikely 
event of a hijacking or other terrorist act, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It also pays to understand some local customs to avoid inadvertently offending 
anyone, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware as well that people eavesdrop on airplanes and may pick you out as 
someone with valuable corporate information or ties to a wealthy company, both 
of which could make you a potential target. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the security pitfalls for Americans traveling overseas is 
that they tend to be friendly and engage people in conversation, inadvertently 
giving away sensitive information. Foreign criminals exploit this tendency for 
their own gain, advises the State Department's Overseas Security Advisory 
Council in a booklet called "Security Guidelines for American Families Living 
Abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Habits are another thing they exploit. Try to change your travel patterns so 
you don't leave your hotel or temporary residence at the same time every day. 
And change your travel route. It's also smart to know some "safe havens" along 
your route, such as embassy or government buildings, police or fire stations, 
or hospitals. If you think you are being followed, get into one of your safe 
havens and request assistance. Also make sure you know how to use the public 
phones and carry the right coins to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be helpful to register at the U.S. embassy or consular office when you 
arrive at your destination, because officials will be able to give you current 
security risks for the country in which you're traveling. They can also assist 
in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Abarbanel suggests learning some basic phrases such as, "Help," "Police," and 
"Where is a phone?" in the native language. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, note that hotel rooms are not secure. Avoid leaving important 
identifying information or valuables in your room or car. Lock your passport, 
money and any important business papers in a hotel safe-deposit box and carry a 
photocopy of your passport with you. The experts also say you should not tell a 
hotel clerk your movement plans for the day, and avoid discussing travel plans 
where they can be overheard.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; CHARITY BEGINS ON THE GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One act of charity that can make sense for a busy business traveler is to 
donate miles or points to some worthy cause. Instead of forcing yourself to 
take trips you may not really want to take anyway, the airlines give you a 
variety of donation options. Remember, since you probably didn't report those 
miles as income, you can't expect to deduct anything from your taxes when you 
give them away. Here are some of the options available. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines: Members can donate any number of miles to Miles for Kids in 
Need; however, 5,000-mile increments are preferred. Members may designate the 
General Fund, which donates to organizations like the Brass Ring Society and 
the National Children's Cancer Society; the Starlight Foundation, which grants 
wishes for seriously ill children for travel to special places or to meet 
celebrities and athletes, or the Variety Club International Lifeline, which 
provides transportation for children who need medical treatment not available 
close to home. For every mile donated, American will match with three. Call 
(800) 882-8880. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Airlines: Members are encouraged to donate in 5,000-mile increments; 
however, donations of any amount are accepted. Request an award donation from 
the Children's Wish Foundation, Mission Air Transportation Network, or the 
Ronald McDonald Children's Charities of Canada. Call (800) 426-7007. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Airlines: Donations to Give the Extra Mile should be in 5,000-mile 
increments, and members may designate the Brass Ring Society, the National MS 
Society, or Careforce, an all-volunteer organization providing free or 
reduced-rate transportation to persons facing medical or personal crises. Call 
(800) 525-0280. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners Club: Members may donate in 4,500-point increments to the National Park 
Foundation, Literacy Volunteers of America, or Second Harvest. Call (800) 
234-4034 for further information. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday Inn: Members may donate to Give Kids the World in 250-, 500-, or 
1,000-point increments to send terminally ill children and their families to 
Disney World. Call (800) 272-9273. 
</P>

 Britain Raises Interest Rates: The government raised interest rates by a half 
point, calming jittery financial markets after a major defeat in its bid to 
fill a budget gap by raising domestic fuel taxes. Britain's top treasury 
official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, said the increase in the 
base rate to 6.25% from 5.75% was in line with the government's policy of 
holding back inflation. Clarke also said he wanted to ease uncertainty in 
Britain's financial markets, which for weeks had been full of speculation about 
higher interest rates.

 Iberia May Sell Assets to Avert Bankruptcy: Spain's ailing national airline 
will contact several international investment banks this week to begin selling 
assets in an effort to avert bankruptcy, said officials at Teneo, the 
government holding company that controls 99% of Iberia. The implementation of 
this so-called "Plan B" means Iberia management is dropping its original plan 
to seek authorization from the European Union for a $1-billion government 
bailout to save the airline from collapse. Iberia now hopes to raise the money 
through cutting a fifth of its work force and selling assets, including its 
Latin American holdings, certain domestic routes and its lucrative handling 
operations.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: SADDLEROCK RANCH RESTAURANT CLOSES SIX MONTHS AFTER 
OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Coast Restaurant Ventures has closed Saddlerock Ranch, a family-oriented 
restaurant that opened in June in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was in the space formerly occupied by Zuni Grill, a West Coast 
Restaurant Ventures eatery that closed earlier in the year. West Coast 
Restaurant's executive chef, John Sharpe, linked Saddlerock's closing to 
extremely tough competition from national restaurant chains operating in the 
same area.  
</P>
<P>
 "The economies just weren't there," Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast Restaurant Ventures, based in Newport Beach, operates many of 
Orange County's best-known restaurants, including Diva, Bistro 201 and Kachina.

ROCKWELL COMPLETES TENDER OFFER FOR RELIANCE ELECTRIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. said Wednesday it has completed its cash tender 
offer for Reliance Electric Co., paying $1.03 billion for 63% of the company's 
common shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, based in Seal Beach, said it plans to buy 100% of Reliance, but 
other steps need to be taken, company officials said. Because part of a second 
class of Reliance stock with greater voting rights also was tendered, Rockwell 
now holds 89% of Reliance's voting stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got control of Reliance at this point," Rockwell spokeswoman Mary Lou 
Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 21, Rockwell agreed to pay $1.6 billion in cash to acquire 
Cleveland-based Reliance, a maker of industrial and telecommunications 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's sweetened offer of $31 a share, up from $30, led Reliance last 
month to back out of its August agreement to merge with General Signal Corp. in 
a proposed $1.4-billion stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell is a maker of industrial automation systems, automotive components, 
spacecraft, electronic defense systems, telecommunications and graphics 
systems. The acquisition of Reliance, with 1993 revenue of $1.6 billion, will 
boost Rockwell's annual sales to about $12.6 billion, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell will merge Reliance into its rapidly growing Allen-Bradley automation 
business, making it the company's single-largest unit, with annual sales of 
more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The business will generate about 30% of Rockwell's sales, company officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tender offer expired at midnight Tuesday. So far, Rockwell has accepted 
33.2 million Reliance shares for purchase, mostly Class A shares but including 
146,304 Class B shares, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shares give Rockwell 63% of Reliance's outstanding common stock and 89% of 
the voting stock, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Reliance share not purchased in the tender offer will be converted into 
the right to receive $31 in cash for Class A and Class B shares, and $83.948 
for each Class C share. No Reliance Class C shares were tendered, Rockwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell is planning to sell Reliance's telecommunications operations, whose 
sales are projected at $470 million for this year. Rockwell said previously 
that some cutbacks and layoffs are inevitable after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliance adds about 14,000 employees to Rockwell's 72,000.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: DOWNEY; FREE SERVICES HELP PARADE BREAK EVEN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of Sunday's Holiday Lane Parade said thousands of dollars of 
donations and a City Council decision to provide police protection and other 
services at no charge allowed them to break even on the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade chairman Michael J. Prokop said the free city services, which would 
have cost about $5,700, helped reduce the parade's tab to $22,200 for the 
event's organizers, the Chamber of Commerce. Donations from residents and 
businesses covered the other costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, building and cleanup crews were provided by the city at no charge 
until last year. JOHN CANALIS

 Hawaiian Gardens, Norwalk and Paramount are teaming up to sell nearly $20 
million in tax-exempt bonds to help residents with low or moderate incomes buy 
their first homes or upgrade existing housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian Gardens and Norwalk will receive $6.75 million each, while Paramount 
will get $6.4 million.Norwalk will offer half of its allotment to first-time 
home buyers and half to existing homeowners who want to upgrade their property. 
Paramount will use $5.45 million to help first-time buyers -- those who have 
not owned a home for three years. The remaining $950,000 will go to home 
rehabilitations. Hawaiian Gardens has designated its entire allotment for 
first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates on the home loans will be 1 to 1 1/2 percentage points below 
rates charged by conventional lenders, said Richard Leahy, Paramount's 
assistant city manager. Income limits are $45,200 for one- or two-member 
households and $51,890 for a household of three or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rehabilitation program, homeowners must borrow enough money to pay off 
their current mortgages and make improvements that increase the value of their 
homes by at least 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents must plan to live in their homes for at least two years. STEVE EAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, asserting that driving around on official business has 
become more costly, has increased its monthly car allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 4 to 1 to raise their stipend for gasoline, auto 
maintenance and insurance from $250 to $400 a month, the first increase since 
1986.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Grace Hu said she voted for the increase because traveling costs 
are higher for council members, who drive to meetings throughout the county. 
The higher stipend matches the amount paid to city department heads. Mayor Paul 
W. Bowlen voted against the measure. "I think (the car allowance) was 
sufficient the way it was," he said. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; STORE TO REDO DESIGN PLANS TO PRESERVE MURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City planners and the owner of a trendy furniture store have reached an 
agreement that could save a mural painted on the interior of the city's oldest 
non-residential building. 
</P>
<P>
 Z Gallerie, a Los Angeles-area chain, had sought permission from the city's 
Planning Commission to remove the expansive mural of a setting sun before 
moving into the former Masonic Temple at 230 Pine Ave.Z Gallerie officials 
appealed to the planning commission after the city's Cultural Heritage 
Commission ruled that the painting must be preserved.  
</P>
<P>
 The company wanted to demolish the mural wall, saying it would interrupt the 
open, warehouse look that officials planned. But after learning from an art 
history expert and preservationists that the mural is one of the oldest in 
Southern California and is critical to the historic fabric of the building, Z 
Gallerie agreed to rework its interior design plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the compromise, Z Gallerie will leave the unsigned painting in place, 
but will remove an ornamental staircase and a portion of the wall beneath the 
mural. The new plans must meet city fire and safety codes, said Eugene Zeller, 
the city's interim planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 If the modifications are not up to code, Z Gallerie and the Cultural Heritage 
Commission will be required to raise enough money to move the mural to another 
wall in the building. Z Gallerie would put up $25,000 while the heritage 
commission and preservationists would raise the rest, which could run between 
$25,000 and $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission cannot raise its share, the mural wall can be demolished and 
Z Gallerie can proceed with its original plans, said Planning Commissioner 
Douglas Otto. JOHN CANALIS

NEW ASSEMBLYMAN KUYKENDALL BLENDING IDEOLOGY, PRAGMATISM; POLITICS: LEGISLATOR 
SAYS ACCEPTING TOBACCO FIRM'S $125,000 CONTRIBUTION HELPED HIM BEAT INCUMBENT, 
AND VOWS IT WON'T EASE HIS OPPOSITION TO SMOKING. 
</P>

<P>
 If the state Assembly takes up campaign finance reform again, Assemblyman 
Steven T. Kuykendall (R-Rancho Palos Verdes) admits that he might be singled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have taken what is the largest single contribution to an individual 
Assembly candidate, except for maybe Willie Brown," said Kuykendall, who was 
sworn in Monday as the assemblyman in the 54th District, which includes the 
Long Beach, Signal Hill, Palos Verdes Peninsula and San Pedro. Campaign reform 
would limit the size of contributions to state Assembly and Senate campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the waning days of the campaign, Kuykendall accepted a $125,000 check from 
tobacco giant Philip Morris even though he is on record as supporting 
anti-smoking legislation.  
</P>
<P>
 It might look like a contradiction. But this is how the political system 
works, Kuykendall says. 
</P>
<P>
 A more polished politician might be coy about it, but Kuykendall freely admits 
that accepting the money was a pragmatic move that may have helped him defeat 
incumbent Betty Karnette by 597 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Kuykendall, an ex-Marine and mortgage banker, is facing threats of a 
recall launched by Sacramento Democrats. The state party has already filed a 
complaint over the contribution with the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, there's been little protest beyond Sacramento Democrats. 
Kuykendall and his supporters dismiss the complaint as frivolous and doubt that 
a recall will go anywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that he's always going to to have to deal with. But I'd rather 
accept the check and be the winner with controversy than be the loser," said 
Republican consultant Tom Shortridge, president of Bear Republic Political 
Services in Redondo Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Even anti-smoking groups say they are confident Kuykendall won't be beholden 
to the tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect we are going to be working with him," said Paul Knepprath spokesman 
for the American Lung Assn. in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that pragmatism and ideology have clashed for 
Kuykendall. Elected to the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council as a "read-my-lips, 
no-new-taxes" conservative, he soon found himself justifying tax increases as a 
way to resolve the city's fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He voted for a utility tax, which the council passed last year, and supported 
a parcel tax, which narrowly lost when it was put on the ballot in 1992. With 
the city in need of new revenue, Kuykendall suggested a referendum to ask 
residents if they wanted to hand control of the city over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of ideology, but whether a locally controlled city 
government can survive or not," he said at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposal went nowhere, but did get people talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a businessman, he had a way of saying 'Look at this problem or we'll be in 
bankruptcy,' " former Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said.  
</P>
<P>
 And Kuykendall's supporters say that voters have little if any resentment over 
the Philip Morris contribution. Kuykendall notes that the tobacco giant has a 
number of subsidiaries, including real estate and food products. 
</P>
<P>
 "That company has got a lot more at stake than whether or not they sell 
cigarettes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And ironically, it could be the Philip Morris contribution that ensures that 
he backs anti-smoking legislation while in Sacramento. Otherwise, opponents 
could gain even more fodder for a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to be dumb enough to vote tobacco," said Shortridge, the 
Republican consultant. "I don't think he owes them anything."

GUN RANGE OKD DESPITE OPPOSITION FROM POLICE; COMPTON: CHIEF SAYS IT MAY BRING 
MORE GUNS INTO THE COMMUNITY. MAYOR CALLS VENTURE 'A GOOD IDEA.'

<P>
 The Compton City Council this week approved a new commercial shooting range 
despite protests from law enforcement officials who warned that the venture 
could increase gun sales and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Hourie L. Taylor had urged the council to reject the proposal by 
City Clerk Charles Davis and two business owners to open the gun range at 1316 
N. Long Beach Blvd., next door to a gun shop. The city's Planning Commission 
also rejected the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed shooting range "appears to be more detrimental than beneficial to 
the community," Taylor wrote in a letter to the council. "The Police Department 
is profoundly concerned with the possession and use of handguns by the public 
at large." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members, who unanimously supported the project, said there is no 
evidence the range will contribute to an increase in crime. They also contended 
that the range will be a welcome addition to the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a right to fire weapons in a confined area," said Mayor Omar 
Bradley, who owns a gun. "It's just a good idea all around." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has fueled longstanding concerns about the presence of guns in 
Compton. Compton was the first in the state to ban the possession and sale of 
assault weapons after a man armed with an AK-47 assault rifle gunned down five 
elementary school children in Stockton in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said murders declined in the city after state and local gun 
restrictions were passed.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the year in which the Compton City Council passed the weapons ban, 
there were 84 homicides, the highest in five years. Police officials say the 
number of homicides has fallen every year since the ban. In 1993, the last full 
year for which figures are available, the number of murders in Compton had 
dropped to 62. Figures were unavailable for the number of deaths related to 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Police Capt. Steven M. Roller said officials are worried that a new 
gun range may reverse that downward trend and bring an increase in other 
violent crimes involving handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a location that sells weapons and a place where you can 
shoot them, that brings more weapons into the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Betty Howe said the gun range is not a suitable business 
along Long Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most gun ranges are located in an industrial area, not a main thoroughfare," 
Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the city clerk, contends that the city will be safer if gun owners have 
a place to practice away from residential neighborhoods. "Maybe some innocent 
people won't get hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Yvonne Arceneaux, who said she favors gun controls, supported the 
range. Arceneaux said she is concerned about an increase in crime in Compton 
but believes a shooting range will have little impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Arceneaux said weapons have been sold at the nearby gun store for more than 26 
years and will continue to be sold there even if the range is not built. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is going to buy a gun, I thought gun practice might be a good 
idea," Arceneaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 shooting range will have 21 booths -- 19 for handgun use and two 
for rifle use. Instruction in gun safety will be offered, said one of the 
partners, Michael Virgilio, who also owns the gun shop next door. The other 
partner in the shooting range is Elizabeth Harlan. Virgilio said he plans to 
eventually move the gun shop into the building that will house the shooting 
range.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be the only gun range open to the public in Compton. The Police 
Department has a six-stall gun range at its station on Willowbrook Avenue. A 
shooting range at the Evans Security Academy on El Segundo Boulevard is 
restricted to gun owners taking mandatory firearms classes and to people 
training to become security guards, owner Louis Evans said.

GARDENING PROGRAM HELPS RESIDENTS GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An urban gardening program has taken root at the county's Carmelitos public 
housing project in North Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Project residents recently pledged their help in cleaning up an empty lot and 
replacing it with individual gardening plots and a fruit tree orchard. They 
also set aside land for county officials to train residents in landscape work. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they are especially excited about the project's potential to 
provide job training. They hope to eventually offer training in landscaping, 
operating greenhouses and installing irrigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Community approval of the program was crucial, organizers said.  
</P>
<P>
 They said resident support will allow planners to put together a design in 
time for a groundbreaking ceremony scheduled in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to all this is that it's resident driven," said 4-H coordinator Ray 
Grabinski, who works for the Cooperative Extension Program, an agricultural 
education arm of the county. "Part of the problem of living in a housing 
project is the lack of a sense of ownership. That's one of the values of a 
gardening project." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials think the program will help make the housing project more 
attractive and will bring residents together. Children in the project's 
after-school 4-H club have tended their own gardens since September. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's gardens "make our community look pretty," said 11-year-old 
Catrice Bydon, a member of the 4-H club. "I don't mind getting dirty, as long 
as it's for my community." 
</P>
<P>
 In two colorful 4-by-8-foot patches, Catrice and other project youngsters have 
planted and tended to vegetables and flowers, learning the value of food 
production and preparation, said Brenda McDuffie, who runs the after-school 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 County organizers say the larger plot across the street from the children's 
gardens can do more than teach agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can grow from here," said gardening program director Rachel Mabie, a 
University of California urban horticulture adviser who works for the 
Cooperative Extension Program. "There will be plenty of land left over to do 
landscaping in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Once individual plots are assigned to residents, perhaps by early next year, 
Mabie and other organizers will watch to see if the gardens improve diets and 
bring residents together. If successful, the program may be duplicated at other 
county housing projects in East Los Angeles and Lomita.

 Some residents near Drake Park will be keeping a close eye on a new neighbor 
who is due to arrive this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Fehr bought a deteriorating 1905 Victorian house on Locust Avenue from 
the city and plans to move it about 10 blocks to the Drake Park Historic 
District, where some of the city's founding families lived.He plans to restore 
it to its original condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he will live in the vintage home, but some of his future neighbors 
are a little leery. Fehr originally had planned to use it as a home for 
recovering alcoholics and drug addicts. Fehr is co-owner of the Amends Center 
of Long Beach on Daisy Avenue, which houses about 40 people who are recovering 
from substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what he says, but he can legally do whatever he wants to do once he's 
there," said Elisa Trujillo, president of the Friends of Drake Park, a 
neighborhood improvement group. "We'll wait and see what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the city cannot stop Fehr from converting the house to a 
residential care facility as long as he has no more than six clients, said 
Eugene J. Zeller,acting planning and building director. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the house move last week after Fehr said he planned 
to live there. STEVE EAMES

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH GATE; AZALEA FESTIVAL DATE WON'T BE MOVED TO MAY 
</P>

<P>
 Mariachis won't be competing with azaleas after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously decided against moving the 30-year-old Azalea 
Festival from March to May and making it part of a Cinco de Mayo celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the council has scrapped plans altogether for a city-sponsored Cinco 
de Mayo celebration, bowing to concerns it would shortchange other ethnic 
groups in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy with the council's decision to keep our festival," said 
Mildred Ward, 75, this year's Azalea queen. "I love mariachis and Spanish 
stuff, but I don't think it should rob the city of our traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival -- azalea is the city's official flower -- honors women over 60 
and includes the selection of a queen and her court. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the council discussed organizing a Cinco de Mayo festival to 
recognize the city's predominantly Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, city staff members recommended incorporating the festival into a 
celebration of Cinco de Mayo, which commemorates the anniversary of the Mexican 
victory over the French in the city of Puebla on May 5, 1862. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cinco de Mayo is hardly celebrated in Mexico, it is an important 
holiday for Americans of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already holds a carnival on Sept. 16, the Mexican independence day. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to allocate $5,000 toward the Azalea Festival 
organizing committee. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEBELLO; ORANGE COUNTY FISCAL CRISIS FELT IN HEAVILY 
INVESTED CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EAMES and JOHN D. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's growing financial crisis has created anxiety among Montebello 
officials, who are trying to determine the status of $47 million that the city 
has invested in the county's troubled investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been huddling to figure out how to deal with the county's 
decision this week to seek federal bankruptcy protection. Their most pressing 
concern is whether they can pull out about $25 million from the pool to meet a 
Dec. 31 deadline to pay off some city bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still optimistic that the county will make that payment," City 
Administrator Richard Torres said. "We're extremely concerned, but we're not 
panicking yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello is one of about 180 government agencies -- Orange County, cities, 
schools and special districts -- that have pooled $7.42 billion in the 
county-run investment fund. Before the crisis, their holdings were worth $20 
billion. Orange County officials reported last week that the pool lost $1.5 
billion in value -- about 20% of what investors had put up -- because of a 
risky investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's investment strategists used the pool as collateral to borrow more 
than $12 billion in short-term loans to buy long-term bonds that were paying 
higher interest rates. But interest rates on the long-term bonds dropped while 
those on the short-term loans rose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said the city has had money in the Orange County investment pool for 
most of the 5 1/2 years he has been city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw it as an absolutely safe investment that offered the best return we 
could get for our money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $47 million that Montebello has in the Orange County pool represents 60% 
of its $78-million investment portfolio. The city has $21 million in 
certificates of deposit and $8 million in the state investment pool, Torres 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello's $32-million operating budget includes $3.8 million in income from 
investments. Torres said he did not know how the Orange County crisis would 
affect those earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Art Payan said he was concerned because that $3.8 million pays for a lot 
of city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this moment we don't know what this means," he said. "We've been told 
(recently) that as long as the municipalities and school districts don't make a 
run on the pool, everything will be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then they filed Chapter 9 (seeking bankruptcy court protection), and we 
don't know what that means. There are so many unknowns at this time."

COVER STORY; A WORKABLE SOLUTION; EDUCATION-JOBS PROGRAM STEERS 'AT-RISK' YOUTH 
AWAY FROM CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMELYN CRUZ LAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The odds were stacked sky-high against Melvin Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12 he began stealing cars, cutting classes and hanging out with a North 
Long Beach gang. By 14 he was convicted of receiving stolen property and placed 
on probation after police found him riding a missing bicycle. At 16 he wound up 
in youth camp after ditching school and getting involved in a shoplifting 
incident, a violation of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many "at-risk" youths, Holmes seemed caught in an endless downward spiral 
with escalating consequences. But earlier this year, Holmes was given a chance 
to break the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined a new program started by the Long Beach Unified  
</P>
<P>
 School District for youths expelled from school or recently released from 
youth camp. Participants are offered a job and a chance to continue school. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight months, Holmes attended classes in the morning to earn credits 
toward graduation. In the afternoon, he worked as ajanitor in an elementary 
school, his first job. He had to dress appropriately, arrive promptly and 
follow instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 The discipline that he learned on the job carried over to the classroom. He 
began attending classes regularly and doing his homework. Gradually, his grades 
began to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes, a tall, soft-spoken youth who is now 17, said his life has been turned 
around. "If it wasn't for the program, I would have ended up in camp again or 
somewhere worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials started the program early this year in response to a surge in the 
number of student expulsions. The number of students being expelled in Long 
Beach tripled in the past year from 58 to 173, partly the result of new laws 
requiring districts to expel students who are caught carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials were concerned that the tougher policies were shortsighted -- 
that kicking problem youths off campus and onto the streets simply encouraged 
them to commit more crimes and become more involved in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once students are expelled or drop out of school, chances are good they will 
be deprived of more than just an education. Dropouts are three times as likely 
as high school graduates to be arrested, and six times as likely to become 
single parents, according to a recent study by the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also wanted to set up a system to encourage youths who have recently 
been released from youth camp to resume their education. More than half of the 
minors sentenced to such camps are rearrested within two years of their 
release, according to a youth authority study. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Long Beach program gives at-risk youngsters incentives to stay in 
school. For instance, students on probation must report regularly to school and 
their assigned jobs or risk being sent back to camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the program also provides counseling sessions to help students deal with 
personal and family problems, and insists on heavy parental involvement. 
Parents are required to attend meetings and therapy sessions, and are asked to 
make sure their child attends classes regularly and does assigned homework. An 
on-site probation officer also keeps a close eye on participants who have been 
released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths participate in the program for a semester or up to a full school year, 
depending on the length of their expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial results have been encouraging. Since the program began in February, 
about 80% of the participants have completed their courses. Many have returned 
to regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say at this point it's a cure-all and it's going to solve 
everything, but it's a step in the right direction," said school board member 
Ed Eveland, who proposed the comprehensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes was one of the first students to sign up. He joined shortly after his 
release from youth camp in Malibu earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his classmates, Holmes says he got into trouble because of low 
self-esteem. "I didn't have faith in myself that I could do certain things," he 
said. "I felt I wasn't as smart as everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 So he cut classes, got into fights, started hanging out with the wrong crowd. 
He said he also felt distant from his strict mother and his father, a truck 
driver who often was on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents, Floyd and Shenovea Holmes, said school officials did not tell 
them that their son was having trouble until it was too late. When officials 
finally called, they said, Melvin was already facing expulsion for getting into 
frequent fights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new program, the parents said, they noticed teachers, counselors and 
probation staff "really take the time to sit down and talk to the kids about 
their problems." Shenovea Holmes said she occasionally received calls from 
Melvin's teacher to let her know how her son was doing in class. "They really 
show concern," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 20 students filed into Room 4 at Benjamin F. Tucker School to 
begin a new semester. The class members had been expelled or sent to camp for 
various offenses from truancy to assault and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of class where students, during a recent discussion, 
identified the number 187 with the penal code section for murder, rather than 
with the ballot proposition to cut off social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the first few weeks, students tested the teacher's patience with 
unexcused absences. Some wore baggy pants, earrings and bandannas -- items 
forbidden by the classroom dress code -- because they can signify gang 
affiliation. Daniel, a smooth-talking 17-year-old with a B average, wore gang 
colors to class. A new student was reduced to tears by her classmates' teasing 
and taunting. By month's end, one student had dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are children that people have given up on," a school employee said. 
</P>
<P>
 But teacher Lynn Wilson doesn't believe in giving up. She has been teaching 
at-risk children in Los Angeles County for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's frustrating," Wilson said. "One day you think you're getting 
through to a student and the next you discover he has been pulled out of your 
grasp again." 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Compton, Wilson claims a special connection with the 
children she teaches. She describes how some of her relatives still live in 
housing projects in Los Angeles, and that she has helped children there. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a seasoned maestro, Wilson carefully orchestrates her approach, 
alternating between gentle nudges and swift reprimands. But throughout she 
focuses on the positive and spends much of her time encouraging the students, 
trying to build their confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will never hear me put you down," she told her students during a recent 
session. "I want to encourage you to be whatever you want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a couple of months, the message seems to sink in for many in the class. 
Students slowly begin to warm up to the idea of attending classes, doing 
homework and having goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want that structure in their lives," says Bill Jordan, a Los Angeles 
County probation officer. "Even the hardest-core kid still wants that, still 
needs that. And they need that personal touch, to feel that someone really 
cares about them." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, students work on individual assignments. They focus on 
subjects they need to graduate. Then they head out to various jobs ranging from 
picking up trash to planting trees for the city of Long Beach, the school 
district and nonprofit organizations. The district received a $150,000 federal 
grant to fund the job-training part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of each semester, students receive a stipend of $75 for their work. 
In addition, they are taught how to prepare for job interviews, fill out 
applications and write resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to make a complete turnaround," said Paul E. Scranton Jr. 
project coordinator with the Los Angeles County Office of Education, which has 
jurisdiction over expelled students. "Supply an academic setting that's safe 
and productive, a job that gives them responsibility and makes them 
accountable. You put all those things in place so hopefully that youngster can 
transition back in the system and do well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 George Lopez, 17, who was expelled for punching another student, says the 
program has helped him realize he needed an education to avoid doing menial 
jobs for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 He had cut classes, losing credits needed for graduation. Now he's trying to 
catch up. He spends his afternoons in class hunched over a wooden table working 
out algebraic equations, simplifying fractions and writing essays. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, all he can think of is finishing the program so he can go back to 
regular classes. "You're kind of isolated here," he says. "You're away from all 
your friends." 
</P>
<P>
 He also says his job -- sorting paper in the mornings for a recycling program 
-- is boring. He hopes to become a diesel-truck mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students in the program decide they want to do more with their lives, 
said Glen Goddard, director of operations at the Conservation Corps of Long 
Beach, a local nonprofit organization that provides jobs for some of the 
students. "Some come up to me and say, 'Hey, I don't want to be doing this for 
the rest of my life. I want to do something better.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the teacher, says the program offers students a chance to turn things 
around. But it can't change the dismal reality of the streets -- the guns, the 
gangs, the violence -- that affect so many young lives. Some youths still have 
a hard time making it, even after completing the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She spoke of a former student who completed the program and moved to San Diego 
after receiving a scholarship from a Christian school. A probation officer 
offered him a place to stay in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngster seemed to do well at first but quit school after a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tried to fit in," said the probation officer, who asked that his name not 
be used. "But he couldn't leave L.A. behind. He was in a totally alien world. 
He wasn't used to seeing foxes and birds in the back yard. He was afraid of 
this house because of all the windows. Every time he heard some noise, he 
thought it was gunfire. He would keep his lights on at night." 
</P>
<P>
 For Melvin Holmes, however, the future already seems brighter. He was recently 
taken off probation and is currently attending adult school to earn his high 
school diploma. He plans to go on to vocational school to study computer 
repair.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know now I have what it takes to succeed," he said. "I'm back on track."

POLY HIGH PLACES SIX PLAYERS ON TIMES' SOUTH COAST TEAM; FOOTBALL: JACKRABBITS' 
SELECTIONS ARE LED BY QUARTERBACK TOLER, THE ONLY REPEAT SELECTION FROM 1993 
ALL-STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was business as usual for the Long Beach Poly football team this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackrabbits, a perennial Southern Section power, completed the type of 
season that has become all too familiar to their opponents over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 They finished 10-2, won a share of the Moore League title and reached the 
Division I quarterfinals before suffering a 7-0 loss to Los Alamitos. Their 
record was the best of any team in the South Coast region this season. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems only fitting that the Jackrabbits lead the selections to The 
Times' 1994 South Coast all-star team. Poly has six players on the first team 
and three on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackrabbits are represented on the first team by defensive linemen Taeao 
Salausa and Junior Amitoelau, linebacker Jerry Sprewell, defensive back Cedric 
Gay, offensive lineman Alex Maliga and quarterback Rob Toler. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Jordan placed three players on the first team and four on the 
second and San Gabriel Valley League co-champion Paramount had three on the 
first and three on the second. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 13 schools represented on the first and second squads. The only 
repeat first-team selection is Toler. 
</P>
<P>
 The only juniors on the first team are kicker Marcelino Herrera of Paramount 
and linebacker Michael Balloue of Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches, all of whom were asked 
to participate, and a poll of Times sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Players named to the 23-player first team, along with their parents and 
coaches, will be guests of The Times at an awards brunch at 9 a.m. Sunday at 
the Cerritos Sheraton. The winners of the South Coast back, lineman and coach 
of the year awards will be announced at the brunch. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the all-stars: OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Haywood (Cerritos, receiver) -- An integral member of a high-powered 
passing attack, the 6-foot and 180-pound Haywood led the South Coast with 72 
receptions for more than 1,200 yards and 15 touchdowns. He also returned a punt 
for a touchdown and had an interception on defense. He has been recruited by 
USC, San Diego State and Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Walsh (St. Anthony, receiver) -- The 5-11 and 180-pound had 60 catches 
for 836 yards and three touchdowns to spark St. Anthony to a 9-3 record and 
berth in the Division IX quarterfinals. He has been recruited by Colorado, 
Illinois and New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Morris (Paramount, lineman) -- One of the biggest factors behind 
Paramount's success on offense was the blocking it received from the 6-3, 
269-pound Morris. A dominating blocker at the point of attack with exceptional 
quickness, he was also a standout on the defensive line for a Paramount team 
that finished 9-3 and reached the Division II quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Garcia (St. John Bosco, lineman) -- Another solid blocker is the 6-2, 
265-pound Garcia, who helped lead the Braves into the Division I playoffs. A 
two-time All-Del Rey League selection, he is also regarded as one of the top 
college prospects in the South Coast. Among the list of colleges recruiting him 
are Colorado, Washington, Colorado State and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Maliga (Long Beach Poly, lineman) -- On a first-team offensive line that 
averages nearly 275 pounds, Maliga is the biggest by far at 6-3 and 330. An 
All-Moore League selection, he is considered a top college prospect having been 
recruited by Pacific 10 Conference teams such as Rose Bowl-bound Oregon, Oregon 
State, Washington and Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Brown (Long Beach Jordan, lineman) -- It was a milestone year for 
Jordan, which won a playoff game for the first time since 1947, finished at 8-4 
and reached the Division I quarterfinals. The 6-4, 275-pound Brown played no 
small role in the team's success. He was regarded as the top blocker on a 
potent offensive team. 
</P>
<P>
 David Stamper (St. Anthony, lineman) -- Perhaps the top two-way player on The 
Times' team, the 6-2, 230-pound Stamper was regarded as one of the premier 
all-around players in the Camino Real League. He has been recruited by 
California, New Mexico and Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Toler (Long Beach Poly, quarterback) -- Toler's statistics -- 1,700 yards 
passing, 15 touchdowns and four interceptions -- told only part of his story. 
The 6-2, 185-pound quarterback became a team leader, guiding Poly to a 20-4 
record the last two seasons. Toler was named Moore League most valuable 
offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Fletcher (Paramount, back) -- It is anyone's guess where Paramount 
would have finished without the play of the 5-11, 185-pound Fletcher. A 
quarterback who is listed as a running back, he rushed for 1,318 yards and 18 
touchdowns in only 110 carries and passed for 1,126 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Demond Winston (Artesia, back) -- For sheer running ability, you would be 
hard-pressed to find a better back than the 5-7, 160-pound Winston. He finished 
with 1,844 yards rushing and 27 touchdowns in only 129 carries. He is also a 
good receiver who had two touchdown receptions in Artesia's loss to Bloomington 
in the Division VIII quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 LeJuan Gibbons (Long Beach Jordan, back) -- Gibbons is one of the fastest 
backs in the state, ranking among California's best in the 100-meter dash. He 
rushed for 1,162 yards and 12 touchdowns in only 107 carries, including eight 
runs that covered 60 or more yards. He has been recruited Washington, Arizona, 
Tennessee and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcelino Herrera (Paramount, kicker) -- At 5-10 and 165 pounds, Herrera also 
played an important role in Paramount's success. He made seven of nine 
field-goal attempts, including a 56-yarder for his team's only points in a 21-3 
loss to Quartz Hill in the Division II quarterfinals. He also made 38 of 40 
extra points. DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Faagata (Long Beach Jordan, lineman) -- The 6-3, 255-pound Faagata 
always seemed to show up in the opponents' backfield. He earned the reputation 
as a big-play pass rusher with 12 tackles for losses, including four 
quarterback sacks, to spark the Jordan defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Taeao Salausa (Long Beach Poly, lineman) -- The 6-3, 230-pound Salausa was a 
dominant player. A difficult player to block, he finished with 12 quarterback 
sacks and a fumble recovery. If he improves his work in the classroom, major 
colleges will come calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Amitoelau (Long Beach Poly, lineman) -- The 6-2, 280-pound Amitoelau 
ranked among the team leaders with 12 quarterback sacks and three fumble 
recoveries to propel a fierce pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Davelle Gladney (Dominguez, lineman) -- Gladney, a 5-11, 235-pound lineman, 
helped lead his team into the Division II playoffs. He earned accolades for his 
pass-rushing ability and ranked among team leaders in quarterback sacks and 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Sprewell (Long Beach Poly, linebacker) -- He wasn't the biggest player 
on Poly's defensive unit at 6-foot and 190 pounds, but it was difficult to 
judge by the way he played. Sprewell was credited with three fumble recoveries, 
two interceptions, four quarterback sacks, a blocked punt and forced three 
other fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Balloue (Dominguez, linebacker) -- He is the youngest member of the 
first team and one of the smallest at 5-10 and 175 pounds. But there is a good 
reason Dominguez Coach Willie Donerson calls Balloue the best linebacker he has 
coached in 11 years at the school. Balloue had 89 unassisted tackles and 
recovered three fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Dempsey (Lakewood, linebacker) -- One of the best all-around athletes on 
the team is the 6-2, 215-pound Dempsey, who helped guide the Lancers to a share 
of the Moore League title with Jordan and Poly. A solid pass rusher, Dempsey is 
also an all-league baseball player and a college prospect in both sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Tapia (St. John Bosco, linebacker) -- Playing in the Del Rey League, 
probably the strongest league in Southern California, the 5-11, 225 Tapia made 
a lasting impression on the competition. The all-league selection had 164 
unassisted tackles, 10 sacks and forced 10 fumbles during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Perkins (Lakewood, defensive back) -- A talented two-way player, the 5-9, 
185-pound Perkins earned his way onto the defensive unit with his reputation as 
a premier coverage back. He had two interceptions and also propelled Lakewood 
on offense by rushing for more than 800 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedrick Gay (Long Beach Poly, defensive back) -- It would be difficult to find 
a more active safety than the 6-3, 185-pound Gay. He led the South Coast in 
interceptions with seven and averaged more than five tackles a game. He has 
been recruited by Oregon, Washington, Fresno State and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan DeBie (Valley Christian, defensive back) -- One of the most versatile 
players on the squad is the 6-2, 190-pound DeBie. He had three interceptions at 
strong safety, caught 30 passes for 308 yards as a wide receiver in only eight 
games and averaged 45.25 yards a punt.

 OUTNUMBERED 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada receiver Wyatt Boatright isn't ready to declare the Matadores the 
favorite when top-seeded La Mirada plays host to second-seeded Bloomington in 
the Southern Section Division VIII football final Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the senior predicts a high-scoring game against the Bruins, who have been 
averaging 66.5 points a game. Bloomington (13-0) has scored at least 60 points 
10 times, with a high of 86. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were held to a season-low point total in a 34-21 playoff victory 
Saturday night over Laguna Hills, but still set a national high school record 
for most points in a season with 832. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 35 to 40 points will win it," Boatright said. "We're top seeded but 
we're the underdogs. Hopefully, we can tire them out and contain them." 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada (13-0) held on for a 7-6 semifinal victory over Norte Vista on 
Friday. Norte Vista missed two field goals in the final three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Nicolini blocked a 30-yard attempt by Ryan Engen with 2 minutes, 14 
seconds left. Engen also missed a 25-yard kick with 22 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory avenged a 25-20 defeat to Norte Vista in the first round of the 
1993 playoffs and put La Mirada, which won the 1993 Division VII title, in a 
championship game for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't forget about last year's loss, but we got lucky big time," 
Boatright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Palumbo connected with Mark Rudigar on a 19-yard touchdown pass and Eric 
Martinez kicked the extra point to give the Matadores a 7-6 lead late in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada, which had scored no fewer than 24 points before Friday, failed to 
score three times inside the five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is gunning for us, but we dodged a bullet," Coach John Mele said. 
"We played well but we didn't take advantage. Now we have to figure out how to 
stop Bloomington." PYRAMID OF SUCCESS 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State is 3-0 in the Pyramid, the $22-million on-campus arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49er men's basketball team christened the Pyramid with victories over 
Detroit Mercy and College of Notre Dame last week. The women's volleyball team 
defeated Montana in its first contest in the Pyramid in an NCAA second-round 
playoff match Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A standing-room-only crowd of 5,021 -- the largest on-campus athletic crowd in 
school history -- was on hand for the first event in the Pyramid on Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Mike Atkinson scored 21 points to lead Long Beach over Detroit 
Mercy, 71-64, in a nationally televised game on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty exciting considering we've played in the Gold Mine for so many 
years," Atkinson said about the 1,900-seat gym built in 1954. "It's nice the 
school lived up to the promise they made to build the Pyramid. Hopefully, we'll 
bring people in to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in the 77,000-square-foot structure, which is 180 feet tall at its 
highest point, was not an easy adjustment Atkinson and the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson said he was posting too low in the key in the first half because of 
unfamiliarity with the Pyramid court. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the Gold Mine, there was this orange line I always ran to," Atkinson said. 
"There aren't as many lines on the floor at the Pyramid so I didn't know where 
I was. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson didn't have trouble finding the basket, making seven of 11 shots from 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could not be said of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers missed all 13 of their three-point shots and made only two shots 
farther than 10 feet in the Pyramid, the world's largest space frame building 
and one of only three pyramid buildings in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach fared better in its 96-68 victory over College of Notre Dame, a 
Division II team from Belmont in Northern California, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge background difference compared to our old gym," Atkinson said. 
"But overall, it's a great facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which shot 49% from the field, made its first two three-point 
shots and four of 12 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman forward Akeli Jackson scored a game-high 17 points, made seven of 
eight shots and had seven rebounds. Junior point guard Rasul Salahuddin had 12 
points, nine assists, and a game-high six steals in 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (2-1) suffered its first loss of the season Tuesday, losing to Cal 
State Northridge, 64-58, on the road. The 49ers are idle until a Dec. 21 home 
game against Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pyramid may be open, but construction is not complete. Portable concession 
stands were erected and many of the seats were benches on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49er women's volleyball team will play its Northwest Regional semifinal 
match Friday night against Hawaii at the Gold Mine. And the women's basketball 
team will play its home games at the Gold Mine until January. 
</P>
<P>
 That has not sat well with the members of the women's basketball team. 
Athletic Director Dave O'Brien said the men's program has outgrown the Gold 
Mine, necessitating the need to play in the Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's program has sold more than 1,500 season tickets while less than 300 
have been purchased for the women. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people aren't coming for just the game," freshman Sarah Davis said. 
"They're coming to the Pyramid. I think we can get a lot of people too. We can 
get just as many people as the men get." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Michelle Esparza said the opportunity to play in the Pyramid was one of 
the reasons she transferred to Long Beach from Cal State Northridge this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me upset because this is just as exciting for me to be in the 
Pyramid sitting on the bench as it would if I were playing," Esparza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen Construction of San Diego loaned the building to the athletic 
administration for the inaugural game. Because no construction occurred over 
the weekend, Long Beach was allowed to schedule the men's basketball game 
against College of Notre Dame and the NCAA women's volleyball tournament match 
against Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building still belongs to (Nielsen)," Assistant Athletic Director Scott 
Cathcart said. "We don't even have the keys to the building." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach women's basketball team beat Loyola Marymount, 77-60, Tuesday 
to improve to 2-1 after a season-opening defeat against NCAA runner-up 
Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, coached by Glenn McDonald, a former Long Beach All-American, have 
four players from Lakewood and three from Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Gower of Lakewood was an All-Big West Conference second-team pick as a 
junior, averaging 15.8 points and 9.6 rebounds. The 6-foot-2 senior had a 
career-high 36 points in a 88-74 victory over Southern Utah and had a game-high 
27 points and 13 rebounds against Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior point guard Akia Hardy of Lakewood, who led the 49ers in steals and 
assists, and junior forward Kim Barfield of Lynwood are the other returning 
starters from last season's 11-17 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ja'net Davis is a junior from Lynwood and Toby Metoyer, a Lakewood High 
graduate, is sophomore transfer from Duquesne. Amy Heaton, a 6-1 freshman, was 
a two-time All-Moore League selection at Lakewood. PRACTICE TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Bell High has won City Section titles in volleyball, cross-country and 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles moved closer to their first City football title with a 27-7 victory 
over Manual Arts in a 3-A semifinal playoff game last week. Bell (10-3) plays 
Birmingham (6-5-1) in the final Friday night at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we wanted was to practice for four weeks after the regular season ended," 
Bell Coach Henry Santiago said. "Regardless if we win in the final or not, our 
goal was just to make it there. That was the hardest part." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinging to a 13-7 fourth-quarter lead, Bell scored two touchdowns within a 
five-minute span to secure its first berth in the championship since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a close game all the way, but we got some lucky plays down the line," 
Bell running back Vern Benard said. "Now we want to move forward and prove we 
can win it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Benard rushed for 142 yards in 18 carries, including a 79-yard touchdown run. 
Dicky Purcell, who had four receptions for 51 yards, and Gary Herrera, who had 
two catches for 60 yards, each scored a touchdown. BOWLING 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Ephriam scored three touchdowns and Corey Kelley scored two to lead 
Cerritos College to a 55-9 victory over Moorpark in the first Strawberry Bowl 
Saturday night at Cerritos College. Cerritos (8-3) scored three touchdowns in 
four minutes in the second quarter to race to a 35-0 halftime lead. The Falcons 
intercepted five passes and blocked two punts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach City College was shut out in the first half for the first time this 
season in a 31-9 defeat against host Bakersfield City in the Potato Bowl 
Saturday. Neo Aoga completed 18 of 40 passes for 228 yards and Patrick Norris 
had 75 yards in 19 carries for Long Beach (9-2). KIRBY LEE

<P>
 What's the point of going to school, if you have no time to be a student? 
</P>
<P>
 The thought must cross Joe Ponce's mind as he stands amid the din of UCLA's 
Cooperage cafeteria, wearing a blue work apron. 
</P>
<P>
 He loves to play basketball, and his student fees help keep the nearby rec 
center courts open. "But they close before I get off," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't have time to play anyway. After serving pizza and scrubbing pots, 
he's got studying to do and an early class the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Big deal, some say, he ought to learn the value of money. Working one's way 
through college is an honorable tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's tougher than ever. While the price of burgers and books has tripled 
in the past two decades, minimum wage has barely doubled. Students must put in 
longer hours just to tread water. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the relative decline of grant funding and the burden of ballooning 
educational costs -- UC Irvine fees, for example, are $4,049.50 for the year, 
more than six times the 1974 cost -- and it's easy to see why some students are 
sinking under the load. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many students say they would rather pay as they go -- and forgo running 
for student office, debating philosophy late into the night or playing 
basketball. Worried about their earning potential in an uncertain job market, 
they minimize debt by working long hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be a different ethic," says a UCLA graduate student who was a 
freshman in the early '80s. "Today, students are less concerned about a growing 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce, a 21-year-old English major and aspiring teacher, rushes to the 
cafeteria after class and works until 8:30 p.m., then drives to the one-bedroom 
apartment he shares with two others to study. The alarm rings too soon for an 8 
a.m. class. He takes three courses, a full load under UCLA's quarter system, 
logs 21 hours -- at $7.50 per -- in the cafeteria and wedges in six more as a 
tutor each week. He needs to work more, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce gets grants that cover most of his fees. But even though he scrimps and 
saves, bills outpace his income. So, like many of his peers, he has made up the 
difference with student loans -- $10,000 worth. And, when those weren't enough, 
he rang up $3,000 on plastic -- also a growing trend. 
</P>
<P>
 A junior, he is a little more than halfway to his degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many units I've got, or how many I've got to go. But I just 
want to get out," Ponce says in a tired voice swallowed by the clatter of the 
Cooperage. "I can't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 More comfortable with her lot is Christine Cabiling, a 19-year-old sophomore 
biology student at UCI. Cabiling, a full-time student who lives in an apartment 
adjacent to the campus, works 13 hours a week in the UCI student center's 
Anthill Bar and Grill and in P.V. Cues, a recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
 Her time behind the counters doesn't cut into her study time, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bosses on campus are really good about it," she says. "If you really have 
to study, they work your schedule around that. They put studying first." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabiling says she has heard, however, that off-campus bosses are not so 
forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that would be a different story," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabiling is one of many students whose family incomes are high enough to 
preclude financial aid, but who still feel the monetary pinch. She says she 
uses her income from her campus jobs to pay her utility bills and "other living 
expenses -- extra money for necessities like food and clothes and shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of UC undergraduates work, and their hours on the job have been 
steadily increasing. Since the UC President's Office began studying the trend 
in 1979, median hours have climbed more than 20%, to 17.6 per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten percent work more than 25 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Campuses nationwide report similar findings, says Arthur Levine, president of 
Columbia University's Teachers College, who has studied the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Public school officials are quick to point out that financial aid has risen 
along with fee increases. That tends to help the poorer students, but those 
from middle-class families receive only self-help aid -- loans and work-study 
-- not cash grants. As a result, students whose parents make $30,000 to $60,000 
work longer hours -- a median 18.8-hour week -- than their richer or poorer 
peers, according to the same UC study. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in such self-help aid has created a "perverse incentive" for 
colleges to raise tuition, says Patrick Callan, director of the California 
Higher Education Policy Center, an independent think tank in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, UCI's tuition increased nearly 10% from 1993-94.  
</P>
<P>
 "Colleges have been trying to justify raising tuition," he says. "They're not 
interested in hearing how tough it is for kids to go to school." 
</P>
<P>
 He also says colleges and universities have avoided studying the impact of 
work on students' intellectual and personal growth. "More and more, we are 
changing the ground rules without any discussion," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis Galligani, a UC assistant vice provost, says an upswing in 
graduation and retention rates suggests work habits are a non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "One would assume that we have more dropouts because of the economy," 
Galligani says. "But the data show that students are persisting and getting 
through." And, he adds, loans are available to qualified students who don't 
want to work. "It's an individual choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Many struggling students, particularly those at community colleges, say they 
would much rather keep their full-time jobs than cut back on their hours enough 
to qualify for financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren McDowell, 27, is studying criminology at Los Angeles Southwest College 
while working at Northrop. He attends classes in the morning, then drives a 
forklift from 4 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. "It's kind of hectic studying," he says. But 
financial aid is not an option. "I make too much money." 
</P>
<P>
 Margarete Allen, a Cal State Northridge graduate student, says she has noticed 
a growing work ethic among young people. She went straight to a job out of high 
school in 1964 and theorizes that, as women began trading home for the 
workplace, families came to accept, even to expect, that children would do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in high school, the students who worked were considered the 
boneheads -- not college material. Now they're all expected to work," she says. 
"It used to be that students were students. Now everybody does two things." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Mark Earhart. He does four. 
</P>
<P>
 He studies business administration at Cal State Northridge, works as a file 
clerk 25 hours a week at Kaiser hospital in Panorama City, has an internship 
with Fox TV and referees football games on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 What amounts to a 37-hour workweek has led to worse grades than he might have 
gotten otherwise, he says, but he will trade A's for the sense of security a 
job brings. Besides, he enjoys spending money. 
</P>
<P>
 Earhart wishes he had worked less and gone into debt to buy a full college 
experience at a private college, he says. Then quickly adds: "I guess it would 
depend on how long it would take to pay it off -- on how much I could have made 
when I got out. I didn't want that (debt) hanging over my head while I was 
trying to establish a career and a family." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hal Pruett, director of student psychological services at UCLA, has watched 
rising prices translate into higher stress on campus. Over the past 10 years, 
and particularly over the past five, complaints of depression, anxiety 
disorders, relationship problems and inability to concentrate have multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't come in saying, 'I'm working too much,' " he says, but it isn't 
hard to figure out. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also suffer from lack of sleep, either because they are too busy or too 
worried about deadlines or finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Time-management and stress-reduction techniques may help, but some anxieties 
persist. "At one time, students were confident that a job awaited them after 
graduation," Pruett says. "But now futures are uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
 As vice president of the National Sleep Foundation, Mary Carskadon knows where 
students find the time to do more and more. Although sleep deprivation has been 
linked to heart disease, automobile accidents, even the Exxon Valdez oil spill, 
busy students don't seem to worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Carskadon, a Brown University psychology professor, sees a macho attitude 
toward lack of sleep. "You never hear students brag about how late they slept 
or how much sleep they got," she says. "It does become a point of honor to be 
getting less." 
</P>
<P>
 But sacrificing sleep for studying may be a bad idea. When the body is in a 
"low ebb," such cognitive functions as memory operate at reduced capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 After a freshman year spent nodding off in early classes, Ponce tries to get 
at least five or six hours each night, at the expense of study time. 
</P>
<P>
 And his busy schedule ultimately does more than shave points off his GPA. It 
keeps him in school longer. "If I had more time to study, I would be a 
fourth-year senior, instead of a fourth-year junior," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts are uncertain how much work is too much. According to a national study 
by Alexander Astin, director of UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute, 
student performance slips slightly as work hours top 10 per week and clearly 
suffers with 20 or more on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Astin says those in the workplace for long hours score lower in everything 
from graduation rates to grade-point averages to satisfaction with the college 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, a number of studies, including Astin's, also indicate that students 
with a moderate work schedule, say 10 or fewer hours per week, do better than 
those who don't work at all. A part-time job, preferably on campus, can be a 
good thing, honing time-management skills and offering peer interaction -- "the 
single most important influence on a student," Astin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're hanging out with your peers a lot and they're talking about 
attending graduate school, you're going to be much more likely to attend 
yourself," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Astin study does not distinguish among types of jobs or types of peer 
interaction. It is unclear whether an on-campus job slinging burgers is better 
than an off-campus one. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Peters, 22, manages four restaurants on the campus of his alma mater, 
Stanford University. He never applied for financial aid, he says, because he 
thought his parents' income made him ineligible. But because they had two other 
children to educate, Peters had to help pay his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a college job as a restaurant manager was an invaluable experience, he 
says, offering a challenge that led to a career. "A lot of what you're learning 
here is how to deal with people, how to communicate your ideas," he says of his 
overall academic experience. "A job is just an addendum to your education." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he warns, some students get so carried away with work they forget why 
they're in college. "Especially with some of the professors well-connected with 
Bay Area entrepreneurs, you can find yourself with a lot of power at a young 
age, and the academic side kind of loses it," Peters says. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate teaching assistants at UCLA say work clearly interferes with some 
students' performances. To help, many allow student workers to switch to 
already full evening classes, leaving daytime classrooms cold and lonely. Some 
assistants also report giving failing students extensions on assignments -- or 
even passing grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than await the outcome of students' conflicting allegiances to work and 
school, the faculty of Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., adopted the 
Hamline Plan. It seeks to integrate student working experiences into lectures 
and discussions, leading to such course titles as "Cultural Perspectives in the 
Workplace," in the anthropology department, and "The Helping Professional at 
Work," taught by a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Jerry Greiner says the program, up and running for eight years, was 
designed to attract those who want a liberal arts education and a job. The 
students, he says, "aren't just interested in knowledge for knowledge's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 While the UC system isn't planning any curriculum changes, Regent Ward 
Connerly says, it is trying to create more student job opportunities, courting 
private business for internships and encouraging administrators to fill more 
campus jobs with students. The regents have also discussed raising admissions 
standards to reduce enrollment -- and the demand for financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, barring drastic change, many young people will continue their dual 
lives as students and employees. And whether work adds to or detracts from 
their college experience will depend on the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 For USC's Erin La Combe, 21, who gave sororities and football games a try but 
found them uninspiring, the chance to work is a blessing. Internships and 
research jobs have given her a jump on the career track. 
</P>
<P>
 But for UCLA junior Audrey Wong, 20, who was on her high school volleyball and 
track teams as well as the student council, a job in the Cooperage is a 
necessary evil. "I wish I could work less, but you have to pay those bills," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ponce would have liked more time for basketball and academics, the 
soon-to-be fifth-year senior is just grateful to be in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be in school and to be able to pay for everything, or, at least, 
borrow to pay for everything."

TIRELESS CRUSADER IS MAKING INROADS; COMMUNITY: SYLVIA CASTILLO IS DETERMINED 
TO REVIVE HER SOUTH-CENTRAL NEIGHBORHOOD FROM BLIGHT. AND HER EFFORTS ARE BEING 
RECOGNIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's 9 a.m. in Room 561-A at Los Angeles City Hall, and Sylvia Castillo is 
bustling, conferring, offering advice, checking names off lists in her armload 
of manila envelopes and keeping an eye on the door for newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the tense hearing last week before Associate Zoning 
Administrator John J. Parker was to ask for a crackdown on four motels along 
the Figueroa Corridor that neighbors believe are centers for prostitution and 
drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker hears not only from City Councilwoman Rita Walters, who requested the 
hearing, and Los Angeles Police Department vice division detectives, but also 
from residents of the South-Central Los Angeles neighborhood who are tired of 
crime and blight, fed up with the dirty needles and discarded condoms that 
litter their sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some don't speak English and few have been to City Hall before, but they are 
there thanks to Castillo and her team. 
</P>
<P>
 As associate director of the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment, Castillo laid the groundwork for the hearing, 
knocking on doors, meeting with residents to discuss their plight, and setting 
up transportation and directions right up to the door of Room 561-A. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of organizational work that Castillo does well -- so well that 
she has been named one of three outstanding grass-roots community leaders in 
the state by the California Wellness Foundation. Each of the winners -- 
Castillo, David Lewis of East Palo Alto and Gayle Zepeda of Redwood Valley -- 
will receive a California Violence Prevention Award of $25,000 today at a 
reception at the Claremont Hotel in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "As community leaders they represent the cutting edge of a community's 
conscience," says the award certificate. "Their goal is to create fundamental 
changes in the moral fiber of society."  
</P>
<P>
 Castillo, 42, believes the Community Coalition at 8500 Broadway is doing 
exactly that. Since its formation in 1990, the federally funded group -- whose 
members include churches, anti-drug organizations, schools and community groups 
-- has been working to reverse what members see as a drug and alcohol epidemic 
in South-Central Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have been extremely effective in reach-out activities as we try to rid 
the 9th council district of some of this blight," Walters says. "I'm delighted 
she has won. It's not easy to knock on doors in South-Central where people are 
very cautious. Sylvia has a very engaging personality -- she comes across as 
very credible and non-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to address the environment that fosters drug and alcohol 
addiction," says Castillo, who lives in an apartment in the area she serves. 
"That takes many forms." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as the motel hearing, for which she organizes community representatives 
and translates for some of them. After vice detectives describe the area as 
"blighted by the problems of prostitution and drug sales," Castillo is the 
lead-off speaker for the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you rent a room for $8 an hour and sell condoms for $1, you are aware of 
what kind of client you are attracting," she tells Parker. "This is not the way 
business should be conducted in our community -- this is not the Wild, Wild 
West. This would not be condoned in Beverly Hills and should not be condoned 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's decision on tougher regulation of the motels will come by early 
January. The coalition is hopeful for victory because similar hearings in the 
San Fernando Valley last spring resulted in much tighter conditions being 
imposed on the motels there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo looks at South-Central and sees a "once-thriving, working community 
with employers like B.F. Goodrich and U.S. Steel" that is now a vacuum.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many smart youngsters, teen-agers, out there, and they are 
outraged for very valid reasons, whether it is school bathrooms so filthy they 
can't be used or liquor stores with couches in the back alleys where alcoholics 
can congregate."  
</P>
<P>
 On the wall of her office is a huge map of South-Central and its liquor stores 
that is "really a big strategy chart," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dividing her time between desk work and neighborhoods, she has clocked 100,000 
city miles in her Honda Accord, equipped with cellular phone, pager and a 
laptop computer.  
</P>
<P>
 "You begin with folks who have a whole lot of commitment to protect their 
children," says Castillo, who is single. She rattles off her many activities 
with typical exuberance: the Rebuild South-Central Without Liquor Stores 
Campaign, HOPE (Helping Our Peers Evolve, a program for teen-agers), a 
youth-run graffiti removal business, Youth Empowered Through Action and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is just fabulous," says Thelma Dimancheff, a retired teacher who is 
involved with the Manual Arts High School Parents Patrol. "Without a blueprint, 
a ship goes round and round the ocean. Sylvia and the coalition have come out 
and helped us put together a plan to fight drugs and alcohol. They offered 
resources the parents didn't have. She has helped us set a direction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Setting direction comes almost naturally to Castillo, who grew up in Los 
Angeles. "My grandfather was a railroad organizer for the Southern Pacific, and 
there was a tradition of discussing politics at the dinner table." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Luis Castillo, was an aircraft worker and her mother, Minerva 
Castillo, "was just a mom" -- until the family moved to all-white Lakewood 
because of its good schools and experienced immediate prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Petitions were passed in the neighborhood, Castillo heard the word wetback for 
the first time, and she and her younger sisters were ostracized. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden my mother got politicized -- we were going to hold our 
ground. My sisters and I got dragged along to fair housing meetings at night, 
and eventually we got introduced to the United Farm Workers organizing 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation from Lakewood High School, Castillo helped develop the 
Chicana studies department at Cal State Long Beach and the Chicana Service 
Action Center in Downtown Los Angeles, which started one of the first programs 
in the country to serve battered Latinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually she got training as a licensed vocational nurse, because "community 
activism doesn't pay." 
</P>
<P>
 While working as a pediatric nurse in the late '80s, "patching together 
newborn babies who were crack exposed," she realized the impact of the drug 
epidemic. With longtime friend Karen Bass, she began to concentrate on 
full-time community organizing. She receives a salary from the Community 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass, executive director of the coalition, says she is particularly excited 
about Castillo's award because "when people come to South-Central, they are 
always looking for racial conflicts. Our group is African American and Latino. 
We're working together, and race relations get taken care of in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo and Bass see positive change taking place on many levels. "Los 
Angeles has 150 fewer liquor stores now," Bass says. "More than 200 were burned 
out and about 50 came back. In some places there are office buildings or 
Laundromats where liquor stores were. We believe this is a direct result of the 
work we've done. 
</P>
<P>
 "And a lot is due to Sylvia -- she is dedicated, committed and will not give 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo didn't know she had been nominated for the California Wellness 
Foundation's award when she got the telephone call from Crystal Hayling of the 
foundation. "I just wept," she says. "It was like getting a big hug. And then 
on top of that was the $25,000. Oh man, it was too much. I just couldn't 
speak!"  
</P>
<P>
 Castillo views the money as a double reward. "It acknowledges our work," she 
says, "and it will allow me to qualitatively improve my life. I'd like to have 
my own home, my own stable place to be from." 
</P>
<P>
 The money has no strings attached. "It's just pure recognition," Hayling says. 
"We're just saying, 'Good work, and keep it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo will certainly keep up her work. "I'm passionate about it," she says. 
"It almost sounds corny, but looking into the faces of people we serve keeps me 
inspired. I know we are going to turn this around."

LONG LIVE THE KING; YES, HE'S BEEN AWAY FOR A WHILE, BUT HE HASN'T BEEN 
FORGOTTEN. GIORGIO ARMANI -- MR. ARMANI -- SHOWS HOLLYWOOD WHO CAME FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRE GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Giorgio Armani sits in a white wooden folding chair inside a sound stage at 
Fox studios. It might as well be a director's chair, the way he controls the 
fitting session in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 One model is too short, he tells his aides in Italian. Another is too bosomy. 
A frowning, brainy-looking model may be unconventional, "but I like her," 
Armani says. Across the room, a brunette twirls on the fitting platform 
revealing extraordinarily beautiful legs to match an extraordinarily beautiful 
face. "Bella, bella," he says, and everyone around relaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Is perfection too much to ask for? Not if you're Mr. Armani, as he is 
respectfully called. And not when the audience for your fashion show is le tout 
Hollywood, as it was at Wednesday night's Fire & Ice Ball, a benefit for the 
Women's Cancer Research Clinic at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in his uniform of navy corduroy trousers, a long-sleeved T and brown 
bucks, Armani -- the ball's honorary chairman -- issues a stream of directives 
in preparation for the event. "Take out the shoulder pads." "Try a lower heel." 
He's unhappy with the volume created by a blouse over a gathered skirt. The 
volume is pumped down. 
</P>
<P>
 Armani's last official appearance in Los Angeles was eight years ago at a 
dinner and show at the Museum of Contemporary Art, "when I was doing more 
masculine styles," he says. As if anyone could forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, to wear Armani in the '80s was an exercise in restraint that changed 
the way men and women in Hollywood would dress forever. Understatement and the 
luxury of impeccable tailoring told the world you'd arrived in a more modern, 
though not necessarily less costly, style than sequins and rhinestones. 
</P>
<P>
 But since he's been away, challengers for the Hollywood-status-symbol crown 
have appeared. Such designers as Richard Tyler and Jil Sander have won fans 
with their distinctive versions of the tailored suit. And insiders say Calvin 
Klein has already made overtures to actresses who might attend the Academy 
Awards next year -- a ceremony once practically monopolized by Armani. 
</P>
<P>
 By taking center stage in a splashy, high-profile event like the Fire & Ice 
Ball, Armani is, in effect, reminding Hollywood who came first -- and ensuring 
that his reign as an important designer continues into the '90s. The trade 
publication Women's Wear Daily recently anointed him "the world's most 
successful designer," but how potent is Armani's message now? Even he 
acknowledges the realities of the way women dress today. And it's not always in 
a $2,000 Armani suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women mix different perfume," he says philosophically. And likewise, the 
impulse in the '90s is to shed the designer uniformity of the '80s. Armani is 
attuned to the impulses of fashion -- for both creative reasons and financial 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 After the death of business partner Sergio Galleotti in 1985, Armani took over 
the reins of the company's business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a mistake, he says in retrospect, to price his A/X line so high 
initially, since the point is to offer affordable Armani basics. By increasing 
volume, he's been able to lower the prices (jeans, once $75, now start at $45). 
</P>
<P>
 And although he is aghast at the revival of this season's obsession with 
fashion from the '40s (he calls retro "another word for a lack of ideas"), 
Armani is sensitive to the increasing desire by women to look, well, womanly 
again. He responded with a spring collection that was acclaimed for its 
femininity -- high heels, a bit of exposed tummy, the suggestion of a ruffle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good reviews were overshadowed, however, by a corruption scandal that swept 
through the creme de la creme of the Italian fashion world during the October 
shows in Milan. Government officials questioned Versace, Krizia, Missoni and 
Armani, among others, to determine if bribes had been paid to reduce tax 
payments. (No fines have been levied again Armani.) 
</P>
<P>
 "If something like that would have happened in Paris, no one would have heard 
a word about it," Armani says. "But in Italy, everyone has to talk, talk, talk. 
Sensationalize it." He reaches for an Italian newspaper and shows an article 
that blames jealousy and envy for the sensational media coverage of the 
inquiries, which have not been limited to the fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italy needs to recover from this. It is not an easy time. But we need to go 
on," he says with a gravity that hints at why director Robert Altman excluded 
Armani from his fashion farce, "Ready to Wear (Pret-a-Porter)." 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I was too serious," says the designer, looking quite pleased. And he 
is serious, so serious about work, for example, that he works through sickness, 
hunger, exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last 10 years I've spent a lot of time and a lot of energy 
increasing the size of the business. And as a result," he says, "I've neglected 
some of my dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Armani is anxious to design a line of home furnishings, for example. And he 
recently designed costumes for an opera by Mozart. "I would love to do a 
musical," he says. Or, even better, a film about fashion that would depict the 
struggle for creative success. 
</P>
<P>
 Just walking onto the Fox sound stage was, he says, a very moving experience. 
Not the sets so much, but the "big, empty space" of the sound stage, where "you 
could create anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Armani's creation is a replica of his fashion theater in Milan -- from the 
plexiglass runway lit from below to the quilted white bleacher seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The models' hair, though, is hopelessly indigenous -- the sort of 
surfer-girl-meets-love-child coiffure that L.A. women are so loath to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer short hair," says Armani, explaining that he'd planned to have the 
long-haired models wear their locks pulled up. "But here, looking at these 
young girls with their hair long and loose, I want them to feel natural." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Armani, who is 60, says maturity has helped him relax his exacting standards. 
"I look at things in a more tender way now than I used to," he says. The 
fittings are a case in point. "The models want to work with you, to give you 
what you want. . . . It can be very humiliating for a girl to be told something 
is wrong with her. It's not her, it's just that the clothes are not working on 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Armani still takes pride in directing the fittings ("most designers don't") 
and in the general calm that pervades an Armani show. "There is no time to 
waste on hysteria," he says, then allows that hysteria can be useful, even 
necessary, when it is critical that something be done in a very specific way. 
</P>
<P>
 One senses that Armani gets what he wants, without resorting to temper 
tantrums, by the force of his convictions. He refuses, for example, to use 
super-models in his shows or ad campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have always been stars. Like Suzy Parker," he says. "But not like we 
see today." Armani likes pretty "girls" who don't overpower the clothes -- 
which, of course, are the real stars. He dislikes vulgarity, nudity and 
enormous displays of cleavage. "It's too much," he says, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Much better, in Armani's view, for a woman to be mysterious. Such as? 
"Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman." 
</P>
<P>
 The last fitting complete, Armani breaks for lunch with Lee Radziwill, 
Armani's director of public affairs. He's anxious to try the food at a place 
he's never visited -- the restaurant at Emporio Armani.

A LIFE OF DOING IT HER WAY; BOOKS: DORIS LESSING'S STUBBORN RESISTANCE TO 
MISFORTUNE HAS TAKEN HER ON A REMARKABLE JOURNEY, WHICH SHE REVEALS IN HER NEW 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLOTTE INNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her newly published autobiography, "Under My Skin" (HarperCollins), Doris 
Lessing recalls an important scene from her childhood in Southern Rhodesia, now 
Zimbabwe, in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming home from playing in the bush, she stops short at the sight of her 
British immigrant parents sitting in front of the farmhouse they had built 
themselves. They are smoking, faces tense with money worries, gray and old 
before their time. 
</P>
<P>
 To the young Doris Lessing, they seem "intolerable." From this moment she 
rejects what they represent -- victimhood, illness, despair, a confining 
marriage -- and she repeats to herself a phrase that will become a lifelong 
mantra: "I will not." 
</P>
<P>
 This stubborn resistance to misfortune, and a tremendous will to live life on 
her own terms, has taken Lessing on a remarkable, often controversial journey 
far from the African bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades later, now living in London, she is a world-famous writer -- some say 
one of the greatest -- with more than 30 books of fiction, nonfiction and 
poetry to her name, all still in print, translated into 23 languages. Her most 
famous novel, "The Golden Notebook," first published in 1962, is still a world 
bestseller, with more than a million copies sold. An unsentimental portrait of 
clever women compromised to the point of madness by what men expect of them, 
the book was taken up by the fledgling women's movement as a kind of manifesto, 
and earned Lessing the title "archeologist of human relations" from critic 
Irving Howe. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to others, Lessing has proved infuriatingly elusive as she sheds 
philosophies and interests like skins -- communism, the politics of colonial 
Africa, Freud, the anti-psychiatry movement and, finally, Sufism, in which she 
still believes. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a realist who baffled readers by switching to "space fiction" in her 
"Canopus in Argos: Archives" series, and a prankster who wrote two "realistic" 
novels under the pseudonym Jane Somers to show that critics praise only the 
familiar. (The books had modest success, but nothing like novels under her own 
name.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even her expansive, unadorned prose eludes definition. Admirers say she's 
technically a "bad" writer, yet her very ponderousness casts a spell. As Joan 
Didion put it, Lessing "can close her eyes and 'give' a situation by the sheer 
force of her emotional energy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The small, sturdy 75-year-old woman who opens the door to her room at the 
Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena seems at first glance less 
intimidating than her works suggest. Dressed simply in muted colors and a 
patterned Indian shirt, gray hair drawn back in her trademark bun, Doris 
Lessing has an air of contained stillness that might mean shyness or 
self-assurance, perhaps both. 
</P>
<P>
 She's in town as part of a world tour to promote volume one of her 
autobiography, "Under My Skin," which describes her childhood in Persia and 
Southern Rhodesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Filled with evocative descriptions of the African landscape, the book also 
explores Lessing's complicated relationship with her parents. Her mother was a 
career nurse who gave up an interesting life in London to follow her husband to 
Africa, which she always hated. Her father was a heartbreakingly handsome bank 
clerk-turned-farmer who lost a leg in World War I, disguised his subsequent 
depression with laconic wit, and died an embittered diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessing also tells of her decision to leave school at 14 to educate herself; 
her two marriages and three children, and her active membership in the 
Communist Party. She closes with her departure for England in 1949, at the age 
of 30, with Peter, her son from her second marriage to Gottfried Lessing, a 
German-Jewish refugee. 
</P>
<P>
 In her suitcase she has the manuscript of her first novel, "The Grass Is 
Singing," which proves an instant success and establishes Lessing's reputation 
as a serious writer -- although it is followed by a bitter blow. Because of her 
writings about Africa and her call for justice for the black majority, she is 
labeled a "prohibited immigrant" by the white Southern Rhodesian government. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years later, newly independent, black African-run Zimbabwe allowed 
her to return -- she wept upon arrival -- on a series of visits described in 
her last, highly praised book, "African Laughter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Under My Skin" has had a mixed reception. Richard Eder in the Los Angeles 
Times called it "the slurry after the gold is panned," preferring her fiction, 
which covered much of the same ground. The New York Times' critic, Michiko 
Kakutani, praised Lessing's absorbing portrait of British colonials but chided 
her for "rationalizations and evasions" and her "reluctance to assume 
responsibility for personal choices." 
</P>
<P>
 In England, Lessing says, "Most of the reviews have been good, but there have 
been some really tetchy ones. They sound as if they'd trodden on a corn or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 She decided to write her autobiography, she says, because she discovered five 
American biographers working on her life. "So I thought, right, I'll get the 
facts down, and then they can make what they like of it. At least that will be 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the writing, she discovered that accuracy, truth and memory are 
slippery creatures and, being Doris Lessing, she allowed "Under My Skin" to 
evolve not simply as a factual record but also as a vehicle to question 
autobiographical methods. Mixed in with the reportage, she keeps up a running 
commentary, full of unanswered questions, as if to emphasize the fluid nature 
of her inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very untidy book, which I think autobiography should be," she says. 
Yet she has an overarching theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book from beginning to end is about patterns inside us, patterns of 
indoctrination, which govern our behavior, which we often don't notice -- the 
message being, we're not as free as we think we are," she says. Among the most 
important patterns are those formed by war and family. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of a shellshocked veteran, Lessing felt "the Great Unmentionable" 
hanging over her childhood like a gray cloud. Long a doomsayer about the 
world's potential for self-destruction, she's more optimistic now -- or, 
rather, buoyed by "small things," such as the abolition of apartheid in South 
Africa and the success of the U.S. peacekeeping mission in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 As for family, her childhood was "stressful," largely because of her mother, 
who complained to visitors how difficult her daughter was, clearly preferred 
Lessing's younger brother, Harry; yet her mother tried to dictate how Lessing 
looked and thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in nervous flight from her ever since I can remember anything, and from 
the age of 14 I set myself obdurately against her in a kind of inner emigration 
from everything she represented," she writes. Now she wishes she had been more 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a terrible life you know, and I am very sorry indeed about fighting 
her." But, "It was absolutely essential to fight her, because she was a very 
possessive woman." Her mother died when Lessing was in her 40s. Their antipathy 
was unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sometimes think if she were alive now. . . ." Lessing drinks some water, 
her voice shaky. Then she takes the long view. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is bad luck, it happens in families. No one's to be blamed for it. . . . 
Why does one dislike someone so much? Very often, you know, for breathing." 
</P>
<P>
 She's impatient with criticisms that she left her children and her failing 
first marriage to Frank Wisdom too easily -- to join the Communist Party and 
change the world, she said at the time, and she believed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that one doesn't really need to spell out that a woman leaving 
two children is likely to be unhappy about it. I know people would be very 
pleased if I wrote two chapters saying how terribly unhappy I was, and then 
they would have said that it served me right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of her reluctance to write about family members who are still living is a 
strong sense of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of her daughter, Jean, she'll only say that she lives in South Africa and that 
they are in touch. She has two granddaughters, Anna, a budding architect, and 
Susie, a soon-to-be lawyer. Her son John, a farmer in Zimbabwe, died two years 
ago of a heart attack during a terrible drought that ruined his farm -- just a 
week before the rains came, Lessing says sadly. Of Peter, she'll say only that 
he lives in London. 
</P>
<P>
 She never married again -- she calls herself unmarriageable -- although she 
has had at least one famous relationship, with American writer Clancy Sigal, 
the model for Saul Green in "The Golden Notebook." Sigal retaliated with two 
Lessing-like fictional characters, in 1976 in "Zone of the Interior" and in 
1992 in "The Secret Defector." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't read his (books) on purpose, because I knew I'd fly into a rage and 
say, how can you tell all these wicked untruths?" Lessing says, 
matter-of-factly. "He's perfectly entitled to put me in a novel. But I'm not 
going to read it, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, she says, she has reached a level of happiness through her 30-year 
study of Sufism, a mystic philosophy that aims for harmony with a spirit of 
"absolute being," and encourages its students to be "in the world, not of it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's "not a guru system. It's not a cult. It is not a religion," she says. As 
the writer Lesley Hazelton puts it: "Sufism seems tailor-made for Doris 
Lessing. It eludes definition." 
</P>
<P>
 Lessing plans to start on volume two of her autobiography this month -- it 
will cover the 1950s. She also has a novel about to come out, and two short 
stories "mapped out" in her head. 
</P>
<P>
 She seems most relaxed talking about domestic things. After years of renting 
apartments and giving away money to good causes, she now owns a house in West 
Hampstead in north London, "an extremely lively, mixed neighborhood, with a lot 
of people who read books." 
</P>
<P>
 But she really comes alive talking about her cat, "a very handsome 
black-and-white cat," called General Pink-Nose the Third, usually addressed as 
Butchkin, who's featured in her nonfiction book, "Particularly Cats . . . and 
Rufus." Butchkin had cancer of the shoulder and had to have a leg amputated, 
"so now he's a handsome three-legged cat. But there's no doubt his dignity has 
been badly wounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Butchkin, does she live alone? 
</P>
<P>
 "More or less," she says with a smile. "And that's all I'm going to say."

BY DESIGN; TIGHTLY WOUND; HERVE LEGER'S BANDAGE-WRAP DRESSES APPEAL TO THOSE 
WHO DARE TO BARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL / SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 When French designer Herve Leger came to town, he brought trunkloads of his 
signature bandage-wrap dresses. Imagine an Ace bandage wrapped mummy-like, with 
a very high hemline and plunging decolletage, and you've got the idea. It's 
fashion first aid, but not for the fainthearted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to love your body and you've got to like fitted clothes," Leger 
said. And no one likes them better, apparently, than the women of L.A. Neiman 
Marcus in Beverly Hills sells more Leger than any other store in the chain. So 
it was here the designer staged his first U.S. fashion show, a benefit last 
month for American Cinematheque. 
</P>
<P>
 His sexy designs for spring dazzled some, while others in the audience looked 
a bit dazed by the show, which exposed more leg than a Miss America pageant. 
The "King of Cling," as Leger's been called, has two favorite lengths: micro 
(mid-thigh) and really micro (baring a bit of cheek). Then there was the issue 
of tightness: Dresses looked as if they'd been applied with glue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sandy-haired, 37-year-old designer dismisses the notion that his 
clothes can be worn only by young, lithe models. Or such women as Cindy 
Crawford, Geena Davis, Nicole Kidman and Meg Ryan, who wear his smoldering 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of being perfect," he said. "I dress very different kinds 
of bodies, and I dress women from 16 to 70. I know that not all women are a 
Size Small, and I know they do not all have good bodies. But I don't think 
about that when I design. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like clothes that are really body-conscious. I'm not going to do tent 
dresses just to please." Rather than emphasize flaws, Leger said, his 
$1,000-to-$5,000 dresses ameliorate them, like a girdle. "I don't like the 
word, but here they say it sucks you in. It shapes your body because of the 
material and cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Leger struck gold with his signature look, he worked as an assistant to 
Karl Lagerfeld, then as free-lance designer for Charles Jourdan and Lanvin. His 
own Paris boutique opened in 1985, floundered with financial problems and 
closed in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 When he developed his bandage dress a few months later, everything turned 
around. Now his seamstresses hand-make about 1,000 wrap dresses a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his clothes are gorgeous," said Sally Kellerman, who plays a fashion 
editor in the upcoming Robert Altman film "Ready to Wear (Pret-a-Porter)." 
Leger's clothes play well with the gym-toned and surgically enhanced set, who 
showed up in droves the day after Leger's show and placed about $250,000 worth 
of orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biggest Leger fans, however, may very well be the viewers, not the 
wearers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Men love my clothes," Leger said, then corrected himself. "It's not that they 
like my clothes. They like sexy women."

SEAMS LIKE OLD TIMES, BUT IN A NEW WAY; HIGH-TECH HOBBY: ABOUT 25 WOMEN, MOST 
SENIORS, ARE LEARNING TO SEW ALL OVER AGAIN USING STATE-OF-THE-ART OVERLOCK 
MACHINES AT CYPRESS COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jane McKeeman, a 76-year-old Santa Ana resident, learned to sew on her 
mother's Singer sewing machine, the old-fashioned kind with a treadle that she 
would pump with her foot to make the needle go up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 Today she's learning to sew all over again on machines that can perform feats 
her mother never imagined. McKeeman is one of about 25 women, most seniors, 
learning to use state-of-the-art, high-tech overlock sewing machines through 
Cypress College's Adult Education program.  
</P>
<P>
 Called sergers, the new machines deliver perfect seams and decorative stitches 
that allow their users to produce professional-quality clothing and home 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one who likes to keep up with everything," says McKeeman, sporting a pink 
sweat shirt adorned with a picture of a bulldog she stitched on her serger. 
"Whatever's best for my sewing, I like to do. Last week I made 12 pairs of 
underpants." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday mornings in a small portable classroom, the students hunker down 
over their sergers, small but complicated-looking contraptions with as many as 
four spools of thread; the machines scarcely resemble the early push-pedal 
Singers. Some of the more advanced models are even computerized -- an LCD 
display panel indicates the proper setting for all the stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students wear thick glasses that help them see what kind of mischief 
these machines are wreaking on their latest projects. Last week they made 
lingerie -- "underwear" to this no-nonsense group. This week, it's hair bows 
that, thanks to the machine, can turn a wisp of chiffon into a fabric rose -- 
if you know what you're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sophisticated sewing technology, the class maintains the folksy 
atmosphere of an old-fashioned quilting bee. The women enjoy poking gentle fun 
at each other's handiwork, trading news on grandchildren and sharing tips about 
where to find the cheapest fabric or the best machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to her friends in the front row, 71-year-old Maxine Roszell of Seal 
Beach jokes: "They started taking this class when they were in their 50s -- 20 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend Bobbie Judson, also 71, of Cerritos, is busy struggling with her 
machine: 
</P>
<P>
 "This machine doesn't like me," Judson says. "I'll have to take this class 
three or four times." 
</P>
<P>
 Roszell is working on a slip that somehow ended up with an elastic waistband 
at least eight inches too big. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been sewing forever. We've made all of our square dance clothes, the 
whole bit. This is a challenge," she says, taking the stitches out of the slip. 
</P>
<P>
 Their teacher, Gayle Hawthorne, spends most of the four-hour session moving 
from student to student, trouble-shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fun group. They're all real eager to learn," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne shows the women how to thread their machines, execute the stitches 
and put together a project. So far, the students have tried their hand at 
napkins, place mats, T-shirts, sweat shirts, vests and children's clothes. At 
one point, Hawthorne informs the class that, for next week's lesson, she'll 
show them how to make swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swimsuits? At our age?" Judson asks incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne assures the class that, due to the cold weather, she won't spend a 
lot of time talking about swimsuits. Instead she will focus on heirloom sewing 
-- stitching lace inserts into fabric to make blouses, christening gowns, doll 
clothes and other items of more interest to the group. A few raise their 
eyebrows when Hawthorne pulls out a sexy lace camisole. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hawthorne is out of earshot, the students sing her praises. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has patience -- working with us is like working with a bunch of kids. We 
never listen," jokes Nicole Grant, a 59-year-old Garden Grove resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students discover the class after a well-meaning family member gives them 
a serger as a gift or they buy one for themselves -- lured by the machines' 
ability to simultaneously cut, stitch and finish a seam to perfection. Sergers 
can perform decorative stitches and sew two to three times as fast as regular 
machines (1,500 stitches per minute, according to the Butterick Home Catalog), 
so students can finish their sewing projects in far less time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do a shirt in half an hour," says Juanita Giron, a 67-year-old 
retired nurse from Fountain Valley. Yet even threading the machines -- which 
requires juggling multiple spools of thread and one or even two needles -- can 
be daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought this machine, and it sat in my closet for three years," says 
Jeraldine Rankins, a 64-year-old Buena Park resident. "I used to sew all the 
time, but when my husband passed away I quit. I didn't do much of anything for 
several years." 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, while signing her grandson up for kung fu classes at Cypress, she 
decided to enrolled in the serger class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started coming here, and I've been sewing, sewing, sewing. I'm hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 The class has therapeutic benefits, its fans say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call this my exercise machine for my brain," Grant says, feeding a swatch 
of fabric into the serger. "We come here; we make friends, we have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 For seniors with too much time on their hands, the class has proved a welcome 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bored. I was bored," says Barbara Riegle, a 73-year-old great-grandmother 
from Anaheim. "Plus, I wanted to make some bibs for my granddaughter, so I 
said, 'I'm going to learn to use this thing. It looks peculiar.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She has since fallen in love with her serger. "I made a dress the other day in 
about 20 minutes. This machine does everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The serger class is $5 for an 11-week course. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't beat the price," Rankins says. 
</P>
<P>

FASHION; THE ALLURE OF ALLURE; WHY IS THE YOUNG MAGAZINE A WINNER? IT MIGHT 
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH EDITOR LINDA WELLS' BEAUTY-BIZ-NOT-AS-USUAL STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If we were talking girlfriend to girlfriend about Linda Wells, there might be 
some downright dirty dishing going on. She's smart, funny, pretty, petite, 
seven months pregnant and still looks fabulous. She isn't swollen or bloated. 
Nor does she have any of those nasty side effects of pregnancy, nor thank God, 
does she want to talk about them. Plus, she's the editor of 3-year-old Allure 
magazine, which has become a smashing success. 
</P>
<P>
 We could let envy get the best of us and trump up some reason to hate her, but 
we can't. She's too nice.  
</P>
<P>
 Wells was in town last week on a farewell tour of her advertisers before 
maternity leave lays her low. "It's just a friendly hello before I can't travel 
anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She often comes to California. It's home to her largest audience and she likes 
to check out the fitness centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do all the things I usually do here, like go the gyms and the 
treatment places. It's just not the same being pregnant," she said. "What are 
you going to do? You can't take a really hard exercise class." 
</P>
<P>
 (OK, maybe a little bit of loathing will be allowed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Between breakfast and lunch dates, she arrived for tea at Shutters Hotel in 
Santa Monica wearing barely a lick of makeup and a navy blue maternity suit, 
looking like CEO material. No wonder Si Newhouse put her in charge of a beauty 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells weathered the first tumultuous years of her magazine's launch and came 
out smelling like $100-an-ounce perfume. Allure was named one of the best 
magazines by Advertising Age two years running. Adweek ranked it No. 1 in its 
list of the 10 Hottest Magazines of 1993 and the publication just landed a 
National Magazine Award for design. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, advertising pages are up 54% and the circulation is more 
than 700,000. (Californians scoop up 111,086 issues a month.) Wells put her 
publication at the top of subscription lists by not doing beauty business as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took away the pretensions of beauty writing. The old style of beauty 
reporting was to be pretentious, florid and kind of patronizing. The magazines 
treated the readers like imbeciles who didn't know how to wash their faces. We 
wanted to be the voice of a friend who is really well-informed, who can talk to 
doctors and get the scoop." 
</P>
<P>
 Readers, though, are conditioned to the old school. A story about juice 
fasting in the December issue has solicited angry calls from readers, 
especially since the same issue contains a story about Christy Henrich, a 
world-class gymnast who died in July of multiple organ failure as a result of 
anorexia. Readers thought that if juice fasting was in the magazine it must be 
recommended and were troubled that it might promote anorexic behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 They hadn't bothered to read the story, Wells said. "If they had, they would 
have seen we were quite critical of it. We presented what we found -- that it's 
not smart. If you try juice fasting, you're going be in a cranky mood and 
really hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 While Wells takes great pains to run criticisms of dangerous health fads and 
articles that promote self-acceptance, the fashion section of the magazine is 
filled with the beautiful, young, long-legged models who foster feelings of 
inadequacy in anyone who is not young, thin and flawless. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not cause her any loss of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think these two things are in opposition. Our message would be lost 
if we used average-looking women wearing the clothes average women wear. It may 
sound cynical, but the reality is, beauty is appealing. You are more likely to 
pick up a magazine with Cindy Crawford on the cover than me or my cousin." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again Wells blames our conditioning for any conflict we might find 
between page 76 of the November issue, where author Alice Thomas Ellis admits 
to living her life presuming she was a tall blonde, only to realize she wasn't, 
and page 164, where a tall blonde stalks the boardwalk in organza hot pants and 
sequined knee-high boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, the stories that went with the pictures of models told how to 
look like her. Here's how she exercises, here's what she eats and if you were 
to follow these routines you'd look like her. But we don't do that because it 
won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't print diets, step-by-step exercise programs, what to do to get in 
shape for bikini season or any of those horrible compulsive stories that made 
those pictures more potent. Those stories said you should try and achieve that 
and we don't even imply it." 
</P>
<P>
 Over a year ago, Wells ran a story by James Dern arguing that society still 
thinks it's acceptable to discriminate against fat people. Six months later she 
followed it with a story by Fay Weldon stating that it was better to be thin 
and receive all the good things and privileges accorded the svelte. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most politically incorrect story you've ever read in your life," 
Wells admitted. But she insisted: "This is not a one-note, one-message 
magazine. I want a forum for a lot of voices." 
</P>
<P>
 Her voices come with clout. "We got off the block with good writers," Wells 
said. "Edna O'Brien was in the first issue, Fay Weldon, if not in the first was 
in the third issue. And good writers are clannish. If one has a good 
experience, they tell their friends and it spreads." 
</P>
<P>
 She's found spas to be a big carrot enticing writers into her stable. "I bet I 
could probably, almost, get John Updike to write for Allure if I sent him to a 
spa," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While her writers want to loll in the hot tub at Canyon Ranch spa, her readers 
want advice about their hair. Everyone, Wells said, wants different hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're never happy with what we have," she said. "It's women's biggest 
insecurity. I think sometimes people who get their hair colored have the truer 
stereotype personality than the ones born that way. I have a friend who is 
blond to her bones and she has to have that realized through a bottle of 
chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wells is not immune to hair-dissatisfaction syndrome. "I don't think of 
myself as a blonde. Even though I have this white-blond hair, I don't have a 
blond personality. I'm a brunette." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all perceived personality defects can be treated by chemicals, and 
Wells said this is one of the problems in the beauty industry. It preys upon 
women's insecurities. "Women suffer from the desire to completely remake 
themselves through frizzed-out perms and bleach jobs and then wonder why it 
doesn't look good. It makes me crazy."  
</P>
<P>
 Her mix of big-name writers, controversy and blasting the beauty biz has 
enhanced her reputation to such a degree that earlier this year a rumor made 
the rounds that Wells would soon replace Vogue Editor Anna Wintour. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells attributes the rumor to a competitor of Vogue's who was trying to erode 
the power of the venerable fashion magazine. Most people in the fashion world 
read it as a testament to Wells' success rather than a slam at Wintour. At the 
time Wells was vacationing in Europe, lending more credence to the rumor. Even 
her own assistant and publisher suspected it might be true and tracked her down 
to verify or discount the rumblings. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wells aspires to another office under a different masthead, she's keeping 
it to herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think about my job, or my career. I think about how are we going to 
make the magazine better, what are we going to do next month. In terms of my 
fate, if the magazine does well, things are good -- and if it doesn't, it's 
bad. It's not magic," she said with a pragmatic shrug.

BUYING IN TO THE NEW AGE OF SKEPTICISM; INFORMATION: ONE DAY BUTTER IS BAD FOR 
YOU. BUT THE NEXT, IT'S OK. IS IT ANY WONDER CONSUMERS ARE GETTING CYNICAL?

 Shari Thurer isn't crazy about the title of her book "The Myths of 
Motherhood," but an author's gotta do what she's gotta do. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtitled "How Culture Reinvents the Good Mother," Thurer's volume is a survey 
of societal expectations and maternal feelings of guilt and anxiety that may 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurer examines attitudes about motherhood from the Stone Age to the present 
and makes reference to neolithic symbols, the Book of Genesis, Marx and Engels, 
Sigmund Freud, poet Anne Sexton and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Stern's memoirs, it ain't. Still, Thurer, a psychologist at Boston 
University, wanted her baby to sell. Slipping myth into the title wasn't going 
to hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, more than 650 "myth" books have been released -- a 
trend that reflects savvy marketing strategy and a deepening sense of public 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary of sound bites and pop sociology, many readers take special pleasure in 
books that articulate their own dissenting views. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience you start out with are those people who are saying to 
themselves, 'I knew all along this was baloney,' " says Clay Harper, marketing 
director for Houghton Mifflin, which published "The Myths of Motherhood." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the matter, says Thurer, is a sense of "social relativism" -- 
a philosophical position that recognizes that accepted "truths" are merely the 
consensus of society at a particular moment and, necessarily, subject to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not writ in the stars, they are not in our genes, they are not 
written in stone. Ideas we thought were God-given change over time," Thurer 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Quartuccio, a supervisor with New York Public Library on Staten Island, 
agrees that citizens are less willing these days to take someone's spiel at 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a world where there is so much information available that we want 
to see every side of an issue, from every which way," Quartuccio says. "We've 
become real skeptics. There is always somebody who contradicts what someone 
else says." 
</P>
<P>
 Quartuccio, a specialist in children's services, says even young readers are 
apt to demonstrate a dubious nature when choosing reading matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a movement toward authors like Jon Scieszka, who wrote 'The True 
Story of the Three Little Pigs,' " the librarian says. In this 1989 version of 
the tale, Quartuccio says, the wolf is a benign creature seeking sugar for his 
grandmother's birthday cake when he sneezes and unintentionally blows down the 
house of the three little pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Revisionism is the rage. 
</P>
<P>
 The authoritative publishing trade resource "Books in Print" lists 1,799 
volumes that feature myth on their covers. Although many have the unmistakable 
mark of academic enterprise ("Myth and the History of the Hispanic Southwest"), 
a significant portion reflects the contrarian spirit that apparently has seized 
the reading public ("Myth of America's Eclipse," "Myth of Black Progress, "Myth 
of Christian Uniqueness"). 
</P>
<P>
 "The Beauty Myth," by Naomi Wolf, was a bestseller in 1991. And more scholarly 
works, such as Joseph Campbell's "The Power of Myth," based on the 
philosopher's 1987 public television conversations with Bill Moyers, and the 
1992 volume "Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman 
Archetype," by Clarissa Pinkola Estes, reached the top 10 list. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek magazine recently ran a cover story dubbed "The Myth of Generation X: 
Seven Great Lies About 20somethings" and, to coincide with the 20th anniversary 
of Richard Nixon's resignation as President, the New York Times published an 
Op-Ed piece by Harper's magazine that editor Lewis Lapham called "The Watergate 
Myth." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the public seems in a feisty mood, Warren Farrell, the San Diego-based 
author of "The Myth of Male Power," says there is an odd yin and yang to the 
dynamics of doubt. Cable television and the electronic superhighway supply 
consumers with vast amounts of data in such rapid fashion that the audience may 
suffer intellectual whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
 A political scientist and sex therapist who was a founder of the "men's 
liberation" movement in the 1970s, Farrell says that although easier access to 
information helps vanquish false notions, trouble arises because renegade 
material circulates with remarkable speed thanks to modern technology and, once 
absorbed, can be difficult to excise. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, Farrell argues, for example, that close examination of certain 
widely held assumptions regarding the status of men and women in the United 
States -- that women are the victims of most violence, earn less for the same 
work and receive inferior health care -- suggest the common wisdom is seriously 
flawed. His research indicates none of the above is true, Farrell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can both destruct and construct myths easier than we used to," Farrell 
says. If anything, he says, readers should be more vigilant for false notions 
in these days of the Internet and cyberspace, and challenge all assumptions, 
even those that seem most credible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skepticism is healthy because it prevents cynicism," Farrell says. "A cynical 
person is usually an idealist who has been constantly disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 But myths wouldn't be myths unless people accepted them -- and, author Paul 
Dickson says, even in an age of skepticism, there are plenty of trusting folks 
in a mood to believe first, ask questions later. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1993 book, "Myth-Informed: Legends, Credos and Wrongheaded 'Facts' We 
All Believe," Dickson and co-author Joseph C. Goulden, shake apart the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you thought no two snowflakes are alike, or that whales spout water, or 
elephants have superior memories -- Dickson and Goulden offer an opportunity 
for enlightenment: Dickson says there are a finite number of forms that 
crystalline structures can assume and that identical snowflakes are inevitable; 
that whales spout air, not surf, and elephants have about the same recall as 
many other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans may be pushovers on the one hand, but, Dickson says, they are superb 
debunkers, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major theme in American literature and pop culture, in letters and in 
journalism is the undermining of conventional wisdom," he says. "It's something 
we do as Americans and we enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson says there is nothing new about the spirit of skepticism that now 
seems so prevalent. In "Myth-Informed," the authors refer to social critics 
H.L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan who, in 1920, published "American Credo," 
which Dickson describes as "a poke in the eye at American wisdom." Concludes 
Dickson: "It's a constant, this debunking. It has nothing to do with the 
millennium." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, of Houghton Mifflin, is convinced something is juggling the American 
mind-set as the 21st Century approaches. "Nobody has any authority anymore. One 
day butter is bad for you; six months later someone is saying, oops, butter is 
really good. Everything is greeted with cynicism." 
</P>
<P>
 Young people who a few years ago claimed their elders were just a bunch of 
sellouts are buying into the Establishment themselves. "Now that everyone is 
over 30," says Harper, "there is no one left to trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Can't trust anyone over 30? Watch for "The Myth of Middle Age" at bookstores 
soon.

AUDIT CITES DISTRICT FOR INADEQUATE CONTROLS; COLLEGES: THE REPORT REVEALS NO 
SPECIFIC MONETARY LOSSES DUE TO THE PROBLEMS FOUND, BUT IT OFFERS NUMEROUS 
REMEDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A yearly audit of the Ventura County Community College District has turned up 
a series of failings that contribute to inadequate financial controls, lax 
computer security and an undertrained accounting staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The 96-page report chastises the district for not tracking whether funds 
received actually matched revenue projections for the fiscal year that ended 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 It also suggests that workers in the district's accounting office are not 
adequately trained, and that four new managers be hired to see that better 
accounting is done at the district and its three campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the auditors recommended rethinking some classes that do not 
traditionally attract large numbers of students. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, performed by the firm Coopers & Lybrand, was submitted to trustees 
at a meeting late Tuesday. By law, the district must forward its audit to state 
education officials in Sacramento by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report cites no specific monetary losses due to the problems that were 
uncovered. But it does offer numerous remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a separate audit of the Oxnard College bookstore found tens 
of thousands of dollars in losses due to incomplete record-keeping on the part 
of its manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Governing board members clearly were not pleased with some of the latest 
findings, although they said some work was already under way to remedy many of 
the shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee John D. Tallman questioned the audit's conclusion that the 
district has beefed up its reserves to 4.4% of its general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's based on your budget, so if you've budgeted revenue that isn't 
materializing, then obviously you don't have reserves," he said. "We have an 
inflated revenue budget, so the reserves are very suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Tallman said he would propose adding three community members to the district's 
audit committee, which now consists of two board members. "They could be 
accountants or others with specialized knowledge that will help us have more 
accurate income projections," Tallman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief recommendation in the audit was to improve monitoring of the 
district's finances. "There does not appear to be adequate and timely 
monitoring of the financial performance throughout the year," the report 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very important sentence," Tallman said. "But they don't amplify what 
they mean by that. They're in a polite way telling us we've got to quit 
adopting a budget that has faulty income projections." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Tallman said, the board adopted a budget earlier this year that 
assumed $800,000 in state funds that never materialized. The result, he said, 
was a budget balanced on paper but totally inaccurate. Trustees later voted to 
use a health insurance rebate to make up the $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Chancellor Jeffrey Marsee on Wednesday stood by the audit and his 1994-95 
recommended budget adopted in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audited reserve balance is based on actual reserves as of June 30, 1994," 
Marsee said. "Mr. Tallman may be confusing actual audited information with 
budgeted revenues and expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee in September told the board -- absent Tallman, who was just seated 
Tuesday -- that the $800,000 may not be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Others complained that the audit was kept hidden from district staff and 
teachers. Oxnard College Academic Senate President Gary Morgan said he was 
denied a copy of the audit until the board acted on it Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my understanding (that) the minute a document like this is prepared, it 
becomes a public document," said Morgan, who teaches journalism at Oxnard 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee said he ran short of copies of the report and could not immediately 
accommodate all of the requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was particularly concerned about the audit's Recommendation 13, the 
suggestion that the district review its policy of offering courses that do not 
attract 15 or more students. But board President Timothy D. Hirschberg said the 
colleges are obligated to offer some courses that, by their nature, attract 
small numbers of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the auditors meant to make a sweeping indictment of all 
low-enrollment classes," he said. "I don't think the board would go along with 
that anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "But certainly as enrollment overall has declined, one strategy is to offer 
more of what the students are registering for on admission day," he said. "When 
dollars are limited, the board needs to maximize each dollar. One way to do 
that is to offer courses the public wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirschberg also said the district may be forced to hire additional help 
"because of the chronic and continuing inadequacies," despite approving new 
comptroller and accountant positions within the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 An aging computer system with inadequate security controls exacerbates 
problems, Hirschberg said. Presently, individual computer passwords are not 
adequately protected, meaning that students and others have access to sensitive 
data, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got good people there, but they need to have the technology to work 
with," he said. "With adequate training, I think we can address most of the 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cheryl Herrmann, an official of the district's classified employees union, 
said new business officers could duplicate work being done by others in charge 
of reviewing finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they add business officer positions at the campuses, then they should 
reconsider the need for the vice presidents of administrative services," said 
Herrmann, a lab technician at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has a history of dealing with problems by doing one of two 
things: throwing staff at it or throwing money at it," she said.

COMING ATTRACTION; CAMARILLO'S 1ST MAJOR MOVIE COMPLEX IS READIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Workers scrambled Wednesday to put the finishing touches on a 12-screen 
Edwards Theatres complex in Camarillo -- preparing for the Friday opening of 
the city's first major cineplex. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With many city residents spending their work and leisure hours elsewhere, the 
$8-million theater complex -- to be known as the Edwards Camarillo Palace 12 
Cinemas -- will offer residents a chance to stay within their city when they 
look to go out for entertainment, city leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a part of our maturation as a community," said Councilwoman 
Charlotte Craven. "A lot of people still think that you have to leave the city 
to do anything. With the Edwards project, I think that mind-set will change." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ken Gose echoed Craven, saying he would like to see more 
opportunities for families to spend time together in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very glad to see it. We need more things like this in our city," Gose 
said. "I like it because of its architecture and I like it because we will be 
able to see a wide variety of films without having to drive out of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, one day before a private opening ceremony and two days before 
the theaters' public opening, about 100 construction workers were working on 
the movie house's final touches under the command of Michael Tiemeyer, the 
company's operations director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may well have the last of the painters going out the back door as our 
guests come through the front door," Tiemeyer said. "In this business, if it 
looks like there's still two weeks of work left, that means we're almost done." 
</P>
<P>
 The 56,000-square-foot facility sits on a three-acre Ventura Boulevard lot 
south of the Ventura Freeway between Las Posas Road and Carmen Drive. The 
complex, which will seat 3,000, will offer only first-run movies and may 
include art films among its selections, Tiemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cineplex will feature wall-to-wall screens and digital sound equipment 
projected through an elaborate speaker array in each theater. Other features 
include a $500,000 imported Italian granite lobby floor, brass ceilings and a 
two-sided, 70-foot-long concession stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Specially designed non-reflective sidewalls are featured in the 12 theaters, 
which seat 200 to 325 patrons each.  
</P>
<P>
 On the complex's second story, a video game arcade and restrooms are reached 
by two curving staircases or by elevator.  
</P>
<P>
 Tiemeyer said the company was not overly concerned about an 11-screen United 
Artists multiplex that has recently broken ground in eastern Camarillo's 
Mission Oaks area. Completion on that project is expected next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we'll feel it, but I think Camarillo and the surrounding region 
represent a large enough market for both of us," Tiemeyer said. "Personally, I 
think when people see this facility, they'll make a habit of seeing movies 
here. Everything's top of the line. You can even get real butter on your 
popcorn."

DECLINE IN COUNTY CREDIT RATING FEARED; FINANCE: IN WAKE OF CRISIS ELSEWHERE, 
LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT BONDS COULD MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO 
BORROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite a conservative investment philosophy, Ventura County officials said 
Wednesday that the county's credit rating could be harmed in the volatile bond 
market created by Orange County's bankruptcy filing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the county's bond rating is a stellar A+, a loss of confidence in 
local government bonds could lower that rating and make it more expensive to 
borrow money for public projects, Treasurer-Tax Collector Hal Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern is that some investors or (bond) rating agencies will lump 
everybody in California in one group because one county had trouble," Pittman 
said. "We don't really know yet what's going to happen. Do we worry about it? 
Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 County chief administrator Richard Wittenberg said he believes that the credit 
ratings of all California counties will eventually suffer from the fallout of 
Orange County's investment debacle. But he said he does not expect any major 
changes soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to judge how quickly the reverberations are going to occur," he 
said. "I just tend to believe it's going to be later down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 One project that could be affected is the $51-million expansion of the Ventura 
County Medical Center. The Board of Supervisors last month authorized the 
issuance of so-called certificates of participation, which are similar to 
bonds, to pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county's credit rating is hurt, that could mean significant added 
costs, Pittman said. The certificates will not be issued for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely don't want any added costs," Pittman said. "If there are, the 
board may want to take another look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn said he did not know if extra costs would force a 
re-examination of the hospital project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ready to say what I would do right now," he said. "It would depend on 
how much we were affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little early to be speculating," she said. "But certainly there is a 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's short-term borrowing practices could also be affected by the 
Orange County bankruptcy, said Auditor-Controller Thomas Mahon. Each July, the 
county borrows about $75 million to carry it over until it collects property 
taxes in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg noted that Orange County officials invited Ventura County to join 
their investment pool about four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were asked if we would be interested in joining, and we did not because it 
was too risky," he said. "The number one issue for us is safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials, however, had a different philosophy. Managing an 
investment portfolio that included assets of 180 other public agencies, the 
county for years made high-risk investments that depended on stable or falling 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county lost its bet when interest rates suddenly began to climb a year 
ago. On Monday, veteran Orange County Treasurer Robert Citron resigned after 
disclosing that the investment fund had lost $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's investment practices should have been no surprise because 
California counties are so strapped for cash that they are constantly looking 
for new ways to raise money, Wittenberg said. He said the state Legislature's 
raids on property taxes once reserved for local government has created a 
climate of desperation among many cities and counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see how this occurred," he said. "It's very tempting for all counties 
to get involved in similar investment programs. Look, you had about 200 
government entities that were a part of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Coates, president of the California Assn. of County Treasurers and Tax 
Collectors, said she thinks Orange County's investment practices are the 
exception and not the norm among the state's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression is that this is not a widespread problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Coates said she also believes that the ratings of other California 
counties could be hurt in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think so because there's going to be quite a bit of concern about this 
happening somewhere else," she said. "I think it's unfair to have the fallout 
extend to other counties, because the majority of them have been following good 
investment practices, and they deserve the high ratings they have."

TEDDY BEARS GET FINAL HUGS BEFORE TRIPS TO NEW HOMES; GIFTS: SATICOY 
SCHOOLCHILDREN DONATE THEIR TOYS TO NEEDY FAMILIES IN L.A. BUT THE SACRIFICES 
DON'T COME WITHOUT TEARS.

<P>
 More than 300 children -- some with tears in their eyes -- parted with their 
teddy bears Wednesday in the cause of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, children at Saticoy's Sacred Heart School have 
brought the stuffed animals to school to brighten the Christmas of needy 
children served by St. Vibiana's Church in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred Heart's teddy bears are part of a larger effort of about 60 other 
schools, which pledge items ranging from diapers to toothbrushes for St. 
Vibiana's families. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Sacred Heart pupils sat on the floor of the school's auditorium, 
clutching tiny, newborn-sized bears and bears almost as big as themselves. The 
toys came in shades of brown, white, black, pink, purple and gray. Some sported 
ribbons; others were dressed like Santa in red and white. 
</P>
<P>
 The diverse bears were destined for children from the poorest of poor 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Terry Fleming, chief administrator of the Archdiocese serving Los 
Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, drove 60 miles to his former 
parish to gather the bears. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Vibiana's assists about 300 families -- with about 1,500 children -- 
annually, he said. The families often live eight to a 10-by-15-foot room, and 
many have a monthly income of only about $600, $400 of which goes toward rent, 
Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming and Sacred Heart Principal Sister Mary Francelia told the children 
that giving toys to people they had never met was more beautiful than giving to 
family members, because their gifts were unconditional -- they would get 
nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to give to people you love," Fleming said. "It's hard to give to 
people you don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy as the children were of Christmas cheer, some of the kindergartners had 
become attached to their cuddly friends, and were misty-eyed when they parted. 
</P>
<P>
 Francelia told the children to think of how happy the bears would make their 
new owners and to pray for the families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, give that teddy bear a great big hug," she said before the children 
toted their gifts to the stage, where the bears were lined up for a group photo 
before heading south. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said each bear will be gift-wrapped and delivered along with other 
Christmas goodies to needy families Dec. 17.

FAMILY SUES MURDER SUSPECT AND HIS PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight months after their son was shot to death, a Simi Valley couple on 
Wednesday filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the 19-year-old murder 
defendant and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Ventura County Superior Court, charges Harold and Susan 
Chrestman of Port Hueneme with providing the shotgun that prosecutors say their 
son used to fatally shoot 24-year-old Andy Lee Anderson at the Middle Lions 
Campground in the mountains above Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Chrestman is charged with shooting Anderson and Anderson's dog on 
March 4 and stealing the man's pickup truck. His murder trial is expected to 
begin Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say Chrestman shot Anderson in the back as the victim stood next 
to his truck preparing to drive home after a half-day fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Chrestman's parents provided him with the gun used 
to kill Anderson, and Chrestman's father dropped the defendant off at the 
campsite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harold Chrestman and Susan Chrestman knew . . . Timothy Chrestman was 
emotionally unstable, and/or possibly under the influence of drugs and/or 
alcohol," alleges the suit, filed by Camarillo attorney Lawrence M. Schulner 
for Carolyn and Bobby Lee Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Schulner said this is not the first time he has sued in 
connection with a homicide. His law firm settled a previous Ventura County case 
with similar circumstances for $100,000, he said. He declined to identify the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to win this one," Schulner said. "I don't think young people should 
be walking around with guns, and I don't think parents should be giving them 
guns." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chrestmans could not be reached for comment. But Timothy Chrestman's 
attorney, Steve Pell, denied that the parents gave their son the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been Tim's gun for a long time," Pell said of his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Pell also said he does not believe the parents are liable for what happened to 
Anderson and his dog, Sheila, an Australian shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 Information in the lawsuit was based on a grand jury report and other public 
documents in the case, Schulner said. The suit said that Timothy Chrestman was 
having emotional problems stemming from drug and alcohol abuse and had planned 
to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman's father picked him up at a bus station before he could leave for 
Florida, three days before Anderson's death, the lawsuit says. The next day, 
the father convinced his son to spend a couple days at the campground "to think 
over his desire to go to Florida," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father then provided Timothy Chrestman with the alleged murder weapon and 
drove him to the campground, where the shooting later occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman was arrested after authorities found his wallet in Anderson's blue 
truck, which was found abandoned in West Hollywood two days after the shooting.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WORKSHOP FOCUSES ON AIDS EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers from all corners of the county met in Camarillo on Wednesday to 
discuss how to carry out a state law mandating AIDS education in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 While most teachers gave high marks to the HIV/AIDS Prevention Workshop, 
sponsored by the Ventura County superintendent of schools office, at least one 
east county school official left the all-day conference in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I learned was consternation," said Mildred Lynch, a trustee 
with the Conejo Valley Unified School District. Lynch left before the workshop 
was half finished. "I didn't even want their lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop was designed to help teachers teach AIDS prevention in grades 
seven through 12 as required by Assembly Bill 11, which went into effect at the 
start of the 1992-93 school year. Students, HIV-positive speakers and county 
health and school officials spent the day offering suggestions on teaching AIDS 
prevention to their students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We high-schoolers think we're invincible," Tonya Mykleby told the conference 
. Mykleby, 17, is a senior at Rio Mesa High School. "People don't think it will 
affect them and that has a lot to do with the myth that it's a gay disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the law does not specify curriculum, interpretation was open to much 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Choe, a teacher at De Anza Middle School in Ventura, said she believes 
many of her students are sexually active and frank discussions in class are 
needed, including lessons in birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Kubilos, a Planned Parenthood representative from Ventura, raised the 
possibility of handing out condoms to students. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley Unified School District nurses Caroline Ferber and Norma 
Wallace said officials at the schools they serve are politically conservative 
and would stop short of getting into the birth-control business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that schools should be responsible for handing out condoms," 
Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate took place hours after Lynch left the workshop, which she described 
as useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said later that she took particular exception to a gay man infected with 
HIV addressing the more than 30 educators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the education when you bring a person like that into the classroom?" 
Lynch asked. "The student learns that he should be kind to a person that -- 
through his own fault -- was inflicted with this illness. Teaching (that) 
anyone can get AIDS is nonsense. It's a behavioral disease." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Kubilos acknowledged that the issue is controversial, but 
said such firsthand learning experiences are invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are required to teach AIDS prevention and we need to look beyond how the 
person got it and offer compassion," Kubilos said. "And regardless, it makes 
the students aware of the results of risky sexual behavior." PAUL ELIAS

 Students, Senior Citizens Share Ideas 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine J. Boe is among the senior citizens participating in Project Share, a 
program designed to promote lifelong learning and understanding between seniors 
and students in elementary and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's teens may look and act differently than we did in my generation, but 
they are still the same underneath," Boe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Share began three years ago in community schools with senior 
volunteers helping out with one-on-one tutoring. Now the program has expanded, 
with the seniors also listening to students read, helping in classrooms with 
special projects and providing support services in school offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, in turn, tutor their elderly friends in computers and assist with 
projects such as the building of the Senior King and Queen float for the annual 
Fourth of July Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Project Share is one of my favorite projects. I feel young while working with 
these children," Boe says. "It keeps me in tune with what is happening in their 
young lives." 
</P>

 Two armed robberies, at a grocery store and a bank, occurred just 10 minutes 
apart Wednesday evening in Thousand Oaks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first robbery occurred at 5:55 p.m. at the Vons market on Avenida de los 
Arboles, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said.A man carrying what appeared to 
be a toy gun took an unknown amount of money from the pharmacy counter, Sgt. 
Ray Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second robbery was at 6:05 p.m. at the Wells Fargo Bank branch at 140 E. 
Thousand Oaks Blvd. Two men displayed handguns and fled with an undisclosed 
amount of money, Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police apprehended a suspect in the grocery store robbery late Wednesday. Both 
robberies were still under investigation. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; NO DECISION YET ON THORNTON TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day away from completing their case, attorneys for accused Thousand Oaks 
murderer Mark Scott Thornton said they still had not decided whether to put the 
defendant on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Inching closer to the case's end, attorneys questioned half a dozen witnesses 
Wednesday in an attempt to cast doubt over the allegation that the defendant 
killed Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher told reporters that his camp would 
announce the decision on Thornton's testimony today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision still hasn't been totally made yet," he said, "so you will know 
when the court knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, 20, is charged with murder in the Sept. 14, 1993, shooting death of 
the 33-year-old nurse. He is also charged with using O'Sullivan's truck to 
kidnap his 16-year-old former girlfriend later that same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they will call rebuttal witnesses after the defense rests, 
but they will not know the extent of that testimony until they learn whether 
Thornton will testify, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't at this time anticipate any real lengthy testimony," Kossoris told 
Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 The most extensive testimony Wednesday came from Ventura County sheriff's 
investigator Richard E. Gatling. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the jury about his interview with a Thousand Oaks woman who said she 
had seen someone resembling O'Sullivan driving around her neighborhood shortly 
after the nurse's disappearance. The woman, Nancy Briscoe of Thousand Oaks, 
testified Tuesday that she could not remember whether the person she saw was 
indeed O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gatling said she had told him: "I swear to the heavens that I thought I 
saw her in her black Ford Explorer coming up our street." DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FORUM SPOTLIGHTS NEW SCHOOL TRUSTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A forum by a group of newly elected conservative school board members proved 
to be a bigger attraction to school officials curious about what the trustees 
would say than to parents concerned about the state of public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Moorpark chapter of the California Republican Assembly -- the 
conservative arm of the state Republican Party -- the education round table was 
billed as an opportunity for trustees and the public to consider the 
relationship between the Ventura County Board of Education and local school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the two county school trustees scheduled to participate did not 
show up, and the other left early. 
</P>
<P>
 New county board Trustee Marty Bates did not attend the public forum because 
of another engagement, and new Trustee Angela Miller left 30 minutes into the 1 
1/2-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 That left three panelists -- Norm Walker, who was just elected to the Simi 
Valley Unified School District board; Elaine McKearn, a new trustee for the 
Conejo Valley Unified School District board, and Mildred Lynch, who won 
reelection to the Conejo board. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderated by Moorpark Republican Assembly President Matt Noah, the discussion 
ranged from school violence to the federal government's influence on public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 A few parents in the audience raised concerns about these issues, but most of 
the two dozen people at the forum were teachers or elected school trustees who 
appeared mainly interested in listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Some school officials, however, confronted the panel and Noah. Simi Valley 
school board President Carla Kurachi asked why Noah's group chose a panel of 
mostly new trustees who lacked the experience to discuss issues knowledgeably. 
</P>
<P>
 Noah responded: "The Moorpark Republican Assembly wants to highlight the views 
of people who have views akin to what we have." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; GUNS SEIZED, 4 ARRESTED IN SERIES OF RAIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Early morning police raids in Oxnard, El Rio and Nyeland Acres netted four 
arrests and a cache of guns and ammunition that police suspect may be linked to 
recent gang-related shootings in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 As with similar raids in the past, Wednesday's operation was conducted by a 
task force of Ventura County agencies. In all, 85 authorities from the Oxnard 
and Ventura police departments, the Sheriff's Department, the district 
attorney's office and the probation department swept through 13 homes 
simultaneously at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Sgt. Charles Hookstra, whose gang-suppression unit organized the raid, 
declared the operation a success because of the amount of contraband seized. 
The cooperation among police agencies, he said, should send a message to gang 
members that violence won't be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it goes a long way when we show up at the door and they see both 
these uniforms," he said, referring to teams of Oxnard officers and sheriff's 
deputies who entered homes in El Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons confiscated included a semiautomatic 9-millimeter Uzi, a sawed-off 
.20-gauge shotgun, a .45-caliber revolver, a crossbow, two hunting knives and a 
hatchet. The .45-caliber had been reported stolen in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shed behind one of the homes, officers also found a small plastic case 
containing about two ounces of cocaine, a portable scale and cutting powder 
typically mixed with cocaine when it is sold. A beeper and $550 in cash were 
seized at the same home. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Garcia, 22, and Gerardo Carillo, 18, were arrested on suspicion of 
possessing illegal weapons. Carillo was also booked into County Jail on 
suspicion of possessing cocaine for sale. Anna Ambriz, 19, and Dominic Reyes, 
18, were arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of a narcotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail. Carillo's bail was set at 
$50,000 and Abriz's at $5,000. No further information was available on Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids were prompted in part by two shootings Nov. 30 that left two men 
wounded in Oxnard. Members of an El Rio gang are suspected in both incidents.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; HOSPITAL ESCAPEES FOUND NEAR BASE 
</P>

<P>
 Two patients at Camarillo State Hospital -- an 18-year-old man accused of 
attempted homicide and a 21-year-old woman -- were picked up near Point Mugu 
Navy base Wednesday morning after escaping overnight from the mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple apparently left the facility Tuesday night while other patients 
were having coffee and snacks after a service in the hospital's chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the staff must have turned their back for a minute or something and 
they took off and jumped the fence," said hospital spokeswoman Lynette 
Castleman. "The staff immediately searched the area, but it was already dark." 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's helicopter and two police dogs were called to assist in the 
search, but the couple could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 a.m. Wednesday, employees at Point Mugu spotted two people near the 
perimeter of the military base and became suspicious. The employees then 
learned of the missing patients and called the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Castleman said the 18-year-old man was committed to the hospital four months 
ago by a Ventura County judge. The teen-ager will undergo treatment at the 
hospital until he is declared competent to stand trial on a charge of attempted 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Castleman declined to give his name or details of the crime, although she did 
say that according to a diagnosis he is developmentally disabled with mental 
problems. JULIE FIELDS

 The Salvation Army is gathering Christmas cash after ironing out problems with 
two Ventura stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Sav-on drugstore halted soliciting last week at its store, and K mart 
restricted it to the week before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Both stores attributed their decisions to aggressive fund raising by other 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lt. Rene Beauchamp of the Salvation Army said the stores received calls 
from customers who wanted to see the familiar red kettles and hear the bells. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the charity began soliciting at K mart on Monday and at Sav-on on 
Tuesday. JAN STEVENS

 The Camarillo Planning Commission has unanimously approved a health 
maintenance organization's plans to build a 19,120-square-foot medical building 
on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by Foundation Health Inc., set for a vacant three-acre parcel 
near Adolfo Road and Avenida Acaso, would allow the company to retain more 
family practice physicians and to centralize services for members, spokesman 
Kurt Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project approved Tuesday calls for the company to build a single-story 
building that will include examining rooms, X-ray facilities and a pharmacy.

PANEL FAVORS CHIPPING IN FUNDS TO KEEP 2 LIBRARIES OPEN LONGER; VENTURA: 
BACKERS URGE MORE HOURS FOR WRIGHT AND FOSTER BRANCHES. RECOMMENDATION NOW GOES 
TO FULL COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing a room packed with ardent library boosters, a Ventura council committee 
broke course with past tradition Wednesday and recommended that the city chip 
in $145,000 to keep two branches open longer each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Steve Bennett and Gregory L. Carson, members of the council's 
Finance Committee, said they will ask the full council to approve the extra 
funding. The third committee member, Councilman Jack Tingstrom, was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the extra 13 hours a week between January and August, the money 
would pay for an automatic checkout machine at the H. P. Wright Library in 
mid-town Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really was very pleasantly surprised," said Yvonne Esler, one of 30 
residents who jammed the narrow, wood-paneled meeting room in a show of support 
for local libraries. "I'm glad the city is looking at the importance of 
libraries in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, neither H. P. Wright on Day Road nor E. P. Foster Library in 
downtown operates more than 20 hours a week. A staff of 10 employees shuttles 
between the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The county pays for the libraries through property tax monies, but with 
funding increasingly short, it has had to cut the library budget back 
dramatically in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's recommendation does not guarantee that the libraries will win 
support from the full council, which has repeatedly refused to contribute city 
money for fear that county officials will use that as an excuse to cut back 
county funding even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, in fact, Bennett warned the city's library advisory board that it 
stood little chance of winning financial support for its cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very surprised if the council said, 'Yep, let's do this,' " he 
told the board Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, however, after weeks of mounting community pressure to do 
something, Bennett voted to cut a check to pay for more hours. The cash will 
come out of onetime funds, meaning that there is no certainty that the city 
will be able to repeat the funding in the 1995-96 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson also approved the recommendation, although he warned that the city may 
be heading down a course it cannot easily reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we're in the library game, we're in the library game," he said. "To 
think we'll be able to get out of it later, we're kidding ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's money would add eight hours to Wright Library's schedule and five 
to the schedule at Foster. A recent library fund-raising drive brought in 
$7,677 from residents, allowing Wright to stay open two hours later Wednesdays 
and Foster to begin operating two hours earlier Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Wright is open from 2 to 8 p.m. Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Wednesdays 
and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturdays. Foster is open from noon to 8 p.m. Tuesdays, 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. Thursdays and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent fund-raising efforts also paid for the Avenue Library, the city's 
smallest branch, to open at 1 p.m. instead of 2 p.m. Mondays. The Avenue branch 
on Ventura Avenue nearly closed two years ago, but a donations drive then 
collected enough money to keep it open until June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Committee and the residents at the meeting agreed that the present 
recommendation to spend $145,000 can only be a Band-Aid solution. In the 
long-term, they said, the city must find a new home for its entire library 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 One site mentioned repeatedly at the meeting is a vacant furniture store at 
the Buenaventura Mall. Carson, however, said the building will need extensive 
and costly retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council committee's recommendation came in response to a library board 
vote last month to ask the city for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has also come under increasing pressure from library administrators 
and residents to do something about the situation at Foster and Wright. Some 
board members wanted to shut Wright, at least temporarily, and move all its 
books to Foster so it could operate 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal, however, met with fierce resistance from other board members as 
well as many eastside residents, and it was shelved. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright is far more popular with readers than Foster, circulating nearly 
225,000 books a year to Foster's 107,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foster is the county's main reference library, with a collection of 
133,000 volumes.

HOSPITAL REBUFFS NURSES' REQUEST FOR UNION RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of registered nurses at Los Robles Regional Medical Center who have 
joined a statewide union were rebuffed by hospital management Wednesday when 
the nurses asked for union recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a letter, union President Lesley Whitehouse went to acting chief 
administrator Ken Underwood's office and asked that he recognize American 
Federation of Nurses, Local 535, as the nurses' exclusive bargaining agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuts in hours and benefits, discrepancies in the pay scale and lack of 
communication between management and staff members prompted the move toward 
collective action, Whitehouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Underwood refused the letter, and told the nurses he would meet with them 
on an individual basis only. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the nurse told me is that she had a letter saying she represented a 
majority of nurses in the hospital," Underwood said. "Basically I truly believe 
that they or the union do not represent an uncoerced majority of the nurses." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehouse, who has worked in the emergency room at Los Robles for 12 years, 
said more than 60% of the nurses on staff are paying dues and carrying union 
identification cards. The group held elections in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not coerced anyone," she said. "We tell people, if you are really 
anti-union, tell us. You can come to us if you are interested. That is our 
philosophy." In the letter to Underwood, organizer Jim Moreau suggested a union 
card count by a neutral party to verify the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Underwood did not accept the letter, Moreau said the group will canvass 
its members before taking the next step in the unionizing process, applying to 
the National Labor Relations Board for recognition. The group had hoped to 
avoid calling in the national board to settle its dispute, organizers said, so 
costs and conflict between administrators could be kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to damage the hospital," chief shop steward Brenda Perry said. 
"We're proud of our work and we're proud of what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Thousand Oaks hospital's roughly 1,000 employees are now 
represented by a union. About 300 staff members are registered nurses, 
according to Underwood. During Los Robles' 26-year history, no unions have been 
formed, though nurses said they remember unsuccessful attempts more than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospital is not anti-union," said Underwood, who took charge when former 
chief administrator Bob Quist was ousted last month. "We recognize the right of 
everyone to join a union. But I personally do not feel that dealing with an 
outside group is beneficial to any of the employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to organize began in February after a cut in benefits, Whitehouse 
said. In May, the group presented a letter to Quist stating some of the 
members' concerns and asking him to schedule a meeting with labor 
representatives. Quist never responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions in benefits included reducing overtime wages and cutting three 
days from annual vacation time and from sick leave, the nurses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Whitehouse said she received notification that another 
benefit would be reduced. Because she does not take the hospital's health care 
insurance plan, choosing to use her husband's carrier instead, she has been 
receiving $53 per paycheck toward her retirement fund. But effective Jan. 1, 
that figure will drop to $19 per week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood said he stands by the hospital's benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd put our wage and salary benefit package up against any other hospital in 
the area," Underwood said. "From Santa Barbara to Tarzana." 
</P>
<P>
 But nurses cite other policy changes that have affected paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, some 12-hour shifts have been reduced to eight-hour days, 
cutting down on overtime pay for nurses. In 1993, a $2 hourly differential for 
nurses who worked weekend shifts was cut, nurses said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any hospital in the area that has a weekend differential," 
Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses also say the pay scale is confusing and discriminates against 
longtime employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a new nurse come in and she'll be making $2 more an hour than 
you," said Perry, who has been at Los Robles nearly 13 years. "It's very 
upsetting." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said some nurses have become disenchanted with the atmosphere at 
Los Robles in recent months and left, leaving the hospital understaffed and 
affecting the quality of patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have enough nurses to take care of the patients," Whitehouse said. 
"We just had one patient who needed a CCU (critical care unit) bed sit in the 
emergency room for six hours because we didn't have the staff. It's just been 
getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
 But Underwood defended the hospital staffing standards, saying that in three 
unscheduled random visits by the California Department of Health Services in 
1994 the hospital received the highest marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met 100% of their staffing standards," he said, adding that he expects no 
disruption in patient care due to the unionizing effort.

CAR DRIVEN IN ALLEGED ASSAULT IS ITSELF HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The felony case against a Newbury Park woman who allegedly rammed a jacked-up 
car while her husband worked beneath it has taken another strange twist. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged assault weapon -- the defendant's Audi 5000 -- was rear-ended on 
Nov. 29 as a prosecution expert was testing its brakes in preparation for the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Burns, 44, was originally charged with attempted murder in connection 
with the Sept. 23 incident in which Jimmy Burns was working under a car when 
his wife allegedly crashed into it. The couple had been having domestic 
problems, the husband has testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors reduced the charges to assault with a deadly weapon and 
hit-and-run last month after the husband recanted part of his story. At an 
October preliminary hearing, Jimmy Burns testified that his wife could not have 
seen him underneath the jacked-up car. He also testified that her Audi had a 
mechanical problem that occasionally caused it to surge forward. 
</P>
<P>
 To check out the husband's story, prosecutors retained Audi of America to 
inspect the car's idling system and brakes. Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Connors said 
inspector Hans Gelke of New Jersey was testing the brakes on a surface street 
near the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall at the time of the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he stopped, he didn't see a car behind him," said Connors, who did not 
know if Gelke was cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Burns' attorney expressed concern that the evidence against her client 
has "changed" because of the crash. But Assistant Public Defender Jean Farley 
said she has not asked to have the Audi excluded from Burns' trial, scheduled 
to begin Monday. DWAYNE BRAY

PROP. 187 COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a devoted Times reader, I am disappointed in your biased publishing of 
mostly anti-187 articles and letters.In your Nov. 27 editorial of "Jail 
Overcrowding," you mention inmates will leave early due to insufficient space; 
you do not mention that 18% of California's inmates are illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 While you focus on children of illegals being victims, you do not mention 
compromising the education of legal children by overcrowding classrooms 
particularly in low-income areas where we have gang problems and lower rates of 
graduation.  
</P>
<P>
 Latinos see 187 as racial discrimination. However, it is more a rebellion 
against classrooms becoming overcrowded, our streets becoming more dangerous, 
and putting our systems into chaos.

THRIFTY PAYLESS EXECUTIVE REPLACED 7 MONTHS AFTER FIRM LEAVES L.A.; MERGER: 
CHAIRMAN OF BI-MART STORES UNIT WILL LEAD COMPANY. SOURCES SAID FORMER CEO DID 
NOT CONSULT SUFFICIENTLY WITH BOARD.

 Tim McAlear, the executive selected to lead the recently merged Thrifty and 
PayLess drug store chains, has been replaced just seven months after he 
persuaded Thrifty to move its headquarters from Los Angeles to Wilsonville, 
Ore., as part of the consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty PayLess, Inc., would not comment on the reasons for McAlear's 
departure but said he has been replaced by Marty Smith, chairman of the merged 
company's Bi-Mart stores division. Smith has also become chairman of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, which were made Friday, raise questions about past efforts to 
meld the two companies. On Tuesday, sources familiar with company developments 
said McAlear did not consult sufficiently with his board of directors on major 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board of directors believed that a change of leadership was appropriate," 
company spokeswoman Mary Ann Dunnell said, refusing further comment on the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlear was expected to lead the drug store giant before Thrifty and PayLess 
formally merged on April 20. The merger occurred after Kmart Corp., parent 
company of PayLess, agreed last December to sell the chain to Thrifty for $1.2 
billion. The deal was engineered by Leonard Green & Partners, a Los 
Angeles-based investment firm that controlled Thrifty.  
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Green was chairman of the merged firm's board of directors during 
McAlear's tenure. Green has relinquished that title to Smith, but remains on 
the board of the company, which has about 1,100 stores in 11 Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlear and Green were not immediately available for comment. However, 
Jonathan Sokoloff, a principle at Leonard Green & Partners, said the changes 
were unrelated to the financial performance of Thrifty PayLess.  
</P>
<P>
 "The company has done well and will continue to do well," he said "Business is 
continuing . . . with minimal disruptions." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it expects to generate annual sales of $4.7 billion. In the 
three-month period ended Oct. 2, the company's most recent fiscal quarter, 
Thrifty PayLess had a 3.3% increase in same-store sales -- revenue from stores 
open at least 12 months.

 Approval of Macy-Federated Merger Expected: The marriage of the once-fierce 
rivals, Macy & Co. and Federated Department Stores Inc., will bring to an end 
nearly three years in Chapter 11 bankruptcy for Macy.It will also form the 
nation's biggest department store chain, with more than 335 stores and annual 
sales exceeding $14 billion. Barring last-minute hitches, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge 
Burton R. Lifland will confirm the plan today. Federated will pay off more than 
$4 billion of Macy's debt and Macy will emerge from bankruptcy status later 
this month.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; O.C. DEBACLE, INFLATION FEARS SEND STOCKS, DOLLAR LOWER

<P>
 Orange County's bankruptcy filing and inflation warnings from Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan rattled the nation's financial markets Wednesday 
sending stocks prices and the dollar lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.43 points to 3,735.52. In the broader 
market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 5 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, while 283.49 million shares changed hands, down from 298.90 
million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes also fell, led by the Nasdaq composite index, which 
tumbled 6.96 points, or almost 1%, to 246.85. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sought bankruptcy protection on Tuesday following the disclosure 
of a $1.5-billion loss in its investment portfolio partly because of a highly 
risky strategy that backfired when interest rates began rising this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While most analysts do not believe stocks will be directly affected, the news 
had a negative "psychological effect" on the stock market as bond yields rose 
in response, said Bob Walberg, senior equity analyst at MMS International, a 
money management concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury yields rose, but shorter-term yields fell as investors dove 
into safe-haven securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee that economic growth 
has been stronger than expected. Greenspan said consumer prices could start to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the comments raised speculation the Fed may raise short-term 
interest rates as soon as its next policy-making meeting on Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar weakened against most key currencies, falling below 100 yen for the 
first time this week amid nervousness about the potential implications of the 
Orange County financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. currency closed at 99.94 Japanese yen and 1.568 German marks, down 
from 100.08 yen and 1.572 marks Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shares of major securities firms fell on the Orange County bankruptcy news. 
Merrill, Lynch & Co. dropped 1 1/4 to 35. Its asset management unit said its 
holdings of bonds and notes sold by Orange County fell to $60 million from $110 
million in July. 
</P>
<P>
 * Franklin Resources Inc. fell 7/8 to 35 3/4 after an Oppenheimer & Co. 
analyst downgraded the stock, citing Franklin's California municipal bond 
funds' potential exposure to Orange County. Morgan Stanley lost 1 5/8 to 56 
7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Big losers among the Dow average components were Caterpillar, off 7/8 to 52; 
IBM, down 3/8 to 71 1/4; Alcoa, off 3/4 to 82 1/8, and General Motors, down 3/4 
at 38 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stocks of health maintenance organizations fell after a trade group said 
enrollments would rise but premiums fall slightly in 1995. US Healthcare fell 2 
1/4 at 40 7/8 in Nasdaq trading. United Healthcare fell 2 3/8 to 43 5/8 on the 
Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continental Corp. surged 4 3/4 to 18 3/4 following Monday's news that it is 
to be acquired by CNA Financial Corp. for $1.1 billion cash, or $20 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alaska Air Group dropped 1 5/8 to 14 3/8 after two analysts downgraded the 
stock and cut earnings forecasts. 
</P>
<P>

 PriceCostco to End Mexican Joint Venture: The membership warehouse club 
retailer said it will pull out of its 3-year-old venture with Controladora 
Comercial Mexicana.The two companies announced a preliminary agreement under 
which Kirtland, Wash.-based PriceCostco will sell its 50% stake in Price Club 
de Mexico to Comercial Mexicana or to a company chosen by Comercial Mexicana. 
The move was prompted by the decision, announced in July, to split the U.S. 
retailer into two companies, PriceCostco and Price Enterprises Inc., 
PriceCostco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said. Most of Price 
Enterprise's assets are to be real estate holdings and an electronic catalogue 
system. There are 10 Price Club stores in Mexico.

 Thomas Spiegel -- An Oct. 29 story in The Times inaccurately reported the 
court testimony of Kenneth Heitz in the fraud trial of Thomas Spiegel, former 
chief executive of now defunct Columbia Savings & Loan in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The story reported that Heitz, Columbia's former general counsel, testified 
that Spiegel tried to keep $7 million in profits that rightly belonged to 
Columbia.The story reported that Spiegel had not disclosed his investment in 
Storer Communications warrants to Columbia's directors and went "ballistic" 
when Heitz confronted him with evidence of the alleged deception. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the news story confused the events of two separate meetings. 
According to court transcripts: 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Heitz recommended that Spiegel transfer his personal profits from 
stock warrants in Storer Communications to Columbia Savings because Spiegel had 
not gotten approval for the investment from Columbia's full board of directors. 
Heitz said that Spiegel complied with his request professionally -- without 
emotion or argument -- shortly after consulting his personal attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a separate meeting in 1989, Heitz said that he showed a prospectus 
for the Storer warrants to Spiegel and a colleague, David Sachs, that had been 
prepared by Drexel Burnham Lambert and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that meeting, Heitz testified, that both Spiegel and Sachs went 
"ballistic," in part because they had not known the document existed. They were 
also angry because investors such as Columbia Savings, which was a major 
investor in Storer securities, should have been given the opportunity to invest 
in the valued warrants by Drexel, Heitz said.

CITY SUGGESTS REVISIONS TO MASTER PLAN; DEVELOPMENT: COMMISSION WILL HEAR 
PROPOSAL TO DROP BUILDERS' 'TRIP FEES' RELATED TO GROWTH ALONG VENTURA 
BOULEVARD CORRIDOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Commission today hears suggested revisions to the 
master plan for the future of Ventura Boulevard, with city officials saying 
deep budget cuts won't harm the way the San Fernando Valley's main street will 
look 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 That's at least partly because some of the current budget projections turned 
out to be in error. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier, higher estimate set off a multitude of legal quarrels with 
developers of new projects, who were hit with assessments to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hear suggested changes from the departments of 
transportation and planning for dealing with expected development along the 
corridor that runs 17 miles from Studio City to Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the proposed revisions will be considered by the Planning and Land 
Use Management Committee of the City Council, then the full council. No date 
has been set for those meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The main subject to be discussed today is a proposal to eliminate "trip fees" 
-- assessments that boulevard developers had to pay based on the number of car 
trips that city officials estimated their developments would generate. They 
would be replaced by much lower fees based on the square footage of new 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed change follows the discovery that the original $222-million 
budget for improvements to the boulevard was almost $140 million too high, 
according to the transportation department. The surplus was attributed to an 
error in calculation, outdated projections of land acquisition costs and street 
widening plans later deemed unworkable or unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the planning department has scaled back projections for new 
development. Previously, planners had expected builders to create 8.6 million 
square feet of development by 2005, but now they expect only 4.1 million square 
feet by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 With less development expected, there will be less need for measures to deal 
with its effects, such as increased traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now suggested to reduce the budget to $77 million, and it will be 
difficult for those using the street years from now to tell the difference, 
transportation officials predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed changes, new turn lanes would still be added at 
intersections, relieving traffic congestion. Trees, special paving and benches 
would still be put in along the boulevard, creating a more pedestrian-friendly 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan has not substantially changed," said Robert H. Sutton, deputy 
director in charge of community planning. "The plan has been corrected to 
reflect both cost restructuring and errors, and it is hoped that this change 
will help us make the plan work better." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes have not disarmed the plan's critics. On one hand, some 
developers contend that they were forced to pay excessive trip fees under the 
previous system, which discouraged development. On the other, community leaders 
expressed concern that the proposed budget cuts will result in too little being 
done to ameliorate the effects of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee that helped the 
city draft the original plan adopted in February, 1991, predicted gridlock on 
the boulevard if the number of street widening projects is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I see is a chopping down of the fees to let the developers off the hook," 
he fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning department says the revised plan would result in widening 19 of 
the originally planned 30 intersections, although the transportation department 
says 25 would be widened. The proposed plan also cuts the budget for shuttle 
buses and public parking, while maintaining full funding for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board, 
which is now overseeing the plan, also said the proposed budget cuts have gone 
too far, particularly in funds to create additional parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain, who was responsible for alerting the transportation department to an 
arithmetic error it made that inflated the original budget by $73.6 million, 
agreed with Sutton that most of the plan remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Gaines, an attorney representing six property owners who have appealed 
their trip fees as being excessive, has said he believes that the new fees are 
still too high and that they will continue to discourage development on the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 As of November, 1993, 38 boulevard property owners had appealed $8.4 million 
of the $12.5 million in trip fees that had been imposed.
