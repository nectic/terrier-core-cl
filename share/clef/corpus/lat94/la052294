SURVIVING; PAIN IS THE EXPERIENCE OF A SINGLE PERSON, INEXPRESSIBLE AND 
UNSHAREABLE. BUT NO ONE'S INNER STRENGTH IS SUFFICIENT TO BEAR IT ALONE.; A

By Richard Selzer, Richard Selzer is a surgeon and the author of Down From Troy 
and Raising the Dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is only natural that a writer make the literary most of whatever happens to 
him. In April 1984 the distinguished novelist Reynolds Price was asked by a 
friend with whom he was walking why he kept slapping his foot on the pavement. 
It was the first faint whisper of the monstrous illness that would roar across 
his body for the next four years. For unbeknown, an eel-shaped tubular cancer 
had taken root and was compressing his spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next four years the author would undergo radiation to his spinal cord, 
multiple surgical procedures -- diagnostic, palliative and the last, one hopes, 
curative. In addition to the paralysis of the lower half of the body, there was 
a slowly ascending numbness to just below the nipple line. And there was pain, 
real and phantom, the latter no less severe for all its suggestion of 
unreality. It was suffering worthy of Job. On page after page, we are 
confronted by the downright ugliness of suffering, its senselessness. Pain is 
not noble; it is disgustingly ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 The reader tries to imagine the pain, but the language of pain is exclusive; 
it is a tongue spoken by one person only. The rest of us are not conversant in 
it, nor can it be conveyed in words. Never mind, we shall know it in our turn. 
There is some danger in the reiteration of pain, that it will eventually have 
an anesthetic effect no matter how persuasive the writing. In this, it is not 
unlike pornography that within minutes becomes tedious. The rapture of others 
cannot be rendered in words either; for that too we must wait our turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Whole New Life" is Reynolds Price's candid account of his ordeal, written, 
he announces, to furnish others in similar trouble "a companionable voice 
that's lasted beyond all rational expectation." He has written it years after 
the white heat of the events and from the vantage of the crippled survivor. 
Like many such recountings, I suspect it was written also to exteriorize the 
horror, to put a barrier of printed pages between himself and what can best be 
described as a re-enactment of Dante's "Inferno." Eschewing the novelist's 
proven gifts of style -- there is none of the elegance, nuance, ambiguity or 
wit of his powerful novel, "Kate Vaiden" -- he tells his story in a prose that 
is stripped down and pell-mell, utterly devoid of the pomp of language or the 
writer's vanity. The sentences come spilling out much as the facts were 
remembered, but the meaning of the sometimes clotted paragraphs is never in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the book tells of the few ups and the many downs in his agonizing 
struggle to live -- the progressive loss of strength and sensation and 
function. With each diminution, along with the author, we contemplate sadly the 
little that remains from the much that was. A good deal of the account is 
moving: his brother's preoperative kiss, and the fellowship of the "gimps" at 
the the rehabilitation center all striving to recover a modicum of 
independence. We cheer each brief respite from pain as we do his brave 
resumption of writing and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 What sustained him? There was a seemingly endless line of kind friends and 
acquaintances who committed themselves over long periods of time to assist 
Price in recapturing the pace of his life. One's inner strength is no match for 
suffering. It is not our own strength alone that will help us prevail, but the 
strength and commiseration of others. It takes courage to lean on others, but 
great suffering demands of us that humility. 
</P>
<P>
 Too, there is Price's lifelong belief in a God who is personally interested in 
him, if not always benevolent. This belief was made powerfully manifest just 
prior to the course of irradiation. The area on his back to be treated had 
already been marked out with purple dye. The radiation oncologist had informed 
the patient of all the possibilities. Shortly thereafter, Reynolds Price 
experienced an uncanny translocation in which he found himself lying on a slope 
by the Sea of Galilee in 1st-Century Palestine. Sleeping nearby were Christ and 
his 12 apostles all dressed in the tunics and cloaks of the time. In the 
distance he saw the town of Capernaum just as it was. Jesus looked much like 
the Flemish paintings of him, lean, "tall with dark hair, unblemished skin and 
a self-possession both natural and imposing." He rose, directed Price to 
undress, then led the naked man into the waters of Galilee. Now, existing both 
with and outside of his body, the author could see the purple marks on his 
back. Again and again Jesus poured handfuls of water over him. There was 
dialogue: 
</P>
<P>
 "Your sins are forgiven." 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I also to be cured?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That too." 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment Price's mind returned to the here and now, he has believed 
this event to be neither dream nor vision but "an external gift . . . of an 
alternate time and place in which to live through a crucial act." For Price, 
this experience had a tactile reality. It happened. Even the skeptical reader 
shivers in wild surmise. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who emerges from these pages is feisty, gritty, angry, sometimes 
snobbish and, notwithstanding, most appealing. He makes no effort to portray 
himself as a saint or a martyr. The clerk at the hospital is "sullen." The 
cardiac fitness participants are imagined as "a squad of garrulous heart-attack 
survivors in designer sweat suits." Many of the "true practical saints" who 
offer to help him are "boring as root canals." It is the radiation oncologist, 
cast as the villain, who bears the brunt of Price's anger and resentment. He 
has "all the visible concern of a steel cheese-grater"; he "never offered to 
tell me . . . "; he is "the frozen oncologist." 
</P>
<P>
 And here another physician must demur. Was it not this very doctor, among 
others, whose judgment and therapy brought about the cure of his patient? 
Surely, that he is not also gifted with charm or bedside manner might be 
forgiven? Some doctors, particularly those whose work brings them daily into 
contact with the gravely ill and whose treatments themselves augment the 
suffering, may function better when they withhold or even stifle pity, 
compassion, aesthetic response than when they allow these feelings full sway. 
Certainly there are great doctors who are also haughty, cold, materialistic and 
insensitive; just as there are great artists who fall short of expectations. 
Beethoven, Wagner and Richard Strauss were bigoted, angry, domineering. 
Schopenhauer and Rossini were scornful and misanthropic. Da Vinci and Goethe 
were detached, aloof and condescending. And then there was Robert Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in the final section of the book that Reynolds Price rises above the 
dreadful years and reaches out to his new life. It is a life full of 
satisfactions, work, friends and even erotic love. "Reynolds Price," he told 
himself, "is dead." And asked himself: "Who can you be?" The answer is: a 
writer and a teacher as before, only now with the patience and watchfulness 
born of suffering, and the blessing of whole days of focused energy undiluted 
by the distractions of the able-bodied. In the years since his illness, 
Reynolds Price has written 14 books. His last advice to the afflicted is to 
finish grieving for the former self, to reach out hungrily to the new and to 
find work that sustains the spirit. In writing "A Whole New Life" Reynolds 
Price has come, in the words of Adrienne Rich, "to see the damage that was 
done/ and the treasures that prevail." There can be no sweeter use made of 
adversity than this act of generosity that comes in the form of a book.

JUDGED BY HISTORY; WHAT MAKES A GREAT JUDGE -- HIS REASONING OR HIS VISION?; 
LEARNED HAND: THE MAN AND THE JUDGE, BY GERALD GUNTHER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $35; 
818 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sheldon M. Novick, Sheldon Novick is the author of Honorable Justice: The 
Life of Oliver Wendell Holmes (Dell). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Learned Hand's portrait has fixed itself in our memory: the lined face, 
the striking eyes. He leans forward, his hand thrust into the pages of an 
immense volume of law, and he looks up from under his bristling brows, 
patiently listening, disbelieving. The famous photograph was taken in 1952; the 
following year, Gerald Gunther became his law clerk and began to plan this 
biography, which he has been working at with varying degrees of intensity for 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that epochal year of service with Judge Hand he gives an intimate and 
moving account. It was the bitter McCarthy time, and Judge Hand was laboring at 
a solitary dissent on behalf of a man convicted of disloyalty. The grounds for 
the dissent were tenuous, and the judge went through 13 drafts in agony to find 
forceful expression for his sympathy. He asked his young clerk to listen to 
each draft, paragraph by paragraph, as he wrote. Gunther was "startled to find 
this experienced jurist, a near mythic figure, a household word to every law 
graduate, the master judge of his generation, asking for help and insisting on 
candid criticism. . . ." Hand held him close in this Socratic fashion, and for 
Gunther "everything that followed was anticlimactic." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years later we have this remarkable book, unlike any biography I know. 
It is a law professor's lecture expanded to the size of a Victorian 
life-and-letters, a huge construction of shadowy rooms and long corridors 
illuminated by occasional flashes of lightening. Its graceful and modest 
subject is sometimes in danger of being lost. 
</P>
<P>
 One is startled by the reminder that the well-remembered Hand was born in 
1872. He grew up in surroundings that might have been expected to produce a 
more complacent and less reflective character: His comfortably well-off family 
lived in Albany, a little way from the widow of the elder William James. Albany 
was then still a half-rural, half-Dutch provincial capital. Hand followed the 
conventional path of college, law school and a respectable Albany firm. But he 
was something of an outsider, an intellectual suspected of being a "sissy." He 
was restless and dissatisfied, without clear ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 His marriage to Frances Fincke changed his life. For them both, marriage seems 
to have meant escape from their insular circumstances. They went to New York 
City together, and there they lived affectionate but largely separate lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand's principal interests and pleasures lay within the then entirely male 
world of the courts, where he served a very long apprenticeship. After five 
unhappy years in private practice, he succeeded in being appointed a federal 
trial court judge in Manhattan in 1909. Hand seems not to have cared for the 
bulk of the work, which consisted of bankruptcy and admiralty law. The disputes 
over damage done by collisions between barges in New York Harbor, and squabbles 
among creditors over the assets of a bankrupt, were heard in shabby, poorly 
lighted rooms. Hand served for 13 years in these uncongenial surroundings, and 
he formed a permanently unfavorable view of trial court judges and all their 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 He remained so long in these lower depths largely because of his passionate 
attachment to Theodore Roosevelt's cause. It was Roosevelt who wooed him from 
the staid, conservative Democratic Party of Albany, and who with conscious 
charm in later years seemed to keep him in thrall. Hand campaigned for 
Progressive candidates, and while a sitting federal judge allowed himself to be 
named as a Progressive candidate for election to a state judgeship. This closed 
the door of promotion for many years, until Chief Justice William Howard Taft 
reached down and lifted him to the federal court of appeals in New York in 
1924. There, at 52 years of age, he began his true career. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand's attachment to Roosevelt was characteristic. He had fierce loyalties, 
and a weakness for men of action. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the dashing 
veteran of the Civil War, was his idol. He had a talent for friendships, and 
his close and troubled relation with Felix Frankfurter ran through his later 
years. Gunther portrays the complex character of Frankfurter, and the highly 
charged friendship between the two men, with great tact and clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court of appeals, Hand was free to devote himself principally to what 
interested him most, the writing of opinions. It was a highly collegial court, 
and most cases were decided by a panel of three judges. Judges, like other 
people, most often decide a question first and then try to express their 
reasons afterward. Hand was not a talented decision-maker; but he was a 
brilliant analyst. The portion of the work in which he excelled was the 
preparation of detailed and carefully reasoned memoranda for the other judges, 
analyzing each case, which then would often become the basis of the joint 
opinion, explaining their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther does not mention and perhaps fails to see that Hand refused to hire 
women long after the law schools had let down their bars. Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently recalled that when she graduated from law school 
with distinguished honors, Hand said he could not hire her because his language 
was too "salty" for a woman. There is a certain justice, I suppose, in having 
her appointed to the seat on the Supreme Court for which he yearned. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand evidently enjoyed his work. He was an intellectual, as one sees. One of 
the disappointments of his life was that he had no great originality of mind; 
he went into the law after being disappointed in his hopes of pursuing 
philosophy, George Santayana having discouraged his youthful efforts. He formed 
a thoughtful view of his work, however, in which he combined elements of 
William James' pragmatism and Holmes' jurisprudence into a very modern, 
personal doctrine of utter tolerance. His ironic, self-doubting tone was the 
voice of the intellectual of the post-war era. 
</P>
<P>
 He became very well known as a voice of moderation during President Truman's 
and Senator Joseph McCarthy's purges of the disloyal. It is true that he 
affirmed, in the United States v. Dennis case, the criminal convictions of 
officers of the American Communist Party, for advocating the overthrow of the 
United States government. His thoughtful opinion in that case argued that 
freedom of speech does not protect those who advocate violence. The Supreme 
Court upheld him, but the academic world has always had a great deal of 
difficulty in coming to terms with Dennis, and Hand himself continued to 
agonize over loyalty cases. Within the limits of his position as a judge he 
spoke publicly, which took some courage, against the illegal McCarthyite 
excesses of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 He cherished a lifelong ambition to sit on the Supreme Court: "I longed as the 
thing beyond all else that I craved to get a place on it," he said when the 
chance to do so finally passed out of his reach. Justice Felix Frankfurter, his 
mentor for 30 years, had undertaken a desperate effort in 1942 to have him 
appointed. Frankfurter was losing ground on the Court and he wanted Hand, his 
friend and ally, to join him before Roosevelt passed from the scene. But there 
was no chance of this -- Hand was already past 70, and Frankfurter himself was 
occupying the only seat to which there was a chance of Hand's being appointed. 
When Frankfurter's effort failed, Hand was freed of his yearning. His old age 
was marked by a new freedom and grace in his work, and an affectionate reunion 
with Frances. 
</P>
<P>
 His name had become well known, but his work was always highly specialized, 
and even among lawyers was known principally to experts alone. This poses a 
dilemma for Gunther, who has written his biography for a general audience. Some 
of Hand's opinions on intellectual property law are classics, but their elegant 
quality is difficult to convey outside the context of the law. How to present 
the appellate court opinions that were Hand's principal accomplishment? Gunther 
characteristically attacks the problem frontally; he gives in non-technical 
language detailed descriptions of dozens of Hand's memoranda and opinions. This 
method is not entirely satisfactory. The tone here is relentless praise, 
evidently because Gunther can't really show us how good Hand was, and so 
constantly has to tell us. The whole question of what qualities make for 
success in a judge needs more thoughtful consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 There is yet a third book in this vast volume, in some ways the most 
interesting of the three. It is Gunther's extended and dramatic presentation of 
constitutional law and history from a position he attributed to Hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther makes the fact that Hand never served on the Supreme Court the theme 
of his life. The biographer yearns to have had the great cases decided by Hand 
himself, for he thinks Hand would have done a better job than his idol, Holmes. 
And that may be; in many ways Hand's pragmatist thinking was more modern than 
Holmes'. But it is an odd theme for a biography. 
</P>
<P>
 The point seems to be to make Hand the spokesman for one side in a continuing 
debate. On the one hand are those who say that the Bill of Rights sets the only 
limits on the power of our national and state governments; and on the other, 
those who say the Civil War produced new and broader guarantees of equality and 
due process of law, which we found in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther makes the case for relying on the narrowly written provisions of the 
Bill of Rights. He likes to call his position "judicial restraint," although 
that begs the question. If the Civil War changed the nature of American 
government, and the 14th Amendment embodied that change, Gunther's heroes are 
not models of restraint, but judicial activists rewriting the Constitution. 
Gunther makes Hand the exemplar of this "judicial restraint." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Professor Gunther insistently calls Hand a liberal, using this as a 
term of praise, his views were closest to those now expressed by Justice 
Antonin Scalia. The battle lines have not shifted, but the armies have a way of 
exchanging uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there is too much of Gunther and not enough of Hand in this portion of 
the book. He lectures, entertainingly but dogmatically. He is entitled to his 
opinions, but one occasionally yearns to raise a hand and ask the teacher for a 
more balanced discussion. Hand as a constitutional scholar had the defects of 
his virtues, after all. His pragmatism and his tolerance left him without a 
hard core of moral principle, other than the principle of tolerance itself. 
Like Holmes, but for different reasons, he saw no limits on what the 
legislature might do, so long as it acted in proper form. This view of the 
Constitution would have left us with segregated schools, and with women 
criminally prosecuted for choosing abortions, points that Gunther omits to 
make. I don't think it does Hand a service to make these views, perhaps in some 
degree the fruit of disappointment, the theme of his life. They are his 
response to a specific historical setting (as perhaps Justice Scalia's are), 
and fall on the bank outside the broad current of constitutional law, as we 
find it in the decisions of the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its fascination, I must admit that the first 400 pages or so of this 
book are difficult going. Gunther is unwilling to let any detail go by without 
rendering a judgment upon it. The second half of the book, which deals with 
people and events that Gunther knew firsthand, is far better, and the 
cumulative effect of the last chapters is very powerful, although even here, 
Gunther rides his hobbies too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are understandable defects in a vast and passionate work, written by 
someone uniquely qualified for it. It is certain to be the definitive biography 
of Learned Hand, and when Gunther manages to forget the King Charles' Head he 
has made of the Masses case, and forgets for a moment to compare Hand with 
Holmes, he can write simply well, without excessive authorial intrusions. It 
would be unfair in any case to judge this biography by ordinary standards for 
books. It is a historical phenomenon in its own right, and the reader's 
patience, although often called upon, is richly rewarded.

RICHARD EDER: THE ROOT OF ROOTLESSNESS; A WAY IN THE WORLD, BY V. S. NAIPAUL 
(ALFRED A. KNOPF: $23; 380 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The word Caribbean may conjure up all kinds of vivid colors, but to V.S. 
Naipaul it suggests gray: a land and seascape bleached out by unmediated sun 
and a counterfeit history. It is the gray in the face of a professional 
entertainer the morning after a late night. 
</P>
<P>
 The displacing and alienating effects of a colonial past on today's 
post-colonial peoples has been Naipaul's leading theme ever since, once past 
his early Trinidad novels, he broke through the colors to the gray underneath. 
He has pursued it in his fiction and nonfiction, set in Britain, Africa, South 
America and India, the home of his forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of literature's great travelers and also one of its oddest. He seeks 
not roots but rootlessness. He travels not for acquaintance but for alienation. 
Paul Theroux does that, to an extent, but the difference is very large. For one 
thing, Naipaul, who can be petty, vain and cruel, both uses and transcends his 
defects. His theme is the terrible inauthenticity that history has imposed on 
the heirs of colonialism's subjects. But by refusing to conceal or temper his 
own crabby vision -- a walleyed sensibility that tends to swivel inward -- he 
achieves at his best moments a unique authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
 His nightmare Argentina, for example, can be unrecognizable but there is no 
question about the nightmares that it produces in Naipaul. When he is not 
displaying a certain haste and roughness (on purpose, perhaps, like a musician 
asserting his freedom to play sour), he is a great writer. In a magical and 
redeeming phrase he will suddenly link up the particular estrangements he 
acquires, wherever he goes, to the estranged wanderer in all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Way in the World" is a series of partly autobiographical and partly 
fictional variations on his theme. Each centers on a different personage, and 
Naipaul himself appears in many of them. The principal characters differ 
widely. There is a Trinidadian who uses his color sense as both a funeral 
parlor cosmetician and a cake decorator; and a conservative Port of Spain 
lawyer who unexpectedly reveals his flaming commitment to black power. There is 
a supercilious English writer who helps and patronizes the narrator; an 
itinerant Caribbean radical -- "an impresario of revolution" -- who is lionized 
by the radically chic in London and New York, and an enterprising Venezuelan 
who has submerged his identity as a Trinidadian Hindu. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the figures are historical. Naipaul writes a vivid fictionalized 
account of Sir Walter Raleigh, aged and desperate, seeking to discover El 
Dorado as a way out of his political troubles at home. He paints a poignantly 
imagined portrait of the early Venezuelan revolutionary, Francisco de Miranda, 
lifted up and let down by his British patrons and finally, betrayed by the 
supporters of Bolivar, dying in a Spanish prison. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance there seems to be little connection among the real, part-real 
and fictional characters he writes of. The styles differ considerably too: from 
factual documentary to a first-person combination of memoir and commentary to 
poetic evocation. In fact all of the protagonists are linked by their passage 
through the world of the Caribbean. It is a world that, instead of evolving 
gradually through slow migrations and evolution, was created in a kind of 
cataclysm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the space of a few years, the Spanish, the French and the British landed, 
fought each other, and shoved aside the Native Americans as unfit for their 
purpose. Their purpose was sugar plantations; and to accomplish it they brought 
over slaves from Africa and indentured laborers from India. And then, after a 
couple of centuries, they were gone; leaving behind a fragmented culture 
resting on a jumbled, conflicting, half-dreamed past. Naipaul doesn't draw the 
comparison, but one thinks of Prince Sigismund in Calderon's "Life Is a Dream." 
Arbitrarily immured in a tower from infancy, he suddenly finds himself -- 
arbitrarily released and royal once more -- in a wide and terrifying universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigismund went temporarily mad. Naipaul's characters are put together out of 
pieces that don't fit. Though not usually mad, they maneuver hybrid and 
uncertain identities through a world constructed of misapprehensions and are 
visited by undissolved bits of a heritage they are unconscious of. 
</P>
<P>
 In his gentle corpse-and-cake decorator, Naipaul sees an ancestral ghost of 
"the dancing groups of Lucknow, lewd men who painted their faces and tried to 
live like women." He adds: "He frightened me because I felt his feeling for 
beauty was like an illness; as though some unfamiliar deforming virus had 
passed through his simple mother to him and was even then . . . something 
neither of them had begun to understand." The lawyer, Evander, a properly 
British-mannered black professional in a still-colonial Trinidad, receives a 
courtesy visit from young Naipaul, about to depart for London on a prized 
scholarship. There is a starchy moment or two; then, startlingly, Evander 
raises his fist, smiles, and says: "The race! The race, man!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was meant as a secret, confraternal sign to a youth who was off to learn 
from the enemy and come back to fight. Except that Naipaul wasn't. He was off 
to gather the rewards that the British colonial authorities had implied would 
be his when he reached London with his prize. Instead there were years of 
misery, condescension and the grinding struggle to find himself as a writer. In 
his portrait of Foster Morris, an established author who helps him generously 
and then mortally offends him, Naipaul vents with gleeful malice his feelings 
toward the grip of British attitudes, not only on his country but also on his 
own divided nature. 
</P>
<P>
 But Evander mistook young Naipaul in another respect, as well. As a member of 
Trinidad's Indian minority, he felt no kinship with the black nationalist 
current that was to accompany independence in Trinidad and other parts of the 
Caribbean. On the contrary, he felt his own identity threatened; as he would 
years later in Africa, where the Indian middle class was a particular target of 
black politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubly rootless, doubly colonized, Naipaul draws his most blistering portrait 
when he writes of Lebrun. A cultivated, brilliant black Communist, Lebrun was 
adviser to a number of nationalist leaders in the independence days. Once in 
power, they had no use for him; his ideology was good for building up their 
strength but they had no intention of actually setting up a Marxist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he remained much in demand among left-wing circles in Britain and the 
United States. A penetrating review of Naipaul's early work -- Lebrun saw a 
political and social significance that the author himself was unaware of -- led 
to a short-lived friendship. Soon, Naipaul felt he was being colonized once 
more and broke away. The fashionable '60s formula for the Caribbean -- 
socialism -- was just as much an imperial imposition as anything the British 
had devised. In any case, like black nationalism, it took no account of 
Naipaul. His pursuit of Lebrun through a later career advising African 
dictators is perceptive, cruel and, like one or two other pieces, far too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Naipaul's angers can be useful as well as shrill, and usually directed at 
those -- British and black -- who exercise power. The finest portraits are of 
figures torn and fluttering through their lives and identities. His Miranda is 
one of the best things he has done, and he writes of the deluded Raleigh with 
unusual compassion. And there is the Indian whom Raleigh, assuming he comes 
from El Dorado, takes back to London to make up for the gold he couldn't find. 
In fact, Don Jose comes from the well-settled province of Nueva Granada 
(Colombia). His reflections on Raleigh and on European dreams have a haunting 
simplicity. Asked years later what difference he finds between the Europeans 
and the Indians, he answers with an irony that points up what Naipaul is after: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thought a lot about that. And I think, Father, that the difference 
between us, who are Indians, or half Indians, and people like the Spaniards and 
the English and the Dutch and the French, people who know how to go where they 
are going, I think that for them the world is a safer place."

STAY A MOMENT LONGER; PROFANE FRIENDSHIP, BY HAROLD BRODKEY (FARRAR STAUS & 
GIROUX: $23; 387 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Carlson, Ron Carlson is the author, most recently, of the story 
collection Plan B for the Middle Class. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The writer Harold Brodkey has made his true mark by taking language into 
cornices of human emotion and event that have been avoided or overlooked or 
underestimated by other writers. He opens these moments to view with a stunning 
accuracy that seems the very purpose of literature: the approach of essential 
mysteries of life with a sense made of words. At times, of course, he waxed 
poetic or beyond poetic, but at others he struck the note with an honesty that 
was simply arresting. It was clear, always, as I think it's clear in this new 
novel, that he is willing to stay a moment longer, reach for something -- a 
deeper sense or an essence -- that most books won't even attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Profane Friendship," it is noted in the front matter, is a book commissioned 
by the Consorzio Venezia Nuova, the group charged with the task of saving the 
city of Venice, and the book takes that city, or more exactly the light and 
mood of that city, as its locus. The lifelong friendship that is traced through 
the book is between the narrator Niles O'Hara, the son of an expatriate writer, 
and a Venetian youth Giangiacomo Gallieni, who takes the sobriquet Onni. The 
novel insists on a tight focus on the two, claustrophobic in its exclusion of 
the larger scene of Venice -- which is evoked primarily through "watershine and 
amoral sunlight." Thus it is appropriate that the narrator Niles' nickname is 
Nino, the anagram of his friend's. 
</P>
<P>
 Though their lives are in some ways parallel, they are not interchangeable. 
They meet as boys before the war and the novel takes them well into late middle 
age, when Niles has become a successful writer/screenwriter and Onni a famous 
and celebrated film actor. The book is Nile's record of their friendship, in 
Brodkey's conceit: "This book is meant to be no more than an attempt to give 
one small aspect of love in its dimensionalities and color, its silliness, as a 
confession of its importance to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the book is given to their youth: their prewar school days and their 
reunion after the war, when they begin an adolescent sexual exploration. 
Brodkey's examination of this relationship, from its dawning in the rough 
boy-play through its evolution to what Niles finally calls a "profane 
friendship," is the kind of intense, long set piece that defines Brodkey at his 
best. His understanding of the emerging sexual self is extreme, and through 
long unhurried scenes he shows that the two friends attract and repel each 
other, play roles, posture, act, act tough, talk about art, about love, about 
death and politics, and try the possibilities of what becomes an uncertain 
physical relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pull of the novel is not scenic, not illustrative, not literal, not 
linear. What is traced here is the inner heart of a friendship in all of its 
vagaries and nuance. The narrator has an "ambition to make the world as much a 
matter of one's own vocabulary of memory and experiences as a dream is." 
</P>
<P>
 These are very bright people and Brodkey's portrait of Niles' complex 
emotional life, the cautious development of a powerful and abiding ambivalence 
toward Onni, may be the masterstroke. Of course, Onni's life is one of 
extremes. As a child during the war he was raped, and the abuse makes him the 
tougher of the two, the mentor. He's 16 when Niles is 14; he takes the lead in 
their adventures. Niles, in his genius, measures his distance, at times 
becoming an unnervingly dispassionate observer. Onni's worldly habits and his 
destiny lead them both into rougher and rougher terrain, until inevitably 
flirtation leads them deeper into the Venetian night and they are degraded, or 
so Niles sees, and abased. Though we see him primarily with Onni, he sees his 
friend as a "monster." "I did so thoroughly in some sense, 'hate' him. I mean 
the history of our connection would be a live thing and ugly. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years -- the time a conventional novel might have used to give us the 
lives into which this friendship intruded, the basis by which we might have 
calculated its real effect on them -- are elided in this book, and we see the 
men again as old men, 60 or so, in Venice. They are still doppelgangers, Onni 
and Nino, meeting for walks and talks along the pedestrian boulevards in the 
ancient city's fabulous light. The writer and the actor each feel the full 
power of their careers, and the struggle now is manipulation and power. The 
days and the scenes are those of a dream, unanchored in a city that rinses in 
the sea tides everyday. The men -- devoid of the context of larger lives -- 
talk still about love and death and power in the shadow of a actual film they 
are making together. This remains abstract when we long for the concrete. And 
even early in the novel the reader will certainly know that we read this novel 
to see not what happened when and to whom, but simply to accompany Brodkey's 
brilliant and wandering inquiry into the choices and the absence of choice that 
accrue, later to be called self . 
</P>
<P>
 In light of Brodkey's recent personal essays on having AIDS, this novel seems 
to hold some fundamental place in his artistic and personal credo. Still it 
feels more successfully personal than public. To call "Profane Friendship" 
ambitious is to insult a seasoned hand, and that is not my intention. To 
describe the book as seminal, that being a notch deeper than realistic, rings 
true. It exists, as many works do for a time, in a zone utterly required of one 
life -- a book generated in a search for the redeeming aesthetic.

COVER STORY: LOGGING OFF; 'THE NEXT GENERATION' IS ALL GROWN UP, WITH ONLY 
MOVIES LEFT TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as TV series finales go, the last week of filming "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation," may not be one for the log books. Cast members move back and forth 
between TV and feature film wardrobe fittings and contract negotiations for the 
movie in which they'll reprise their syndicated TV characters. That film, "Star 
Trek: Generations," already has begun shooting on an adjacent sound stage, even 
as the successful syndicated series is winding down. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of all of it is a media feeding frenzy chronicling the end of 
the popular show, as the cast deals with very personal emotions. Saying 
farewell to fellow cast and crew members, who felt more like family after 
working together for 16-hour days, five days a week, 10 months a year for the 
past seven years, would not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 And not insignificantly, cast members have to focus on the real task at hand: 
filming the exhausting two-hour series finale, a time-traveling adventure that 
finds them 25 years in the future. Patrick Stewart, who plays Capt. Jean-Luc 
Picard, asks to be excused from interviews in order to concentrate on his work 
-- resulting in gossipy reports about his behavior on the set (see related 
story).  
</P>
<P>
 LeVar Burton, who plays Lt. Geordi La Forge, calls all the attention to the 
filming of the final episode a major inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens here is that the most important thing tends to get left behind, 
and that's the work," he says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 But outside the sound stages, where the cast trailers back up against each 
other to form a cozy sort of trailer park, a different picture presents itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really sad it's over," says Marina Sirtis, sitting in her trailer the 
afternoon before the final day of shooting. "I'll probably be the one who shows 
it the most," says the actress who plays the empathetic Counselor Deanna Troi. 
"I'm getting a bit misty thinking about this being the end. It's been the best 
time of my life. I feel like part of me is being amputated." 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Spiner, coated with yellow makeup for his role as the android Data, 
pokes his head into Sirtis' trailer. "I'm sorry I couldn't make it last night," 
he says, remorseful over missing a birthday celebration for Sirtis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," Sirtis says. "You sound so guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 "Guilt is my religion," he replies. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as Spiner relaxes inside his trailer, Gates McFadden's 2 1/2-year-old 
son toddles up to the screen door and waves enthusiastically: " 'Bye, Uncle 
Brent!" 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden, who plays Dr. Beverly Crusher, asked Spiner to be her son's 
godfather. Spiner smiles at the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Bye, Jack," he says like a child. "I'll see you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he'll miss the most, Spiner answers quickly: "Without question, the 
people. There's this huge bunch of friends who I come and play with each day. 
Not just the actors, but the crew and production staff. I have never had an 
ugly moment with anyone connected with this show." 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden, just back from shooting an hour ABC pilot called "Mystery Dance" in 
Oregon, is wistful. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was on location in Portland," she says, "I wasn't hanging around a 
studio, like I've been doing for years here, where your trailer opens up to 
someone else's trailer in the cast, and it's just like a coffee klatch. On 
location, I had a sense of being much more isolated. I'm going to miss this." 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the cast had hoped the successful "Next Generation" would be back for 
one more season; they were, after all, under contract for eight. But Paramount 
decided instead to turn this "Star Trek" generation into a feature-film 
franchise to make room for another TV series, "Star Trek: Voyager," scheduled 
to premiere on the new Paramount Network next January. ("Star Trek: Deep Space 
Nine," another spinoff of the original Gene Roddenberry series, currently airs 
in syndication.) 
</P>
<P>
 The $25-million feature film "Star Trek: Generations" involves a time nexus 
where Picard meets the original "Star Trek" captain, James T. Kirk, played by 
William Shatner. The rest of the "Next Generation" cast members say they get 
rather short shrift in the script, which they see as a transitional passing of 
the guard. But if the "Generations" movie plays to good box office in November, 
the "Next Generation" cast could see steady feature work for many years to 
come, as have the original Trekkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, they must adjust to a new reality: a return to the auditioning 
process. During Spiner's first audition several Sundays ago, for "Picket 
Fences" creator David E. Kelley's upcoming series, "Chicago Hope," a good-sized 
aftershock jolted those in the room. Spiner just kept on. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was getting ready to leave, David Kelley said to me, 'Wasn't that 
incredibly difficult for you, to audition after that experience?' " Spiner 
recalled. "And I told him -- and I meant it -- 'It was actually kind of good 
for me, because after the earthquake I wasn't the only nervous person in the 
room.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the cast are nervous about something else as well: falling victim to 
typecasting, which happened to many of the original "Star Trek" actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever part I play and, hopefully, I'll go on to more successful work, I 
will always be Counselor Troi to many people," Sirtis acknowledges. "As far as 
Marina the woman goes, it's OK, yeah. As far as Marina the actress goes, it's a 
concern, because I want to work again. There is the danger of being so 
identified with one role that you never do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside of the marriage I'm in, I've never done anything that has lasted this 
long," says Jonathan Frakes, who plays Cmdr. William Riker. "It's provided a 
security that's very rare for an actor, having somewhere to go every morning, 
knowing when you get there there will be laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having a steady job is going to be an adjustment. You go back seven 
years, and all of us were new faces. Now we have to go back out on the 
marketplace, where it's not pretty. I suppose you never get used to rejection, 
which is what part of being an actor is. But we'll go back out and fight for 
jobs with all of the same competition, only now we're seven years older." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dorn, who had to endure an hour of daily makeup as the Klingon, Lt. 
Worf, looks forward to the change. He feels he was growing stagnant as an 
actor. "I'm excited because it's ending, and my life is going to start over 
again. I don't have any idea what's out there. I don't have any idea what the 
business is like, because it's been seven years. But that's why I got in the 
business, for the excitement of getting out there and testing myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour series finale of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" airs Monday at 
8 p.m. on KCOP.

ARCHITECTURE; IT'S NO DAY IN THE COUNTRY; MOCA'S NEWEST EXHIBITION, 'URBAN 
REVISIONS: CURRENT PROJECTS FOR THE URBAN REALM,' TACKLES THE TOUGH ISSUES OF 
CONTEMPORARY URBAN DESIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. HINES, Thomas S. Hines is professor of history and architecture at 
UCLA. He has recently written a history of Wilshire Boulevard, The Grand 
American Avenue (1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its provocative new exhibition, "Urban Revisions: Current Projects for the 
Urban Realm," the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art solidifies its role as 
the West Coast institution most committed to the importance of the art and 
craft of architecture and the built environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its opening in the early 1980s, MOCA has presented half a dozen major 
architecture shows, the most successful of which was 1989's "Blueprints for 
Modern Living: History and Legacy of the Case Study Houses," curated by 
Elizabeth A. T. Smith and designed by Craig Hodgetts and Ming Fung. Though 
marred by a numbingly awkward installation design by architect Arata Isosaki, 
the ambitious retrospective of the architecture of Louis Kahn was the fullest 
explication, to date, of that designer's monumental achievement. Another high 
point was MOCA's 1988 seductive presentation of "The Architecture of Frank 
Gehry," organized by the Walker Art Gallery, Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is surely to be one of its more controversial offerings, "Urban 
Revisions" tackles the difficult, elusive subject of contemporary urban design. 
"It is the peculiar tragedy of this visual art," writes sociologist Richard 
Sennett in the exhibition catalogue, "that the urban designer has less autonomy 
than the painter, the sculptor or the photographer. Urban projects are realized 
only if the designer can cooperate at every step with banks, investors and 
government authorities." He could also have included bottom-line developers and 
the no-less-determined clusters of special interest groups, neighborhood 
associations and individual property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Urban Revisions" investigates 18 very different types of projects in a 
variety of scales and locations from grand master plans to modest neighborhood 
interventions from all sections of the country. It also includes a 
team-designed plan for the Fauberg Quebec section of Montreal, Canada, and a 
plan for the town center of Esslingen, Switzerland, by the L.A.-based firm of 
Angelil/Graham. Three of the most compelling (and cost-effective) schemes fall 
within the virtuous Green category, emphasizing an intense reliance on trees, 
grass and plants: Balmori Associates' Farmington Canal Greenway Project for 
Connecticut; Johnson, Fain, Pereira Associates' Greenway Plan for Metropolitan 
Los Angeles, and Achva Benzinberg Stein's Uhuru Garden in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would any sane art museum curator want to venture into such murky and 
dangerous territory? Thus far, few have even attempted it, and it is to MOCA's 
credit that, despite the risks -- and the resulting vulnerabilities of 
presentation -- Elizabeth Smith has had the courage, the wit and the artistic 
sensibilities to make a serious stab at confronting such critical urban and 
architectural issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When MOCA's godmother, the Museum of Modern Art, opened in New York in 1929, 
its dual mission was proclaimed to be the presentation, on the one hand, of the 
history of the "modern movement," and, on the other, the new, contemporary, 
less-established art that would constantly push the edges of the modernist 
sensibility. Most observers concur that while MOMA has succeeded gloriously in 
the first category, it has been absent or overly cautious in the latter. And it 
was this realization that made the founders of MOCA determine that, while 
chronicling the history of "contemporary" art since 1945, this museum would not 
lose its nerve in exploring the edges and dealing with that which had not yet 
been certified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Urban Revisions" exemplifies this commitment and demands an equivalent 
commitment on the part of the viewer. This is not an exhibition one glides 
through blissfully as one might do through a gallery of Impressionist 
landscapes. To get the full effect, the visitor must carefully read the texts, 
study the visuals, absorb the video components and interact empathetically with 
the projects, their designers and their users. It also helps to read the 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward is a richly heightened appreciation of the problems and 
possibilities of urban life and design. The collective power of the show is 
that it leads one, forces one, beyond the projects on the walls to the myriad 
situations, issues and landscapes not explicated in the museum. There should be 
something for almost everyone here, something that makes visitors think freshly 
about their own neighborhoods and cities and that forces them to seek, on the 
unwieldy landscape, other needy targets of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 If the psychological demands of this densely packed exhibition suggest a 
tedious viewing experience, that is happily not the case. Considering how 
boring most urban planning presentations are, the MOCA installation by ROTOndi 
Architects is engagingly hip. Combining raw, funky building materials with 
colorful visual effects into an image of skillfully controlled chaos, the show 
is a pleasure to experience with its varied attractions on the floor, the walls 
and even the ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of ROTOndi's mordant humor is the stacking of five boxes of weighty 
environmental impact reports (like so many Warhol Brillo boxes) in the midst of 
Los Angeles' controversial Playa Vista project. The exhibition is also 
relatively easy to navigate. Rather than a straight-and-narrow path from which 
the viewer must not deviate, there are directional options that give one 
choices without the possibility of missing a crucial section. One exception to 
the show's generally lucid explication is the practice, apparently fashionable 
in museums these days, of placing small-type, hard-to-read texts out of 
convenient eye range. There is no excuse for forcing viewers occasionally to 
squat or bend deeply to read texts that are nearly at floor level. 
</P>
<P>
 Such burdens are ameliorated, however, by the insouciance of the installation, 
in which ROTOndi was aided by ADOBE LA, an organization of Latino artists, 
architects and designers who observe and document the Latino physical presence 
in Los Angeles and create works that express and enrich that presence. In this 
exhibition, ADOBE LA has positioned specially decorated street vendor carts and 
poignantly composed roadway "shrines" throughout the galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the installation's most potentially controversial element, colorful 
explosions of artfully crafted graffiti splash the walls and ceilings of the 
usually white MOCA spaces. In this regard, the north wall of the main gallery 
is particularly stunning. While some viewers will enjoy such effects and will 
respect their connection to the show, others may have more trouble with the 
group's defense of graffiti and "tagging" on the actual L.A. landscape of 
public and private spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Such practices, ADOBE LA argues in their statement in the catalogue, "reflect 
and respond to the particular socio-cultural conditions and aspirations of 
urban Latino youth. Graffiti is not merely a reflection of social dysfunction, 
but more importantly a sign of creative resistance, spiritual tenacity and a 
cohesive, coherent and positive self-identity. In the context of ownership and 
appropriation of space, tagging is often used by gangs to delineate territory. 
Tagging is meaningless to mainstream culture because it is a code which is 
inaccessible." But does ADOBE LA not acknowledge the need and right of each and 
every citizen to define, present, decorate and defend his or her own spaces 
free from the intrusive tagging of others? 
</P>
<P>
 "Urban Revisions" is accompanied by a useful and attractive catalogue edited 
by Russell Ferguson and designed by April Greiman Associates. Elizabeth Smith's 
cogent introduction is followed by four essays of uneven quality. Pieces by 
sociologists Richard Sennett and M. Patricia Fernandez-Kelly offer valuable 
insights but fail to focus sufficiently on the business at hand. The essays by 
critic-historians Gwendolyn Wright and Mike Davis, however, provide incisive 
tie-ins to the discussion of contemporary urban design. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Inventions and Interventions: American Urban Design in the Twentieth 
Century," Wright makes the welcome observation that "architectural historians 
have often disparaged American modernism for its parochialism and lack of 
rigor, charging that this country's architects failed to grasp the true social 
and formal meaning of the modern movement. This template assumes a single, 
universal orthodoxy, obscuring the variety of national, regional and individual 
interpretations that in fact existed. . . . These alternatives should not be 
seen as deviations, but as vital evidences of modernism's real complexities." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' "Cannibal City: Los Angeles and the Destruction of Nature" is one his 
freshest essays to date. It provides a beautiful rationale for several of the 
exhibition's Green proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The revitalization of abandoned rail corridors and under-utilized water 
channels is the key element of Johnson, Fain, Pereira Associates' Greenway Plan 
for Metropolitan Los Angeles, a welcomed reaction to the alarming fact that 
"only 4% of the total area of metropolitan Los Angeles is dedicated to public 
open space and recreational facilities, contrasting with San Francisco and 
Boston's 9% and New York's 17%." From existing urban infrastructure, such as 
the former Pacific Electric's abandoned rights-of-way and the under-utilized 
basin of the Los Angeles River, the planners hope to synthesize a grid of 
public, green, open space and to give added structure and cohesion to the city 
with connected systems of commuter and recreational bike trails, walkways, 
jogging paths and linear recreational park spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic "before and after" photographs and drawings suggest ways in which 
dull wastelands can be enlivened and where even the environs of such landmarks 
as Watts Towers can be greatly enhanced. The planners offer a winning rationale 
in their citing of the role of public open space in the traditions and social 
patterns of a number of L.A.'s diverse ethnic cultures and in their reminder 
that conversion and maintenance of such areas could provide a steady source of 
jobs. This plan seems so obviously valuable for all the citizens of Los Angeles 
and so relatively feasible and affordable that one wonders why it has taken so 
long for someone to come up with it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a much more modest and localized scale, Achva Benzinberg Stein's proposal 
for Uhuru Garden, at Grape and 103rd streets in Watts, seems equally 
therapeutic, appealing and practicable. Conceived as a two-and-a-half acre 
demonstration public garden project, the site is adjacent to Jordan Downs, the 
largest public housing project in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Uhuru includes a community "victory" garden for 60 individual family plots, a 
market garden with street merchandising outlets, a horticultural teaching area 
for the Watts drug rehabilitation program, a recycling and composting area, an 
herb garden and orchard, and a demonstration garden of drought-tolerant plants 
native to Southern California, Latin America and Africa. To encourage job 
training for work in various Green industries and to reinforce the idea of 
purposeful service to one's community, access to Uhuru Garden and its 
satellites and successors will be limited to those who work, volunteer or study 
on the site. It is another idea that should have happened already. 
</P>
<P>
 In vibrant counterpoint to these refreshingly practical "green" plans, MOCA is 
to be commended for bravely reopening the "Steel Cloud" controversy. In this 
high-tech winning entry in a 1988 city-sponsored competition for a West Coast 
Gateway immigration monument, the New York-based firm of Rashid/Couture 
designed an elegant metaphor of the late 20th-Century (post-) machine age that 
would occupy the air space over a major downtown freeway -- a living monument 
accommodating galleries, libraries, cinemas, parks and plazas "that are 
intersected by the fluid and transient space of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shifts in funding priorities" and the heated controversy over the winning 
scheme's appropriateness determined that the "Steel Cloud" would unfortunately 
not be built. While it struck some as "chaotic" and even "threatening," and was 
portrayed in the media as a "monumental folly," others defended it as a "deeply 
poetic concretization of the nature of its site and moment in time." Smith 
reintroduced it into the current exhibition because she believed that the 
polemic obscured "one aspect of the project's potential role as connective 
tissue within the urban fabric by its reclamation for pedestrian, cultural and 
recreational usage of an otherwise dead zone of space over a sunken freeway in 
a city center." 
</P>
<P>
 Certain projects in "Urban Revisions," such as Agrest and Gondelsonas's 
"Vision Plan" for Des Moines, Iowa, seem overly schematic and dauntingly 
opaque. Others, such as Studio Works' wry "Conceptual Master Plan for Grand 
Center, St. Louis" are, like most of that firm's work, beautiful to experience 
as works of art though difficult to read as realizable urban design. In fact, 
most of the exhibition's entries have liabilities as well as assets, the former 
of which the MOCA curators have been nonjudgmentally reluctant to criticize. 
</P>
<P>

 A partial exception comes in the presentation of the much-disputed Los Angeles 
Playa Vista project of Maguire-Thomas Partners. Planned for the last sizable 
area of open land in the L.A. coastal region, Playa Vista is intended to house 
25,000 people in a densely developed tract. Praiseworthy features include the 
containment and treatment of its own waste water and the ostensible 
"restoration" of the adjacent Ballona Wetlands, one of the few remaining tidal 
marshes in Southern California. In his catalogue essay, Mike Davis observes 
that "even giant developers like Maguire Thomas have learned to speak 
impeccable Green -- if only, in the cynical view of some, to better despoil the 
last remaining wetlands." The ecologically progressive intentions of the 
planners and the commitment to "affordable housing" by their team of architects 
(generally characterized as "Post-Modernist" and "Neo-traditional") go far, in 
the view of curator Smith, to counterbalance "the historicist and vernacular 
impulses of that movement's urge to re-create community on the model of a 
turn-of-the-century American town." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Smith does not go far enough in lamenting the fact that the turn from 
the 19th to the 20th Century is the architectural model for a development 
occurring as the world now turns from the 20th into the 21st Century. With the 
exception of designs by such members of the team as Ricardo Legoretto, the 
problem with Playa Vista is its generally regressive architecture, its pastiche 
of historicist vocabularies parading as a "model community." In looking at its 
models and drawings of mimetic quotations from the past, one wonders what such 
stuff is doing in a Museum of Contemporary Art. Since most "post-modernist" 
architects are said to admire "theme parks" and especially Disneyland, one 
wonders if Playa Vista could not include a Tomorrowland that would engage 
progressive architects and provide alternative visions for the 21st Century.  
</P>
<P>
 The chance and the motivation to raise such questions is the ultimate payoff 
of "Urban Revisions." While encountering the projects, you reassess old values, 
old positions, old solutions, and when you leave the museum, you look at life, 
and the city, differently.

 I innocently began to read "The Twilight Zone" (by Patt Morrison, April 24) on 
my way to the crossword puzzle and unexpectedly bumped into some implied ethnic 
slurs and geographical sour grapes. Calling Steven Spielberg cheap and 
minimizing New York City's entertainment resources by implying that they are 
limited to three other prominent Jewish males was nicely offset by three 
anti-American digs.

 If taking swipes is the thing to do, how about finding a new angle instead of

 I agree with Morrison on the business cadence set by the East Coast simply 
because of its three-hour time advantage. However, I'm willing to contemplate 
how to stay competitive in the business world while I watch the sun set over 
the Pacific. There's a good reason people live in Los Angeles, and it's not 
just because they're all insomniacs.

 Morrison seems unaware that department stores display seasonal clothing (i.e. 
wool in August) several months before the beginning of the actual season. 
August is most assuredly not "sweater weather" in New York City either.

THE WRATH OF ROTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jill Stewart's chronicle of the trivia contest I'm conducting to sell my home 
("The Real Real Estate Game," Palm Latitudes, April 24) bears little relation 
to the actual contest. 
</P>
<P>
 To my statement that the attorney general's office reviewed my contest and 
decided to take no action against it, Herschel Elkins of the attorney general's 
office is quoted as saying that that is news to him.It shouldn't be, though. 
His office's letter of Nov. 10, 1993, to my attorney said as much. 
</P>
<P>
 And, by the way, my first name happens to be Scott, not Steven; my mother 
insisted that I make this correction. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOTT ROTH 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart responds: I apologize for the name error. However, the letter Scott 
Roth refers to said that Elkins' office had decided not to proceed at that time 
with litigation against Roth but that Elkins would be monitoring the contest, 
adding that this should not be construed in any way as endorsement or approval.

 Your puff piece on John Garamendi ("The Loner," by Bill Stall, April 24) 
missed two minuses (and, to be fair, one plus). 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Garamendi's principal achievements were to increase the state 
Department of Insurance budget and to drive a number of insurance companies out 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Garamendi has come out in favor of the no-fault concept, 
which, because of pervasive fraud, is the only system that will ever bring auto 
insurance rates down. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A photograph accompanying the Garamendi article showed the commissioner 
picking artichokes. How many did he actually pick -- ouch! -- without gloves? 
Judging from the expression on his face, at the time the picture was taken, he 
may have already picked one or two -- ouch! Those prickly thistles can draw 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer is to be commended for an excellent example of truth in 
advertising.

<P>
 The most distinctive aspect of this Berkeley-educated bureaucrat's career 
stems from a job title that could have come out of the pages of "Atlas 
Shrugged": state insurance commissioner. Emboldened by the socialist bromides 
of John F. Ken- nedy's New Frontier, Garamendi and his bunch have launched an 
assault on every individual right from a medical livelihood to ownership of 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his comrade, Rhodes scholar Bill Clinton, Garamendi is the 
personification of the follower. He has accepted every statist notion he's been 
offered. His ideas are not new; his principles are the dying gasps of 
socialism. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I'm not certain that Garamendi represents the best interests of the citizens 
of California. Nor am I convinced that he would be an honest governor or an 
effective one. But he does, however, represent a new type of politician: one 
who uses the public interest for his own purposes under the guise of serving 
it. 
</P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
 Garamendi does have a "beautiful family," but on a planet that's reeling from 
the effects of overpopulation, isn't it incumbent on our public officials to 
set a better example -- two children, for example, instead of six? That 
supposedly well-educated couples consider it perfectly OK to have six children 
astounds me. 
</P>

 In my opinion, and with all due respect, I think John Garamendi is pure hokum.

 With a substantial number of drivers in California currently operating 
vehicles without automobile insurance, perhaps the commissioner should sideline 
his political ambitions until the uninsured motorists problem is solved.

THE CAPTAIN'S ROUGH EXIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the Enterprise's intrepid captain, the final few pressure-packed days 
filming the last of the popular "Star Trek" spinoff tested his reputation for 
accessibility. In virtually every scene of the two-hour finale, popular actor 
Patrick Stewart was in and out of costumes and makeup that took him across 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the finale didn't take him was to polite conversation with the media, 
for whom he declared himself off-limits. In a flash, the popular leader of the 
starship became the enfant terrible of the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was simply overwhelmed," explains Stewart, several weeks later in one of a 
handful of phone interviews after the finale wrap. "I was getting deeply tired 
and very overwhelmed by the work, coming as it did at the end of the season. 
That's why I had to say, 'I cannot talk to people.' Whatever time I had, I 
needed for the show." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not being grand or a prima donna. I'm somewhat flattered by the idea 
someone thought me a prima donna. Perhaps now I'll have time to learn to be 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Stewart wraps shooting the feature film, "Star Trek: Generations," in 
July, he plans to unwind for a couple of months at his home in Yorkshire Dales, 
England, near where he was raised. While he purchased the house last year, he's 
not had time to spend more than a couple nights there, until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will spend my time playing house and walking a great deal and breathing in 
the best air in the world and doing nothing but listening to skylarks," he 
says. "Although a number of interesting offers have come up, none of them have 
really been enough to lure me away from the moor top." 
</P>
<P>
 When the noted Shakespearean stage actor was hired seven years ago as the 
captain of the Enterprise, he was trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to mount a 
production of Edward Albee's play "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" in London's 
West End. 
</P>
<P>
 When he goes back to England, he will literally pick up where he left off. He 
has a producer and a director, and he credits his "Next Generation" notoriety 
for making it possible. Stewart has not found his "Star Trek" identity to be 
the albatross he feared it might become several years back. He has worked 
steadily, when he has found time, doing everything from small TV and film 
parts, to commercial voice-overs to a Broadway production of "A Christmas 
Carol." 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, I haven't found it constricting," he says. "I've only found my career 
opportunities expanding. It has practically given me, personally, an audience, 
a following and a support I haven't had before. So now I can pursue and 
initiate projects I want to do. At the moment, I only see myself as being a 
very, very lucky man." DANIEL CERONE

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plunking citified types Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern and Bruno Kirby onto the 
range may not be the freshest of gambits, but it's a funny one all the same in 
the uneven but hugely popular 1991 City Slickers (ABC Sunday at 8:30 p.m.). 
Midlife crises confront these longtime buddies on their two-week vacation from 
unrewarding jobs and family hassles. On the cattle drive from New Mexico to 
Colorado, black-garbed trail boss Jack Palance, in an Oscar-winning 
performance, gives even the cattle the willies. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lethal lack of humor in HBO's mostly dull, lumbering 1993 remake of 
the 1958 sci-fi movie Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.). Daryl 
Hannah stars as a rich, suppressed, bullied, passive homemaker who is turned 
into a tough, marauding giant by a spaceship from another galaxy. This attempt 
at an "Attack of the 50 Ft. Feminist" works as neither spoof nor a message 
about female empowerment. Big woman, big flop. 
</P>
<P>
 Days of Thunder (CBS Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a flat 1990 retooling of "Top 
Gun" as a race-car saga, starring Tom Cruise as an enigmatic Californian with a 
bummer of a past and a burning need to prove himself. The best part is the 20 
minutes of footage on the NASCAR racing circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Lumet's zesty 1982 Deathtrap (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.) has a plot 
that's absolutely not mentionable without spoiling the fun. The cast is 
splendid: Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth and Henry 
Jones; the setting is a wonderfully elegant converted windmill country house. 
Skillfully adapted from the Ira Levin play by Jay Presson Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Maid to Order (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.) is an amusing 1987 comedy in which a 
rich, spoiled Ally Sheedy ends up working as a maid in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Entertainers (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a misfired, sentimental, 
seriocomic 1991 TV movie teaming Bob Newhart and a chimp as a vaudeville team 
desperately trying to break into the big-time Vegas venues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toll of the Sea (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.), a 1922 two-strip Technicolor 
production restored by UCLA, is a charming "Madame Butterfly"-like romance 
about an exquisite young Chinese woman (Anna May Wong) who rescues a handsome 
American (Kenneth Harlan) from drowning only to be betrayed by him.

 THE LOST AND FOUND AND OTHER STORIES by Anne Marsella (New York University 
Press: $24 cloth, $10.95 paper; 198 pp.). Most of the characters in the 10 
stories making up this collection are profoundly alone, usually in a foreign, 
adopted city.They aren't exactly lost, however, as the title might indicate: 
most, in fact, are willfully alone, in part no doubt because of their 
eccentricities. That's what makes "The Lost and Found" an interesting book -- 
Anne Marsella's ability to trace the lives of misplaced people without 
condescension or melodrama, to imagine the everyday frictions of self-imposed 
exile (which the author has no doubt experienced herself, being a Fresno native 
now living in Paris). In the title story, a half-Irish, half-Mexican game-show 
employee seeks reunification with her unknown father through a newspaper 
advertisement directed at St. Jude; in "The Roommates," two women emigrants 
from Nigeria and Turkey work for a Greek sweatshop foreman in Paris, and are 
happy for a time to share his bed, and each other; in "The Builder," a 
clubfooted Egyptian cameraman emigrates to France on the basis of a dream, 
saying "From my hands I will build palaces"; in "The Mission San Martin," a 
Franciscan father in California, apparently homesick for France, pleads with 
parishioners to fund a cooking school rather than a midwifery clinic. 
Marsella's characters are not commonplace, and she makes them memorable without 
turning them into caricatures. It's impossible not to like the young Nigerian 
in "Like Father Like Son" who says, when jilted by his girlfriend for a man 
with a palatial Paris apartment, "I was understanding that Hilda is preferring 
the wealths to the loves."

JENNINGS' ANTI-NIXON STANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding ABC's television coverage of former President Nixon's death and 
subsequent commentaries: I watched most of Henry Kissinger's interview and all 
of Barbara Walters'.Both were informative and respectful. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Peter Jennings could barely contain his hatred of Nixon and came 
across as petty and extremely prejudiced, besides showing an overabundance of 
poor taste. Comparing his attitude with President Clinton's moving announcement 
of Nixon's death, as well as his eulogy, Jennings appeared to be a small, mean 
newsman.

 BRAHAUS by Samuele Mazza. (Chronicle: $16.95.) Wait! Put out the bonfire in 
the back yard! Cancel tomorrow night's ritual neighborhood bra-burning and 
potluck supper! Do not, repeat, do not burn another bra! Designer Samuele Mazza 
has written a "manifesto for the liberation of the brassiere."Inspired by the 
likes of Chanel, Cocteau, Juan Gris, Picabia, Derain, Schiaparelli, Warhol and 
some other surrealists, Mazza set out, in several projects, to 
"decontextualize" clothing (much more fun than deconstructing text), 
particularly accessories such as shoes, T-shirts and brassieres. Organized in 
chapters titled "Edible and Domestic," "Mechanical and Dynamic," "Primitive and 
Natural," and my favorite, "Urban and Perverse," "Brahaus" decontextualizes 
this historically maligned piece of underwear to the point where you may not 
recognize your own breasts. Look at it as an antidote to the Victoria's Secret 
catalogue. SUSAN REYNOLDS

TO MY MOTHER, BY WENDELL BERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was your rebellious son, 
</P>
<P>
 do you remember? Sometimes 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if you do remember, 
</P>
<P>
 so complete has your forgiveness been. 
</P>
<P>
 So complete has your forgiveness been 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder sometimes if it did not 
</P>
<P>
 precede my wrong, and I erred, 
</P>
<P>
 safe found, within your love, 
</P>
<P>
 prepared ahead of me, the way home, 
</P>
<P>
 or my bed at night, so that almost 
</P>
<P>
 I should forgive you, who perhaps 
</P>
<P>
 foresaw the worst that I might do, 
</P>
<P>
 and forgave before I could act, 
</P>
<P>
 causing me to smile now, looking back, 
</P>
<P>
 to see how paltry was my worst, 
</P>
<P>
 compared to your forgiveness of it 
</P>
<P>
 already given.And this, then, 
</P>
<P>
 is the vision of that Heaven of which 
</P>
<P>
 we have heard, where those who love 
</P>
<P>
 each other have forgiven each other, 
</P>
<P>
 where, for that, the leaves are green, 
</P>
<P>
 the light a music in the air, 
</P>
<P>
 and all is unentangled, 
</P>
<P>

 MORTGAGING THE EARTH: The World Bank, Environmental Impoverishment, and the 
Crisis of Development by Bruce Rich (Beacon Press: $29; 376 pp.). The Catholic 
church in Brazil refers to them as inhabitants of the "Fourth World" -- the 
millions of refugees created, rather than housed and fed, by global development 
programs. It's a problem grossly undercovered in the West, mainly because 
Western-style growth is assumed to be an unalloyed blessing, but in "Mortgaging 
the Earth" Bruce Rich catalogues its unexpected, nasty underside. Rich, an 
attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, is no disinterested observer, but 
his account of the Fourth World -- largely created by the World Bank, for which 
Rich once consulted -- is as credible as it is shocking. With "blanket 
paternalism and breathtaking naivete," Rich writes, the World Bank has for 
decades attempted to remake undeveloped countries in the West's image, 
regardless of native culture and economic realities -- a road the bank can 
follow because it controls tens of billions of dollars that poor, 
self-interested governments hope to tap. "Mortgaging the Earth" is overlong and 
over-detailed -- the parallels Rich makes between the World Bank and Goethe's 
"Faust," for example, are too wooden to be effective -- but nonetheless 
important, for the World Bank (which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year) 
has operated for decades without significant oversight. "Mortgaging the Earth" 
should change that . . . though considering the bank's entrenched power and 
wealth, that hope may be forlorn.

 Obviously, Janet Kinosian can't see the word for the prose (as in "forest for 
the trees") in "Publicist Patois" (L.A. Speak, Palm Latitudes, April 24). The 
"Nightline"-originated word for Kissinger-type experts, "jaboney," is a verbal 
diminutive of "jaw-boner."

AN L.A. FLAKER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Peter Deep's letter (April 17) referring to California being called 
the state for "fruits and nuts" as "California bashing" with a "subtle anti-gay 
message" (L.A. Speak, Palm Latitudes, March 30): That joke has been around for 
about 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't people laugh anymore? I may not be a fruit, but I am a 71-year-old 
California-born nut; I may even be a flake and am proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there so much resentment? Why can't you pass someone in the grocery 
store and smile and nod? Who cares who or what they are? 
</P>

 And they might smile back at you -- and surely make your day.

 VIRTUAL LOVE by Avodah Offit (Simon & Schuster: $22; 318 pp.). It's got a 
rousing fictional set-up -- the unhappy sex therapist obsessed by the 
beautiful, mortally ill virgin/whore, a patient whose vaginismus prevents her 
from being sexually penetrated.It also has a shocking conclusion, and a 
singular form, consisting of the e-mail letters between the hot-and-bothered 
therapist and his female mentor. For all that, though, "Virtual Love" is a flop 
as a novel, psychiatrist and sex therapist Avodah Offit being unable to give 
her over-the-top story, or exaggerated characters, much depth. Toni, the 
virgin/whore, is little more than a plot device providing San Francisco 
therapist Marc Martell with an excuse to contact Aphra Zion, ostensibly for 
professional advice but soon for confessional purposes. The two communicate 
electronically, and we voyeuristically read their correspondence, plus Aphra's 
private, computer-filed reactions to Marc's troubled and troubling missives. 
It's mainly in these entries that Offit, author of the nonfiction "The Sexual 
Self" and "Night Thoughts: Reflections of a Sex Therapist," writes 
compellingly; Aphra's recollections of her youth, marriages and medical 
training make the virtual and vaginismal aspects of the book seem like 
overheated gimmicks. There is a novel here struggling to get out, but it 
belongs to Aphra, not Marc: He's a selfish and not very interesting character, 
the sort of sex therapist who gives sex therapists a bad name.

 Ruth Forman's letter (May 1), in commenting on Patt Morrison's "Easier Said 
Than Done" column (Three on the Town, April 3), took issue with the idea that 
the foreign-born should bear the main responsibility for communicating with us. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone going to any other country is mainly responsible for making themselves 
understood.That applies not only to foreigners who come to the United States 
but also to Americans who go somewhere else. And all of us owe patience and 
courtesy to everyone else and should help as much as possible with attempts to 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because Forman is a communications specialist does not give her the 
authority to spell out the responsibilities of the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 I have learned other languages by living in other countries. It is visitors 
who have the primary obligation of making themselves understood.

 STORIES OF SCOTTSBORO: The Rape Case that Shocked 1930's America and Revived 
the Struggle for Equality by James Goodman (Pantheon: $27.50; 465 pp.). "When I 
hear the word culture ," Hermann Goering is supposed to have said, "I reach for 
my pistol." The reader is likely to have a similar reaction while perusing 
"Stories of Scottsboro," only the hot-button concept in this book is "states 
rights" and its remedy, federal law. In the 1930s, Alabama officials held 
nearly a dozen notorious trials intent on convicting the so-called Scottsboro 
Boys, black youths (ages 13 to 19) accused of raping two white women on a 
freight train, and won conviction every time, despite meager, manufactured and 
coerced evidence. The nine defendants, whose innocence is now beyond dispute, 
would have been executed were it not for the Bill of Rights and the U.S. 
Supreme Court, which twice overturned their state convictions. James Goodman, a 
history professor at Harvard, tells the complex story in 54 chapter-length 
vignettes, dexterously weaving issues and episodes into a malignant tapestry -- 
what the star of the book, defense attorney Samuel Leibowitz, called "a 
carousel of hate." Goodman shies away from the idea that "Stories of 
Scottsboro" is definitive -- he writes in the preface that he has "created the 
illusion of stillness, or comprehensible movement, out of the always seamless, 
often chaotic flow of consciousness and experience" -- but it's hard to imagine 
a more complete, or more compelling, version of the Scottsboro events. 
(Footnote, apropos Goodman's aversion to historical certainty: the new edition 
of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations attributes the infamous "pistol" quote above 
to Nazi writer Hanns Johst.)

 SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE by Donna Williams (Times Books: $23; 288 pp.). Donna 
Williams became a celebrity of sorts a few years ago when she published "Nobody 
Nowhere," the gut-wrenching account of her life as an autistic.She continues 
the journey in this volume, and again shows herself to be a woman of great 
bravery and intelligence: once, when asked to explain how she differed from 
everybody else, Williams replied, "I'm a culture looking for a place to 
happen." So she is -- and it's a constant battle, for although in "Somebody 
Somewhere" Williams is increasingly able to control her autism, she often can't 
tell where her one-woman culture begins and her life-long affliction ends. When 
she writes of an airplane flight, "I wondered if I'd be there when Tim met me," 
she means it; relationships were often so difficult for Williams that she 
retreated into an unresponsive "dead" self or invented affectless characters 
capable of operating in what she calls "the world," leaving her true self alone 
inside. In "Somebody Somewhere" Williams describes her ongoing self-education: 
earning a teaching degree, exploring her identity through individual therapy 
and above all learning to be human -- a simultaneously exciting, terrifying and 
painful experience, for she rarely perceives herself as anything other than a 
stranger in a strange land. As Williams evocatively puts it, "I learned to use 
the words know and feel like a blind person uses the words see and a deaf 
person uses the word hear ." This volume doesn't hold the same fascination as 
"Nobody Nowhere," but that's to be applauded: its apparent "normality" is 
evidence of the great strides Williams has made in conquering her malady, and 
will give much comfort and hope to fellow victims.

 IN THE CITIES AND JUNGLES OF BRAZIL by Paul Rambali (Henry Holt: $23; 266 
pp.). "The smell of Brazil," writes journalist Paul Rambali, "is composed of 
sugar molecules -- the hot, sweet, smell of baking sugar that wafts from the 
padarias , the bakeries and coffee shops; and the smell of Gasohol, the potent 
mix of sugar-derived alcohol and gasoline that powers many of the cars." That 
sentence nicely captures the tone of this travel book: lyrical and unexpected, 
intent on highlighting the color and contradictions of Brazil. You could fill a 
long shelf with travel books about South America's largest country, but 
Rambali's is exceptional because it approaches Brazil sideways, not through 
touristic stereotypes. Although he writes about carnaval and the rain forest, 
and meets with hyper, blond children's TV star Xuxa, he first went to Brazil to 
pursue a much less familiar story -- that of escaped mobster Escadinha, the 
Robin Hood of Rio de Janeiro's slums ( favelas ), which stand cheek-by-jowl 
with the city's chic high-rises. Rambali, author of "French Blues: A Journey in 
Modern France," doesn't judge Escadinha nor any other Brazilian, content to 
describe their charged and difficult lives: the street children who can be 
killed, if bothersome, for $70 (the star of the film "Pixote," which made the 
children famous in 1981, was shot to death by police six years later); the new 
religious leaders, who have turned their brand of exploitative, miracle-based 
Christianity into a lucrative business; the Beijoquero , or the Serial Kisser, 
able to plant a fat one on every visiting celebrity (including the Pope, on his 
foot) except George Bush.The best parts of the book, however, deal with 
Brazilian television, especially the making of its ubiquitous telenovelos , or 
soap operas. The broadcasts are appalling -- but entrancing, too, as befits a 
country that seems truly dedicated to sensory overload.

 Sunday's Masters of Illusion: The Wizards of Special Effects reveals secrets 
behind Hollywood's most spectacular special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by "seaQuest DSV" stars Roy Scheider and Jonathan Brandis, the special 
also features Charlton Heston, Bob Hoskins, Robert Englund, Michael Dorn, 
Leslie Nielsen, Robert Patrick and George Lucas, who pay tribute to their 
favorite effects experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids will be fascinated about the amount of time that goes into special 
effects," Brandis says. "After completion, some of the effects only last 30 
seconds on screen, but took days, sometimes longer, to put together." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandis' favorite sequence is a look at the building used in the upcoming 
feature "The Shadow," where effects experts created a 1/24th-scale version of 
New York City. "It's so impressive," he says. "All the tiny windows -- 
everything is so perfect. And all the time it took to put that together! I love 
model making, so it was great to see that done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are gonna see the whole business involved, and realize how much people 
go through to get what's on screen. A lot of what they do seems impossible and 
you are totally fooled by it."

 Scheider and Brandis' "seaQuest DSV " -- a show that's no stranger to special 
effects -- will offer its season finale immediately after "Masters of 
Illusions."

 My friend Yolande knows where all the good parties are, which blues records 
are worth listening to, all the best ways to keep a 7-year-old amused on a 
rainy Saturday afternoon. She's the kind of person who looks as at-home at a 
scruffy rockabilly gig as she does at a high-style cocktail bar. She lives in a 
leather jacket; she works as a manager at the best bakery in town. Yolande is 
also an emigre from South Africa, and a few weeks ago she went to the South 
African Consulate in Beverly Hills to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never voted before," Yolande says, "except for a yes-or-no apartheid 
referendum almost 10 years ago. It never felt right to vote before. My parents 
and I never discuss politics together, especially at the $2 per minute a 
long-distance call costs now. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to the consulate about 6, everyone there was in kind of a party 
mood, but I could hardly feel part of it, my knees were shaking so hard -- this 
election is what I had wanted so badly. The crowd at the consulate was mixed, 
mostly white, but with a sprinkling of blacks, Asians and even Orthodox Jewish 
people in their beards and their hats, which you hardly ever see in South 
Africa. A large group of people were laughing and were videotaping everyone, 
and it was wild to look around and see all my South African friends at once. 
</P>

 "There were a bunch of tables all set up and a policeman there to keep 
everyone in line. First, they checked our hands under an ultraviolet light; 
then they smeared ink on our hands and checked our South African documents. 
After that, they had us gather five or six at a time around a table, where they 
explained what the first ballot was for -- that was the presidential one; we 
stood around a different table and got a different ballot for the state races 
-- and stamped a paper for each of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends and I were shaking like leaves: Finally, it was happening. And you 
probably can't understand it if you haven't lived in South Africa, but this was 
one of the most serious moments in our lives -- alone in the voting booth with 
just a ballot and a sharp pencil. It was so overwhelming, and so strange to be 
so far from our country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you've seen the voting papers, but they were beautiful, very 
colorful, with a bright flag next to each party's name on the ballot, and a 
photograph of each candidate next to that. It was really hard to vote, because 
there were so many parties to choose from. One of the parties in Natal, where 
I'm from, is led by a very cool Rastafarian, so my dad had said he was going to 
vote for that guy because he wanted to grow his own pot. My dad is kind of a 
comedian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left the country for a lot of reasons, political ones mostly, but the 
hardest thing there was to work alongside people who couldn't comprehend 
sharing anything with people who were black. In South Africa, most of my 
friends were pretty left wing. I was questioned by police there because of my 
friends, and because of those incidents, I think, I felt a little bit more what 
was really going on in the country. I've had to educate a lot of my South 
African friends in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, when I go back, I hope to see a country that looks more like Africa 
-- people everywhere, instead of these empty, all-white cities with pretty 
gardens and clean streets. You know, what's interesting is to think of looking 
back in 50 years and seeing that this thing existed where a certain group of 
white people thought it was their God-given right to lead the country. We're 
finally going to get some soul into those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "And after I'd handed in the second ballot, all I could think about was going 
out for tea with my friends somewhere and talking about what we'd done."

 YANGTZE! YANGTZE! by Dai Qing, edited by Patricia Adams & John Thibodeau 
translated from the Chinese by Nancy Liu, Wu Mei, Sun Yougeng & Zhang Xiaogang 
(Earthscan: $14.95; 295 pp., illustrated, paperback original). The ecologists, 
sociologists, geologists, economists and engineers represented in this 
important anthology argue against building the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze 
River.The multibillion dollar structure would require the relocation of over 1 
million people, inundate thousands of acres of productive agricultural land and 
destroy scenic and historic monuments. As the Yangtze carries the fourth 
highest load of sediment of any river in the world, silt and gravel would 
quickly foul the reservoir and hydroelectric plant. The authors of the various 
pieces assembled by journalist Dai Qing are not Westernized protesters, but 
people with long histories of national service. Although banned in China, 
"Yangtze! Yangtze!" pressured the State Council to postpone the project in 1989 
(the government began accepting construction bids in January, 1994). This 
scrupulously documented translation provides American readers access to the 
first attempt to harness large-scale intellectual opposition to the 
governmental decision-making process in China.

 MY LIFE by Marc Chagall, translated from the French by Elizabeth Abbot (Da 
Capo: $13.95; 174 pp., illustrated). Long out of print, Chagall's warm 
autobiography describes his early life in a small Russian town. Not 
surprisingly, he focuses on the gradual discovery of his vocation as an artist, 
despite the affectionate skepticism of his relatives, who felt he should choose 
a more stable occupation that would provide a living wage. Reflecting on the 
beloved family members, friends and locations who fueled decades of creativity, 
Chagall affirms, "If my art played no part in my family's life, their lives and 
their achievements greatly influenced my art."

 THE COAST: A Journey Down the Atlantic Shore by Joseph J. Thorndike (St. 
Martin's Press: $12.95; 233 pp., illustrated). Thorndike walked, drove and 
sailed from northern Maine to the Florida Keys for this pleasant travelogue. He 
found he could gain access to a dismayingly small portion of the coast, as 
people have carved the shore into private enclaves with no trespassing signs. 
Many of these luxurious communities were built on shifting sands that never 
should have been developed: The Army Corps of Engineers has spent tens of 
millions of dollars in unsuccessful efforts to stabilize the shore of northern 
New Jersey.

 THE WATCH by Rick Bass (Norton: $9.95; 190 pp.). Rick Bass' short stories have 
a quirky tone that distinguishes them from his more straightforward 
reportage.Unable to find a place in contemporary America, his characters gamely 
limp through life, despite physical and psychological afflictions. The 
crotchety narrator of "The Government Bears" sums up their attitude when he 
concludes, "There's a lady three miles down the road who handles snakes in her 
church services and I swear that takes less courage than to just duck your head 
and keep on doing what you are doing, the regular."

PALM LATITUDES: URBAN ART; BOXING MEMORABILIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Maria C. Iacobo

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Champeau was looking for just the right "Hallmark message," as he puts 
it, for his father's birthday last year, but he couldn't find one. So he put 
black and red pens to paper and cut out images and letters from newspapers to 
create a card with a "ransom-note quality." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was meant to be disturbing and it succeeded," Champeau says. "People don't 
expect something strange on their birthday." But his father loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as his sister's birthday approached, Champeau began work on "the box": a 
black, 9 1/2x11 1/2-inch wooden container with one glass side. Mapping out an 
elaborate layered design on a computer, he then filled the box with pieces of 
old magazines, out-of-print books, Art Deco catalogues, maps, family 
photographs, all nestled in layers of painted cardboard and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of images is surreal. Some are about his sister, Rachel: a 
tiny piece of a Paris map (where Rachel studied); old black-and-white 
photographs of cacti (her favorite plants); a passage from the Old Testament 
referring to the life of Rachel. But other items are a mystery even to her: a 
silver dollar nestled under intricately cut paper, the bloodied face of a man, 
rats in a laboratory, an American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
 "To create a weird contrast," Champeau says, "I find things that may be linked 
to each other, but are different." 
</P>
<P>
 When someone commissions a box, Champeau asks them for personal items, and 
then combines these with his own impressions. "I put something of myself in 
whatever I do. In my own work, I have personal themes -- gender issues, 
liberation of the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 He's looking for a gallery to display his work, which might make him sound 
like the archetypal struggling artist. He's not. A UC Berkeley graduate in 
civil engineering, Champeau, who lives in Sunland, works for the state's Office 
of Emergency Services mapping and analyzing data from last fall's fires in 
Altadena. He is also completing his master's thesis in geography at Cal State 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 For Champeau, each new piece is an an adventure. "It's like keeping one foot 
in an orderly world, and stepping into another one that's strange." Maria C. 
Iacobo

BE KIND TO YOUR PEARLS; LOVERS, BY JUDITH KRANTZ (CROWN PUBLISHERS: $23; 464 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margo Kaufman, Margo Kaufman is the author of 1-800-AM-I-NUTS? (Random 
House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I believe that the true test of a really great bad book is that you don't hate 
yourself until you've finished it. It's embarrassing enough to have to go out 
of your way to a bookstore where they don't know you to buy it, and then make 
sure that nobody that you want to impress catches you reading it. (To my 
everlasting shame, I once ran into my high school English teacher while I 
holding "Valley of the Dolls," perhaps the "War and Peace" of trash 
literature.) In exchange, a really great bad book should be extremely difficult 
to put down. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, "Lovers," Judith Krantz's seventh novel, is the sort of bonbon 
for the mind designed to get you through a 12-hour plane ride or the weekend 
after you get your wisdom teeth pulled. Granted, it takes a few pages to get 
used to the best-selling author's breathy style and creative sentence 
structure, which is like Faulkner given a Cosmo gene splice. Take this sentence 
-- please: "If only she didn't have a built-in need to disturb the status quo 
of her life, to upset the applecart, if only, Gigi jittered to herself, she'd 
been able to remain happily in the safe and wildly booming bosom of Scruples 
Two, the fashion catalog that she'd come to think of as the family business, 
she wouldn't now be looking for a parking space in a state of gibbering 
fidgets, about to take her first steps in advertising." For fun, I tried to 
parse it. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot, such as it is, chronicles the romantic and business adventures 
(these are pretty much the same) and wardrobe changes of Billy Ikehorn Orsini 
Elliott, Gigi Orsini and Sasha Nevsky. Longtime Krantz fans will remember these 
characters (and many others in the book) from her mega bestseller, "Scruples," 
and the lackluster sequel, "Scruples Two." Joining the ensemble is Victoria 
Frost, who, like the other three heroines, is amazingly beautiful, fabulously 
wealthy, and extraordinarily clever; however, it's obvious she's up to no good, 
since she doesn't have a hoydenish nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 But who can resist an air-brushed universe where the periodical of record is 
Italian Vogue, where middle-aged men can make love five times a night without 
napping, and armchairs cost $8,000? There's no such thing as a bad 
neighborhood: The reader is catapulted from a Holmby Hills estate to a Venice 
palazzo to a Parisian mansion to, most inexplicably, a film location in 
Kalispell, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 No frustrating career glass ceilings on Planet Krantz either. If a girl gets a 
good idea -- for instance, one of Gigi's brainstorms, a chain of expensive toy 
stores called the Enchanted Attic -- it instantly becomes a raging success. (Of 
course, it doesn't hurt that a captain of industry in an Armani suit, with a 
giant erection and an even bigger bankroll, immediately offers to underwrite 
the venture). 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of big bankrolls, what's your fantasy? Tall blond All-American 
surfer, rake-hell Black Irish charmer, Italian-American Zeus, sensitive artist 
-- these ladies sleep with them all and, naturally, they're all filthy rich and 
terrific in bed (the book is set in 1983, before safe sex was de rigueur ). 
It's like a steamy version of the Barbie Game. Of course, these dream dates 
aren't perfect, they tend to act a wee bit chauvinistic, but they sweetly make 
amends with a tiny quelque chose like the Empress Josephine's emeralds. 
</P>
<P>
 Would that my life should be like this. 
</P>
<P>
 A Krantz novel does have its practical side. I learned that to keep my pearls 
happy I was supposed to swim in salt water with them at least twice a year; 
that prego is the most useful word in Italian I could know; and that the secret 
of a successful party is to keep the distance between the tables tight. And 
when Gigi boards her billionaire beau's private jet she remembers that "Billy 
had insisted that she be sure to wear no makeup on the trip and use moisturizer 
and lip gloss every hour to counteract the dry air aloft." 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever the action wanes, the author describes another outfit. The most 
suspenseful moment of the novel comes when Billy frantically rummages through 
her 900-square-foot closet, looking in vain for something to wear to match her 
elated mood: "Finally, she found the perfect ensemble tucked away in the rack 
where she kept her sportswear: slim pants and a long, flaring tunic with a deep 
oval neckline, made of heavy oriental silk in an astonishing blaze of color 
that lay somewhere on the thin line dividing shocking pink and hot pink." 
</P>
<P>
 I held my breath until the next paragraph, when it was revealed that she owned 
matching shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 I must confess that I envy the self-confidence of these characters, who seem 
never to have a bad hair day. Gigi "had to admit in all modesty that she had 
truly marvelous legs, she decided, relaxing and lowering the lovely smooth 
shells of her eyelids so that the long lashes on which she used three layers of 
black mascara set up a bristling hedge in front of the pupils of her eyes, 
which were the green of a granny smith apple." 
</P>
<P>
 I closed the book reluctantly. Self-hate immediately began to creep in.

 The white clothes of summer look especially interesting this season as 
designers combine matte and shiny finishes, sheer and opaque fabrics, openwork 
and tightly woven textures.An outfit that blends cool, chalky whites with warm, 
creamy vanillas looks freshest. Surface details such as pleats, tucks and 
fagoting lend linen additional interest. And hemlines, whether to bare knees or 
cover ankles, don't matter as long as the clothes possess a clean, breezy chic.

<TEXT>
<P>
 While Lori and Alan Erenberg were married, they spent much of their time 
hunting down vintage furniture and accessories, then arranging them in living 
spaces noted for an intrepid, funky style. When the couple separated, their 
sense of style remained amicable.So after Alan, former owner of the Serta 
mattress company, grew dissatisfied with the way his mixed bag of post-divorce 
furnishings looked in his white-on-white condo, he asked Lori, a designer and 
set decorator, to pull the disparate pieces together. 
</P>
<P>
 Her answer: color. And not just any color but bold, bigger-than-life, 
Hollywood-influenced color -- ocher, chartreuse, turquoise -- that "gives a 
space life, movement and flow," she says. To find shades of this intensity that 
would work well together, Alan tested no fewer than 37, brushing them onto the 
white walls before arriving at the final seven. 
</P>
<P>
 This carefully considered palette resulted in a theatrical, Expressionistic 
backdrop that united Erenberg's California-flavored furniture, objects and art. 
Painted Monterey Western furniture (made by Barker Bros. in the '30s), old 
Mexican blankets and pure kitsch -- like the '40s harem lamp, a legacy from 
Alan's father in a style he dubbed "Jewish Rococo" -- combined comfortably with 
blue-chip pieces such as art from Calder and Leger, Tiffany silver and Steuben 
glassware. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alan had great taste, whether classic or kitsch," says Lori of her former 
husband, who died last month. His vision will live on through the Erenbergs' 
teen-age sons, Victor and Ilya. "They've been immersed in this all their 
lives," she says, "and like their dad, they've got great style all their own."

TO MARKET, TO MARKET; CLASSIC DISHES AT THIS VENICE HANGOUT STILL SHINE, 
DESPITE A NEW CHEF AND A RETOOLED MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It's been nearly 10 years since 72 Market St. blazed its way onto the 
restaurant scene with its radical concrete decor, "kick-ass" chili and a 
monumental all-American meatloaf. The original chef, Leonard Schwartz, took 
these homely American classics and gave them a chef's polish. Schwartz decamped 
to Maple Drive in Beverly Hills five years ago, and 72 Market has since had its 
ups and downs. Early this spring, the owners brought in French chef Roland 
Gibert, who cooked up a storm at the late Tulipe. At first, he contributed just 
a handful of specials each night. And then, after Easter, the restaurant 
unveiled a new menu -- a hybrid of old familiars and Gibert's new dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 If you come, as I did, looking for the gutsy French cooking Gibert was known 
for in the late '80s, you're going to be disenchanted. So far, his 
contributions have been much less ambitious: mostly safe, stylish bistro fare. 
If we didn't already know what a bold and exciting cook Gibert can be, it 
wouldn't be such a disappointment. His fans remember fondly Tulipe's ravioli of 
duck, ham and escargots and his elegant appetizer of pigs' feet and snails in 
lacy caul fat. But here, he hasn't trotted out any shocking ingredients, at 
least not yet. Regrettably, there's nary a pig's foot or a snail in sight. It 
is all pretty mainstream, and while the menu and his presence in the kitchen 
are still new, the food for the most part tastes as if his heart isn't in it. 
The question is, why hire a chef if you're not going to let him do what he does 
best? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the tastiest things on the menu are still the old Market Street 
classics. The oysters, freshly shucked at the bar, are glorious, especially the 
belon and tiny Olympia. The chili, tender chopped sirloin in a dusky, complex 
chile sauce, is a sure-fire pleaser, accompanied by great corn muffins and all 
the fixings. And a thick, upended slice of fine-textured meatloaf looks like a 
'40s radio come to the table, served with fluffy mashed potatoes and a 
four-inch-tall pile of garlic-scented spinach. Another classic, the grilled 
chicken with a spunky tomatillo sauce and superlative fries, hasn't suffered 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Curious about what Gibert is up to these days, I naturally gravitated to the 
specials. Mesmerized by the swirling designs of the waiter's vintage tie, I 
struggled to grasp the annoying flood of details, only to be offered a printed 
list of specials after the recitation was over. One night there was a delicate, 
lovely asparagus soup. But on another, the artichoke-and-barley soup was so 
thick it resembled baby food. I love the punch of Roquefort in his fragile 
pear-and-Roquefort tart. The pates, however, are uncharacteristically bland. 
The duck "gateau" and foie gras arrived icy cold, a dull brown mosaic without 
much flavor. A venison pate, a special, and equally pallid in taste, was 
strangely accompanied by an acidic relish of sour cream dotted with red 
currants. And the chilled leek-and-asparagus casserole turned out to be a sort 
of tasteless potato loaf studded with asparagus and wrapped in leek (although 
prepared with reduced calories, fat, cholesterol and sodium). 
</P>
<P>
 Gibert sometimes offers mixed seafood -- shrimp, scallops, fish -- -cooked in 
parchment paper with slivers of vegetables and flageolet beans. It was 
delicious one night, dispirited and dried up another. The grilled filet mignon 
in a well-balanced Roquefort-walnut sauce was first rate. As were the venison 
medallions with celery-root puree. But the fine flavor of the grilled Tasmanian 
salmon was drowned out by an overly strong Dijon mustard sauce. The kitchen 
can't quite seem to get the pitch right -- too little flavor or punch-'em-out 
sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 Come dessert time, think ahead (seven minutes ahead) and order the warm apple 
galette , puff pastry embedded with finely sliced tart apples served with a 
ball of vanilla ice cream. Also quite good is the Lenotre chocolate cake, with 
stylish chocolate stripes outside and layers of soft-as-down chocolate cake and 
mousse inside. But the thick wedge of special pecan pie and the lemon meringue 
tart with a fork-resistant crust are a bit pedestrian. Here, at least, the 
French side of the menu wins out. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking out, I commented to the woman behind the reserva  
</P>
<P>
 tion desk that the menu looked a little different from the last time I was 
there. "Why?" she snapped defensively. "Didn't you like it?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's never easy making this kind of transition, when the new chef has to fit 
his dishes in with old faithfuls, however good. 72 Market St. is halfway there; 
let's hope Gibert takes the menu in a bolder direction.

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When traditional costs too much, odd is your escape. 
</P>
<P>
 That applies especially to the wine list at 72 Market St., which has always 
been relatively eclectic and continues to offer the adventuresome diner an 
exciting experience.But you have to know how to order, and that means a bit of 
boning up. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, if you stick with tried-and-true Chardonnay as your white, only 
two or three wines are decent values. But the 1992 Chablis Premier Cru 
"Vaillons" from Robert Vocoret, $30, is an excellent buy and a fine wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best buys, try 1993 Murphy-Goode Fume Blanc, $19, 1992 Joseph Phelps 
Grenache Rose, $18, 1991 Frog's Leap Zinfandel, $21, or the excellent 1988 
Coltassala from Castello di Volpaia, one of my favorite Tuscan producers, $25. 
</P>
<P>
 The list also has a wide selection of older red wines (some well priced, a few 
far too expensive), more than a dozen fine beers, 10 tequilas, six bourbons, 19 
Cognacs and Armagnacs, 11 single-malt Scotch whiskeys, an array of grappas and 
some other dessert wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Its failings: a skimpy sparkling wine list, and only three Pinot Noirs. Dan 
Berger

ON THE RECORD: CHERYL STUDER SCORES AS SEMIRAMIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Semiramide," completed in 1823 and the 35th of his 40 operas, is the kind of 
Rossini modern listeners have found difficult to swallow, employing as it does 
many of the dated conventions of opera seria . Given singers capable of leaping 
its punishing vocal hurdles, the plot can, however, be at least involving. The 
new, complete Deutsche Grammophon recording (437 797, 3 CDs) solves the vocal 
problems with stunning success. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous, heavily cut recording ("Hemisemiramide"?) on the London label, 
was a showcase for the vocal acrobatics of Joan Sutherland, as the impossibly 
conflicted titular queen of Babylon, and Marilyn Horne as Arsace, high-spirited 
commander of Semiramide's army, her intended (at one point) but in fact 
(gulp!), her son ! London's other singers simply couldn't hack it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the plot is incidental to a score that is inventive even by 
Rossini's loftiest standards, and perhaps his most original and futuristic in 
its handling of the orchestra. The writing throughout -- vocal and instrumental 
-- is filled with quirky rhythms, striking harmonies and unexpected 
modulations. There's a surprise around every corner, and grand tunes galore. 
</P>
<P>
 The four leading roles, and indeed the four smaller ones, are devilishly 
difficult to fill, but DG has turned the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Studer, in the title role, scores yet again, knifing through the 
coloratura with fierce determination while projecting more character than one 
might think possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As the heroic, potentially Oedipal Arsace, mezzo Jennifer Larmore is likewise 
agile, involved and convincing, while tenor Frank Lopardo is a plucky marvel: 
One has to be won over by a singer whose voice is so effortfully emitted and 
inappropriately dark, yet who by sheer force of will is able to negotiate the 
high-lying convolutions of Idreno, a sort of coloratura Calaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Ramey is the dastard of the piece, the treacherous, lecherous, 
murderous Assur. If Ramey were to act, the role could turn laugh-provoking. 
Happily, he just stands and delivers, letting the voluminous, dark-chocolate 
tones roll forth. 
</P>
<P>
 All four principals are, incidentally, Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ion Marin's brisk conducting of the splendidly alert London Symphony shows 
more force than finesse. Still, it's serviceable work, sufficiently 
accommodating of the singers and never obscuring the opera's glories. 
</P>
<P>
 The early (1813) one-act farce "Il Signor Bruschino" is, aside from its 
familiar overture, a rarity, and a delectable one under the right 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Deutsche Grammophon has built its production (435 865), pushily 
conducted by Marin, around Kathleen Battle, who sings with her patented vocal 
purity, which is hardly to be despised, while repeating her well-worn 
impersonation of the arch Kathleen Battle, which is. Ramey does little with the 
comic possibilities of the part of the mock-philosophical tutor and Lopardo is 
again present, providing heft where quicksilver is called for. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the veteran Claudio Desderi (Los Angeles Music Center Opera's designated 
Don Pasquale next season) in the title role to show us how Rossinian comedy 
should be played: nimbly, zestfully, with maximum regard for the spoken and 
sung word. Too bad his present colleagues weren't listening. 
</P>
<P>
 The even rarer "L'occasione fa il ladro" (Opportunity Makes the Thief), a 
longer one-acter than "Bruschino," its immediate successor, is a Gallic-style, 
mistaken identity- cum- lechery farce, replete with exchanged valises and "who, 
me?" double takes, propelled by a score that is an irresistible mix of 
effervescence and long-spun lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
 What would seem to be the score's first commercial recording arrives courtesy 
of the 1987 Pesaro Festival, and it's a sparkling success (Fonit Cetra 2001, 2 
CDs) in the hands of Salvatore Accardo, one of our brainiest violinists, who 
here gracefully swaps bow for baton, leading the willing young members of the 
Orchestra Giovanile Italiana. 
</P>
<P>
 His cast is exceptionally strong, individually and in the numerous hectic 
ensembles, including Raul Gimenez, his tenor never more honeyed and a vocal 
actor of great charm; Desderi again, as the most lovable of the opera's several 
dolts; soprano Luciana Serra, in most seductive vocal fettle, and American 
baritone (since turned tenor) J. Patrick Raftery, who handles the Rossinian 
patter-and-fluster with Italianate deftness.*

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT; BOBBY WATSON (*** 1/2); "MIDWEST SHUFFLE" ( COLUMBIA ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike pop music, where appearances in front of an audience often reveal the 
emperors to be wearing no clothes, the best jazz often comes in live 
performance. This new recording from Bobby Watson and his band Horizon, 
recorded last year at a trio of concert spaces, supports that contention, as 
the alto saxophonist's quintet moves the intensity level up a notch from its 
previous releases. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's ensemble refuses to trade in the post-bop revivalism that has today's 
young, hotshot recording artists modeling, if not outright stealing, the sounds 
of 30 years ago. Instead, Horizon expands on that direction, bringing harder, 
tougher beats and a cosmopolitan smartness that moves to the tempo of the 
times. The best examples of this approach are Watson's title tune, which has 
the immediacy of an on-the-scene news broadcast, and drummer Victor Lewis' two 
contributions, "Complex Dialogue" and "He's More Good Than Bad," both of which 
carry a well-tempered sensitivity for soloists to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Lewis for the disc's muscular rhythmic strengths, as he pumps up the 
program with tom-tom variations and exploding snare and cymbal accents. But 
each member shines in turn: trumpeter Terrell Stafford, whose daring recalls 
the late Woody Shaw, young Venezuelan pianist Ed Simon who brings Latin touches 
to his moody expressionism and bassist Essiet Essiet who keeps to the lower 
range of his instrument for a big, throaty sound. For his part, Watson shines 
as he attacks the title tune with a linebacker's aggressiveness, as well as 
during the solo technical display dubbed "Finger Games." This disc's only 
drawback is the spoken introductions and vocal asides that pepper its length. 
Couldn't that time have been better spent on more music? 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

RECORD RACK: ORGANIC LOVE FOR SPACE AGE SWOONERS; ** 1/2; ERASURE, "I SAY I SAY

 Synthetic trappings aside, Vince Clarke and Andy Bell are the last of the 
red-hot, un-ironic romantics. Theirs is a world full of real or promised 
delirium amid the dandelions, waterfalls, poppy fields and moons, a yearning 
lyricism so determinedly innocent it recalls late-'50s pop balladry more than 
the jaded techno passions of Erasure's '90s contemporaries.The melodies are so 
sweet, the lyrics so taken with swooning archetypes, that in the context of 
electronic sophistication and oblique gay subtext it's easy for outsiders to 
read the naif passion as camp. But, as with David Lynch, we think they're 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first album of new material in four years is surprisingly low on the 
danceability meter, though "Run to the Sun," which may or may not be a paean to 
a departed loved one, should score big at the clubs. Clarke is a delightful 
programmer, achieving a kind of musical streamline moderne as he melds pop 
nostalgia and even music-box riffs to the wonderfully anachronistic futurism of 
"space-age" synth sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an inherently limited enterprise, though, since Clarke's grander themes 
cry out for an emotionalism that lyricist Bell tries to deliver but finally 
can't in his chosen language of June/moon cliches.

RECORD RACK: ** JON SECADA, "HEART, SOUL & A VOICE"; ERG/SBK  
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miami-based, Cuban-born Secada, who won a Grammy award for best Latin pop 
album of 1992, moves into a new and not always comfortable arena this time out: 
dance music. His guiding lights for these repetitious tunes are Earth, Wind & 
Fire, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder.But Secada is almost totally reliant upon 
clunky, rhythm machine-sounding tracks to generate any real sense of 
propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the overproduced, Top 40 sound of the tracks, Secada's undeniably 
appealing singing sounds just fine. With one of the most flexible voices in 
pop, he soars across the octaves with almost uncanny ease. On tunes such as 
"Mental Picture," "Where Do I Go From You" and "Don't Be Silly," he 
demonstrates the warm, affecting style that was so convincing on his 1992 debut 
album, "Just Another Day." 
</P>
<P>
 More typically, like on "If You Go," he's saddled with a pounding rhythm track 
that forces him into a shouting competition with an oppressively heavy backup 
vocal ensemble. Secada has the talent to become a big-time crossover act but on 
this he doesn't get much opportunity to show it.

 ** Travis Tritt, "Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof," Warner Bros. Positioning 
himself as the modern inheritor of the '70s outlaw movement may make for good 
copy, but truth is, Tritt fits as squarely within the mainstream nowadays as 
his frequent target Billy Ray Cyrus.He's still reasonably charming, if not 
nearly charming enough to justify the ego. Tritt's choice of weepers ranges 
from cloying to clever; he's better as an exceedingly frisky Southern rocker, 
his preferred performance mode.

a Polish export with an earthy and relaxed style that's straight out of 
Brazil.When she sings "Third Time Lucky," you're practically transported to the

sophisticated musical growth, especially on the title track, a playful salute 
to love's perplexing powers.

 ** 1/2 Various artists, "Beauty and the Beast: A New Musical" original cast 
album, Walt Disney Records.The six new songs by Alan Menken and Tim Rice that 
were added for the Broadway production overlap easily with the music from the 
Menken-Howard Ashman film score. This serviceable, undemanding, Disney-style 
music suggests that the show has more to do with visual effects than aural 
enchantment. The only surprise is Menken and Ashman's "Human Again," a brightly 
attractive waltz that was dropped from the film.

 *** Milla, "The Divine Comedy," SBK/ERG. Forget that Russian-born Milla 
Jovovich is a supermodel-actress.Forget that she's just 18 years old. Forget 
the pretentious album title. This debut would be a solid effort even for a 
seasoned veteran. Milla's strong writing and mature vocals (both somewhat in 
the Kate Bush mode) make one hope that this is not just a dilettantish side 
trip but the start of a full music career.

 ** 1/2 BlackHawk, "BlackHawk," Arista. If the group sounds familiar , it 
should: Lead singer Henry Paul also fronted Southern-rock band the Outlaws in 
the '70s.BlackHawk's strength is its sweet high harmonies and tasteful mandolin 
and guitar work. Lyrics rise above average now and then, as in "Sure Can Smell 
the Rain," a foreboding look at the beginning of the end of a love.

 *** Bruce Cockburn, "Dart to the Heart," Columbia. Like Jackson Browne, 
Cockburn has lately set aside global for personal politics.Unlike Browne, he 
hasn't found the home front quite so chilly. This album is tenderly hopeful in 
heart and slightly feisty in folk-rock spirit -- so that even as it segues from 
love to death, the capping "Tie Me at the Crossroads" is the most enjoyably 
jaunty sort of self-eulogizing wake.

 ** Van Morrison, "A Night in San Francisco," Polydor. Only the Man's 
completist fans will want this two-disc live set -- which is not to say it 
chronicles a sub-par performance or is poorly recorded.Indeed, Morrison's 
marvelous voice has weathered three decades with nary a chink, and the Tom 
Jones-meets-Junior Wells arrangements have a novel appeal. But does anyone 
really need another version of "Moondance"?

 *** 1/2 Jimi Hendrix, "Jimi Hendrix: Blues," MCA. The cover art and album 
notes argue that the essence of Hendrix was blues.The music (including eight 
previously unreleased performances) makes a different case: that his nature was 
protean, his music a boundary-jumping transformation of the blues. No other 
guitarist could have put this much sizzle and surprise into a collection that 
is 90% slow blues.

 ** Nas, "illmatic," Columbia. In an obvious attempt to wrestle hip-hop away 
from the West, East Coast critics have been gushing over Long Island's Nas as 
if he were rap's second coming.Don't believe the hype. While "The World Is 
Yours" is one of the year's smartest, silkiest numbers and his delivery is 
equally smooth, too much of the album is mired with tired attitudes and 
posturing.

FOUR-STAR FILMS; 'PATTON'

<TEXT>
<P>
 This 1970 blockbuster brought George C. Scott an Oscar he refused to accept 
for his superb portrayal of Gen. George S. Patton Jr. A most unconventional war 
movie -- yet full of the noise and action of battle -- the film does not give 
comfort to hawks or doves.It is a portrait, not an argument, and that is its 
strength and salvation. Written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund North, the 
film follows Patton from the desert war of North America through Sicily and 
Europe to the moment he is relieved of command of the Third Army. Impeccably 
directed by Franklin Schaffner, "Patton" preserves a strong momentum, and we 
could hardly ask for a rounder or deeper understanding of an extraordinarily 
complicated and contradictory human being (USA Friday at 10:30 a.m.).

 Writer-director Paul Schrader comes close to transcendence in his 1992 
thriller with theological underpinnings, a meditative saga of a drug runner's 
inevitable collision with fate.Like almost all of Schrader's work, it dives 
into dangerous waters. It has an almost cruelly ambitious subject: the collapse 
of the 1970s and '80s high-style drug culture, as distilled into one man's 
pilgrimage. Willem Dafoe stars as a Manhattan cocaine deliveryman and Susan 
Sarandon plays his sexy drug boss (Showtime Tuesday at 12:35 a.m.). Michael

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; CHARLIE DELL'S 'SHADE' OF BEING SOUTHERN: THE NICE WORD 
IS ECCENTRIC 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's a cliche, but it's true: Charlie Dell, who plays idiot savant Nub Oliver 
on CBS' "Evening Shade," is a classically trained Shakespearean actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nub, a middle-aged newspaper delivery boy, whizzes around in a wagon named 
Chariots of Fire on which the American flag proudly waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nub and Dell are not the total opposites one might think. 
</P>
<P>
 Offstage, Dell, who has a drama degree from the University of North Texas, is 
an articulate man with an all-American childhood. He was born in Texas and for 
a time lived on his grandparents' small dairy farm in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 "You most often hear that Nub is the town weirdo or moron," Dell says. "I 
describe him this way: an eccentric." 
</P>
<P>
 Nub's a metaphor for a small town, he says, like the little Arkansas hamlet of 
Evening Shade, where the show is set. Nub's simplicity makes him someone people 
can relate to, Dell adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so defined," Dell says. "I just put him on like you would clothes. 
Being from the South and around simple farm people, I knew all the characters 
(executive producer) Linda Bloodworth-Thomason was writing about. When I heard 
about the role, I said, 'I'm perfect for that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie's as sweet and dependable as Nub is, and a great actor too," says 
co-executive producer Victor Fresco, who adds that Dell's steadfastness offers 
a "calming presence" on the set of a show whose star, Burt Reynolds, has 
attracted considerable public attention for his high-profile divorce from Loni 
Anderson this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell got a bit of his own publicity last Fourth of July when he married 
actress Jennifer Williams in the actual town of Evening Shade, Ark. While they 
worried that it might smack of a publicity stunt, they found the location 
convenient for both families and the town extremely accommodating. Dell 
realized during the planning of his wedding that the town's actual residents 
exemplified the qualities given to "Evening Shade" characters -- caring and a 
will to bend over backward for friends. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine years doing small theater across the country, Dell's small, but 
memorable, roles in "Jason of Star Command," "Dukes of Hazzard," "Trapper John, 
M.D." led to what he considers his lucky break: exposure on national commercial 
campaigns as a Prudential angel and as one of Dr. Pepper's original "Peppers." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, he got his first film role in the obscure "Encounter With the 
Unknown," where he says he played, convincingly enough, "the town idiot." The 
film is an important footnote on the actor's resume, because the producer, 
Harry Thomason, remembered him when he and his wife cast "Evening Shade" some 
20 years later. It's an experience Dell calls a "dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 The season finale of "Evening Shade," featuring a story line involving Nub and 
guest star Tony Bennett, airs Monday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

ON VIEW; FIELD OF MEMORIES; PBS' 'MASTERPIECE' TALE RECALLS D-DAY WITH A 
JOURNEY TO NORMANDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Emotions ran high during the filming of "A Foreign Field," the latest 
presentation of PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre" series. The bittersweet comedy-drama 
salutes the 50th anniversary of D-day, the June 6 landings by Allied forces on 
France's Normandy shores during World War II. Within a year of D-day, the 
Allies overran Hitler's Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Roy Clarke ("Flickers") and directed by Charles Sturridge 
("Brideshead Revisited"), "A Foreign Field" focuses on Cyril, a British war 
veteran played by Leo McKern. Cyril travels to Normandy with Amos (Alec 
Guinness), an old friend mentally incapacitated after shrapnel hit him in the 
head during the landing. Waldo, a brash American (John Randolph), is staying in 
the same hotel with his daughter (Geraldine Chaplin) and son-in-law (Edward 
Herrmann). Also quietly grieving at the hotel is a mysterious American widow 
(Lauren Bacall). 
</P>
<P>
 Cyril and Waldo aren't just in Normandy to remember the invasion, but to find 
an old flame (Jeanne Moreau), who, unbeknown to them, romanced them both during 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who worked on the film were moved by the enormity of the loss suffered 
by the Allies during the invasion. The Tony Award-winning Randolph ("Broadway 
Bound") was in the Air Force during World War II, but never saw action 
overseas. "I was a control tower operator for almost four years in the United 
States," he says. During the 1930s, he also volunteered for the Abraham Lincoln 
Brigade -- a group of Americans who fought against Franco's forces during the 
Spanish Civil War. "I was turned back because I was the only person earning 
money in my family," says Randolph, who was blacklisted in the 1950s by the 
House Un-American Activities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "D-day -- there was such a fight about opening a second front," Randolph 
recalls. "They weren't doing it in the right place. They were doing it in the 
underbelly of Italy and a lot of guys got killed. So, the second thing was to 
do it at Normandy ... the slaughter that took place was inconceivable. I didn't 
realize it until I stepped on that soil." 
</P>
<P>
 Randolph hadn't anticipated how moved he would be at seeing the thousands of 
crosses and stars of David at the American cemetery at Normandy. "I think I'm 
pretty tough," he says. "I lived through all of the blacklist. I lived through 
everything. I'm not very religious, but I tell you something, when I saw what I 
saw -- it was like a field of snow. It went on and on ..." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Sturridge, who was born after World War II, was struck not only by 
the sheer number of graves, but also "the age on the gravestones and the 
proximity of all the (death) dates. I think almost everybody died within five 
or six days of each other. They were all people from the first assault. That 
ferocity of those early days of the landings of the American Army, as well as 
the British army, was quite terrifying and very graphically shown by looking at 
the gravestones." 
</P>
<P>
 Sturridge says the anniversary of D-day has sort of snuck up on the English. 
"I think D-day is a more confusing anniversary in many ways than next year's 
V-E Day, which is the end of the war. D-day represents a great many deaths, and 
I think it's the way you see it in the film, a curious combination of 
celebration and remembrance." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he was in school in England during World War II, Clarke's memories of 
the global conflict are strong. "It meant an enormous lot," he says. "I've 
always been fascinated how very ordinary people can be plucked away from very 
ordinary existences and shoved into these situations. And they could cope." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, Clarke says, people have grown nostalgic about the war. 
"Although you hate it at the time, when you look back at these things you 
remember the good sides of them and they are very powerful. I think this 50th 
anniversary is well worth remembering." 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreign Field" aired on the BCC last year and will repeat on June 5. The 
response, Clark says, was very good. He was especially pleased with the 
reactions of Normandy veterans and their wives who were invited by the BBC to a 
special screening. "That was the audience I was sweating about. I thought, 
'These are the guys who know, and if I've got it wrong, they are not shy on 
telling.' Their response was wonderful. That made me feel that though it's a 
piece of fiction, there is some truth there, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The film, Sturridge says, also struck a chord with the younger generation who 
knew little or nothing about D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the peculiarities of film actors," he says. "I'm thinking of Alec 
and Jeanne. When you watch them and watch them talking about when they were 18 
or 19, we know how they were. ... In 1945, Alec was bouncing up that staircase 
in 'Great Expectations.' We have images of them as young people in a more 
potent way than our parents or grandparents. We know exactly what (Guinness) 
was like in 1945, how he behaved. That added a kind of poignancy. The effect of 
the film on the younger generation was more extraordinary than on the 
veterans." 
</P>
<P>
 "Masterpiece Theatre: A Foreign Field" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on KVCR; 9 p.m. 
on KPBS and KOCE .

FOCUS; THE 'HEART' PART; CAROL BURNETT TAKES ON A ROLE THAT DEFIES HER OWN 
INSTINCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carol Burnett describes her latest TV movie, "Seasons of the Heart," as 
atypical fare for the small screen. "It's not the woman in jeopardy," says the 
five-time Emmy Award winner. "It's not the disease of the week. Also, it 
doesn't tie up in a nice, neat little bow at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 According to director Lee Grant ("Nobody's Child"), the drama, premiering 
Sunday on NBC, originally was written as a feature. "The chance to do features 
on television is something that I feel really strongly about because it's adult 
fare," says Grant, who as an actress won an Oscar for "Shampoo." "I'm so 
appreciative when it comes into my living room. There are no pat answers (in 
this movie). You don't expect what is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Seasons," produced by Grant's husband, Joseph Feury, Burnett plays Vivian 
Levinson, a wealthy and successful publisher who recently married her longtime 
lover, Ezra Goldstine (George Segal). The two had carried on their affair for 
25 years, during his five marriages and her one marriage to an alcoholic 
husband. Levinson also had an affair with Alfred McGinnis (Malcolm McDowell), a 
famous writer with a severe drinking problem, who views Levinson and 
Goldstine's marriage with sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Into their structured, if unusual, world comes 7-year-old David (Eric Lloyd), 
Levinson's grandson who has been abandoned by his drug-addicted mother, whom 
Levinson had practically abandoned herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming a real parent for the first time in her life puts a strain on her 
marriage to Goldstine, who, Levinson discovers, is having an affair with 
another woman. But for the first time in her life, Levinson learns to take 
responsibility for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a woman who had wanted what she wanted," Grant says. "She is a woman 
who made choices, who took what she wanted and was paying for it with a lot of 
style. She knew what she was buying and she knew what she was losing. This kid 
is not an immediate appealing little tyke. That is a real problem in her life 
and she had real choices to make. Just the step of taking responsibility for 
someone opens you up to growing up yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing Levinson wants to be is a grandparent. "She was in the throes 
of a very romantic passion with one of those guys you can't have, which we all 
want," Grant explains. "We always want the guys we can't have and when she has 
him, she doesn't have him." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett, the mother of three daughters now grown, believes Levinson is a woman 
bereft of maternal instinct. "She has put a wall up and she doesn't know how to 
handle him," she says. "She doesn't know how to talk to (her grandson) nor does 
she want to. She really doesn't want this. She has got her career and she is a 
newlywed." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Burnett acknowledges, she wasn't fond of Levinson. But her feelings 
changed when she became better acquainted with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She seemed like she had it all together," Burnett says. "Then as you peel 
away the layers of what she has been through, with the alcoholic husband, with 
the drug-addicted daughter ... she was looking for happiness. You kind of 
started to understand a little more about her and see how insecure she was 
about Ezra. I think they are going to make it, but I think they are going to 
have their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Segal, who has known and admired Burnett for years, jumped at the chance to 
play the slick, charming Goldstine. "It's a meaty role," says the star of 
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "'Blume in Love." 'It's so rare something 
like this comes along." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Burnett, Segal immediately liked Ezra. "He is me in this situation," 
Segal explains. "Lee J. Cobb told me the acting stuff and the techniques you 
learn in class are all for when you are in trouble. But most of the time, you 
just pretend to be the guy you are supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Before production began, Grant held a week of rehearsals. "That's just 
absolutely necessary for the actors so they know each other before they are 
intimate on camera," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way we had lunch together," Segal adds. "That's so important -- you 
become family. If you have a week's rehearsal, it's like a team. All the ground 
is fairly familiar and everybody feels comfortable. It bonds you together." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett, though, says she didn't get a fix on her character until she got on 
the set. "It's nice to get to know everybody (in rehearsals), but it was kind 
of funny," she says. "I am one who has to get into the outfits. I don't like to 
examine things too deeply. I work from the outside in and Lee works from the 
inside out, and, yet, we worked great together because I wanted to learn what 
she meant by certain things or (to) reach into whatever place and call up 
something and make it work."

 Grant can't say enough about Burnett as a person or an actress. "This is a 
very interesting facet for her to go for," Grant says. "It is not her warm, 
outgoing 'love me' place. She had to go to an entirely different place in 
herself. Every once in a while I would have to say, 'Carol. It has a little too 
much Carol in it.' She knew immediately what I was talking about. This is a 
woman who has a lot of secrets and operated from a careerist point of view and 
still does. Carol had no hesitation about people liking her or not liking her. 
She just wanted to explore that part."

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: 20,000 LEEKS UNDER THE SEA

 A celluloid-bright yellow submarine of exaggerated cartoon dimensions is now 
docked at the foot of the Century City Shopping Center. Topped, improbably, 
with an olive on a toothpick, the new sandwich palace Dive! launches Steven 
Spielberg as restaurateur (with a little help from Chicago-based Levy 
Restaurants, which developed and runs the place). Last weekend kids, parents 
and assorted caretakers in tow, lined up by the hundreds. It was an unruly lot, 
but one willing to wait the wait to be among the first to climb aboard the 
beckoning ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cool," my 10-year-old escort pronounced the decor awash in dials and 
trappings of the deep. Not so cool, when we were told we had yet another hour 
to wait in the bar. "Keep your eye on this coaster; it lights up when your 
table is ready," the crewman told me. The room dimmed. Sirens blared, lights 
flashed as the submarine restaurant prepared to dive. How did I know this? 
D.I.V.E. flashed on the 210-foot screen and we seemed to sink through a flurry 
of bubbles many fathoms below. Enthralled by the eerie blue underwater voyage, 
we munched on fries (very good) with two of nine sauces until our coaster 
(finally) lit up. Later, the sub prepared to dive again (and again) as we 
waited for our order of USS Humongous. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a submarine sandwich sampler for four ($13.95 per diver). The theme -- 
if you hadn't guessed -- is the "reinvented submarine sandwich served up in 18 
fashions, from traditional cold cuts and Italian meatballs to brick 
oven-roasted steak, even fajitas and Chinese chicken salad, plus three 
vegetarian versions. There's a good, if overdressed, chopped vegetable salad. 
And for dessert, a warm cookie sundae topped with white chocolate ice cream and 
a billowing cloud of whipped cream. Too sweet?, I asked the kids. No! But next 
time, they insisted, they're having the burger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dive!, Century City Shopping Center & Marketplace, 10250 Santa Monica Blvd., 
West Los Angeles. (310) 788-DIVE. Open daily for lunch and dinner. Valet 
parking. All major credit cards accepted. Full bar. Subs $7.95-$12.95; kids' 
subs $4.95.

OLNEY'S MANTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Leading L.A. to the Light," by Sean Mitchell (May 8): 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's story gives the impression that via "Which Way, L.A.?" Warren Olney 
has become the voice of Los Angeles public radio: "In the continuing social 
disarray that is Los Angeles, it has sometimes seemed that if anyone is pulling 
the city together . . . it's, of all people, Warren Olney." 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree. My candidate for the voice of Los Angeles public radio is 
KPCC-FM's Larry Mantle. Mantle is doing on his nightly "Airtalk" show exactly 
what Olney is doing, and has been doing it for more than nine years with the 
personality, sense of humor and enthusiasm Olney lacks. Olney's deadpan 
approach bores me. 
</P>
<P>
 Mantle has many of the same guests, usually in studio (why is it a matter of 
pride to Olney that he has no in-studio guests?), and he is just as 
well-informed and articulate. Both men have a following at their respective 
stations. And yet, it is Olney who is given a write-up, while Mantle is ignored 
and avoided by every newspaper and magazine in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL LIGHTCAP 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's profile attracted me and pleased me by summarizing Olney's 
professional resume, his personal relationships, his diligence and public 
spirit as revealed in his radio program. Good thing the folks at KCRW-FM want 
him to continue the daily discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 The profile, unfortunately, also revealed at least one of Olney's 
shortcomings: Having enjoyed Olney's evenhanded questioning of radio guests for 
the last two years, I was surprised to see Mitchell quote him twice using the 
name of the Lord Jesus casually. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Olney's sensitivity to people of different ethnicities needs to extend 
to people's religious beliefs. Those who respect Christians' beliefs avoid such 
casual references to the Godhead, just as they avoid ethnic slurs out of 
respect for ethnically diverse people. Let's not reduce multiculturalism to 
matters of ethnicity, gender bias and sexual orientation only.

<TEXT>
<P>
 While I appreciate the ink regarding my pending move to Arista Records, I must 
take issue with the inaccurate light in which RIP was cast in your piece (Pop 
Eye, May 1). 
</P>
<P>
 You stated: "With pop-metal stars that were once the magazine's staple having 
been replaced by the earthier likes of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, RIP's 
readership has dropped." 
</P>
<P>
 First off, though we did champion arena rock bands throughout the late '80s, 
we have also led the left-edge music revolution. RIP was the first national 
rock mag to devote feature-length coverage to Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Helmet, 
Soundgarden and, to say the least, Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 And for my second point: It's true that RIP's circulation is down, but that's 
true for every hard-rock mag across the board. But unlike the competition, we 
are experiencing our second consecutive year of record-breaking ad revenues, 
thus keeping the publication firmly in the black.

MOVIE MUSICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With journalists such as Chris Willman ("What a Fantastick Concept," Film 
Clips, May 1) misrepresenting the facts about the artistic and financial 
success of live-action movie musicals in recent decades, it is no wonder that 
Hollywood is reluctant to release them. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is true that the last blockbuster live-action musical was "Grease," 
both "Annie" and "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" brought in considerable 
sums to the box office, not to mention dance musicals such as "Footloose," 
"Flashdance" and the recent "Strictly Ballroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, to state that there hasn't been a great movie musical since "West Side 
Story" in 1961 is preposterous. What about best picture Oscar winners "My Fair 
Lady," "The Sound of Music" and "Oliver!" not to mention best picture nominees 
such as "Mary Poppins," "Funny Girl," "The Music Man" and "Cabaret"? 
</P>
<P>
 The heyday of the movie musical may have long passed, but its recent history 
has not been as bleak as Willman suggests.

CANDOR, NOT WHINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to last Sunday's letters regarding Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam: 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie's candor while disclosing information about his personal life should be 
taken as it was given; he gave answers to questions asked of him. 
</P>
<P>
 In regard to the "poor kid" quote, I read more self-pity in the letter from 
Norm Matew than I think I will ever hear from Vedder. 
</P>
<P>
 His music is a perfect example of what our youth have had to deal with and 
their way of dealing with it since the "perfect" '50s. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 In reading the letters about the May 1 interview with Vedder, I found myself 
wondering why we seem so judgmental these days. There's the old explanation of 
envy, but that doesn't seem to cover it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read the interview, I heard a nice, talented guy speaking honestly 
about his past, his sadness at the death of a friend and how difficult it can 
be to adjust to a new situation. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes him a spoiled whiner? 
</P>
<P>
 I wish all of Pearl Jam the best. I enjoy their music and hope the audience 
can find its heart and mind and understand that the people on the stage are 
human beings and not fictional characters to be picked apart.

<P>
 Your headline "Dive! Torpedoes Century City Parking" (Restaurant News, May 8) 
was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking challenges faced by the shopping center have nothing to do with Dive! 
or any other tenant of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it is a shopping mall management dilemma brought on by the 
overwhelming success of the Century City Shopping Center as a destination point 
for all of Southern California.

WAIT UNTIL VERDICT IN JONES CASE TO LAY BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was amazed by Robin Abcarian's skill in skewing the facts in Alan 
Dershowitz's article to reach her conclusion that the bad guys are Paula Jones 
and the far right of the political spectrum ("In the Paula Jones Affair, the 
Burden Is Squarely on the Right," May 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Abcarian chides Jones for waiting three years (within the statute of 
limitations for this type of action), while remaining mute on the fact that 
Anita Hill waited more than 10 years before coming forward. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not imply that President Clinton is guilty of any charges. That I leave 
to the jury, unlike most of the media who would find him guilty until he proves 
himself innocent. But blaming any of this on Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson or 
Rush Limbaugh is the height of ridiculousness.

<P>
 Robin Abcarian provided a thoughtful analysis of the reactions of leading 
women's rights organizations to the charges of the young lady who's filed suit 
against Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In summation, she indicated that it has only been after years of hard work and 
activism that awareness of the concerns of women has been elevated. This 
provided me with a brief moment of satisfaction that perhaps we might be 
getting somewhere. And then my eye fell on a small item on another page. 
</P>
<P>
 Buried there was a tiny report on a gathering of 1,000 women. These women had 
taken time out of their busy schedules to meet with doctors and discuss women's 
health. The lead sentence really says it all: "Pity the poor doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine a meeting that would attract 1,000 men to meet with doctors 
would be introduced "Pity the poor doctors"? Can you imagine such a meeting not 
being reported at all -- basically, this meeting was not reported in this 
little article. 
</P>
<P>
 Abcarian gave us one step forward; you gave us two steps back.

PRENATAL-CARE CUTS NEED CLARIFICATION

 Please inform your readers that the state has not -- yet -- cut a program that 
provides prenatal care to undocumented women as reported in the article on 
Kimberly Belshe, director of the state Department of Health Services ("Tough 
Choices," May 3). 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has proposed cutting Medi-Cal coverage of reproductive health 
services, including prenatal care and family planning, to undocumented women in 
his 1994-95 budget, but this proposal must still go through the budget process 
this month and next.

BEAUTY ON A BUDGET / TAHITI; TWO OF THE PACIFIC'S MOST BEGUILING DESTINATIONS 
ARE PLACES YOU CAN'T AFFORD. OR CAN YOU? HERE'S HOW TWO VACATIONERS DID IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH WASSERMAN, Wasserman is a staff writer for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Paris stock exchange crashed in 1883, a stockbroker named Paul 
Gauguin found himself without a livelihood and decided to indulge in his true 
love: painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shall soon be leaving for Tahiti, a small South Sea island where it is 
possible to live without money," he wrote to an artist friend. "I am determined 
to forget my miserable past, paint freely as I like without thought of fame, 
and in the end die out there, forgotten by everybody here in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Gauguin proved wrong on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
 His brilliantly colored paintings of Tahitian women and landscapes led to a 
lasting fame. But for most of his years here, he was in desperate need of 
money. Even in his day, Gauguin was surprised to find that Tahiti was more 
developed -- and considerably more expensive -- than he'd imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 As my husband, Jim, and I discovered during a visit to Tahiti and neighboring 
Moorea last month, paradise on two of the South Pacific's most legendary 
islands still comes with a hefty price tag: refreshing pineapple daiquiris 
($7), luncheon buffets of grilled mahi-mahi and salads of local papaya and 
grapefruit ($40), lush tropical terrain to explore in a rented Jeep ($55 for a 
half day; you buy the gas at about $3.75 a gallon) and fish of bright blues and 
yellows to observe from over-the-water bungalows (upward of $300 per night). 
Residents of Tahiti, Moorea and the approximately 115 other islands that make 
up the territory of French Polynesia pay no income or property taxes, but the 
French government compensates by slapping steep tariffs on imported goods 
before they reach the market. 
</P>
<P>
 But the things that had lured us to French Polynesia were free: Warm, 
blue-green lagoons that lap blinding-white beaches and a romantic history 
chronicled by writers from Herman Melville to Paul Theroux. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike Gauguin, we had planned our trip with Tahiti's high costs in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 We weren't into lugging sleeping bags across the Pacific and camping under 
mosquito netting, and we wanted more luxury than we'd get at a shared-bath 
pension for $50-per night. 
</P>
<P>
 And while we'd read that it was more economical to buy a hotel package that 
included meals, we figured we'd never eat or drink enough to make an 
all-inclusive, $1,630 per-person, per-week package at Club Med worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 We wound up with what seemed like an ideal compromise: A week-long package for 
$899 per person, including hotel and air fare from Los Angeles (which, if 
booked separately, would cost at least $598 round trip). The tour was offered 
by Islands in the Sun, an El Segundo-based operator, and featured coach seating 
on a French airline, AOM; garden-room accommodations for six nights at Moorea's 
Bali Hai Hotel and one night at the Tahiti Country Club, ground transfers and 
inter-island flights. (A $100 airline surcharge is added at high season.) With 
meals, day trips and souvenirs for two, we would spend about $2,750 in all. 
</P>
<P>
 After our eight-hour flight, we checked into the Bali Hai Hotel -- opened in 
the 1960s by three Orange County ex-patriots who still run the place today. We 
came prepared, unpacking a jar of peanut butter and two boxes of granola bars 
from our luggage, along with plenty of mosquito repellent and sunscreen (two of 
the islands' most expensive tourist staples; a bottle of Coppertone is about 
$20, bug spray about $16.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow travelers we met through a computer bulletin board had told us about a 
small grocery store a short walk west of the hotel, down Moorea's only main 
road, which circles the island. We were intrigued by the assortment of odd 
fruits. We asked a Polynesian woman behind the counter for a breadfruit, the 
booty Capt. William Bligh was after when he sailed the HMS Bounty to Tahiti in 
1788. Only later did we discover that what the clerk handed us was a 
pamplemousse, a sweet, green grapefruit. The pamplemousse, a few ripe papayas, 
two liters of water, a loaf of French bread and some Brie totaled just $12 -- 
and made our breakfasts over the next few days a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 For the price we'd paid, our bungalow at the Bali Hai Hotel wasn't on stilts 
over the lagoon (where guests can watch fish from a window in the floor), or 
even facing the beach. But our view of lush Mt. Tarai twice was accented with 
stunning rainbows, and we fell asleep each night to the muffled applause of the 
pool's small waterfall. The room was spacious, with rattan chairs, a table, a 
desk and two day beds that could sleep another couple or a few children. And 
our large, red-tiled bathroom included a small indoor garden, making us feel as 
though we were showering each day in a tropical rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few days, we found plenty of ways to avoid Gauguin's Polynesian 
fate of falling into debt. At $2 per person per day, our rented snorkeling gear 
was perhaps the best bargain of all. No matter where we put our face masks, we 
found clouds of dark-blue emperor angelfish, yellow Moorish idols, and 
florescent blue-green putters. Right in front of the Bali Hai, a coral wall 
drops straight down several yards into cool, deep-blue water, where one guest 
said he spied an octopus. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of shopping for black pearls (which, at the place we stopped, cost 
anywhere from $50 for an individual, slightly imperfect pearl to $1,000-plus 
for a necklace), we picked up a blue and green tie-dyed pareu , a rectangular 
cloth that you wrap like a sarong ($12); and a six-pack of jams in such flavors 
as mango, pineapple and pamplemousse ($9). 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of taking the $30-per-person motorized outrigger trip to a motu 
(islet), we paddled around in one of the hotel's free outrigger canoes. 
</P>
<P>
 We did book the beach-picnic excursion ($37) and rode the hotel's 
thatched-roof catamaran, the Liki Tiki, to a pristine patch of beach beyond 
Cook's Bay. Ringed by jagged peaks, it's a popular haunt of windsurfers and 
visiting cruise ships. Our picnic featured all-you-could-drink rum punch, beer 
or wine; and a deliciously fresh, all-you-could-eat barbecue of mahi-mahi 
cooked in coconut milk, hamburgers, salads and fresh pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than rent a car to explore Moorea, we opted for a $20-per-person tour 
of the island in a small bus. The move was a smart one -- the first stop was a 
pineapple plantation and cannery with a tourist kiosk that serves complimentary 
shots of strange Tahitian brews, from premixed mai tais in a carton to 60-proof 
pineapple liqueur. There was no pressure to buy the $70 bottle of pineapple 
rum, inside which was an entire pineapple, or even the $14 gift set of 
cordials. And as we settled on the exotic jams, the kiosk manager kept 
refilling our plastic cups. Again and again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch on the tour was more of a challenge. As we walked into Le Bateau, a 
restaurant on a turquoise lagoon, we were disappointed to find a menu featuring 
only $10 appetizers and $20 entrees when a sandwich would have sufficed. 
Compromising, we ordered the tuna steak in tomato-garlic sauce and a huge Greek 
salad. With two baskets of crusty French bread (included at every restaurant we 
visited), it made for one of the best meals on our trip. 
</P>
<P>
 We learned to economize at other meals, too. Since some restaurant prices were 
several dollars less at lunch than at dinner, we planned most of our major 
meals for the middle of the day (one of our favorites was poisson cru, 
marinated raw fish, for about $8 each.) We also opted for tourist menus which, 
for about $20 each, included appetizer, a choice of two or three entrees and 
dessert. At Michel et Jackie, also on Moorea, that $20 brought us a delicious 
meal of avocado cocktail with fresh shrimp, tuna Nicoise and chocolate mousse. 
Another bonus: No tax, and tipping throughout French Polynesia is neither 
required nor expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the French government lowered the tariff on alcohol several years ago, 
prices are still high by American standards. So despite the allure of the cool 
tropical drinks at the open-air bar, we tried to limit our consumption to one 
Polynesian drink per day -- supplemented with bottles of Hinano, the local beer 
($3.50 each). 
</P>
<P>
 Moorea's pastoralness was infinitely relaxing -- and came free with our 
package. An 82-square-mile island of only about 9,000 residents, it feels 
light-years away from the bustle of Tahiti, which looms above the horizon 9 1/2 
miles across the Sea of the Moon. Electricity only arrived on Moorea about 10 
years ago, but unlike on Tahiti, the wires were placed underground, helping 
retain the island's primitive feel. 
</P>
<P>
 After four days of relaxation, though, we needed some excitement. Jim and I 
had wanted to visit Tetiaroa, a coral atoll 40 miles west of Tahiti, ever since 
we saw "Mutiny on the Bounty" and learned that Marlon Brando has owned it since 
the 1960s. It's a necklace of 12 small, stunning islands surrounding an 
unimaginably blue-green lagoon. Most of the islands are protected as a bird 
sanctuary, and several tour companies offer access from Papeete, Tahiti, by air 
(about $250 per person for a day trip) or by small boat ($160 per person for 
the day). The boat ride seemed a smart choice. 
</P>
<P>
 And, until the return voyage over rough seas, it was. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride to Tetiaroa from Papeete (a 30-minute, $13 hydrofoil ride from our 
Moorea base) was uneventful, and we stopped just outside the reef surrounding 
Brando's atoll. The 14 of us on board were ferried to shore four at a time in 
an inflatable jet ski. The beach was made of baked, crushed white coral -- 
making footwear de rigueur -- and rimmed with fallen coconuts and towering palm 
trees. We hiked around Turtle Island (no turtles), and waded through a waist 
deep, bath-water-warm channel to Bird Island, where a guide pointed out a great 
frigate bird nesting in the underbrush and a red-footed booby perched high in a 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sky darkened, and the usual quick afternoon shower set in, our boat 
headed back to Tahiti. The rough seas sent the boat tossing like the S.S. 
Minnow in the opening scenes of Gilligan's Island. Jim leaned over the railing, 
pale from seasickness, and a young French woman discreetly deposited her lunch 
in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, we wished we hadn't taken the cheap way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Our tour ended with a night at the Tahiti Country Club, about a 10-minute 
drive south of Papeete. Turned off by the big-city traffic and motorcycle 
exhaust fumes, we decided to splurge by renting a Jeep for a half day and 
heading 30 miles south, along the coast, to visit the Gauguin Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 For an admission of $4.50 each, we expected to find at least one of the 
artist's original paintings. But the model of his home, entries from his diary, 
and evocative photographs of his life in the South Pacific -- not to mention 
the museum's spectacular waterfront setting, at the narrow point where two 
ancient, eroded volcanic cones meet -- made it worth the price. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, we decided, was Gauguin's adopted homeland itself. GUIDEBOOK: Touring

BEAUTY ON A BUDGET / JAPAN; TWO OF THE PACIFIC'S MOST BEGUILING DESTINATIONS 
ARE PLACES YOU CAN'T AFFORD. OR CAN YOU? HERE'S HOW TWO VACATIONERS DID IT.

<P>
 At first sight, the multileveled Tokyo Station seemed a well-lit nightmare, 
with sarariman (Japanese "salary men") , in navy and dark gray suits, flowing 
around us like schooling fish. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I had arrived here last fall on a sleek, speedy train from Narita 
Airport -- using discount Japan Railways passes, which cost us $440 each for 
two weeks of unlimited travel on trains and buses, instead of hailing an 
airport cab for about $200. From the central station, we planned to take the 
subway (about $1.50 each) for the 20-minute ride to our ryokan , or inn, near 
Tokyo's Ueno Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Our dream was to spend two weeks touring a fascinating country that many 
American travelers have written off as prohibitively expensive. We'd settled on 
three cities: Tokyo for its modernity, Kyoto for its ancient charm and 
Hiroshima for its poignant history. By using public transportation, emphasizing 
smaller, more modest lodgings and searching out back-street, mom-and-pop 
restaurants, we hoped to sample one of the world's most complex cultures within 
realistic limits -- even though we faced an anemic exchange rate of 105 yen to 
the dollar (slightly better than the current rate). 
</P>
<P>
 But only a few hours into our journey, we were wondering whether the budget 
approach was such a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Would we wind up frustrated trying to cope with subways and buses? Could we 
communicate with no knowledge of Japanese? And just what would the inexpensive 
lodgings we'd planned to stay in be like? 
</P>
<P>
 We must have looked confused, wandering about in search of the subway, because 
an angel appeared in the form of a young Japanese woman who asked in English 
whether she might be of assistance. She pointed the way -- indeed, took us to 
the ticket booth -- before departing with a smile and a bow. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching our suitcases, we edged into the crowded car and stood there 
anxiously. A bit of our confidence came back when we noticed the stops were 
marked in Roman letters as well as Japanese characters and heard them announced 
in advance over a loudspeaker in both English and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 After swimming through more sarariman in Ueno Station, we managed to find our 
way outside and hail a taxi. Ten minutes later, and only $10 out of pocket, we 
were at our inn, the Sawanoya. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd booked our accommodations before leaving the United States, through the 
Welcome Inn Reservation Center, a privately subsidized agency that matches 
overseas visitors with low-cost lodgings. "Genuine hospitality at affordable 
rates" is its motto. 
</P>
<P>
 We had not expected luxury for $80 per room, per night. Indeed, the Sawanoya 
is housed in a poured-concrete building more reminiscent of a school or factory 
than an inn. The jolly owner, with a pet cockatiel perched on his shoulder, 
greeted us in English (many other Welcome Inns feature English-speaking 
personnel as well) and led us up the linoleum stairs to our small (about 10 
feet by 12 feet), third-story room. The shared toilet was down the hall, and 
the communal bath lay one flight below. 
</P>
<P>
 After pointing out a coin-operated washing machine and dryer (a convenience we 
found at the other Welcome Inns on our trip), the innkeeper made one request: 
that whenever we walked on the tatami mats, we be sure to wear the slippers 
placed next to the room entrance. But once our two futons were unrolled, there 
was hardly space to walk -- so we crawled about, feeling a little like children 
in a playpen. 
</P>
<P>
 At breakfast the next morning, we saw at a glance that most of our fellow 
guests were Westerners. No doubt they either could not afford, or were 
unwilling to pay for, a pricier hotel -- which, in Tokyo, averages $300-$400 
per night for two people. Our jet-lagged stomachs couldn't face the $9 Japanese 
breakfast of rice, fish and miso soup. But we enjoyed the $3 American version: 
large orange juice, thick toast, scrambled eggs and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Our hotel in the old Shitamachi district, close to the subway and Ueno Park 
with its museums and zoo, served as a convenient base for exploring Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the park, where we enjoyed watching groups of schoolchildren make their 
excited way to the zoo, we indulged in a cup of tea and cookies. We'd brought a 
Thermos, tea bags and snacks from home for just such a purpose; by filling up 
the Thermos with hot water at the Sawanoya, we avoided paying $3-$4 for a cup 
of tea or coffee in a shop. At a street market near Ueno Station, we ogled 
torpedo-shaped white daikon radishes, fresh fish of all kinds, and plump orange 
kaki, or persimmons, a great autumn favorite among the Japanese. Prices, though 
higher than at home, were not prohibitive - except for apples, going for a 
shocking $10 to $15 each. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, we strolled the exquisitely landscaped grounds of the Imperial 
Palace. Another, we window-shopped in the city's razzle-dazzle Akihabara 
electronics district -- an expensive, but entertaining, kaleidoscope of 
flashing lights and day-glo colors. 
</P>
<P>
 To see what a Japanese department store looked like, we headed to Takashimaya, 
one of the city's biggest, not far from the main shopping district known as the 
Ginza. We spent half an hour in the wedding department admiring the brilliantly 
patterned kimonos, which sell for thousands of dollars. And, inspired by a 
massive food hall that puts London's Harrods to shame, we headed to the 
basement restaurant for a satisfying lunch of cold steamed noodles, just $6 
each. Such moderately priced restaurants are common in most Japanese department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 We had no problem locating other inexpensive meals in Tokyo, which boasts more 
than 60,000 restaurants, and sidestepped the language problem by simply 
pointing to the ubiquitous wax replicas of house specialties. For example, 
dinner one evening at a restaurant near our hotel came to just $36 for two -- 
including strips of beef and chicken we cooked ourselves over a grill and two 
large bottles of beer. Since the tip was always included in the check, we never 
had to worry about whether we'd left enough change for the help. 
</P>
<P>
 True to our intentions, we used the subway to get about Tokyo and encountered 
no difficulties in doing so. Fares varied depending on distances, but our trips 
to the heart of town rarely exceeded $1.50 each. We didn't worry about getting 
lost; we soon learned that whenever we hesitated, confused by which tunnel or 
which staircase to take, there was always someone who would volunteer 
directions in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the inn late at night, we had no worry about who might be lurking 
in the dark, ready to mug us -- certainly not after we saw unaccompanied women 
walking home down dimly lit alleys and streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first three days in Tokyo enabled us to get our feet firmly on the ground. 
Now we were ready for Kyoto via the famed Shinkansen, or bullet train -- a 2 
1/2-hou, approximately 300-mile journey that was included in the cost of our 
two-week rail pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Our seats were well-designed and relaxing, with plenty of leg room for my 
6-foot, 3-inch frame, and despite the 170-m.p.h. speed there was none of the 
swaying and rattling associated with Amtrak. At regular intervals, a hostess 
pushed a drink-and-food cart down the aisle. Whenever she left the car, she 
turned toward the passengers and bowed in our direction, a courtesy my wife and 
I found affecting. 
</P>
<P>
 We had purchased two bento, or box lunches, on the platform for around $9 
each, and settled back to eat them and watch the landscape zip by. We even 
spotted Mt. Fuji, its white peak seeming to float disembodied from its base in 
the industrial haze that hangs over so much of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 As luck would have it, our Kyoto ryokan, the Rikiya -- which we had picked 
blind from the Welcome Inns list -- turned out to be on the eastern edge of the 
city, at the foot of the wooded hills where so many of the historic temples are 
located. It was a charming place, on a narrow street free of automobile 
traffic, with a small mossy garden for an entryway. Almost hidden by the 
foliage was a trickling fountain whose sound created a sense of instant 
serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the loveliest thing about such a traditional inn -- a bargain at $152 
for two, considering many, more luxurious ryokans cost anywhere from $100 to 
$600 per person, per night -- is the way nature is invited inside. A large, 
flat river boulder served as a step in the vestibule where the owner, a plump 
woman in a white kimono, welcomed us with a deep bow and cheerful laughter. We 
took off our shoes and placed them in a bamboo-and-wood cabinet that rested on 
a row of water-worn cobbles, then tucked our feet into the pea-green, 
kid-leather slippers waiting for us. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls were the color of coffee and cream, mimicking the mud finish used in 
the old days; the unvarnished woodwork showed its silky grain, and the tatami 
mats had a fresh, golden glow. While a maid unfolded our futons, our hostess 
showed us the immaculate toilets and baths along the common hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Before re-entering the room, I asked for the key. Our friendly guide looked 
puzzled. I pointed to the lock. She shook her head, smiling. Then I remembered: 
In a traditional ryokan you should feel as though you are at home, and you 
don't lock doors behind you at home. 
</P>
<P>
 We awoke early, often to the muffled sound of distant gongs being rung in the 
temples, accompanied by the caws and cries of Japan's ever-present crows. 
Breakfast was of our own devising: We had discovered a bakery and a supermarket 
a few blocks from the inn, where we bought orange juice (about $3 a quart) and 
pastries for around $1 each. Every morning, the maid came to the room with good 
coffee and thick cream, and we ate on our porch, watching passersby below. 
</P>
<P>
 We soon realized that Kyoto provides more charms than our six-day visit could 
begin to cover. But we managed to see many of the temples, gardens and palaces. 
We were somewhat dismayed by the high entrance fees, between $4 and $5 each. 
But we offset their costs walking to many of the sights and taking a bus to the 
more distant ones on the western edge of the city. Using buses proved as easy 
as taking the Tokyo subway, and most had loudspeakers announcing the stops in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyoto, with its high aesthetics, is a good place to shop. Our neighborhood had 
many establishments offering tasteful goods, ranging from traditional painted 
fans and colorful paper lanterns to modern ceramics. Had we the money, we 
probably would have bought one of everything at the nearby Kyoto Crafts Center, 
a cooperative displaying the work of more than 100 local artists. Instead, we 
settled for two silk, bandana-like cloths (which Japanese use as a kind of gift 
wrap) and several graphically stunning calendars. The cost: a reasonable $6 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 We fell in love with Kyoto, and might have stayed longer had we not had a room 
waiting for us in Hiroshima, a two-hour, 225-mile ride by S hinkansen . Our 
hotel, the 10-story Kawashima, lay close to the railway station and was an 
amusing contrast to our genteel accommodations in Kyoto. The double bed filled 
almost the entire room, yet somehow an armchair, a desk, another chair, a TV, a 
small refrigerator and an electric coffee and tea maker had been squeezed into 
it. A closet enabled us to dispose of our luggage while a Lilliputian bathroom 
saved us from having to use any shared facilities. For this, we paid $110 a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd come to Hiroshima to see its Peace Memorial Park and Museum, monuments to 
the 600,000 victims of the atomic bomb dropped on the city in 1945. I suspect 
the museum price is pegged low (about 50 cents each) to encourage visitation, 
but we were struck by how few foreigners we met among the hundreds of Japanese 
who thronged the area. In the park, hardly a moment passed without our hearing 
the reverberating gong of the peace bell being rung by visitors -- a ghostly, 
haunting counterpoint to the images of destruction and horror we had seen in 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 We were deeply stirred, but glad to return to the vital atmosphere of Tokyo 
and to the Sawanoya. Our host was once again on hand to greet us, cockatiel 
still riding on his shoulder, and he gave us a much bigger room this time, 
which cost only $6 more than the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, we felt very much at ease. Looking back, we had managed what we had 
set out to do -- travel economically, even in high-priced Japan. Lunches, 
mostly in noodle shops, had run about $15 for two; dinners averaged $35 for 
two. Excluding air fare, we'd spent around $3,400 for our two weeks -- 
including lodging, meals, transportation and even a few souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Our last day in Tokyo, we headed back to the central station to catch the 
train to the airport. Once again, we were engulfed by an onrushing flood of 
sarariman -- and found ourselves happily swimming along toward the Narita 
Express and the last lap of our Japan journey. GUIDEBOOK: Getting the Most for 
Your Dollar on Your Japanese Vacation 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: The lowest round-trip fare from LAX to Tokyo is $1,030 through 
May 31 (six-day minimum stay); the fare increases to $1,140 June through 
September. United, Northwest, All Nippon, Delta, Korea and Singapore airlines 
all offer one nonstop flight daily; Japan Airlines has one flight daily and a 
second on Saturdays and Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: We used the three-year-old Welcome Inn Reservation Center, 
whose directory lists more than 500 lodgings (most in Tokyo and Kyoto) with 
rates ranging from about $40 to $80 per person, per night. Welcome Inn 
accommodations include ryokan , Japanese-style inns with futons instead of 
beds; minshuku, small, family-run inns that are often less expensive than 
ryokans ; kokumin shukusha , rustic lodgings in national parks; hotels; 
pensions; and "business hotels," small, no-frills, Western-style lodgings often 
located near train stations. Overseas visitors reserving through Welcome Inn 
are exempt from taking breakfast and dinner at ryokans, an extra charge that is 
mandatory for Japanese guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact the Japan National Tourist Office (624 S. Grand Ave., Suite 1611, Los 
Angeles 90017; telephone 213- 623-1952) for a directory of Welcome Inn 
lodgings, reservation centers and reservation forms. Mail or fax the forms at 
least three to four weeks in advance to one of the reservation centers in 
Japan. The center accepts reservation requests only with a confirmed booking on 
a flight arriving in Japan before 3 p.m. the day of check-in. Cancellations are 
highly discouraged on this deposit-free, non-prepaid service. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome Inn bookings may also be made through reservation centers after 
arriving in Japan (though availability may be more limited). For Tokyo 
lodgings, contact the Welcome Inn Reservation Center, c/o International Tourism 
Center of Japan, 9th Floor, Tokyo Kotsu Kaikan Building, 2-10-1 Yurakucho, 
Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 100; tel. 011-81-3-3211-4201 or fax 011-81-3-3211-9009. For 
lodgings in Kyoto, Kyoto Tower Building, Higashi-Shiokojicho, Shimogyo-Ku, 
Kyoto, 600; tel. 011- 81-75-371-5649 or fax 011-81-75- 343-6847. 
</P>
<P>
 Other budget options include lodgings in temples and shrines (about $70 per 
person, per night, including breakfast), and claustrophobic, males-only 
"capsule hotels" (about $40-$70 per person, per night) geared to Japanese 
businessmen who missed their last train. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around: The Japan Rail Pass offers unlimited travel on Japan Railways 
trains and buses. The Japan National Tourist Organization can supply names of 
agencies that sell the passes, which may vary in price depending on the 
agency's exchange rate. Approximate cost is $272 per person for a one-week 
pass, $433 for a two-week pass and $555 for a three-week pass. Japan Rail 
Passes must be purchased before departure from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: Contact the Japan National Tourist Organization. I was 
particularly impressed with the free booklets "Japan for the Budget Traveler"; 
"Japan: Your Traveling Companion With Tips for Budget Travel," which, among 
other things, described how to apply for and obtain reduced-rate rail passes, 
and "Hello Japan," which offered information on everything from the proper way 
to use chopsticks to the etiquette involved in taking a Japanese bath.

TRAVEL INSIDER: CONSULTANTS WITH EXPERTISE BECOMING A TOUR DE FORCE; PLANNING: 
DON'T CALL THEM TRAVEL AGENTS. THESE MAVENS OF REGIONAL ITINERARIES CAN DEVISE 
A CUSTOMIZED TRIP -- FOR A PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The travel agent is as close as most tourists ever get to a free lunch. At no 
cost to you, an agent can recommend and book your vacation, often drawing on 
special expertise and firsthand travel experience in making recommendations. 
Find a good one and your life is simplified. 
</P>
<P>
 But no lunch is truly free. The problem with many of the roughly 32,000 travel 
agencies in the United States is that agents' attentions are claimed by 
computerized reservation systems, airline fare wars, and fluctuations in the 
commissions they are paid by lodgings and airlines. That often leaves agents 
without time to learn geography in detail or see many destinations themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing an opening there, a new breed of travel consultants has developed. 
They specialize in a certain area and reject the title "travel agent" as an 
understatement of their expertise. Some make bookings, some don't. Some accept 
commissions, some don't. Most interview customers about their preferences and 
interests, then come back with itinerary proposals that touch on lodgings, 
dining, cultural attractions and entertainment. Unlike travel agents, these 
consultants charge consumers upfront for their service. 
</P>
<P>
 Their prices can be daunting -- as much as $70 an hour -- but they can deliver 
a service highly prized by travelers with less time than money. Regional 
expertise is one advantage. Also, for those consultants who reject commissions 
-- taking their fees only from the client -- it can be argued that their advice 
is less influenced by monetary considerations, and is therefore more likely to 
be "pure." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a handful of such companies, listed by their territories: 
</P>
<P>
 * California. Perfect Weekends (2059 Camden Ave., Suite 186, San Jose, Calif. 
95124; tel. 800-493-3536 or 408-559-3652). Susan Barton, a veteran of a decade 
in software training and related Silicon Valley-type pursuits, opened San 
Jose-based Perfect Weekends in June, 1993, aiming to match busy Californians 
with B&Bs around the state. In the 11 months since, she says, she has booked 
more than 400 trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton charges $99 to plan a one-destination trip, and presumes that most of 
her customers will be driving. She books lodgings, makes meal reservations, 
schedules lessons or rentals, and often builds weekends around special events 
such as festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 * American West. Off the Beaten Path (109 E. Main St., Bozeman, Mont. 59715; 
tel. 406-586-1311, fax 406-587-4147). Pam and Bill Bryan, both trained 
environmentalists and tour guides, started the firm in 1987, specializing in 
outdoorsy trips to Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana 
and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Bill Bryan estimates, the company arranged trips for about 570 
individuals, couples and groups, with activities such as fishing, skiing, 
riding, hiking and canoeing. Fees for planning generally run $70 an hour, with 
a minimum of four or eight hours, depending on the complexity of the trip. 
Customers get detailed itineraries, plane tickets and maps. 
</P>
<P>
 * England. Oh to Be in England . . . (2 Charlton St., New York 10014; tel. 
212- 255-8739, fax 212-986-8365). Jennifer Dorn, an administrator at New York 
University's law school and frequent traveler to England for the last two 
decades, set up her business four years ago. She doesn't make bookings (she 
advises travelers to make reservations themselves or use a travel agent), but 
fills spiral-bound notebooks with itinerary recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical trip takes her about 10 hours to plan. In the last year, she 
estimates that she's done about 150 itineraries. Dorn charges $150-$225, 
depending on the number of cities in the itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 * France. Point of View. (5922 Melvin Ave., Tarzana 91356; tel. 818-705-4418, 
fax 818-708-7131). Kajsa Agostini was born in France and spent 15-years with 
the French Government Tourist Office in California before striking off on her 
own last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Agostini, who usually spends July and August in France in addition to one or 
two other trips each year, does not make bookings. Instead, she interviews 
travelers and devises an itinerary. Once the itinerary is booked, Agostini 
often writes to hotels to confirm reservations and ensure personalized service. 
She charges about $200. 
</P>
<P>
 * Italy. Marjorie Shaw's Insider's Italy (P.O. Box 021816A, Brooklyn, N.Y. 
11202-1816; tel. 718-855-3878, fax 718-855-3687.) Shaw, who was born in Rome 
and lived in Italy for more than a decade, started her consulting business in 
1988, after spending four years leading walking tours through the country. Shaw 
says she usually visits Italy five times a year, and maintains an office in 
Rome. Her databank of Italian intelligence includes roughly 400 small hotels 
throughout the country. She makes hotel and transportation bookings and gives 
clients a portfolio that runs as long as 85 pages. Her typical fee for a couple 
on a two-week trip with four stops: $495. (If Shaw doesn't answer her phone, 
she's on a fact-finding trip; fax or call back later.)

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; METAL DETECTORS ON CRUISE SHIPS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Coast Guard is seeking public comment on proposals that would require 
cruise ships to implement passenger and luggage screening procedures similar to 
those used by the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 This and other measures were spelled out in guidelines adopted by the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1986, after the cruise ship 
Achille Lauro was seized by terrorists in 1985 and an American passenger was 
killed.When the guidelines were adopted, the IMO asked the cruise lines to 
voluntarily comply with the proposals. However, "progress toward implementing 
the measure has slowed significantly," the Coast Guard now says, hence the move 
to make the measures mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to passenger and luggage screening, ships would be required to 
screen their cargo and meet international standards for lighting, alarms, 
communications systems and training ship personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 These are security measures "that should have been implemented years ago," 
said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Mark O'Malley last week from Washington. "It's basic 
. . . and we haven't reinvented the wheel here -- many of these measures are 
based on FAA security measures." But Jack Estes, president of the International 
Council of Cruise Lines, said that "what may be appropriate for an airline, may 
or may not be appropriate for a cruise ship," adding that "cost is not the 
issue -- the issue is what can get the job done. Every line already has 
security procedures in effect . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard will take comments on the proposals through June 23. For 
information, call (202) 267-0493.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; ANCIENT DANCE TAKES NEW TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The old and new have come together in Bangkok, where a new show combines the 
ancient classical dance of Thailand with contemporary production methods and 
English translations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Khon -- Royal Masked Dance Spectacular" is being presented at 8 p.m. Tuesdays 
and Thursdays in the Chalermkrung Royal Theater in downtown 
Bangkok.Reservations for the two-hour program can be made by any hotel or tour 
operator. Tickets start at about $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Khon often takes its story line from the Indian Ramayana, which is derived 
from Hindu legend. In its entirety, the Khon -- a stunning spectacle of 
warriors, demons and monkeys who perform highly stylized movements while 
wrapped in brilliant costumes -- requires 720 hours and more than 300 actors. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing performances at the Chalermkrung Royal Theater focus on eight 
scenes from the Khon and feature about 170 dancers from the Bangkok College of 
Drama. English translations are provided in printed programs and on above-stage 
screens.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: LAGUNA BEACH; SURF 'N' SENTIMENTALITY; A COUPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
VISITING THE APPEALING ORANGE COUNTY BEACH TOWN FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY COME 
BACK IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 My first romantic weekend here occurred in 1969 when, as an 18-year-old, I 
brought my college girlfriend home to meet Mom and Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 The same girl and I recently returned to Laguna for another romantic weekend, 
marking the 25th anniversary of our first. We left behind two teen-agers of our 
own and set out to rediscover Laguna through the lenses of a couple married 22 
years, tinted with fond memories of this place. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked in Friday afternoon at the Surf & Sand Hotel on Coast Highway, 
south of the heart of town. The local grande dame, Hotel Laguna, where we've 
stayed in the past, may exude an aging charm, but for exquisite comfort, it 
doesn't compare to the Surf & Sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Our top-floor, oceanfront tower room was elegant and as fresh as the day it 
opened -- or at least when the nine-story tower, constructed in 1969, was 
renovated along with the rest of the hotel five years ago at a reported cost of 
$27 million. The room was done in soothing beiges that delivered the colors of 
the sand below; a tabletop bromeliad offered a dazzling splash of red and 
green. On our walk-out balcony we toasted the sunset and watched sea gulls soar 
below us. 
</P>
<P>
 We began the first evening with cocktails in the piano lounge alongside the 
hotel's ninth-floor restaurant, the Towers. We found ourselves looking up at 
the ceiling as much as out of the windows because the mirrors above us 
reflected the breaking waves below. Then before dinner, we strolled along 
downtown's Forest Avenue, peeking inside the Mark Alan Gallery at the 
brilliantly colored acrylic portraits by a Russian artist, Vadik Suljakov. 
</P>
<P>
 On the advice of friends who live in Laguna, we had made dinner reservations 
at 5'0 (as in "five feet above sea level"), at the corner of Glenneyre and 
Mermaid, downtown. We were told -- accurately, as far as we were concerned -- 
that it offered the most exciting dining experience in town. Chef Michael Kang 
calls his menu contemporary Chinese cuisine. At 8 p.m. the restaurant was 
jammed but our table was awaiting us. Five Feet's ambience was curiously 
contrary, both elegant and garish -- as in the contrast between a single red 
rose petal on the edge of the black, gold-edged place setting and the pink neon 
house lighting. In the background, an epic soundtrack swelled, forcing everyone 
to talk still louder. Pop art decorated one wall. 
</P>
<P>
 We started with two appetizers: excellent coconut prawns over exotic greens 
with a Thai lime vinaigrette, and lobster giyoso (a dumpling-like dish) served 
with a tomato relish and crispy onions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the entree, Jeanne was drawn to a duet: rack of New Zealand lamb and 
Colorado lamb sirloin, served over stir-fried garlic chive, aged tofu, sweet 
onion and hot potato. I asked our server for her recommendation. The catfish is 
requisite for first-timers, she said. And it was, stunning both in presentation 
and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Our post-dinner stroll took us into the Engman International art gallery on 
Glenneyre at Forest Avenue. Tucked behind the gallery is its outdoor sculpture 
garden, which shimmers tantalizingly with accent lighting at night but, sadly, 
must be viewed through a fence because it usually is only open during daylight 
hours, when much of its magic is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Down Forest Avenue, the dinner crowd was giving way to the coffee-and-dessert 
crowd at the Renaissance Cafe. Patrons jammed against both the wine and beer 
bar and the coffee bar, and filled every table, including those spilling 
outdoors against the sidewalk. We were drawn in by the jazz-blues offerings of 
a harmonica-playing vocalist and his acoustical guitarist sidekick, and we were 
seated within 15 minutes. We whiled away nearly an hour over desserts, Mexicali 
coffee and Italian soda, enjoying people-watching even more than the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning we called on an old friend for breakfast: the Beach House 
Inn, perched between Coast Highway and the beach, behind Vacation Village. The 
family-run operation has offspring in Rancho Mirage and Cardiff-by-the-Sea, but 
the Laguna matriarch is the most quaint of the trio, operating out of the 
one-time home of Slim Summerville, an original Keystone Cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Snapshots of a Saturday in Laguna: 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Village, a bluff-top collection of 21 small shops on Coast Highway 
at Legion Street, is largely forgettable. C'mon, toe jewelry? But it does offer 
an elevated Kodak viewpoint of picturesque Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fil Mottola Fine Arts Gallery, a block from our hotel, the manager 
brusquely insisted as we walked in that we buy only from local masters, such as 
the ones she represented, versus some rank amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 Western art and curios? Trails West Galleries on Coast Highway is a must, even 
if you don't need another cowhide-covered piano. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried for a late lunch at Las Brisas -- which I knew as the Victor Hugo Inn 
until 1979 -- but got there five minutes too late. Shepherded to the bar, we 
ordered chicken nachos -- which were good -- and margaritas that were too 
bitter for our taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Our walk along Heisler Park, which stretches along the bluff top north of Main 
Beach, was among the most relaxing moments of our weekend. Others must have 
agreed; along the pathway, couples cuddled on park benches or walked 
hand-in-hand while others tiptoed through the tide pools below us. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought of visiting more art galleries but instead retreated to our hotel 
room. Jeanne threw open the slider, adjusted the shutters and nested with a 
favorite book in the large chair. I napped to the chorus of a crashing surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Our dinner site, Sorrento Grille on Glenneyre, has the feel of a nouveau 
Italian villa; it is as wide and long as a 10-lane bowling alley, and -- like 
Five Feet -- just as noisy. But it offers upstairs dining: a balcony that runs 
above the length of the kitchen, then hooks around at the end. Our table, No. 
52, offered a full view of cooks and diners alike, an excellent vantage point 
for people-watching and spying the most popular meals of the evening. Our 
favorites: the wild mushroom soup, which was better than fine; Jeanne's garlic 
chicken breast grilled "under the brick," and my vinegar-glazed pork chops, the 
house specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 For our final Laguna meal, Sunday brunch at Splashes, the beachside restaurant 
at the Surf & Sand, we secured an outdoor table 20 feet from the surf. The sky 
was a cloudless blue; space heaters eliminated any morning chill, and the meal 
-- off a menu, versus a buffet -- was exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the rest of the day in downtown Laguna and chanced upon the Laguna 
Craft Guild's outdoor show. (Another is scheduled for May 29-30.) We ended up 
at the Lumberyard on Ocean Avenue, which used to be a real lumberyard until it 
was converted into a collection of art and gift shops. Lo and behold, behind it 
was another coffeehouse: Cafe Zinc, just enough off the beaten path to have 
forged its success on the trade of locals. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't help myself and ordered a coconut cream pie. Jeanne looked 
disgusted with me, so I got her a lemon bar. And by the end of this weekend, we 
were overstuffed copies of that cute couple 25 years earlier. 
</P>

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: DIALING FOR MEDICAL DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wide range of travel health information is available just by picking up the 
telephone. Government, private and commercial organizations fund the phone 
services that answer questions, as well as provide taped information. Some 
telephone services will fax literature or mail brochures and directories. Some 
are toll-free. 
</P>
<P>
 To help keep a trip trouble-free, travelers should arm themselves with health 
information before leaving home. Here are a few telephone numbers that will 
assist in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perhaps the most useful source for travelers, the government's Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention voice information system offers taped or faxed 
data on a plethora of travel topics. By selecting from a list of options, 
callers with touch-tone phones can hear government advisories about 
immunizations required for specific destinations, recommended food and water 
precautions and other preventive health measures, and locations where there may 
be disease outbreaks: telephone (404) 332-4555. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Superintendent of Documents office accepts telephone orders for the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's "Health Information for 
International Travel" book, which includes specific immunization information by 
country -- updated yearly -- and other travel advice, such as a discussion of 
cruise ship sanitation. Cost of the book is $4.75: tel. (202) 783-3238. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. Department of State's Citizens Emergency Center can inform families 
in the United States of medical emergencies sustained by U.S. citizens abroad 
and will refer travelers abroad to companies offering evacuation services: tel. 
(202) 647-5225. 
</P>
<P>
 * International Assn. for Medical Assistance to Travelers provides a free 
directory of English-speaking doctors in 500 countries. It also offers 
immunization information by telephone and will mail out information about 
climate conditions and health precautions for specific destinations. Among its 
free publications, which can be ordered by telephone: "World Immunization 
Chart," "Traveller Clinical Record," "Be Aware of Schistosomiasis," "How to 
Protect Yourself Against Malaria" and "World Climate Chart." Call (716) 
754-4883 between 5 a.m. and 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Academy of Allergy and Immunology operates an information line 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. Staff can answer questions about pollen counts 
at specific U.S. destinations and suggest precautions for travelers with 
allergies and asthma: tel. (800) 822-2762. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Diabetes Assn. in Los Angeles, provides information about traveling 
with diabetes. Calls taken 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays: tel. (213) 381-3639. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arthritis Foundation, Southern California Chapter, will answer questions 
about traveling with arthritis as well as mail out a free brochure, "Travel 
Tips for People With Arthritis." Staffed 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, or leave a 
message: tel. (800) 954-2873. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Health Care Agency provides over-the-phone information 
about immunizations worldwide: tel. (714) 834-8330. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles County Department of Health Services provides names of 
physicians qualified to administer yellow fever vaccinations -- something not 
all physicians do -- in the caller's geographic area within Los Angeles County: 
tel. (213) 240-7941. 
</P>
<P>
 * In medical emergencies, some telephone companies can provide help by 
offering expert translation to medical personnel via the phone. Call before 
leaving the country for information on how to do so. Among services available: 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T Language Line Services, (tel. 800-628-8486), offers over-the-phone 
interpretation from English to 140 languages, 24 hours a day, seven days a

Services. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI offers travelers in 280 foreign countries translation services in 19

 TRANSYLVANIA AND BEYOND: A Travel Memoir by Dervla Murphy (The Overlook Press, 
$21.95 hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 There's one disappointing thing about this book, the latest from the 
adventurous, stylish and appealingly old-fashioned Irish travel writer Dervla 
Murphy: its title. True, it's straightforward and accurately descriptive of the 
book's contents -- which recount the author's travels, mostly by foot or 
bicycle, through the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. But this is a writer, 
after all, whose previous books have titles such as "In Ethiopia With a Mule," 
"On a Shoestring to Coorg," "Eight Feet in the Andes," "Muddling Through in 
Madagascar," and "Cameroon With Egbert" -- irresistible, colorful monikers that 
set the tone for Murphy's engaging prose. In such company, "Transylvania and 
Beyond" just sounds a little dull. But, of course, it isn't. It's compelling, 
educational (in the good sense of the word) and a delight to read. Murphy just 
strides (or rides) into the middle of a place and asks questions and speaks her 
mind and splendidly records the world that inevitably unfolds around her. 
</P>
<P>
 One brief example, Murphy's account of trudging through the countryside as 
"cold spits" of rain turn into sleet: " . . . (A) tractor drawing a load of 
firewood overtook me and stopped to offer a lift. It was awesomely ancient -- 
in Ireland people pay good money to witness such machines in action -- and 
already had two passengers in the cab. . . . Jolting towards Birzava, I decided 
a tip would not come amiss; as a newcomer, I still had much to learn. When I 
offered 100 lei -- more than a day's pay for a state farm tractor driver -- my 
rescuer flushed with insulted embarrassment. In rural Rumania, humans helping 
humans is not yet a commercial enterprise." This isn't guidebook stuff, but 
this is travel writing at its best.

 WE'RE HERE: A Touring Companion for Showing Visiting Friends and Relatives 
Southern California by Judith B. Uthus (Black Ball Publishing, $9.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Most people's friends and relatives probably don't want to come anywhere near 
Southern California these days, what with the riotsfiremudslidesearthquakes and 
all. Ah, but they'll come back. They'll forget the shaking ground and the 
burning supermarkets. And when they do start descending upon us again, this 
wouldn't be a bad little volume to have on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 As a guide to the area, it's superficial and sometimes sort of silly (its 
"Radical Tour" starts with Watts Towers and the First Unitarian Church on 
Wilshire Boulevard), but it does compress a lot of useful information -- and 
any guidebook that sends readers on a weekend excursion to Trona (not far from 
Death Valley) has a pretty offbeat sense of humor. Quick trips: 
</P>
<P>
 AUSTRALIA: The Rough Guide by Margo Daly, Anne Dehne, David Leffman and Chris 
Scott (Rough Guides/Penguin, $18.95 paper). Roughly (so to speak) 800 pages of 
small type, packed with breathlessly brief, practical information about the 
country-continent. 
</P>
<P>
 THE ALASKA GUIDE by Ron Dalby (Fulcrum Publishing, $16.95 paper). Short on 
literary style but long on practical information, this is a good traveler's 
introduction to the 49th state. The author's top-10 list of Alaskan 
destinations and activities, including touring the Mendenhall Glacier by 
helicopter and driving around Prince of Wales Island, is a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
 BOSTON SITES AND INSIGHTS by Susan Wilson (Beacon Press, $16 paperback). A 
dense, information-packed introduction to Beantown, based around 50 historic 
landmarks in and around the city -- and making use of the author's monthly 
column in the Boston Globe. Probably more than you need to know, but 
fascinating in spots.

TAKING THE KIDS: THE SECRET TO THEME PARK HAPPINESS -- PACING

 "One more time," 3-year-old Melanie pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 It was starting to rain and getting dark and cold. The older kids were ready 
to quit after a long day of being turned upside down on roller coasters, 
splashed on water rides and gobbling too many hot dogs. Needless to say, we 
grown-ups would have gladly gone home hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Melanie. Without waiting for a no, she ran into the 38-foot-tall 
Snoopy's Bounce to jump herself silly on big air-filled cushions. She then took 
off on the pint-size Red Baron's airplane ride, a big grin plastered on her 
ketchup-smudged face. 
</P>
<P>
 We had wandered into Camp Snoopy, the six-acre area of Knott's Berry Farm that 
is designed for younger children. Melanie obviously thought she had found theme 
park heaven and we got a kick out of seeing her enjoy herself so much. But I 
was beat and wondering how fast we could get out of the park -- without 
provoking a tantrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents shouldn't plan on having a lot of fun at amusement parks," said Tim 
O'Brien, who has written a book on the subject. O'Brien, an editor at Amusement 
Business magazine and the author of "The Amusement Park Guide" (Globe Pequot, 
$12.95), has ridden roller coasters all over the country with his two 
daughters. (This summer, O'Brien said, marks the 110th anniversary of the 
roller coaster.) 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you love them or hate them, amusement parks are part of growing up in 
America. So smear on some sunscreen, pack some healthy snacks and extra clothes 
for the kids (they will probably get wet on the water rides) and brace yourself 
for an exhausting day. 
</P>
<P>
 From California to Florida and Texas to Ohio, America's 400 theme parks -- 
both small and large -- are rolling out new attractions designed to thrill and 
entertain. Increasingly, they're designating areas that contain pint-size rides 
for young children, building elaborate playgrounds and touting their family 
appeal with musical shows. Here's what's opening across the country for 
families -- even those traveling with young children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, head for the new $7-million Fiesta Bay Boardwalk at Fiesta Texas 
park in San Antonio. The boardwalk is flanked by a giant Ferris wheel, kiddie 
rides, paddle boats and a water balloon game (telephone 800- 473-4378). 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm has spent $10 million developing Mystery Lodge, an 
attraction that uses special effects technology to take families on an 
adventure back in time, led by a mysterious special effects-created Native 
American storyteller (tel. 714-827-1776). 
</P>
<P>
 Settle down in Hollyrock, U.S.A. for "The Flintstone Show," which will open 
June 14 at Universal Studios Hollywood, complete with flying Pterodactyl planes 
(tel. 818-508-9600). 
</P>
<P>
 On the East Coast, Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, Va., has just opened the 
Land of the Dragons, where kids can cavort with friendly dragons in more than a 
dozen play elements (don't miss the three-story tree house). 
</P>
<P>
 Sesame Place outside Philadelphia is trumpeting its AmaZing Alphabet parade, 
complete with Sesame Street characters and chances for the preschool set to 
take part (call Busch Gardens at 804-253-3000 and Sesame Place at 
215-752-7070). 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of new heart-stopping thrill rides and attractions for older 
kids too. See dinosaurs as tall as 24 feet come to life at the Monster Marsh at 
Sea World of Texas in San Antonio (tel. 210- 523-3611). 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Wayne's World areas of Paramount's Kings Dominion in Richmond, Va., 
and Carowinds in Charlotte, N.C., and ride the Hurler at speeds up to 50 m.p.h. 
(Kings Dominion, tel. 804-876-5000; Carowinds, tel. 704-588-2606). 
</P>
<P>
 Go to the moon on Time Warner's Six Flags Great America new high-speed Space 
Shuttle, just north of Chicago, or escape from Gotham City on Batman the Ride, 
which also is making its West Coast debut at Six Flags Magic Mountain in 
Valencia (Great America, tel. 708-249-1776; Magic Mountain, tel. 805-255-4100). 
</P>
<P>
 Hersheypark in Hershey, Pa., has just opened Tidal Force, the world's tallest 
splashdown water ride -- with a drop of 100 feet (tel. 800-HERSHEY). 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember that kids can have just as much fun at smaller regional parks," Tim 
O'Brien said. Smaller parks are easier on the wallet too. With some park 
admissions now more than $30 a person, it's worth seeking out any bargain 
available. Call ahead to see if discount coupons are available. Disney World, 
for example, is inviting teachers to visit Epcot free through the end of 1994 
(bring verification of current employment and a teaching credential). 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien recommends this secret to theme park happiness: "Pace yourself so that 
you're riding when everyone is in the food lines and you're eating when they're 
in the ride lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, don't eat and then head for the biggest roller coaster. Nor should 
parents ever force kids to ride anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have reasons for not wanting to go on something," said UCLA child 
psychologist Jill Waterman, a veteran of many amusement park excursions with 
her 9-year-old twins. "If parents ignore their feelings, then the kids feel 
like they don't count." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien suggests checking out the ride before waiting in line to make sure the 
child knows what he's in for. And once he's on, if it's more than he bargained 
for, don't hesitate to signal the operator to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try to look at it from the child's perspective," Waterman said. "When they're 
tired and cranky, it's time to go, even if you haven't ridden every ride." 
</P>
<P>
 But try telling that to a 3-year-old when mom's the one who's cranky.

TRAVEL ADVISORY; HEEDING SINGAPORE'S STRICT LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD WRIGHT, Wright is a former assistant foreign editor at The Times. His 
column appears monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of the controversial caning of 18-year-old Michael Fay, the 
American convicted of spray painting cars, the U.S. State Department is 
reminding travelers of Singapore's strict penalties for a variety of offenses 
that might be considered minor in the United States, including jaywalking, 
littering and spitting, as well as the importation and sale of chewing gum. In 
addition, Singapore has a mandatory death penalty for many narcotics offenses. 
Sri Lanka 
</P>
<P>
 Terrorist bombs went off in four luxury hotels in early April, followed by a 
warning that tourists and foreign investors will be targeted, diplomats and 
news agencies reported. Three of the bombs exploded in rest rooms at the 
Marriott, Taj Samudra and Sapphire hotels in Colombo, the capital. A fourth 
went off prematurely, killing the man carrying it, at the Mt. Lavinia Hotel on 
the coast south of the city. A week later, a letter from a Tamil terrorist 
group described the bombings as warnings and said that in the future, 
foreigners who enter Sri Lanka will definitely get killed. The letter justified 
attacks on foreigners, saying that the government uses foreign investment to 
battle the long-running Tamil insurgency. Guatemala 
</P>
<P>
 Security forces rescued 7-year-old Georgina Robbins, daughter of an American 
businessman, who had been kidnaped while on her way to school and held for four 
days last month, according to the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City and the 
Reuters news service. Few details were released, but four Guatemalans were 
arrested in what was presumed to be an attempted kidnaping for ransom. In 
another development, the Mormon church took unspecified security precautions 
after rumors swept Mixco, a Guatemala City suburb, that two of the church's 
missionaries were responsible for the disappearance of two local children. 
According to diplomats, the children's mother expressed the belief that her 
estranged husband took the children. But rumors of child-stealing by foreigners 
have persisted throughout Guatemala recently. Trinidad and Tobago 
</P>
<P>
 Killings in the two-island Caribbean country (pop. 1.2 million) now average 
one a day, according to a local judicial official quoted by Reuters, and 
officials have deployed soldiers and police in troubled areas. There is no 
indication that foreign visitors are targets. (In its last information sheet on 
the country, dated May, 1993, the State Department mentions only the risk of 
petty street crime.) In a sign of economic unrest, at least half of the 
government and private-sector workers in Port of Spain, the capital, observed a 
one-day strike April 25 to protest the government's fiscal policies, including 
its plans to sell off some of the nation's 67 state enterprises. Trade union 
leadership denounced "the sellout of the country's patrimony to foreigners" and 
warned that another protest could bring the nation to a standstill. Briefly . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan: The State Department advises Americans to defer all nonessential 
travel to Sindh province, which includes Karachi, because of the increase in 
rioting, and violence between police and anti-government forces. Deaths have 
occurred, and cars and buses have been burned. The road from the Karachi 
International Airport to downtown hotels is considered particularly unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil: An armed gang blocked the highway from Brasilia, the capital, to the 
Atlantic coast city of Salvador for more than four hours on April 26 and robbed 
passengers aboard every bus that passed, Reuters reported. The gang, about half 
a dozen men, stole cash and valuables from more than 300 passengers on seven 
buses. Police are reportedly now riding the long-haul buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the Territories: A 22-year-old American tourist was stabbed in the 
hand by a young Palestinian near the West Bank village of Husan, according to 
an Israeli news service. The unidentified visitor was attacked while walking in 
an orchard, and police have made three arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot Spots: Because of the widespread fighting in Yemen, the State Department 
has added that Arabian Peninsula country to its list of places where Americans 
might be at risk. Travel warnings also are in effect for Afghanistan, Algeria, 
Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, Guatemala, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, 
Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Korea, Peru, Rwanda, Serbia and Montenegro, 
Somalia, Sudan and Tajikistan, and for East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. State Department offers recorded travel warnings and advisories at 
(202) 647-5225; the fax line is (202) 647-3000.

TASTE OF TRAVEL / SINGAPORE; DISHING UP A CURE; THERE'S A REMEDY IN EVERY 
RECIPE AT THE IMPERIAL HERBAL RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK JENKINS, Massachusetts-based writer Jenkins was born, raised and 
educated in Singapore. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a horrible feeling I know what's going to happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a moment," says my pal Boon Hee, who lays down his chopsticks, jumps up 
from the table and scuttles through the packed Imperial Herbal Restaurant. I'm 
left nervously making small talk with Mrs. Wang-Lee Tee Eng, the restaurant 
owner, between mouthfuls of Shredded Fish With Yam. 
</P>
<P>
 My worst fears are confirmed when Boon returns waving two branch-like objects. 
"This one bull penis; this one deer penis!" he announces triumphantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Curious diners watch my expression as Boon and Wang-Lee explain the 
aphrodisiac properties of the two organs and how they're boiled, dried and 
sliced to make restorative soups and wines. Wang-Lee is especially explicit. 
The dainty Chinese restaurateur points to the shriveled testicles and rejoices, 
"That's where all the hormones are!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mercifully, Boon returns the offending objects to the kitchen, and we resume 
one of the most interesting -- albeit peculiar -- meals I've ever eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore's Imperial Herbal Restaurant, located a stone's throw from the 
legendary Raffles Hotel in the heart of old Singapore, serves a full gamut of 
dishes expressly intended to remedy ailments from arthritis to low sexual 
appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's runaway success in Singapore, where 78% of the population is 
Chinese, may be attributed to the Chinese conviction that you truly "are what 
you eat." It was inspired by southern China's "tonic soup" cafes -- eateries 
whose patrons believe they can calibrate their yin and yang through judicious 
consumption of soups made with ingredients said to possess curative powers. The 
soups are familiar to Singaporeans -- many of whom have roots in southern China 
-- because they are a staple of doting mothers who are thrown into a tizzy if 
one of their offspring looks even slightly off-color. 
</P>
<P>
 During a visit to China in 1986, it occurred to Wang-Lee -- a Singaporean 
freshly graduated from business school in Canada -- that she could take the 
tonic soup concept a step further in her prosperous, food-obsessed homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 She opened the Imperial Herb Restaurant in 1988. In contrast to the down-home 
ambience of traditional tonic soup cafes, Wang-Lee's establishment is decidedly 
upscale, replete with rosewood furniture and antique silk wall hangings. The 
restaurant seats 160, and the day I was there it was crowded with tables full 
of tonic wine-chugging housewives, yuppies scarfing dishes intended to reduce 
their stress levels, ginseng-gobbling tourists from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan 
and even a few bemused gweilo (white devils like me). 
</P>
<P>
 On Wang-Lee's payroll from the beginning has been Li Lian Xing, a famous 
herbalist/physician from Tianjin, China. Li worked with head chef Bian Jian 
Nian, who came from a similar restaurant in China, and master chef Shi Lian 
Yong, a former winner of China's prestigious National Culinary Competition, to 
concoct a myriad of health-enhancing recipes that would produce dishes both 
curative and delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, my shredded fish with yams. The steamed fresh fish was 
firm but tender and served in a pungent garlic sauce that was at once sweet, 
savory and spicy. Superb to the taste. But that's only half the story. 
According to Wang-Lee, the yams will help strengthen my spleen and stomach, 
thus improving my digestive system, and tone up my lungs and kidneys. The dish 
also purports to reduce blood sugar and remedy mild forms of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Double-Boiled Chicken Soup With Ginseng and Chinese Wolfberry, the 
hearty dark broth allegedly improves blood circulation and eyesight, lowers 
cholesterol and helps control diabetes. The chickens they use for this dish, 
incidentally, are "black chickens," a different breed of fowl whose flesh is as 
dark as slate. The Singaporean Chinese believe it is more nutritious than your 
run-of-the-mill white-fleshed variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Double-boiling, Wang-Lee explains, is the process of cooking soup in a 
container that is then placed in yet another caldron filled with boiling water. 
There is no direct contact with the heat, so it cooks slowly -- the low 
temperature helping to maintain the nutrient content. Tonic soups are usually 
boiled for at least three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Many items on the menu, which emphasizes Beijing-style cuisine, won't deter 
the timid of palate. Most dishes feature such familiar ingredients as seafood, 
poultry, beef and vegetables. It's only the presence of the oddly named 
curative herbs that is potentially off-putting. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm warming to the subject and ask Wang-Lee to recommend something for the 
aftereffects of a 24-hour, trans-Pacific marathon flight from Boston. She 
doesn't miss a beat. "Coming from a cold, dry climate to Singapore, which is 
hot and humid, requires your lungs to be moistened," she says, "and for that I 
recommend dishes using the bulb of lily flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 And jet lag itself? "Ginseng," blurts Boon, and Wang-Lee nods sagely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ginseng in tea, in soup, in main dishes -- always restorative," she intones. 
</P>
<P>
 Flipping through the menu, I encounter dishes far more exotic than the ones 
Boon has ordered for us: Monkey-Head Mushroom With Milk Vetch Root ("Improves 
complexion; enhances memory and all mental functions: sedative prevention of 
cancer, especially stomach cancer"); Stewed Shin Beef With Plygenum Multiflorum 
Soup ("Prevents premature graying; promotes longevity"); Fresh Water Fish With 
American Ginseng ("Prevents spontaneous perspiration"); The Whip Soup 
("Aphrodisiac"); Gui Fei Soup "(A lady's tonic soup for a youthful beautiful 
complexion"); Multiflorum Jelly ("Preserves the original color of the hair"). 
</P>
<P>
 Some dishes have as their main ingredient scorpions and ants, which are first 
marinated in Chinese rice wine and deep-fried in a lightly spiced batter until 
they are a crispy golden brown. Ants, a group of esteemed Chinese scientists 
recently reported, act against rheumatism, hepatitis-B and other "immunity 
disorders." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Imperial Herbal Restaurant's selling points is Li himself, who runs 
a traditional-looking Chinese herbal medicine counter close to the restaurant's 
entrance, a sight as incongruous as a prescription counter at Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 By request, Li will check patrons' pulses, examine their tongues and diagnose 
their health -- and provide a list of recommended dishes. He may also prescribe 
a package of herbs ($4-$15) to steep in hot water and drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant starts to empty as Boon and I finish our dessert of Menthol 
Jelly With Honeysuckle Flower ("Good for sore throat"), which frankly makes me 
feel a little peculiar. It has the look and texture of lime Jello, but the 
menthol has the same effect on my lungs that old-fashioned chest rubs do, 
without the smell. 
</P>
<P>
 I sit back in my seat, waiting for a wave of well-being to wash over me, 
sweeping away the detritus of jet lag and an overindulgent night on the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like Western drugs," Wang-Lee says admonishingly. "You must live 
healthily and eat herbal meals regularly. No quick-fix solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least my "original hair color" has been preserved. GUIDEBOOK:

HIKING: GOLD COUNTRY: HILL ON WHEELS ALONG THE SOUTH YUBA RIVER

 Wheelchair access to the forest primeval is becoming more common, but longer, 
truly adventurous trails for the physically challenged remain in short supply.

 But I recently discovered a trail for people of all abilities: the South Yuba 
Independence Trail, which winds through California's Gold Country.

 The Independence Trail began as the Excelsior Canal, built in 1859 to carry 
water from the South Yuba River to hydraulic gold-mining operations in 
Smartsville, 25 miles south. While the five-foot-wide aqueduct crossed very 
steep country, it followed the contours of hillsides, making it almost 
completely level. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer efforts, spearheaded by environmentalist John Olmsted and the 
nonprofit Sequoya Challenge, rebuilt crumbling wooden flumes and transformed 
the long-abandoned water ditch into a scenic, wheelchair-accessible trail in 
1981. The California Department of Parks and Recreation and volunteer groups 
have ambitious plans over the next few years to complete 10 miles of 
whole-access trail along the South Yuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is a large undertaking for the state park system. When completed, 
the park will extend about 20 miles from Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park 
to the confluence of the South and main forks of the Yuba. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-mile trail, part of which is the Independence Trail, extends along parts 
of the 20-mile stretch of river. One length of trail begins at the park visitor 
center and covered bridge, reached by driving eight miles north on Pleasant 
Valley Road from California 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: The main entrance to the Independence Trail is just 
off California 49, seven miles north of Nevada City and one mile past the Yuba 
River crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: From the signed trail head, the path uses an underpass to dip under 
the highway and begins contouring along the south bluff of the river. You can 
use the trail in the old water ditch or a parallel path above it. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasant path crosses ravines by way of several wooden flumes. A bit more 
than a mile of woodsy walking brings you to Flume 28 over Rush Creek. Here 
you'll find a vista point, fishing platform, picnic deck and an outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Independence Trail continues another half-mile to Jones Ravine. From the 
ravine, a non-wheelchair-accessible trail continues westward for five miles but 
boulders and brush make it a difficult hike. Independence Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: California's Gold Country, South Yuba River Project near Nevada City. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2 miles round trip; longer walks possible. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Steep banks of South Yuba River, dramatic river canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Wheelchair accessible trail, world's longest single-span covered 
bridge. 
</P>

DESTINATION / HONG KONG; A WORLD AWAY; LITTLE LAMMA ISLAND, A 40-MINUTE FERRY 
RIDE FROM HONG KONG, OFFERS A RURAL RESPITE FROM THE CROWDS

<P>
 Most of Hong Kong's 6 million inhabitants are packed onto a section of Hong 
Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula. Pushing through the crowds on Nathan Road or 
in the teeming markets of Mongkok, the city's density is all too palpable. But 
take a ferry to one of Hong Kong's 235 outlying islands, and you can escape a 
world of high-rises and flyovers in less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamma is one of the closest islands to the city, only 40 minutes away by ferry 
from Hong Kong's Central District. Its open-air seafood restaurants on the 
waterfront are famous for the freshest prawns, lobster and other delicacies -- 
at prices about a third less than Hong Kong's. The largely rural, 
five-square-mile island attracts a sizable contingent of Hong Kong 
day-trippers, particularly on summer weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I visited on a quiet autumn weekday, I was searching for serenity, 
not seafood. Private cars are prohibited on Lamma, and I was looking forward to 
a relaxing hike along its gentle, grassy hills and deserted beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 I disembarked at Yung Shue Wan, one of two Lamma villages served by the Hong 
Kong Ferry, with several commuters returning home from work. (Most of the 
island's 5,000 residents are fishermen, but it has also drawn former Hong Kong 
residents fleeing the city's congestion.) 
</P>
<P>
 Following the commuters' lead and my map, I walked 20 or 30 minutes to a small 
crescent of almost-white sand, at this hour echoed by the crescent moon just 
visible in the western sky above the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Straight up the steep hill overlooking Hung Shing Ye Beach, I saw a 
red-and-white sign advertising, in Chinese characters, Han Lok Yuen, one of 
several small, unpretentious "holiday houses" that cater to weekend visitors 
from Hong Kong. I climbed a broken flight of cement steps to a scarlet-painted 
iron gate, beyond which was a terrace dotted with umbrella-topped tables and 
surrounded by palm trees and potted plants. 
</P>
<P>
 My corner room on the third and top floor, with a tiny bathroom whose shower 
produced a weak jet of warmish water, was simple in the extreme. But its very 
simplicity set off the beauty of the scene outside. I carefully averted my eyes 
from the large power plant directly to the west (whose twin stacks are visible 
as far away as Hong Kong). But to the east, against a backdrop of brown hills, 
banana trees with broad, tattered leaves fluttered in the wind. Red and purple 
bougainvillea crowded the windows. And on the bay side, green bamboo at least 
30 feet high pushed through my balcony's crimson railings, and the indigo South 
China Sea lay beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant at the Han Lok Yuen is famous for its roast pigeon, and 
securing a table at dinner (especially for one or two people, since most tables 
seat 8 or 10) can be difficult. I managed to get a seat on the terrace at 
sunset and asked for their signature dish. "Why don't you have it tomorrow," my 
waiter suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going back to the city tomorrow," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if you don't mind waiting a long time . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't -- but learned to order in advance the next time. When my pigeon 
finally arrived, spread-eagle on its white plate, it was crisp and luscious . . 
. not really roasted at all, but simmered first in a richly spiced broth, then 
deep-fried to seal in the juices and give the skin a glossy crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The following morning, I set out on what I had planned as an all-day hike to 
some of Lamma's more remote beaches and up 1,158-foot Shan Tei Tong (Mt. 
Stenhouse), the island's highest vantage point. I was prepared for at least a 
few wrong turns. In more populated parts of the island, footpaths are often 
paved and clearly marked in English. But once you pass beyond the larger 
settlements, they are neither maintained nor marked. 
</P>
<P>
 The path that began below my hotel, just off Hung Shing Ye Beach, bumped up 
and down along low and windy cliffs above stony beaches and sheer drops to the 
sea. Dragonflies and blue, black and white butterflies darted in and out of the 
tall grasses. Already a hot-looking haze hung over the peak in front of me -- 
making me glad I'd chosen to explore Lamma in autumn, when temperatures are 
often at least 10 degrees cooler than on a sticky midsummer's day. 
</P>
<P>
 From the island's isthmus near Lo So Shing Beach, the little fishing port of 
Sok Kwu Wan was shining in the sun, the wind rippling the water to a fine 
glitter. Dozens, maybe hundreds, of small boats and pontoons topped by little 
shacks painted pink and green formed a floating bridge almost all the way 
across the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 A red-brick and whitewashed-cement-block building with scarlet doors stood 
open to the breeze on the outskirts of the village. Inside, cramming the narrow 
aisles of the Tin Hau temple (dedicated to the Taoist queen of heaven and 
goddess of the sea), I saw a horned beast's head of papier-mache and red plush 
and two shrines encrusted with paper deities, dragons and red, green and blue 
flowers. Gold-and-white lanterns with silky red tassels hung suspended from the 
ceiling. An open window on Sok Kwu Wan's main street revealed a small room full 
of older women, lustily playing mah-jongg with much clacking of tiles. Along 
the waterfront, shops and restaurants were just opening up. At one 
establishment, the kitchen staff sat around a table outside, eating richly 
flavored sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, a snack that looked so tempting I 
bought one as sustenance for my journey. Following a cement path along the 
coast to the east, I bypassed the turnoff to the beach at Mo Tat Wan and headed 
directly for the village of Mo Tat, a cluster of houses and banana groves. Near 
laundry poles sporting sets of black pajamas in front of traditional, 
tile-roofed stone houses, a man was doing his washing at a communal spigot. 
</P>
<P>
 Past the cluster of houses and banana groves that make up Mo Tat, the path led 
under cover, and tiny sapphire butterflies darted in and out of the shade. 
</P>
<P>
 From another nearby village called Tung O -- where two tattered red rags tied 
to a bamboo pole marked the entrance, reminiscent of a Chinese landscape 
painting -- I took an unmarked, yellow dirt path up the northeast ridge of Shan 
Tei Tong. As I climbed, I looked down the mountain's steep eastern slope to the 
lapis lazuli waters and white-sand beach at Sham Wan. About halfway up, the 
path became steep steps cut into the sandy soil by the feet of earlier climbers 
-- a graphic reminder that the trail is recommended for experienced hikers, and 
only when the visibility is good. 
</P>
<P>
 At the summit, crickets chirped faintly in the sharp wind, amid grass and pale 
purple thistle. The skyscrapers of Hong Kong Island and the cement works at Sok 
Kwu Wan prevented some of the isolation I seek on mountaintops, but the views 
across the water were breathtaking, the gray shapes of neighboring Lantau's 
peaks suggesting another expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 The northwest descent from the peak to Lo So Shing Beach, along a gently 
undulating ridge with a view of the water, looked more gradual and less 
fearsome than the way I came up. But the final segment of the trail petered out 
in the grass. Although I was just above cultivated fields on the outskirts of a 
village, I found myself fighting through a dense growth of cane, emerging in 
the midst of neatly tilled rows of eggplants. Two women in black pajamas and 
conical straw hats, working in a corner of the field, waved me away, showing 
their displeasure at my intrusion. Making my way carefully between the soft 
ridges of eggplant, I was soon on the path back to where I had started, the 
beach at Hung Shing Ye. 
</P>
<P>
 I arrived at dusk, with plenty of time before the last ferry left for Hong 
Kong at 10:35 p.m. Colored lights to celebrate Friday night were strung across 
the red iron gate at my hotel, the Han Lok Yuen; it was so inviting that I 
decided to stay for a leisurely dinner. I had another pigeon, along with a dish 
of choy sung and oyster sauce and a cold Tsing Tao beer to wash the dust of the 
road from my throat. I was rounding out my stay on Lamma as I had begun it -- 
but with a deepened appreciation for the island's serene contrast to its 
frenetic neighbor across the way. GUIDEBOOK: The Isle File 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: The lowest round-trip fare from LAX to Hong Kong is $1,040 
through May 31 (six-day minimum stay); the fare increases to $1,244 from June 
through September. United and Cathay Pacific offer one nonstop flight daily; 
Delta has three weekly flights. Other airlines offer connecting flights through 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong-Lamma Island Ferry operates out of the Hong Kong Central Harbour 
Services Pier with more than a dozen round-trip excursions daily between Hong 
Kong and Yung Shue Wan. Adult fares are about $1-$3 each way. Local telephone: 
542-3082. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Though most Lamma visitors come for day trips only, there are 
several small, unpretentious places to spend the night. Avoid weekends if 
possible, particularly during the summer. I stayed at the eight-room Han Lok 
Yuen, which charges about $41 per night for two people. 16 Hung Shing Ye, Yung 
Shue Wan; tel. 011-852-982-0680. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: The roast pigeon at the hotel Han Lok Yuen costs about $7. I 
didn't sample Lamma's seafood restaurants, most of which line the waterfront 
near the ferry stop in the village of Sok Kwu Wan. They feature large tanks 
from which guests can pluck their dinners-to-be. Among the most popular 
choices: Rainbow, 16219 First St., local tel. 982-8100. Lamma Mandarin, 8 First 
St., tel. 982-8128. Peach Garden, Lot 583, tel. 982-8581. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking on Lamma: A good map is a must, and you can find a full range of 
topographical maps at the government publications office on the ground floor of 
the main Hong Kong Post Office in the Central District. The best map for hiking 
along established paths is the "Lantau & Islands" map (Countryside Series Map 
No. 3).

<P>
 Continental Airlines has renewed its popular Freedom Passport for those over 
age 62. Under the program, travelers buy a "passport" that entitles them to one 
year's worth of airline travel without spending any more money. The Freedom 
Passport must be purchased for either domestic or foreign travel, in either 
coach or first class -- and the purchase price varies accordingly. Although the 
initial cost is relatively steep, passport holders eventually reach the point 
where they are flying for free. Under the program, domestic travel to 
Continental's 185 destination cities must be booked no more than seven days 
before departure date and the same destination may not be visited more than 
three times in any one-year period. For overseas travel, booking is required 30 
days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-month passport prices are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Domestic Coach Passport (mainland only): $1,999. 
</P>
<P>
 * Domestic First Class Passport (mainland only): $3,499. 
</P>
<P>
 * Global Coach Class Passport: $4,499. 
</P>
<P>
 * Global First Class Passport: $6,999. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors who purchase domestic passports may purchase add-ons to destinations 
outside the continental United States. Add-on costs for coach and first class 
including number of trips permitted are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico (2) -- nine cities: $250/$400. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caribbean (2) -- four island destinations: $250/$400. 
</P>
<P>
 * Central America (1) -- seven countries: $300/$450. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hawaii (1) $400/$550. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alaska (1) $400/$550. 
</P>
<P>
 * Europe (1) $500/$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Note that there are a number of blackout dates throughout the year that apply 
to various destinations. For example, travel to Hawaii is not permitted from 
Nov. 23 to 28 or from Dec. 16 to Jan. 8. No travel is permitted between the 
United States and Europe on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays from June 17 to Sept. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Airlines also offers a short-term Freedom Passport valid for four 
months of coach travel to more than 150 U.S. cities for $999. Except for 
certain blackout dates Freedom Passport holders may take a one-way trip each 
week if a Saturday night stay is made between trips. No more than three trips 
may be made to a single destination during the four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers who purchase the four-month passport may also purchase the same 
add-on trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Holders of either the 12-month or four-month passports may purchase a 
Companion Passport for a person of any age for the same price. The companion 
may travel on any flight booked with the primary passport holder.

<P>
 Here's how to find cheap places to stay in North America this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 edition of "Hostelling North America: The Official Guide to Hostels 
in Canada and the United States," a 392-page book, covers 238 internationally 
affiliated travelers' hostels throughout North America. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases the hostels are located in historic or unusual buildings. For 
example in: 
</P>
<P>
 * the oldest remaining hotel building in Gettysburg, Va. (that was used as a 
hospital during the Civil War); 
</P>
<P>
 * a life-saving station on Nantucket Island, Mass.; 
</P>
<P>
 * an antebellum house in New Orleans; 
</P>
<P>
 * a former jail in Ottawa, Ontario; 
</P>
<P>
 * a former courthouse in Kamloops, British Columbia; 
</P>
<P>
 * five Sioux tepees, a log cabin and several covered wagons on Vashon Island 
near Seattle; 
</P>
<P>
 * a former hangout of gangster Al Capone in Miami, and 
</P>
<P>
 * the Pigeon Point Lighthouse, 50 miles south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostels provide inexpensive dormitory accommodations for travelers of all 
ages. There are separate sleeping rooms for men and women, and some hostels 
have rooms that can be rented by families. Guests share kitchen, dining room 
and lounge facilities. Overnight fees range from $7-$20. 
</P>
<P>
 New hostels in North America include Padre Island National Seashore in Port 
Aransas, Tex., and the Dawson City River hostel in Dawson City, Yukon 
Territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hostelling North America" is published jointly by Hostelling 
International-Canada and Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels. Both 
are members of the International Youth Hostel Federation, which encompasses 
nearly 5,000 hostels in more than 70 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Each listing includes a map, hostel description, facilities, overnight fees, 
reservation details, credit card acceptance, accessibility for the disabled, 
family room availability, proximity to public transportation and discounts in 
the area. You'll also find suggestions on what to see and do at cultural, 
historical and recreational attractions in each hostel's area. 
</P>
<P>
 The guide is available free to members of Hostelling International. The annual 
adult membership is $25. Non-members can purchase copies for $5.95. Contact 
Hostelling International-AYH, 1434 2nd St., Santa Monica 90401; telephone (310) 
393-3413. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of independent hostels throughout North America are listed in the 
"Hostel Handbook." But don't expect detailed observations; you won't find out 
much more than the address, telephone number and price. It also contains Motel 
6 listings for areas where hostels don't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 For copies, send $3 to "Hostel Handbook," 722 Nicholas Ave., New York 10031; 
tel. (212) 926-7030. 
</P>
<P>
 When a stop at a popular place such as Nashville doesn't turn up any hostels, 
one of the best sources for budget accommodations is "Let's Go: USA" (St. 
Martin's Press, $18.99). It also covers Canada: Quebec, Ontario, British 
Columbia, the Yukon Territory and the Maritime Provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 Nashville doesn't have youth or travelers' hostels, but it does have budget 
motels and camping facilities. The guide lists these and other activities. For 
example, country music lovers might want to stop in Nashville this summer for 
the economical Nashville on Stage Concert Series. Now until Oct. 2, shows 
feature entertainers such as Alabama, the Oak Ridge Boys, Tanya Tucker, George 
Jones and Tammy Wynette, at rates ranging from $11.95 to $19.95; tel. (800) 
535-0200.

ANOTHER OUTLOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was appalled by the opening statements of "On Different Tracks" (May 8). 
Clayton Jones writes that travelers on the Eastern & Oriental Express "must 
learn to live in the past, when Europeans and Americans could scold the 
'natives' for not polishing the silver or remain aloof from Asian villages just 
outside their windows." In the next paragraph he writes that the stewards "are 
all Thais, whose inbred humility goes over well with the wealthy Western 
traveler who seems to want to be treated like a monarch, or to act like one." 
Why would your paper cater to the ugly American who would enjoy colonial-type 
exploitation? The article could have touted excellent service without such 
innuendoes. 
</P>
<P>
 I also disagree with the author's contention that "Most people in this part of 
the world consider trains today dirty and perilous, suitable only for 
peasants." I have ridden trains throughout the world and have found those in 
Southeast Asia both clean and safe. Indeed, the Thailand trains in second class 
were extremely clean and safe. This article seems intent on scaring Americans 
into choosing the luxury train, as if there were no suitable alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The colonial period was a very dark one in world history, and you should 
apologize for any statements that might glorify this terrible period. 
</P>
<P>
 MARK RHOMBERG, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Your timing on the "Bangkok to Singapore" train is in such poor taste, after 
Singapore's boastful barbarism displayed in the caning of many people, not just 
a young American. I was going to Singapore, but it's off my list forever. 
</P>
<P>
 MIMI MERRILL, Ridgecrest 
</P>
<P>
 Your article on the new Eastern & Oriental Express was interesting. However, a 
price of $1,130 to $2,950 would appear to be out of the range of many. A few 
years ago, we took the first-class, air-conditioned train on the same route, 
had a sleeping compartment and stopped in both Kuala Lumpur and Penang for 
slightly over $100 each. That makes the E&O outrageously expensive.

A NEW DAY IN BULGARIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As usual, your section delighted me, but this time Linda White's informative 
article, "A Different Kind of Rose Parade" (April 24), caught my attention.I 
have kept an eye on Bulgaria ever since first viewing "Casablanca"! Obviously 
times have changed since the wistful Bulgarian girl who appealed for help to 
cynical Rick, said, "Things are very bad there, M'sieu. The devil has the 
people by the throat." How lovely to read that "modern Bulgaria is layer upon 
layer of beauty" and that the American University has set up a center for 
teaching business and economics in the city of Blagoevgrad.

LAST WORD ON JULIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The next time you go to Julian ("Weekend Escape," April 10), don't go through 
Escondido. Continue on (California Highway) 78 and follow the Wild Animal Park 
signs.This will take you onto a two-lane road that goes through lovely country 
and past the ostrich farm. You can make a right on a small asphalt road which 
will bring you out west of the San Pasqual history center, or continue another 
half-mile to hook up with 78 by the animal park. It's easier and prettier. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian is not a center of gourmet dining, but the Julian Cafe has a pretty 
fair chicken pot pie, a great barbecue sandwich and a super hamburger. The 
Italian restaurant behind the cider mill isn't bad either. And don't forget to 
try the old-fashioned malts at the local drug store -- $2.50, but enough for 
two. For the best apple pie it's Farmer's Market in Wynola. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't go (to Julian) on Monday or Tuesday if you're a shopper; most stores 
are closed.

 For years I have been waiting for an article on my grandfather's birthplace, 
Zug, Switzerland.Thank you very much ("Old Town, New Money," April 17). My 
daughter has hiked, biked and swum there several times while visiting her

THEIR CUP OF TEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a great admirer of the afternoon tea ceremony in England, we thoroughly 
enjoyed "Afternoon Tease" (April 17) by Karen Giordano. We were especially 
pleased to find a few new ones to try.The only blemish on an otherwise superior 
piece was the mistake so many Americans make in describing the river that flows 
through London. It is the River Thames, not the Thames River. 
</P>
<P>
 ANNIE and JIM KRESL, Long Beach

<P>
 "Afternoon Tease" brought back rueful memories. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to the most posh hotel in Oxford, the Randolph, for high tea. Trying to 
not look like an American tourist, I wore my English tweed skirt and carried a 
copy of the Spectator. The waitress set a sterling silver tray laden with fine 
china, assorted sandwiches, scones, clotted cream, strawberry preserves and 
Earl Grey tea in the center of the table. I pulled the table closer and 
realized too late it was two tables pushed together. Everything went crashing 
to the floor, spilling all over the plush carpet. It was an experience.

JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS: ABOVE ALL, AN ETERNAL IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Chase, Chris Chase is the co-author of Josephine: The Hungry Heart 
(Random House), a biography of Josephine Baker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis died Thursday. Outside her Fifth Avenue 
apartment strangers gathered, strewed rose petals, lit candles. She was 64 and 
she had been a role model for thousands of women. She was loved by people she 
didn't know and who didn't know her. What they responded to was the image she 
presented. She was smart, brave, complicated and, one suspects, she understood 
that it was all -- politics and fashion, Camelot and the pill-box hat -- about 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning the ambitious, beautiful newspaper woman who could speak 
perfect French and the ambitious, dashing, young senator who wanted to be 
President were a match out of central casting. No one who saw pictures of them 
on a state visit to France ever forgot the dazzling vision of Jackie in a white 
gown with her dark hair swept up. Even Gen. Charles DeGaulle, that fierce and 
austere war hero, melted when she smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 But scratch the surface and there was pain. John F. Kennedy was a womanizer, 
he suffered from Addison's disease, he left his wife alone too much. Jackie was 
a spendthrift whose clothing bills were so huge they infuriated her millionaire 
husband. Yet together, he and she brightened the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In public, Mrs. Kennedy played her part in the pageant and what she felt in 
her heart, we never knew. Maybe it was none of our business. She was so good at 
what she did, the facade was enough. She gave citizens the White House tour, 
she issued invitations to dancers and classical musicians. She was so well 
bred, so elegant, such a magical creature that when she was pictured crawling 
in apparent terror on the back of the convertible after her husband's murder, 
we were shocked. You might have done it, I might have done it, but Jacqueline 
Kennedy never seemed that weakly human. 
</P>
<P>
 More icon than flesh, she saw us through our immense national tragedy with a 
dignity few of us had ever before observed. We were suffering not only loss but 
shame that this had happened in the United States. Many credited her with 
giving us back our national pride. For she staged-managed her husband's funeral 
-- the eternal flame at the grave, the procession of world leaders walking 
behind the casket, the riderless horse, the little boy saluting his slain 
father. She was determined that John F. Kennedy's martyrdom should echo Abraham 
Lincoln's. And while nobody could sensibly equate Lincoln, who's job was done, 
with Kennedy, whose job was just beginning, the country attempting to heal 
itself needed the sense of ritual she imposed on those terrible days. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the myth of Camelot was just that, a myth. Yet her use of it was 
effective. There never was a Camelot, it wasn't history it was a fictional 
rendering of a court ruled over by a fictional king and while Mrs. Kennedy's 
Camelot was an idealized projection -- a public-relations selling job if you 
want to be crude about it -- it was one we gratefully embraced. She tried to 
censor books that said anything she didn't want said about the thousand days 
Kennedy had governed the country and her perfect manners masked an iron will. 
Even so, we appreciated that strength and her pride and her mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Some turned against her when she married Aristotle Onassis. People said he was 
crude and cared only for power and celebrities and had caught the biggest 
celebrity in the world. People suddenly saw her as all style and no substance 
and said she loved money and had caught one of the richest men in the world. 
But when the marriage failed and he died, and she came back to us, all was 
forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not she considered herself a symbol we made her into one. Her 
children turned out well, she went to work though she had the means to be 
perfectly useless. She protected her privacy and we respected that. But because 
she so seldom spoke to us, because we so seldom heard her voice, because we 
never really knew her, we made her into whatever we wanted or needed her to be. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a genius at managing her image. She dealt with the press better than 
any movie star, though she appeared on no talk shows and gave few interviews. 
Despite this reserve, more people wanted to know about her than wanted to know 
about Elizabeth Taylor or the Princess of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, we saw her in ways she wanted to be seen. It was enough.

A DANCE WITH DEATH; THE FALLACY OF THE SMOKING BAN IS THAT IT'S A FUTILE 
ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD RODRIQUEZ, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at Pacific News Service, is 
the author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why are we so preoccupied by the dangers of smoking? At a time when polls 
indicate an increasing number of Americans would legalize drugs, when every 
sort of behavior is justified on the after noon talk shows, smokers are 
outcasts. At a time when death may be the price to be paid for a careless night 
of sex, the hotel clerk will ask you if you want a nonsmoking room. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in this century, some Americans tried to keep other Americans from 
alcohol. Within the fierce Puritan moralism of the temperance movement, one, 
nonetheless, sensed a generous notion of commonwealth -- fear that alcohol was 
bad for the entire society. Today's civic morality is different to the degree 
that it seems justified by self-concern: "I don't care what some jerk does to 
his own lungs. Just don't expect me to breathe his secondhand smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 As the quality of our lives seems to be diminishing, when there is no more 
clean air, clean air becomes a right. My space is my space. Americans end up 
shooting one another over parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 We used to speak of the inevitability of life and death. We used to bend to a 
sense of fate and construct our morality within an acceptance of life's limits. 
Today, as the world around us seems so out of control, the sense of 
inevitability is replaced by notions of "choice." We choose when to give birth, 
we choose when to die, precisely because we feel ourselves unable to control 
random death. Polls show growing support for Dr. Jack Ke- vorkian and "the 
right to suicide," although smoking is not allowed inside our restaurants. 
Thank you for not smoking . 
</P>
<P>
 Not so many decades ago, ladies did not smoke in public. It took a great First 
Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, to break the taboo. At almost the same moment in 
American history, in "Now Voyager," Paul Henreid lit a pair of cigarettes in 
his mouth, then handed one to Bette Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 One did not need a Freudian handbook to understand that cigarettes in the 
movies were all about sex. But if it is true that cigarettes are sexual, then 
what does today's repugnance regarding cigarettes mean? Was the rise of the 
anti-smoking movement in the 1970s related to the increased use of the 
birth-control pill in those same years? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, smoking in America used to be associated with sociability -- a 
cocktail glass, a cigarette -- these were social tools. The cigarette was a 
means of loosening conversation, laughter. Now, we send the smoker outside 
while the rest of us talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The "smoke-filled room" is today associated by many Americans with corruption 
and deceit. But smoking used to be associated with intense human activity, 
parties and laughter, and also intense concentration and solitude. A smoker 
confides to me that his habit is a tool of concentration, a means of 
discipline. ("I light a cigarette before making a phone call.") Thus was Paul 
Henreid related to the solitary Marlboro Man. The cigarette was both urbane and 
Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, smoking is only a private pleasure. Another smoker confesses: "So many 
awful behaviors my cigarette keeps under control. Smoking is such a privacy. A 
lovely deception. It steadies my hand. Too bad it will probably kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as American pop culture moves into parts of the world where it is 
regarded as morally contaminating, Americans are also internationally famous 
for a preoccupation with health. For decades, Americans have been famous for 
our obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 No more so than in California. No more so than now. In California, people do 
not die. We pass away. We do not grow old -- we get plastic surgery. 
California's contribution to the culinary arts is haute hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
 But I am beginning to think that the old cliche about the American fear of 
death needs to be readjusted. In 1994, I do not think that Americans look too 
little at death. Rather, I think we are overwhelmed by death, death everywhere 
around us. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are gunning each other down on the playground. Women are being 
snatched from shopping-mall parking lots and murdered. There is carnage -- 
three people dead -- on the San Diego Freeway this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the century, Evelyn Waugh and Aldous Huxley wrote satirically of 
the Californian evasion of death. They were British and mocked our evasion for 
being characteristically American. But, as a boy, I was in love with California 
precisely because it refused to acknowledge death. I was happy that California 
was so distant from the morbidity of Mexico. The ancient sadness of my family's 
mournful Catholic statues, the darkness that rang in Mexican laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Los Angeles seems a city of death, so different from the city I used to 
love. And life has become a burden, a sorrow. Yet, California is not becoming 
infused with a sense of Catholic sadness as much as with a pagan stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bookstores today, you can find best sellers about a happier afterlife. 
(Your lover is waiting for you on the other side of death's divide.) 
</P>
<P>
 Also near the top of the best-seller list is a book called "How We Die." The 
ancient conversation human beings have with God begins with the question "Why 
do we live only to die?" But in 1994, we seek consolation in another question. 
Not "why" but "how." We do not talk to God anymore. Today, all we know is the 
body -- how it works and, finally, stops. We are not troubled by mystery; we 
seek to control. We are interested in Oprah Winfrey's new diet book, which 
promises us french fries without calories. 
</P>
<P>
 Health replaces holiness in today's America. It is not possible to turn on the 
evening news without encountering a resident TV physician or "health reporter." 
And the news is dire: Beware movie-theater popcorn. There is danger within the 
shrouded cube of margarine. 
</P>
<P>
 A man I know who was, two years ago, a drug addict is now "clean." He works as 
a personal trainer. He has a heroic body; he can tell you what to eat and not 
to eat; he takes enemas weekly; he doesn't smoke. He drinks bottle after bottle 
of mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
 And wasn't that a lovely joke in "The Player," Robert Altman's movie satire on 
Hollywood? How Altman's vision of Hollywood was of a corrupt gang of agents and 
producers and writers. Our hero, who was also a murderer, was obsessed by 
water, imported water. Water from some clean locale like Switzerland. Water 
instead of food. Water instead of sacramental confession. 
</P>
<P>
 In an America that consumes water, is consumed by the need for cleansing, it 
is not odd that so much attention is given to the dangers of smoking. Oh, do 
not misunderstand. I am no apologist for the R.J. Reynolds Company. I hate the 
stench of old smoke on my sofa, on hair, on clothes, on lips. I wish the person 
I love most in the world would quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 But I also understand when another friend remembers her grandfather dying of 
emphysema. "God, how he wanted a cigarette -- even on his last day." The old 
man, wheezing, begged for a smoke. But no one would oblige, except his 
granddaughter. She took the old man's $5 and went to the store and bought him a 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give a rat enough of anything, and the rat's going to die," says one smoker. 
Sometimes, I think the reason I like being with smokers, enjoy their throaty 
laugh, their Dorothy Parker lack of sentimentality, is they are the only ones 
prepared to tell the truth about the inevitability of death and life in 
America.

STAGE WATCH: PRODUCER HOPES CORONET MOVE WILL BE SERENDIPITOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When New York producer James Freydberg takes over the Coronet Theatre, one of 
L.A.'s most prominent mid-sized venues, on Sept. 1, look for it to become a 
link in the Los Angeles-New York theatrical pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not what Freydberg had in mind for the Coronet four years ago, when he 
first became interested in taking over the La Cienega Boulevard hall. Then, he 
recalled, he wanted to go shopping for shows in L.A.'s many sub-100-seat 
theaters and move them up to Actors' Equity contracts in the 277-seat Coronet. 
But his plans stalled when Serendipity, a children's theater company, got the 
Coronet lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, Serendipity announced that it was pulling out of the Coronet. 
Freydberg was finally able to secure the lease, but "this time my intent is 
nothing like what it was then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his first priority is to develop his own shows in Los Angeles and move 
them to New York -- and move his own Off Broadway shows from New York to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is a high-risk venture," he said. "If I'm going to go down, I'm going to 
go down on my own." A recent event that "shook" Freydberg, he said, was the 
relatively short run for "Oleanna" at the 99-seat Tiffany Theatre. "That 
frightened me about L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Freydberg's first Coronet show (other than his 1992 co-production of "Wrong 
Turn at Lungfish" there during a Serendipity hiatus) will be an import of a 
one-woman play he produced Off Broadway, Claudia Shear's autobiographical 
"Blown Sideways Through Life," opening in September. Then he hopes to do 
"something more experimental," and only after that will he perhaps do something 
from a local company. He may use the theater to mount occasional TV pilots, 
"but that's not the primary priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Freydberg knows at least one local producer. He co-produced "Burn This" and 
"Fool Moon" with Center Theatre Group, and he has had "casual discussions" with 
CTG's Gordon Davidson about possible CTG use of the Coronet, perhaps as the 
Mark Taper Forum's long-sought second stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may try to work something out," Davidson said. But he added that he likes 
the courtyard in front of the Coronet more than the theater itself. 
</P>
<P>
 MISSING: When the Mark Taper Forum announced its season a couple of weeks ago, 
the most obvious omission from the list was Tony Kushner's "The Heavenly 
Theatre," which was postponed from the current season. Artistic director Gordon 
Davidson said that Kushner simply won't have the chance to do the necessary 
work on it because of conflicts with the film version of his "Angels in 
America" -- but "when he's ready to take it off the shelf, we'll be here to do 
it for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Also missing was any sign of a show from the Antaeus Company, the classical 
repertory group that completed its Taper run of Chekhov's "The Wood Demon" 
Saturday. "We would love to have been on the schedule," said Antaeus company 
manager Dakin Matthews. "But they have a lot of commitments and constituencies 
they answer to." He noted that the Taper paid for recent Antaeus workshops of 
potential projects. Farthest along is Shaw's "Mrs. Warren's Profession." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews and Taper producing director Robert Egan both hinted that the company 
might end up becoming involved in one of the non-Antaeus-generated shows next 
season. Of the shows on the list, Derek Walcott's "The Odyssey" would seem the 
most logical vehicle for a classical company. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Antaeus on "Wood Demon" was mostly trouble-free, Egan said, 
despite the complicated Antaeus policy of triple casting, creating a variety of 
different casts. However, Egan did face "occasional requests of an actor for 
too much time off." Next time, he wants a "more defined policy" about the 
amount of flex time that an actor can take during a run -- and when it can be 
taken.*

 GORDY SPEAKS: Not only is notoriously press-shy Motown Records founder Berry 
Gordy Jr. set to break his media silence with an autobiography, scheduled for 
September publication by Warner Books, but he's also being paid tribute to by 
old and new Motown artists for an accompanying CD. 
</P>
<P>
 The Temptations, the Four Tops, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson 
are among the "classic" Motown acts slated to contribute new recordings, while 
the likes of Johnny Gill, Queen Latifah and Boyz II Men are expected to 
represent the current Motown roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The album will feature a new song, "Berry's Theme," as well as new versions of 
"You Made Me So Very Happy," "Try It Baby," and "I Want to Go Back There 
Again." It will also feature interviews with Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, 
Melvin Franklin, Wonder and Robinson. Bruce Haring

POP EYE: OK, NICE CONCEPT, BUT LET'S TAILOR IT FOR 40-YEAR-OLDS -- AND NO DRUGS 
OR SUICIDE

 Is the Kurt Cobain story ready for prime time? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently not -- but it may have come close. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours after the rock singer's body was found in his Seattle home on 
April 8, a proposal for a TV movie of the week project on the life and death of 
the Nirvana leader was under consideration by NBC. But after two weeks of 
thumbs up on the project, NBC suddenly pulled the plug, the writer who proposed 
the project says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hiett, a Las Vegas-based special-effects designer and writer who pitched 
the story to the network, says that for about two weeks he thought all 
indications were that his pitch would become a reality. Meetings were taken, 
storyboards drawn up, producers and a scriptwriter were assigned and everything 
looked like a go.  
</P>
<P>
 The crisis-filled rise and fall of the musical hero of Generation X would seem 
to be a natural for adaptation. The networks were reportedly besieged by 
proposals for such ventures, and Nirvana's management also fielded numerous 
calls from producers and agencies to explore the possibility of doing an 
"authorized" film.  
</P>
<P>
 Why would the network back off from such a headline grabber?  
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't sure who would be the audience," says Hiett. "I said, 'How about 
every 15- to 30-year-old?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not who major advertisers are interested in reaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big-money spenders -- the package goods and automobile companies -- 
aren't generally concerned with that audience," says Richard Kostyar, president 
of the New York-based Media First International, a firm that buys advertising 
for corporate clients. "And the older audience, to a large degree, doesn't know 
who Cobain was." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the story itself, with its unavoidable elements of drugs and 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "NBC didn't want to be portraying that lifestyle," Hiett says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any story that borders on the edge of things like drug use, some advertisers 
avoid," says Kostyar. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC spokesman Flody Suarez would not confirm Hiett's account, saying only that 
several pitches about possible Cobain films were fielded by the network, but 
all were passed on. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's manager, John Silva, had no comment about proposed movie projects, 
but a source close to the band says that the people handling Nirvana's affairs 
as well as those of Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, have made it clear that they 
would not cooperate with any film production. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, another Cobain project is in the works: a film being adapted from 
a quickie book that hit the stands just weeks after the death. An aggressive 
boutique talent agency called Paradigm snapped up the book rights to Dave 
Thompson's "Never Fade Away: The Kurt Cobain Story" and is shopping a planned 
screenplay adaptation to studios around town.  
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter Richard Dilello ("Colors," "Bad Boys") has already been tapped to 
pen the screen version.  
</P>
<P>
 But even Thompson says he's not holding out hopes of a movie being made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether my book or any, this is a tough story to sell," he says. Steve 
Hochman and Judy Brennan

 Boyz II Who? Does anybody remember Boyz II Men now that the local group 
All-4-One is cranking out romantic R&B vocal hits and overshadowing the entire

short career -- with "I Swear," which is No. 2 on The Times' Southern 
California pop singles chart and No. 1 nationally. The quartet's debut album, 
"All-4-One," is also climbing the regional chart, at No. 11. South Central

 HOUSE DETECTIVE: The new House of Blues on the Sunset Strip is already earning 
kudos for its down-home music, but many people going to the club are angry 
about what they feel is a stuck-up attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene outside the club for last week's appearance by African guitarist Ali 
Farka Toure was marked by patrons screaming at the headset-wearing doormen, who 
were letting people in very slowly with no explanations about the delay.The 
furor escalated when the performance started, even though many who had arrived 
early still were not inside.  
</P>
<P>
 The hold-up, it was later explained, was due to the dinner-show setting of the 
event, as opposed to the open-floor format of most shows. Fans were seated 
party by party, a very slow process. One club official admitted that there are 
still a lot of "bugs" to be worked out for the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon leaving, many patrons were miffed once again about the wait to get their 
cars from the valet parking -- more than an hour for some. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop Eye's suggestion: Don't use the valet. There's parking at several hotels 
near the club, including self-parking at the Hyatt and valet at the Mondrian. 
But even for those, it's a good idea to arrive early. Steve Hochman

 CRAZY DIAMOND: Is Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett -- virtually unheard from for 
nearly 25 years -- set to resurface? With Pink Floyd back at the top of the 
charts, rumors have started to fly that he will. 
</P>
<P>
 The gossip ran that Atlantic Records A&R executive Tim Sommer had persuaded 
Barrett to come out of his self-imposed hermitage to record his first new album 
since his two 1970 releases, "The Madcap Laughs" and "Barrett." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's apparently not to be. Sommer confirms that he made an overture to 
Barrett, who lives in Cambridge, England, through the singer's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "It occurred to me that perhaps the only reason Syd hadn't released an album 
in all those years was that no one had asked him," Sommer says. "So I made a 
proposal, but word came back that he just wasn't interested." Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: As leader of the Leaving Trains, "Falling" James Moreland 
is a legend in L.A. punk circles. Still, he was as surprised as anyone to hear 
that an Italian band has named itself after him.But he says he's flattered, and 
is helping to arrange some California shows pairing his own group with the 
Falling James Band this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreland was first alerted about the group by Howe Gelb of the group Giant 
Sand, who heard about it while on tour in Italy. Moreland himself actually 
visited his namesake on a Leaving Trains tour and wrote a short item about it 
for the alternative rock magazine Fiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really cool -- and they happen to be a rocking band," says Moreland.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Leaving Trains are set to release a new album, "The Big Jinx," 
including sessions recorded with producer Chas Ramirez, who died last year in a 
warehouse accident.*

 I can't think of a thing to say. The 6-year-old girl, at the urging of her 
grandmother, has pushed back her sleeve to show me the scars on her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 There they are: two small dark circles, just above the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell her how you got them," Grandma says. 
</P>
<P>
 "(He) burned me with his cigarette," says the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell her about your eye." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in bed and (he) told me to close my eyes, and then he hit my eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Nausea and rage compete for my attention. I would like to find this man and 
kill him right now. Instead, I take a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not the girl's father. He is, however, the father of her 3-year-old 
sister. He is also the alcoholic, child-molesting ex-boyfriend of her 
drug-addicted mother. The drug-addicted mother is Grandma's youngest child. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of beleaguered grandmothers -- women who ought to be thinking about 
how they will spend their golden years but who instead are thinking about 
toilet training and schoolwork -- is growing in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Both children live with Grandma in a modest house in a modest Los Angeles 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of months ago, Grandma tells me, chest pains landed her in the 
hospital for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 I can only imagine how she feels. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a pretty family portrait, but these days, it's certainly not an 
unusual one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The number of beleaguered grandmothers -- women who ought to be thinking about 
how they will spend their golden years but who instead are thinking about 
toilet training and schoolwork -- is growing in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the spokesman for the county Department of Children's Services, 
which oversees the removal of children from the homes of wayward parents, more 
than half of the nearly 40,000 children in the system are living with relatives 
-- mostly grandmothers and aunts -- rather than foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular grandmother, a state employee who cares for her own elderly 
mother, has called me in a panic. She pays for the girls' private school, 
therapy, baby-sitting and food. She has also plunked down $2,500 for a lawyer, 
who has petitioned the court to allow her to have standing in proceedings 
affecting the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500 a month she receives from the county barely puts a dent in the 
expenses, but money, she says, is besides the point. 
</P>
<P>
 She is terrified, she says, because last month a social worker submitted to 
juvenile court a report that suggested, under a section titled "Case Plan 
Goals," that the court consider returning the younger of the two girls to her 
father in October. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has every reason to be fearful. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, he pleaded nolo contendere to charges that he molested a 
14-year-old girl and spent time in jail. According to court documents, he 
enrolled in a sex offenders program in March, and in April, he enrolled in a 
parenting course. He told the court that he also attends Alcoholics Anonymous 
meetings twice a week and is in therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad he is doing all this and I applaud him for that," says the 
grandmother, but she does not believe that someone with a history of alcohol 
and child sexual abuse can change enough in six months to provide a healthy, 
stable environment for a small child. 
</P>
<P>
 Could anyone believe it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I sure couldn't, so I phoned Renee Powers, director of the policy section of 
the Department of Children's Services, whose social workers are monitoring this 
and thousands of other families in various states of decomposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I did not identify the family, Powers commented about DCS procedures. 
She said the social worker has undoubtedly chosen October because the matter 
will automatically return to juvenile court then for a review, and state law 
requires that social workers project a family reunification date. Far from 
being a done deal, she assured me, the court will simply want to know whether 
the father has continued to attend his various rehabilitation programs and will 
not require the child to be handed over if he is deemed unfit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not set in stone," Powers says. "In October of '94, the worker could be 
talking about the father's progress. Has he been attending these sessions? What 
is the progress? What is the prognosis? The recommendation of the therapist? 
The court makes the final decision whether or not to accept the social worker's 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl's fate probably lies with a juvenile court judge. A friend who 
is a children's social worker tells me that some judges lean toward family 
reunification more readily than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, this situation is hardly extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 As the grandmother tells it, a detective once assured her after the older 
child was flicked in the eye: "Your granddaughter, compared to others, looks 
like a princess." 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean?" the grandmother demanded. "The child has a black eye!" 
</P>
<P>
 The detective is said to have replied: "I know a child who is 2 years old, who 
was battered by her father and who is now on life-support systems, and he only 
got two years for it." 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure the grandmother felt tremendous relief. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a black eye or a couple of cigarette burns, after all, when there are 
babies on life support? 
</P>
<P>
 These days, I guess, you take your comfort where you can.

UP ALL NIGHT: SOCIAL CLIMES; PARLOR PARLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I dreamed I was Barbara Bush last night," croons Karen Benjamin in the deep, 
melodious voice that carried her through four years in "Phantom of the Opera." 
"Suddenly, George got that look in his eye. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Benjamin and her husband -- pianist-composer Alan Chapman -- pause 
during their cabaret act to hold up a huge color photocopy of their newborn 
son. "We have more," Benjamin says, waving a fat envelope, "if anyone wants to 
see after the show." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday evening, Chapman and Benjamin are redefining the notion of 
an "intimate" performance for an audience of 50 or so total strangers who have 
paid $18 each to sit in folding chairs in a Santa Monica living room for an 
evening of cabaret songs and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is sponsored by Parlor Performances, a semiweekly series that has 
been bringing performers and the public together in private homes throughout 
L.A. since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The series is the creation of Jeannine Frank, a lyricist, photographer and 
former schoolteacher who has found her true calling as Los Angeles' premiere 
itinerant hostess.  
</P>
<P>
 "I make a pitch at each show for living rooms," she says. "I use homes of all 
types. It's usually people who've come and liked the show who then want to 
donate their own places." 
</P>
<P>
 This evening's soiree takes place in the home of stockbroker Glen Strauss, who 
built his cathedral-like living room specifically with concerts in mind and 
frequently acts as host for Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play bassoon with a chamber orchestra and piano myself, and I really enjoy 
being able to provide a forum for performers like Karen and Alan," he says. 
"This stuff is so much fun; you get to hear a lot of groups you might not 
otherwise hear." 
</P>
<P>
 As casual as the ambience may be, it's hard work for Frank. "People assume 
there's an office somewhere, and sometimes they call at 2 and 3 in the morning. 
When I pick up, they're very embarrassed," she says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have to do paralegal work from time to time, but I've put on about 
300 shows by now. What I strive for is quirky, humorous, edgy material. The 
more mainstream ballads and stuff people can see anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the entertainment, the audience is mildly eclectic, made up of film 
industry types, academics, professional and amateur musicians, as well as a 
smattering of adventurous retirees. In short, not your regular night owls, but 
people who are more likely to be home watching Martha Graham on PBS than 
haunting LunaPark or the Improv. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the idea of the small, intimate venue," says Sheila Wyse, who read 
about the series in a singles column three years ago and finally decided to 
take a break from her quake-damaged home in Sherman Oaks. "There's action and 
reaction between the audience and performers." 
</P>
<P>
 While Parlor Performances gets audience members out of the house, it also 
helps move many of the entertainers onto larger stages. Many of Frank's acts 
have gone on to play major venues and win awards. Notable alumni include jazz 
musician and comedian Dave Frishberg and the political-satire folk group the 
Foremen. Chapman and Benjamin have released a CD, "Songs of Life, Love and 
Antelopes," and their show is up for three Manhattan Cabaret Assn. awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the more well-known performers use the parlor shows as a way to 
develop new material with an audience," Frank says. That goes doubly for 
Chapman and Benjamin, who are surrounded after the show by audience members who 
pass around snapshots of their latest composition, Baby Boy Chapman.

THE BUZZ: SOCIAL CLIMES; AROUND HERE, TONYA'S A GODDESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By COMPILED BY THE SOCIAL CLIMES STAFF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lillehammer may be a distant memory for most of us, but the Tonya-bashing 
continues unabated. So, in the interest of balance, L.A.-based 'zine Ben Is 
Dead, in its celebration of all things sassy, has come out proudly on the 
Harding side. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the thunder-thighed skater as a "sassy goddess," the 'zine saves 
its barbs for that "boring as a marshmallow" Nancy Kerrigan. Its answer to her 
existential, Zen-like "Why me?" is simple: "Why not you, you idiot." 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of 'zines, we've noticed that 'zine appeal is filtering down to 
younger and younger readers. Thus, the appearance of Brain, which features the 
twisted works of L.A. underground arts community masquerading as a coloring 
book with puzzles and mazes. Best wait for the kiddies to go to bed before 
cracking this one open. Then, pass the crayons. 
</P>

 Fashion Fission?: Kiss that unisex look goodby. From now on, Boys will B-Boys 
and girls B-Girls. At least that's the way it seems to be going on North 
Vermont Avenue, capital of L.A.'s New Bohemia. First, hip-hop outfitter X-Large 
spun off a new store, X-Girl. Then, suddenly, one block north, the funky 
boutique Half-Off opened a men's store farther down the block. There are still 
a few vacant storefronts left on the strip. Anyone ready for baggy toddler 
wear? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Singapore Chic: If the Singapore caning hasn't produced much outrage here at 
home, it's at least provided the opportunity to make plenty of fashion 
statements. The latest is a black Mercedes, tagged Fay-style, that the Social 
Climes staff has observed driving around town. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect to see any local outbreaks of caning, though. That, as any L.A. 
club-hopping hipster knows, is -- yawn -- old news.

VOICES: WHAT ABOUT THE PLAN?; TODAY IT'S CALLED REBUILD LA. TWO YEARS AFTER THE 
1965 WATTS RIOTS, THE BLUEPRINT FOR SOCIAL CHANGE WAS CALLED THE 25-YEAR PLAN. 
AND WE'RE STILL WAITING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HOLLAND, Randy Holland wrote, produced and directed The Fire This 
Time, a documentary on the Los Angeles African American community and the 
causes of the 1992 riots. It premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival 
and is playing at Laemmle's Monica 4-Plex. Holland was interviewed by Mike 
Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the people I met in South-Central after the riots was Mrs. Nola Carter, 
who is the mother of Alprentice (Bunchy) Carter, who started the L.A. chapter 
of the Black Panthers in the 1960s. He was assassinated at UCLA by a rival 
black power organization, which I knew nothing about. It took me into an 
investigation of the role of the FBI and the LAPD in undermining the black 
community, which is a shocking but was very well-documented in government 
hearings in the 1970s by the Church Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunchy Carter's mother said I should go look for the 25-year plan. I said, 
"What's the 25-year plan?" She said, "We have Rebuild LA now. After the 1965 
riots they had the 25-year plan." It came out in 1967 and 25 years later we 
didn't have peace or social justice. Instead, we had another riot. 
</P>
<P>
 She took me out on a street corner, 79th and Central, and said, "I remember 
they showed us plans for the new community. There was supposed to be a park at 
79th and Central." It was just a liquor store. She said, "They showed us a 
model of what the community was going to look like and there were no African 
American people in that model. It was all white mothers pushing their babies." 
</P>
<P>
 That got me started on this 25-year plan. What happened in 1965 that laid a 
fire bed for 1992? I went to the city archives and the plan is missing. There's 
a file card there but you can't find the plan. Then I went into City Council 
records and looked up the elements of the plan. You can still find them in 
notes of the City Council meetings. And sure enough, at 79th and Central there 
was supposed to be a park. And Gage Avenue and Main Street, and 108th Street 
and Main, and numerous other locations. I went to four or five of them and 
there was not one park or rec center.  
</P>
<P>
 So this became the basis of an investigation into how the city was not only 
neglected but sabotaged, either consciously or unconsciously, by the system. In 
some ways it was conscious, like the out-and-out sabotage of cultural 
organizations like the Watts Writers Workshop, which started in the wake of the 
'65 riots. It brought together creative elements of the community -- writers, 
directors, dancers -- and created this incredible performance space and beehive 
of cultural activity, which was infiltrated by the FBI and the LAPD. The 
sabotage was so thorough that the FBI, after the hearings by the Church 
Commission, publicly apologized.  
</P>
<P>
 The workshop was empowering the community, and when a community is empowered 
it coalesces. Diverse groups come together and they form a base of power. And 
that base of power can question policy decisions. Take the Century Freeway. It 
cuts through a wide swath of South-Central that was really the cultural nexus 
of the inner city. It was the center of a community, this long strip that was 
taken by eminent domain. If a community is strong and groups are together, they 
can fight those things. But if they're in disarray and fighting each other, 
they can't come together and question policy and authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The community was being undermined for economic reasons, and that's still 
happening. The land in South-Central is prime real estate. Nearby you have the 
Port of Long Beach, you have Downtown, you have the airport. It tops the 
Westside in investment opportunity because you can buy it so cheap. If you can 
get a block, and when something like the Alameda Corridor train project comes 
through from Long Beach to Los Angeles -- whoever owns that land is going to 
make out very well.  
</P>
<P>
 When the Black Panther Party came into power -- I'm not saying they were Boy 
Scouts -- they had an empowerment aspect to them. They were providing breakfast 
programs and education programs and testing children for sickle-cell anemia and 
myriad of other programs, and that had to be stopped. So there was systematic 
elimination of the Panther leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the 25-year plan we had the Kerner Commission, which was a 
federal commission headed by Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois, who was appointed by 
President Lyndon Johnson to study the massive rioting that swept the United 
States in some 200 cities. It wasn't just L.A. It was Detroit, Newark, N.J., 
Birmingham, Ala., Minneapolis. The commission's conclusion was America was 
moving toward two societies, separate and unequal, one white and one black. The 
report said the ghetto is maintained with the full knowledge of the white 
community. White people maintain it and they condone it and it's economic in 
nature. And that's still going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at what happened with the Santa Monica Freeway. That thing was rebuilt 
post haste, ahead of schedule, because that's what the system wanted done. But 
two years later, the riot-torn areas are still a shambles. If they wanted it 
built up, it would be built up. It serves a purpose not to build it up. And 
chaos in the inner city serves a purpose.

VOICES: A PROPHET SPEAKS; POETRY IS AT THE ROOT OF RAP MUSIC, SAYS A MEMBER OF 
THE GROUNDBREAKING WATTS PROPHETS. IT'S A FORM OF FREE SPEECH THAT SHOULD BE 
PROTECTED, NOT ATTACKED. 
</P>

<P>
 The language of rap is nothing new in the black community. If you remember 
Rudy Ray Moore, old Redd Foxx albums, old Richard Pryor albums, they make 2 
Live Crew look like babies. It wasn't mainstream, but it always was here. It 
always was a slice of black life -- it wasn't all of black life. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the violence in rap lyrics, look at other artists, like Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. If you look at some of his films, I've seen him kill a whole 
squad of police, and kids love him -- and then we talk about Ice T. Why don't 
we talk about everybody? It's like the black artist is being used as a 
scapegoat to abridge our First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, I don't think there should be any censoring at all of this work. 
But the question is, who is putting it out, who's distributing it, who's 
pushing it? Who's putting it on TV, who's putting it on the radio? Who has the 
power to do that? Those are the people who need to be talked to. If Ice T or 
Ice Cube or any of the rappers made a million dollars, somebody else made $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 One artist, any artist, cannot do it alone. It takes a lot of people, it takes 
a machine to make a Madonna, to make an Ice Cube, to make an Ice T.  
</P>
<P>
 But I have to say I don't like the way some rappers are portraying or talking 
about themselves, because when they talk that way about black women they're 
talking about themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 I was a dope fiend who came from the streets and changed his life. When I 
wrote my poems, I said survival is my thing, I'm just trying to survive. But 
what has been done with these topics today is that they've been glorified. 
They're not being overcome, nor are they being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 But like I said, it's like black artists are being used as scapegoats, because 
when you listen to Guns N' Roses and some of the different rock groups, what 
they're saying is often horrible, but nobody's attacking them. They're just 
attacking the black rapper who, a lot of times, is just trying to make a 
living. One told me one day when I was talking to him about the content of his 
work, "Amde, what would you rather me do, say MF on a record 12 times and get a 
million dollars or rob you? Which one would you rather?" What could I say? 
</P>
<P>
 In the ghettos, they're trying to survive. Everybody wonders, why are they 
self-destructing -- because they're coming from the ghetto! But when you leave 
the ghetto, you leave with all that you had there. If you were using drugs 
there, when you become a star you're still using drugs. Whatever you were 
doing, positive or negative, you take that with you. If you were buying one 
gram of cocaine, now you're buying 50.  
</P>
<P>
 That's what's happening to a lot of these kids. There's no guidance in the 
industry.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the rappers, I don't like the content of their work, but what they do 
with their voice is amazing. There are also a lot of good writers out there. I 
hope the door doesn't close on the gangsta rappers. I hope they have an area of 
expression, to talk about their way of life, and what they're going through, 
because not all gangsta rap is negative. 
</P>
<P>
 We did the first album on earth called rap, but we weren't the fathers of this 
art form. Rap music didn't grow out of a void, it came from poets. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, what these kids are doing today, the foundation of that is poetry. 
The first message all the way back to Africa was usually about the culture, 
about the earth, about the social conditions, and that's how rap music started 
out in the United States. Breed What You Need

 A controversial call in the fourth game kept Santa Monica alive, but Loyola 
came back strong to win 15-6, 8-15, 15-8, 14-16, 15-4 in a Southern Section 
Division I second-round match at Santa Monica on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading 14-13 in the fourth game, Loyola appeared to have won the match when a 
Santa Monica player came in contact with the net on a spike.One referee called 
it and Loyola celebrated, but the other referee overruled the call, saying the 
player ran into padding below the net. Play resumed, and Santa Monica 
eventually won that game, 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decisive game, Loyola took offense to the call and soundly beat the 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs (19-1) were led by Pat Klein, who had 30 kills and the final point of 
the match. Setter Vaughn Montgomery had 33 assists, but didn't play in the 
final game and outside hitter Davey Olson had 23 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Haro led Santa Monica with 59 assists and Ryan Heumann had 23 kills and 
four blocks. GARY CHAVEZ

 The roof caved in on Bell Gardens when Fontana scored eight runs in the fourth 
en route to a 14-8 Southern Section Division I victory Friday at Veterans 
Stadium in the City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers led 2-0 on consecutive squeeze bunts by Bill Barajas and Alex 
Castillo in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana responded with eight runs off Barajas in the fourth, led by Paul 
Orabona's bases-loaded triple. Orabona went three for four with four runs 
batted in. Four of Fontana's runs in the inning were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Loza relieved Barajas in the fifth after Barajas had given up 11 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers mounted a small comeback with one run in the fourth and two runs 
in the fifth. With the bases loaded in the sixth, Loza drove in a run on a 
fielder's choice at second. The Lancers scored again on a passed ball. Manuel 
Aranas' single drove in the third run to make the score 14-8, but he was thrown 
out at second trying to stretch the hit into a double. 
</P>
<P>
 Aranas was two for four with two RBIs. GARY CHAVEZ

 Cantwell-Sacred Heart 8, Cathedral 3 -- Pitchers Christian Hernandez and Ray 
Nuno combined for a two-hitter, and Manny Ciallo had a two-run double to give 
Cantwell-Sacred Heart an upset win Friday in the first round of the Southern 
Section Division IV playoffs at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phantoms carried an eight-game winning streak and hope to use that 
momentum into the game, but appeared flat after falling behind 3-0 in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez (5-2) struck out 10 and limited Cathedral to two hits in six 
innings. Nuno retired three of the last four batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis DeLeon had a triple to center field in fourth and Manny Badillo had a 
single in the fifth for Cathedral's only hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Phantom right-hander Greg Vidales pitched four innings, giving up six runs 
(five earned) on eight hits and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play our type of game," Cathedral Coach Robert Morales said. "Our 
players were preoccupied with tonight's school prom." LATEEL FRIERSON

TRACK; 2ND STRAIGHT CITY TITLE ALMOST IN DONS' GRASP; DORSEY EXITS SEMIFINALS 
WITH 12 QUALIFIERS AND WINS ITS HEAT IN THE BOYS' 1,600-METER RELAYS DESPITE A 
BOTCHED HANDOFF. THE FINALS ARE THURSDAY AT BIRMINGHAM.

<P>
 A botched handoff didn't prevent the Dorsey High boys' 1,600-meter relay team 
from winning its heat in the City Section semifinals at Birmingham High last 
week. And barring another major mishap, nothing stands in Dorsey's path for its 
second-consecutive City team title in the finals Thursday at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons led all schools with 12 qualifiers, including both relays, in the 
semifinals. Birmingham, last year's runner-up, had 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't going to be close," Dorsey senior Leo Settle said. "We feel we're 
going to take City by a good 20 points. We have too much depth. All I can say 
is: 'Good luck to the best man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Settle was tops in the 100 and 200 meters in the Thursday semifinals, clocking 
10.93 and 21.77 seconds. He also ran on Dorsey's 400- and 1,600-meter relay 
teams, which timed 42.09 and 3:24.25 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in pretty good shape right now," Dorsey Coach Ralph Tilley said. 
"Birmingham and Washington will be tough, but we're looking good." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for those few anxious moments in the 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons dropped the baton on the final exchange between Anthony Wheeler and 
Gene Shepard. Shepard had to make a 180-degree turn and run five yards in the 
opposite direction to retrieve the baton. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, which had been leading by 60 meters heading into the bell lap, was 
never challenged by runner-up Manual Arts. The only debate was whether the Dons 
would be disqualified for passing out of the zone, but no red flag was raised 
by the finish-line official. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard and Anthony Mabry, who ran the second leg on the 1,600 relay, were 
among other heat winners for the Dons. Shepard won the 400 in 49.17 and Mabry 
rolled to victories in the 110 high hurdles and 300 intermediate hurdles in 
15.02 and 39.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Friday bounded 43 feet 1 1/4 inches to qualify in the triple jump and 
was one of 12 to clear 6-0 in the high jump. Jabulani Smith-Freeman advanced in 
long jump (22-8 1/2) and triple jump (42-8 1/2) and Anthony Wheeler qualified 
in the 800 (2:01.21) for Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo Valenzuela of Belmont and Humberto Sanchez of South Gate continued the 
rivalry in the distances. Sanchez blasted by Valenzuela in the 1,600 to win 
with the top mark of the meet in 4:24.11. Valenzuela sprinted from Sanchez and 
runner-up Miguel Ramirez of Roosevelt to win in 9:46.24. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Butler of Dorsey was the fastest qualifier in the 400 (58.25) and 800 
(2:23.91) and anchored the Dons' 1,600-meter relay team, which qualified in 
4:12.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Keisha Griffis of Washington, the defending City champion in the 300 low 
hurdles, turned in the top mark in her specialty in 46.05 and won her heat of 
the 100 hurdles in 15.20 with the No. 2 time. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing in the Cee division, Clarence Scott of Fremont had the best mark in 
the long jump -- varsity, Bee or Cee -- with a personal-best 23-5 1/2, smashing 
the 1961 record of 22-8 held by Robert Myles of Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott jumped 22-7 1/2 and 22-6 on his first two attempts. He broke the record 
with a leap of 22-9 1/2 on his third attempt before sailing 23-5 1/2 on his 
final try. He bested the No. 2 qualifier by more than three feet.

 Cal State Los Angeles won the men's and women's titles in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on May 
13-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Keadrick Washington and Oshonda Posey were selected as Athletes of the Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington won the 110 high hurdles (14.39), 400 intermediate hurdles (52.39) 
and high jump (6-9 1/2) as the Golden Eagles to held off four-time champion San 
Luis Obispo, 165-159, for its first CCAA title since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Posey won the 100 and 200 meters with wind-aided marks of 11.60 and 20.42 and 
joined Phetima Woods, Secora Taylor and Jean Yokoyama on Cal State L.A.'s 
victorious 400 relay team (47.77).

 Garfield sophomore swimmer Martha Ramos led the girls' varsity 200-yard 
freestyle team to a third-place finish at the City Section championship meet 
last week at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos clocked in at 27.82 in the first leg; teammates Maria Medrano, Laura 
Avila and Diane Jardon finished up for a time of 1:55.14. The same group 
finished sixth in the 400 freestyle relay with 4:20.73. Ramos also finished 
sixth in the 100-yard freestyle, clocking in at 1:01.23 to win her third medal 
of the meet. The 15-year-old entered the finals as the only inner-city swimmer 
to earn a seed for the varsity finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The first six seeds automatically earn medals. In the consolation finals, only 
the winner receives a medal as the seventh-place finisher.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramos' other chance to win a medal was in the 200 medley relay where the team 
finished in eighth place, clocking in at 2:09.81. The Bulldogs' time was better 
than Birmingham (2:10.38), but Birmingham took home the medal as the 
sixth-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate, Bell, Huntington Park, Roosevelt and Fremont each fielded teams at 
the City Finals on Wednesday, but none competed in varsity championship heats. 
SOUTHERN SECTION FINALS 
</P>

 Loyola's Ben Odell won the 200-yard freestyle and the 100 backstroke and 
assisted two relay teams to lead the Cubs to the boys' Southern Section 
Division II championship last week at Belmont Plaza. The Cubs won with 217 
points, outdistancing last year's champions, Crescenta Valley, by 59 points. 
Harvard-bound Odell clocked in at 1:40.09 in the 200 freestyle and 51.72 in the 
100 backstroke. Teammate Peter Baldwin won the 100 butterfly in 51.40. SOFTBALL

 Verdugo Hills 9, Roosevelt 0 -- The defending City Section 3-A Division 
champion Dons easily overpowered the Roughriders (16-6) in a semifinal game 
Tuesday. Roosevelt's Liz Ballesteros gave up 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like it (the loss) was all my fault," said Ballesteros, who was named 
Southeastern Conference player of the year. "My arm gave out on me and I 
started to pitch slow." The Dons (18-3) scored four runs in the fourth and 
fifth innings. Roughrider Jennifer Elizando got Roosevelt's first hit in the 
bottom of the fifth with a single. Norma Zuniga's single was Roosevelt's only 
other hit.

WOMAN'S DREAM COULD TURN TO ASHES: AIDS BY INSEMINATION; MEDICINE: LAGUNA 
NIGUEL MOTHER, ONE OF FIVE WHO CONTRACTED HIV THROUGH PROCEDURE, IS SUING A 
WEST LOS ANGELES CLINIC.

 Joshua's big blue-green eyes looked into hers. "Mommy," the 6-year-old asked 
softly as she tucked him into bed, "do you have AIDS?" 
</P>
<P>
 She stopped dead. My God, she thought, he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that Mary and Joe Orsak sat down with their adopted son, who 
already knew more than a small child should. Mommy didn't have AIDS, they told 
him, but she did have the virus that causes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Orsak was infected by the sperm of a stranger. She belongs to a group of 
heterosexual women numbering in the tens of thousands who have never been 
publicly warned they may be at risk for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In last-ditch efforts to conceive, up to 80,000 women each year resort to 
artificial insemination with donor sperm. But 13 years into the AIDS epidemic, 
the increasingly popular fertility business remains largely unregulated and 
unmonitored, even though it traffics in semen, long known to be one of two main 
HIV transmission routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical and public health experts agree artificial insemination is an HIV risk 
that somehow fell through the cracks of public education and health 
regulations. They insist, however, that the risk is low. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell that to Mary Orsak. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, long after she had been unsuccessfully inseminated 26 times, 
she received a call from Dr. Jaroslav Marik, who supervised her insemination in 
1984 and 1985 at the Tyler Medical Clinic in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that one of my donors had AIDS," she recalled. "And that I should 
come and be tested." 
</P>
<P>
 An upper-middle-class suburban housewife married to the same man for 12 years, 
Orsak said she never has used intravenous drugs, never had a blood transfusion 
and never cheated on her husband, who is not infected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orsaks have sued Marik and his clinic, contending "very little or no 
screening procedures" were used on donors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of their battle, they learned of another couple who had filed a 
similar lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Hallvik of San Luis Obispo, Calif., received sperm from the same donor 
as Mary Orsak during unsuccessful fertility treatments in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 They are two of the five women in the United States reported to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention as contracting the virus through artificial 
insemination with donor sperm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the risk is still out there," said Hallvik, who learned she was 
infected in 1991 when she banked her blood for surgery and it was routinely 
tested. "I don't think that people realize that it's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of states, including New York, California, Ohio, Illinois and 
Michigan, require AIDS testing of semen donors. There are no federal 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most states, if I wanted to get a liquid nitrogen tank and open a sperm 
bank in my garage, I could," said attorney Lori Andrews of the American Bar 
Foundation, who specializes in reproductive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couples don't think to ask about donors. You just assume that the safety and 
efficacy of the procedure has been shown," she said. "Some physicians have had 
the nerve to say to me, 'Well, I didn't screen my wife before I had a baby with 
her, why should I screen donors?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, then-U.S. Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) commissioned the Congressional 
Office of Technology Assessment to complete the most exhaustive survey ever of 
the fertility industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The study -- still the most recent one taken -- revealed that more than half 
of 1,558 physicians questioned did not check prospective donors for the AIDS 
virus, even though the antibody test had been made available three years 
earlier. All 15 commercial sperm banks surveyed, however, did test donors for 
HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts contend that voluntary industry and CDC guidelines issued in 
1988 now are standard practice. Those recommendations include testing donors 
twice, at three-month intervals, for HIV and quarantining frozen semen for six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think adequate safeguards are in place now," said CDC spokesman Kent 
Taylor. Mass testing of women who received donor sperm "is probably not 
warranted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five women reported to the CDC all received donor sperm before the HIV 
antibody test was licensed in 1985. All are living, and none conceived from 
infected sperm. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Laurene Mascola, head of infectious diseases for the Los Angeles County 
Health Department, located 46 of the 53 women who received sperm from Mary 
Orsak's donor. Only Orsak and Hallvik tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "All women should be aware that this could be a potential hazard and that they 
should be tested," Mascola said. "In general, the risk is low." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has debated fertility industry 
regulations for at least six years, but issued none. Dr. Jay Epstein, the FDA's 
acting director of Blood Research and Review, said the agency continues to 
study the issue and "may very well try to regulate this." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Gore accused the agency of moving "at a glacial pace" in drafting 
requirements. It also has been criticized by others as moving too slow in 
directing widespread testing of blood, the other primary AIDS transmission 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview, Dr. Marik said his clinic has always tested donors for 
HIV as technology permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine that this is a tragedy for everyone concerned," he said. 
"That donor was used in the early 1980s. There was no way to test him." 
</P>
<P>
 It never occurred to the Orsaks to ask about screening. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted was a baby," Mary Orsak said. "The thought that a world-famous 
clinic would not take care of that never entered my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're so involved in trying to have a child," said her husband, "you're not 
doing a whole lot of rational thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second marriage for both. Mary, now 41, heard the deafening roar of 
her biological clock. Joe, after months of trying to get his new wife pregnant, 
learned his sperm was not capable. 
</P>
<P>
 So Mary, then a 5th-grade teacher, dutifully began long, weekly treks to the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we had this beautiful little miracle appear," she said, beaming. The 
miracle was Joshua, whom they adopted privately at birth from an unwed mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, in 1992, they moved 70 miles south from the Los Angeles 
suburb of Downey to upscale Laguna Niguel, where Joe had a new job as vice 
president of an area hospital and served as president of the Laguna Beach 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Life was good. Mary was happy, in perfect health, teaching school and rearing 
her precocious son. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with one phone call, their lives were changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
 After her HIV tests, Mary cried a lot. Joe was stunned, then angry, and still 
struggles with guilt because he is virus-free. For a long time, the couple told 
only family and a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that night two years ago when Joshua looked up and guessed the truth. 
Mary still has no idea what prompted it; he had been told only that Mommy's 
immune system was sick and she could easily catch cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked at me and said, 'Are you going to be here when I'm 14?' I lost it 
at that," Mary said, wiping away a tear. "I still lose it when I think of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 But she remains in good health. Her attitude is radiant. She has been through 
spiritual healing and support groups. Now, she relies on a special diet, the 
AIDS drug ddI and the love and support of those around her. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Joe, she has started to talk publicly, and her message is simple: 
</P>
<P>
 "It can happen to you. Nobody ever told me that you can get it this way. 
Someone's got to tell these women to get tested."

BATTLE OF DIEN BIEN PHU SHAPED SOUTHEAST ASIA; VIETNAM: PEASANT ARMY OF 
NATIONALISTS AND COMMUNISTS DEFEATED THE FRENCH 40 YEARS AGO, ENDING COLONIAL 
RULE AND SETTING STAGE FOR U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN MOST DIVISIVE WAR OF ITS 
HISTORY.

<P>
 Forty years ago, men fought, bled and died here in an epic battle that changed 
the course of recent world history. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years the trenches and bomb craters have given way to the gentleness 
of the land, save for some battle sites with small decaying stone memorials 
that hint at the events that took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was where the French stronghold of Dien Bien Phu fell to a peasant 
Vietnamese army of nationalists and communists, ending French colonial rule, 
setting the stage for the involvement of the United States in Vietnam, and 
ending Western -- and white -- domination of much of Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 New generations of farmers now roam the peaceful valley with water buffalo, 
tending to their crops. Life is simple and uncomplicated. Children play in 
ponds. Old men and women ride their bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 White clouds frame the ring of mountains from which Vietnamese troops laid 
siege to the French forces for 56 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can no longer communicate with you," crackled the last chilling message 
from the French fortress to headquarters in Hanoi, nearly 200 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Dien Bien Phu fell on May 7, 1954. The victorious Vietnamese raised a banner 
over the bunker command post of French Gen. Christian de Castries proclaiming, 
"Determination to Fight, Determination to Win." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, France waned as a colonial power. A new player would emerge as a 
bulwark against the spread of commmunism in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dien Bien Phu propelled America into a full-scale war a decade later, boasting 
that its military and economic might would crush the poorly armed communists 
and maintain a balance of power in the Free World. It didn't, and history wrote 
its own script. 
</P>
<P>
 French President Francois Mitterrand acknowledged as much after a visit to 
Dien Bien Phu a little over a year ago. "French colonialism had to understand 
the necessity of turning the page . . . ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, with their own hands, the peasants and soldiers themselves 
filled the bomb craters and trenches and flattened the battlefield of Dien Bien 
Phu on which thousands of Vietnamese and French died. 
</P>
<P>
 They and the generations that followed gave birth to a new valley of lush 
green pastures of rice and maize and fruit gardens sustaining a population that 
has grown more than tenfold, to 125,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the veterans of the battle are still alive, as the ballad of Dien Bien 
Phu, written by Huy Can, proclaims: 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers of Dien Bien Phu, my comrades,  
</P>
<P>
 Wish you forever be in this life.  
</P>
<P>
 So that thousands of centuries,  
</P>
<P>
 Will listen to your words.  
</P>
<P>
 The veterans are paraded out for special occasions such as the 40th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 At the front is their leader, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, now 82, the legendary 
warrior who defeated the French and later held off more than a half-million 
American troops. He wields little power today in a newly emerging Vietnam that 
years ago made its peace with France and is now edging closer to America. 
</P>
<P>
 Dien Bien Phu represents the glory of the old soldiers, an occasion to put on 
their tattered, mismatched uniforms with medals as they retrace the battlefield 
and pose for photos for reporters and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Giap himself and senior officers who fought alongside him took a patrol into 
the past on a pre-anniversary visit to Dien Bien Phu in early April. Giap stood 
in front of the command post of de Castries, transfixing villagers with 
riveting accounts of how he defeated the French general. 
</P>
<P>
 While Giap had been to Dien Bien Phu several times in past years, he returned 
to his old headquarters in Muong Phang, 10 miles away, for the first time since 
his victory. He received a hero's welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,000 of Giap's troops lie in four tree-shaded cemeteries in Dien Bien 
Phu. There is none for the French. Their dead are symbolized by two rebuilt 
grave sites, where returning French veterans pay their respects. Hundreds of 
Vietnamese and French troops were buried in the earth of Dien Bien Phu at the 
positions where they fell, or were swallowed up by monsoon waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Vietnamese veterans of Dien Bien Phu also fought against the 
Americans. One of the four cemeteries comforts the fallen Vietnamese of that 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Vietnamese soldiers lionized in the ballad of Dien Bien Phu who survived 
have grown old now. Many are retired and tending their gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 But they can still feel the weight of the heavy artillery they pulled by hand 
and the 50 pounds of rice each carried for miles through the mountain passes, 
often under attack by French bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 They can still see the French bodies in the trenches and feel their hatred 
that inspired them to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 They can still feel the sting of the hot shrapnel making contact with their 
own bodies and the excruciating pain of bullets being removed with no 
anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people were killed, both Vietnamese and French," said veteran Nong 
Van Khau, now 63. "They all laid down in the trenches and died." 
</P>
<P>
 The French lost 2,200 troops out of more than 16,000 in the garrison. Waving 
white flags, up to 10,000 others surrendered, many of them seriously wounded. 
Many of them succumbed on a 500-mile death march to POW camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Western historians estimate that between 8,000 and 10,000 Vietnamese were 
killed, up to one-fourth of their forces at Dien Bien Phu. 
</P>
<P>
 Khau was among the thousands of wounded who survived to fight in the war 
against the Americans. He wears a chest full of medals. He still carries scars 
on his right knee and a piece of a bullet in his lung. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgeons ripped his back open with a pair of scissors to pull out the shrapnel 
with no anesthesia. Pain killer was for the more severe cases. The surgeons 
gave him the part of the bullet they removed as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very angry," Khau said. "I threw the bullet away because I considered 
it as my enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other expressions of anger and hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 A statue depicts a mother clutching her dead baby and old women and children 
running in panic through balls of fire. Soldiers said it is both a memorial to 
403 men, women and children killed in an air strike and an expression of the 
villagers' hatred of the French. 
</P>
<P>
 Cao Xuan Du, 65, dug trenches with hand tools, so determined was he to defeat 
the French. "We had been dominated by the French for over 80 years and that 
caused our hatred," he said. "We were just determined to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese surrounded Dien Bien Phu with a network of trenches stretching 
hundreds of miles from the high mountains to the plains, cutting French supply 
lines and gradually tightening the noose around their camp. 
</P>
<P>
 From their fortified trenches, barefoot Vietnamese shock troops assaulted 
French strongholds day and night, even under French bombardment. They secured 
their artillery in emplacements in the surrounding mountains and built roads 
for trucks to carry shells to each gun position. 
</P>
<P>
 As thousands of soldiers and civilians hauled rice and ammunition through the 
jungle and high mountain passes, the Vietnamese battle cry became, "Everything 
for the Frontline, Everything for Victory." 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest surprise we had in store for the enemy was our refusal to engage 
in all-out lightning clashes with the elite entire strength of the (French) 
Expeditionary Corps, firmly dug in their solidly built forts," Giap wrote in 
one account of the battle, "Dien Bien Phu: The Most Difficult Decision." 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to destroy pockets of resistance one by one," Giap wrote, "and 
gradually, in our own way, at a time and place of our own choosing, launch 
attacks with overwhelming superiority in each battle and at the same time 
consolidate our bunker system and cut the enemy's supply line until the base 
camp was strangled." 
</P>
<P>
 President Dwight D. Eisenhower was ready to order U.S. air strikes against 
Vietnamese positions at Dien Bien Phu in support of the French because he 
believed Indochina was vital to American interests. But he was unable to get 
approval from U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of the French brought to a close the first Indochina War. The 
Geneva Agreement of 1954 that followed divided Vietnam along the 17th Parallel 
into North and South. 
</P>
<P>
 The communist victors at Dien Bien Phu held the North with Hanoi as the 
capital. A U.S.-backed non-communist regime controlled the South with the seat 
of power in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the United States and France sought political influence in the new 
government in Saigon in the year after the Geneva Agreement. But the United 
States emerged as the new Western power when Ngo Dinh Diem, an anti-communist 
leader, ousted French-backed Emperor Bao Dai. 
</P>
<P>
 Diem became president of the newly formed Republic of Vietnam in the South. 
France had withdrawn all of its troops from South Vietnam by 1956. The United 
States remained the only foreign power supporting Diem. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1956, both the United States and South Vietnam refused to honor a key 
provision in the Geneva Agreement that called for national elections to be held 
that year to reunify the country. They feared the communists would win and gain 
control of South Vietnam, upsetting the balance of power with China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 That refusal marked the beginning of the second Indochina War. Giap would 
repeat his Dien Bien Phu strategy against the United States, locking it into 
its most divisive war that took a toll of nearly 60,000 Americans and as many 
as 2 million Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 The first American military advisers arrived in Saigon in July, 1950. The 
first U.S. combat forces arrived in South Vietnam in March 1965. Over the next 
three years, American forces grew to more than half a million. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, Dien Bien Phu stirs memories of an old American battlefield, Khe 
Sanh, near the Laotian border just below the old Demilitarized Zone that 
divided the warring Vietnams. 
</P>
<P>
 For 77 days in 1968, Giap's North Vietnamese forces laid siege to the American 
fortress, hammering it daily with cannon fire from mountain positions 
surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Khe Sanh held with the support of massive U.S. air strikes that unleashed 
nearly 100,000 tons of explosives against North Vietnamese positions, one-sixth 
of the total tonnage dropped by U.S. planes during the entire three years of 
the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 A relief column of 12,000 American and South Vietnamese soldiers reached the 
battered base on April 5. The North Vietnamese had withdrawn into the jungles. 
</P>
<P>
 What had been billed as the showdown battle of the war never came off, but the 
cost of holding the base had been high, with more than 200 U.S. Marines killed 
and 1,600 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The late historian Bernard B. Fall said in his book about the first Indochina 
War, "The Siege of Dien Bien Phu," that a major American air effort there in 
support of the French would have achieved desirable military and political 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Fall wrote that the communist Vietnamese army was getting stronger by the day 
and it became imperative for the French to destroy at least a large part of the 
main battle force as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was feasible only if the French could induce the enemy to face up to 
them in a set-piece battle, by offering the Viet Minh a target sufficiently 
tempting to pounce at, but sufficiently strong to resist the onslaught once it 
came," Fall wrote. "It was an incredible gamble, for upon its success hinged 
not only the fate of the French forces in Indochina and France's political role 
in Southeast Asia, but the survival of Vietnam as a non-communist state. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Like Dien Bien Phu, Khe Sanh became synonymous with failed French and American 
military strategy. It was a consideration that eventually led the United States 
to withdraw its military forces in 1973 under terms of the Paris Peace 
Agreement. The war between North and South ended on April 30, 1975, with a 
communist victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cemeteries of Dien Bien Phu, wives and daughters and sons come to light 
joss sticks and pray for the fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran Thi Yen came here for the first time on this 40th anniversary to search 
for the grave of her father. She was only 2 years old when he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The earth of Dien Bien Phu also embraces the remains of American airmen, 
missing in the second Indochina War during missions over the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 They lie far from family and home, missed and mourned by their loved ones.

PRIVATE TUTOR NEWEST OF STATUS SYMBOLS; EDUCATION: PARENTS SEEK EXTRA HELP TO 
GIVE THEIR CHILDREN AN EDGE. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

 Even though 9-year-old Barry Dreiband already speaks four languages and earns 
good grades, his mother drives him after school to a private tutor in an 
Alexandria, Va., shopping center. There, in an office next to Domino's Pizza, 
she plops down $35 an hour for extra reading instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bethesda, Md., Meghan Moscoti, 15, and her tutor hold math sessions at the 
dining-room table. She, too, gets good marks but scores even better with the 
one-on-one attention that guides her through trouble spots in algebra. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because I can say, 'Wait. I don't get it,' " she said. "At school 
you have one chance, and if you don't get it, you don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents in affluent parts of the country are turning to tutors to help their 
children. Some prefer the increasingly visible networks of teachers making 
house calls. Others drive to a new academic innovation: shopping-mall tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as parents have had children and money, they have been paying for 
extra school help. But what is happening now is that relatively expensive 
private tutoring is becoming more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons run from parental guilt -- not enough time or desire to step 
through the proofs of the binomial theorem -- to a perception that even the 
best students can use more instruction than they get in class. 
</P>
<P>
 While tutoring was most often reserved for students cramming for 
college-entrance exams or struggling not to flunk a course, students seeking 
tutors these days frequently are high achievers. These students begin getting 
tutored as early as the first grade, though the majority are in junior and 
senior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that having a tutor had a stigma to it, but now it's seen as 
being lucky if you can get extra help for your kid," said Tiffany Smith, 
co-owner of Potomac Tutors, which opened eight months ago in the Potomac 
Village, Md., shopping center. "Now kids brag about 'my tutor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At suburban soccer and lacrosse matches, parents can be heard trading notes on 
tutors as if they were talking about summer camps, supermarket specials or 
discount designer shops. Most schools, public and private, try to schedule time 
for teachers to meet with students after school. But students say it's often 
hard to match their free time with their teachers'. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Bren Tutorial Service, based in Montgomery County, Md., has a stable 
of 50 tutors who fan out to some of the Washington, D.C., region's wealthier 
addresses. Her rates run $35 to $50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon is the same in other affluent areas. Nationally, there are more 
than 500 Sylvan Learning Centers, offices resembling classrooms where certified 
teachers work with groups of two or three students. A competing tutorial chain, 
Huntington Learning Centers, is growing too, with 100 offices selling 
by-the-hour reading, writing and arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westchester County outside New York City, honor-roll students chat about 
the personalized attention and convenience of tutors. After all, they say, it's 
not like they can stay after school -- there is band, yearbook and gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the time after school," said Deborah Schoeneman, a junior at 
Mamaroneck (N.Y.) High School, who like many other students has extracurricular 
activities after her last class. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Schoeneman said, all of her close friends have tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, tutors are almost a status symbol, for others a good idea. Some 
public-school advocates sigh, saying tutors are just another sign of a 
disturbing gap between the educational opportunities of the poor and the 
wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barry Dreiband's mother, Mahla, said she sees the issue of paying for 
extra academic help as related more to a family's priorities than its income. 
Dreiband, who works as a government computer program analyst, pays $35 an hour 
for her son's tutoring because she wants to give him an edge. She thinks 
American schools try to cram too many subjects into too short a school day and 
year.

ALASKA DEBATES ARMING VILLAGE OFFICERS; PUBLIC SAFETY: RURAL LAW OFFICERS ARE 
CLOSELY WATCHING WHETHER THE GOVERNOR WILL SIGN A BILL THAT WOULD LET RESIDENTS 
CARRY CONCEALED HANDGUNS. AT PRESENT, PEOPLE OVER 16 MAY CARRY WEAPONS AS LONG 
AS THEY ARE VISIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Angoon's village public safety officer knows the troublemakers among the 
town's 700 residents, and they know him. 
</P>
<P>
 They also know he's not allowed to carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been to gunfights. I've had to wrestle with people who had loaded 
firearms," said Mike Einfeldt, a village officer since 1988. "They might be 
much less apt to tangle with me if they thought I had a firearm." 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska's rural law officers, who are unarmed, are closely watching the fate of 
a bill approved by the Legislature to let Alaskans carry a concealed handguns. 
The measure is on Gov. Walter J. Hickel's desk; he must decide by May 31 
whether to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would allow residents over 21 to tuck a handgun into their 
purses or briefcases if they submit to fingerprinting and a background check, 
and pass a weapons-handling class. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska currently allows people over 16 to carry weapons as long as they are 
visible -- in a holster, for instance. Only police officers, or citizens who 
are hunting, hiking or in their own homes or businesses, may carry concealed 
weapons. No gun registration is required other than the federal Brady law 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill has stirred debate over whether Alaska's 99 village officers should 
carry weapons. The high cost of liability insurance has thus far precluded them 
from being armed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the village-officer program, state money goes to regional agencies that 
hire and pay the officers and cover their insurance costs. If the agencies 
choose to send their officers to weapons-handling class and pay for the higher 
insurance premium, officers may be armed. 
</P>
<P>
 But arming the officers would add at least $600 to the $1,100 annual premium 
per officer, said David Taylor, the program's insurance agent in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program began statewide 13 years ago, one village officer has been 
killed in the line of duty -- ambushed by a man with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers are always in a certain amount of danger, but the measure 
"potentially allows everyone a (village officer) comes in contact with to have 
a concealed weapon. We think it creates an unjustifiable risk that outweighs 
any potential benefit," said George Cole, a retired state trooper who 
coordinates southeastern Alaska's officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the legislation say a concealed handgun could make people feel 
safer in cities like Fairbanks and Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's sponsor, Jeannette Janes, said she knows village officers are 
worried. But she said a provision that allows towns to hold a referendum to ban 
concealed weapons should ease those fears. 
</P>
<P>
 In Angoon, an Admiralty Island village south of Juneau, village officers face 
many of the same risks that armed officers do, especially when they answer 
domestic violence complaints, Einfeldt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are told not to respond to calls where a weapon is involved. But we never 
know until we get there, and then we're in a position of having to run and 
cover our backsides," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Al Schadle, who helps oversee Alaska's 99 village public safety officers 
for the state police, said unarmed officers may actually have an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you arm a police officer, there's the mind-set that goes, 'Here comes a 
guy with a gun. I got to get a gun.' With an unarmed officer," he said, "you 
know up front he doesn't pose a lethal threat."

UNDAUNTED BY FLOODS OF '93, IOWA FARMERS PLANT SEEDS OF THEIR FUTURE; 
AGRICULTURE: THE RIVERS INUNDATED VAST STRETCHES OF FARMLAND. BUT THE LAND 
SURVIVED, AND SO DID ITS INHABITANTS. SPRING CAME EARLY; CROPS ARE GOING IN.

 The farmers of Green Bay Bottom are racing against the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 In fields once swallowed by a river, tractors kick up dust, corn planters drop 
seeds no bigger than a thumbnail and the earth closes around them. The spring 
planting has begun in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 From the cab of his tractor, Harold Bonar looks over his shoulder as the corn 
planter cuts 12 neat rows into ground littered with the ashen stubble of last 
summer's flood-ravaged soybeans. Nearly all of the 81-acre field has been 
planted, but thunderstorms are brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the hours of blue sky left to him, he must finish planting so the field 
can be sprayed with fertilizer and weed killer. Ever the optimist, the 
ruddy-faced farmer smiles and says over the creak-creak-creak of the planter: 
"Isn't this peaceful?" 
</P>
<P>
 The river that turned Harold Bonar's thousand acres into a murky sea last year 
churns muddily along, 2 1/2 miles away, hidden by a rebuilt levee and a ridge 
of leafy green cottonwoods, willows and maples. 
</P>
<P>
 The mighty Mississippi is a comfortable four feet below flood level. 
</P>
<P>
 But who knows what summer will bring? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know it's a good year until after the crops are in the bin," said 
Eric Burch, the 33-year-old father of two who sells seed beans, oats, beet 
pulp, soy hulls and other farm products from the feed-manufacturing company he 
operates with his wife, Kay. 
</P>
<P>
 From Minnesota to Missouri, the Great Flood of 1993 overwhelmed farmers and 
fields alike. The swollen rivers of the Midwest overran cities, submerged towns 
and decimated crops. The flood hit Green Bay Bottom, as this 14,000 acres of 
prime southeast Iowa farmland is known, mid-season, in the early morning hours 
of July 11 with a levee break. 
</P>
<P>
 Their crop ruined, farmers pumped out the Bottoms and cleared debris from 
their land -- a commercial fisherman took 40,000 pounds of fish from the 
drainage ditches in which they were trapped. They repaired their sodden homes 
and waterlogged machinery, all the while knowing the vagaries of weather -- 
namely a wet winter -- could set them back farther come spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the runoff from winter snow nor the expected ice jams on the river 
proved onerous. Spring arrived early and warm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just storybook perfect for planting so far . . . ," said Nick Huston, manager 
of the riverfront Colusa Elevator Co., from which Wever's flood-fighting 
efforts were launched. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had to be double perfect because we have to make up a crop too," added 
Charlie Miller, a lanky, 52-year-old Iowan who finished planting his 240 acres 
with corn and soybeans at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's flooding cut the corn harvest in Lee County by half; the soybean 
harvest fared even worse, according to state figures. A less harsh winter and a 
record-breaking dry March warmed the soil enough to begin planting a week or 
two ahead of schedule. Across Iowa, anxious farmers took advantage of the good 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five percent of the corn in Lee County was planted by early May, a 
vigorous start in a state that usually has about 6% of its crop in the ground 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just beautiful weather -- the kind of weather that just makes you feel good 
to get out and smell the fresh earth," said Bonar, who has planted 350 of his 
1,100 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonar, a former Marine, sports the tattoos popular in the Corps: An eagle on 
his right forearm, "Mom and Dad" on his left. His hands, scarred and knobby, 
reveal his life's work. He has lived on a farm for nearly all of his 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A month earlier, Harold's eldest son, Rick, died unexpectedly from 
complications associated with an intestinal ailment. He was 39. Like his two 
brothers, Rick lived within an easy walk of his parents' farm on Green Bay 
Road. Last year, father and oldest son put in the crop, one driving a tractor 
that pulls the corn planter, the other planting soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the father has been a lone figure in the dark fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got him a new trailer house," Bonar said as he droves past his son's 
home, "getting him set up, (then) this come along. It's been a hell of a year." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his personal pain, Bonar has the clear-eyed outlook of an 
optimist. 
</P>
<P>
 "In another 30 days, this will all be green down here," said Bonar, who has 
restocked his hog operation since the floodwaters forced him to sell off his 
pigs last summer. "I look for a good year myself. You got to look ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 After three days of planting, an overnight rain kept Green Bay Bottom farmers 
from their land -- if the ground is too wet, the earth is sticky and won't 
properly cover the seed. But once the crop is in the soil, an inch or two of 
rain is welcome to ensure that the seed germinates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says a farmer's hard to please," said Karl Pieper, who is helping 
his cousin Mike put in his crop. 
</P>
<P>
 But their livelihoods depend on an often fickle partner. In the years before 
the great flood, too little rain had been the problem. This year, too much rain 
too soon could harden the soil and keep the young corn from poking through. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the good start this spring, and the weather notwithstanding, Wever's 
farmers will have other worries, such as cutworms and corn borers, as they have 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farming is not just a job. It's a commitment," said Nadine Bonar, Harold's 
wife of 40 years. "You can't farm one week and decide you want to do something 
else. Once you farm, you're committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, farmers can gauge the moisture in the earth by the darkness of its color 
when it is tilled. They ride tractors equipped with CB radios and light sensors 
that flicker when the planter doesn't drop a seed. In farmhouses, a wife may 
monitor the weather from a scanner. She is the same woman who can sense rain 
when the air is too muggy. 
</P>
<P>
 While farmers may plant more acres this season -- the government land 
set-asides have been lifted -- a bigger harvest could mean a lower price per 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our neighbors are just now getting their houses fixed (after the 
flood), so it's been a long process," Nadine Bonar said. "But you do what you 
have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 A sign tacked 15 feet high on a utility pole marks the reach of the swollen 
Mississippi. It reads, "The Flood of '93." The Millers left the wheels on their 
trailer so they can haul it out "if it floods." The front lawn Bud Pieper 
reseeded is finally in need of a mow.

NEW PRESIDENT TAKES OATH OF OFFICE IN MALAWI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bakili Muluzi was sworn in as Malawi's new president Saturday, ending more 
than 30 years of H. Kamuzu Banda's autocratic one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Muluzi, 51, was elected in the country's first multi-party election last 
Tuesday, but his United Democratic Front still lacks an absolute majority in 
the country's 177-seat Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The new president was inaugurated before a crowd of 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his first acts was to order freedom for political prisoners and to 
close down at least three prisons he said were notorious for having been used 
by Banda's government to detain and torture opposition figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The ailing Banda, believed to be in his mid-90s, had ruled the impoverished 
southeast African nation since independence from Britain in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 His grip on power started to slip two years ago with mounting domestic and 
international demands for political reform.

IN ALASKA, MIDNIGHT CAN LAST TILL 4 A.M. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN S. AKRE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not only is Alaska the state of the midnight sun, a day can last more than 24 
hours, at least in the final days of the legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wee hours of Monday, May 9, as the House finally began working in 
earnest on its Sunday floor agenda, Speaker Ramona Barnes ruled that Sunday 
didn't really end at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 It's known around the capital as stopping the clock. It usually happens at 
midnight on the 121st day -- the time when Alaska's constitution says a regular 
legislative session must end. Strictly speaking, that deadline arrived May 11 
at 12:01 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the endless-day declaration followed an excruciatingly long 119th 
legislative day in which precious little legislative work was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes was not about to let the day go to waste, since that would have left 
some bills without time to get to a final vote by the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 What was so important that lawmakers had to stay up later than the crew at 
Juneau's Red Dog Saloon? 
</P>
<P>
 Moose farming. 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, there also was a big oil-spill bill on the agenda and something to do with 
long-term logging contracts. But most of the pre-dawn session was spent 
debating the raising of moose for fun, food and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 There was debate on 18 amendments, including one that proposed a ban on 
dressing moose "in any gaudy clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a legitimate concern people have," said state Rep. David Finkelstein, 
sponsor of the clothing amendment. "Let's not degrade our animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Finkelstein insisted he had postcards somewhere showing moose "in actual gaudy 
clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes ruled the amendment dilatory. That's parliamentary talk for "a joke 
that's wasting our time." 
</P>
<P>
 Another amendment referred to an animal called "carriboo." It was sponsored by 
state Rep. John Davies, who teaches at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wonder if the sponsor of this amendment went to the Dan Quayle School 
of Spelling," said state Rep. Jim Nordlund. 
</P>
<P>
 The 119th legislative day finally was adjourned . . . after 4 a.m.

A DOG'S LIFE? HOW ABOUT POOL, SUN DECK, SOFT RUG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joshua puts on the dog every day of his life in his L-shaped California ranch 
house with the sliding glass doors and the Oriental rug. 
</P>
<P>
 The snow-white Maltese is the 10-year-old canine owner of a doghouse that 
lists for a modest $8,250, including the kidney-shaped pool. It was bought for 
him by Paul and Melinda Arneson, who describe themselves as "dog people." 
</P>
<P>
 Their friends, they say, think they are crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua is one of the first to occupy a new line of critter mansions built by 
an architect and sold to affluent pet owners. The homes range from the Inner 
City Kitty Condo -- an $11,000 cathouse -- to the modest $4,250 Manhattan Kitty 
Penthouse. The condo has four levels and room for four cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven R. Steinheimer -- architect, artist and dog-owner -- specializes in 
building models for architects and developers. He's had a hand in some of 
Washington's major structures, such as its subway and the Federal Triangle 
complex, now being built. 
</P>
<P>
 For $13,500 Steinheimer will build twin San Francisco row houses, 4 feet long, 
3 feet wide and 3 feet high. A single row house goes for a mere $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the idea that luxury homes should go to the dogs (and cats) after 
watching a developer give an expensive model to his children as a toy once its 
official use was ended. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Steinheimer's first creations, the L-shaped ranch, was snapped up by 
the Arnesons, who live on the same block as Steinheimer's downtown Washington 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua has the choice of entering the house through swinging front and side 
doors, or through sliding glass doors at poolside. The pool, in lesser paws, 
would be considered a water dish. 
</P>
<P>
 And no, he hasn't learned to slide open the doors, but he is working on 
licking them open. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was eager to look into it, but not to go inside," said Melinda Arneson. 
After a while, along with dog treat enticements, he ventured in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inner City Kitty Condo is a tower on four levels, with a tree running 
through the middle, all made of wood and glass. The $4,500 Pantheron, with 
columned porticoes, is carpeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinheimer's creations were featured on a network television show and 
resulted in telephone calls from pet owners who just couldn't wait to order. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinheimer's own dog, a basenji, was struck by a car recently and is 
recovering from surgery. Not in a glass-and-wood sanitarium, but a plain, 
low-rent wire cage.

TINY MOTH GIANT THREAT TO FLORIDA CITRUS; AGRICULTURE: THE DESTRUCTIVE 
LEAFMINER RIDDLED LAST YEAR'S SUMMER FLUSH, PROMPTING THE INDUSTRY TO FORM A 
TASK FORCE TO CHART A BATTLE PLAN. GROWERS ARE OPTIMISTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IKE FLORES, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A microscopic Asian moth, the newest threat to Florida's citrus industry, is 
puzzling scientists and worrying growers. 
</P>
<P>
 The citrus leafminer somehow hitchhiked into the Miami area almost a year ago 
and quickly established itself in much of Florida's 790,000-acre citrus belt. 
Officials believe it traveled to Florida from China, Thailand or Australia in a 
cargo shipment or in travelers' luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 The insect derives its name from its habit of boring into leaves and then 
"mining" them for food. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry leaders are scrambling to devise biological controls, since 
eradication is impossible. Much of the industry's hopes rest on parasitic 
wasps. 
</P>
<P>
 Early fears that the leafminer might severely damage this year's crop largely 
dissipated after the important spring flush of new foliage escaped serious 
damage. Growers are using expensive pesticides and special culturing methods in 
efforts to minimize expected attacks to new growth this summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The destructive pest riddled last year's summer flush, prompting industry 
officials to form a task force to chart a battle plan. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some damage to young trees, but officials said it was not extensive; 
however, they were unable to estimate the cost of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The leafminer's speedy march last year through commercial groves worried many 
growers, according to Walter J. Kender, director of the University of Florida's 
citrus research center in Lake Alfred. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was quite a scramble. If (the infestation) continued, we felt the 
important spring flush would be very vulnerable," Kender said. "It turned out 
that didn't happen, but we're still watching it very closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists and agricultural experts are confident they will learn to control 
the leafminer, just as they have other crop-eating bugs, pests, blights and 
infections that have descended on groves and citrus nurseries over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're in a watch-and-wait period," said Phil Stansly, entomologist 
at the University of Florida's citrus research station in Immokalee. "This is 
one of the worst pests I've ever seen. But we'll learn to live with it just as 
we have with the root weevil and others. . . . Most pests are under biological 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Five separate research projects are under way in different growing regions, 
and University of Florida entomologist Marjorie Hoy is in Australia to collect 
samples of three Asian wasps introduced to combat a leafminer infestation 
there. Australian researchers have found that the parasites kill about 80% of 
the leafminers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasps, often smaller than the leafminers, lay their eggs on the body of a 
leafminer with larvae. When the wasp eggs hatch, they eat the miners' larvae. 
Some native wasps are able to do this in a 15-day cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that some wasps evolved specifically for that will do a better job 
than our native wasps are doing," said Stansly. "But the natives are learning. 
They may have been a bigger help than we realize this spring." 
</P>
<P>
 The leafminer has some other natural predators: ants, spiders and the green 
lacewing insect. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers are taking the latest threat to their livelihoods in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fully apprised, totally familiar with what it can do," said Doug 
Bournique, executive vice president of the Indian River Citrus League. "Right 
now -- knock on wood -- it's not a severe problem. We have problems that have 
been a lot more devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus industry officials say the leafminer also has shown up in five 
southwestern Florida counties and along the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens in the groves this year is the key to control, citrus extension 
agent Robert M. Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was a scramble to find out about it. This year, we're a little 
better informed and well prepared. Once we've gone through a season, we'll know 
how to manage it," Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was first discovered in May, 1993, in Homestead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Pena, an entomologist at the Tropical Research and Education Center in 
Homestead, said about 3,000 acres of lime groves were quickly infested. By 
summer, the leafminer had traveled as far as the Florida-Georgia border. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been speculation that the insect was carried from West Africa by 
winds and ocean waves that became south Florida's Hurricane Andrew in August, 
1992. But most scientists consider that theory far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena believes it's possible that the hurricane helped spread the pest in South 
Florida after its arrival from foreign shores, probably aboard an ocean 
shipment.

LIVELY NEWSMAN, 88, IS TOWN'S SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN FLESHER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gordon Turner arrived in July, 1927, to work as a reporter for the Cheboygan 
Daily Tribune, salary $10 a week. His plan: spend three months learning the 
basics of newspapering in this small northern Michigan town, then head for the 
big time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still working for the Tribune 60 years later, Turner wryly noted in a column: 
"This has been the longest three months of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's even longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner recently celebrated his 88th birthday doing what he loves best: sitting 
behind his desk in the Tribune newsroom, banging out story after story on the 
Remington manual typewriter he bought for $1 decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask what keeps him going, and you'll get a straightforward answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the work," he said in a soft, muffled baritone. "I'd rather be 
working than doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Michigan Press Assn. knows of no other reporter or editor who has held one 
job longer than Turner, according to director Warren Hoyt. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner is a monument to a bygone era -- and not just because he never caught 
on to the computers on which most reporters now compose their articles. A 
colleague punches his typewritten words into the Tribune's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it's the Turner brand of journalism that sets him apart. He's called 
Mr. Cheboygan, with good reason. In nearly 70 years of chronicling the life of 
this town, he has become its soul. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves what he does, and he loves this town," said Ellis Olson, a local 
historian and former mayor of the tourist and factory town of 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never heard him say a bad word about anybody his entire life. He's 
always positive. He's a Cheboygan booster and lets you know it, but he doesn't 
editorialize -- just gives the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 A city park was renamed for Turner. The walls of his modest frame house are 
lined with honorary plaques. When he arrived for work on his birthday, two 
birthday cakes and a stack of gifts and cards awaited him. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's title is news editor, but it's honorary. He is a reporter -- and 
turns out more stories than reporters six decades his junior, Editor Jillian 
Bogater says. 
</P>
<P>
 His beat is, simply, the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a Turner story on a local teen-ager resuscitating a heart-attack 
victim. There's a Turner report on a business expansion. On the sports page, 
Turner writes about football tryouts at Cheboygan High School, where he has 
covered graduation ceremonies for 66 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 He is best known, though, for his thrice-weekly, front-page columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are compilations of local tidbits: An area birch is listed among the 
nation's biggest trees; a Coast Guard ship commander is being transferred; a 
local couple is displaying a new kind of quilting frame at the county fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Other columns are devoted to local history; Turner often spends his off days 
doing research in the Tribune archives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the Tribune is more popular, says its publisher, Roy S. Trahan II. 
</P>
<P>
 "He writes in a style that should be taught in college now but isn't," Trahan 
said. "It's upbeat; it makes you feel good about what you just read." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner wears horn-rimmed glasses and wide plaid ties. An arthritic back bends 
him into a severe hunch. Local drivers keep watch for his dark-blue Chevy, 
which sometimes wanders across the center line. 
</P>
<P>
 But he plays an occasional round of golf and still visits the archery range. 
During summer he's a familiar sight on the Cheboygan River, piloting his 
15-foot motorboat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think he'd be ailing and sickly at his age, but he just keeps right 
on," said Jerry Pond, who runs the Tribune's press room. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner lives alone; his first wife and adopted daughter are dead, and he's 
been divorced twice. His only surviving brother lives in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Every workday Turner eats the same lunch -- peanut butter sandwich, banana, 
cookie and coffee -- while watching his favorite soap opera, "Days of Our 
Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 He heads to work at 3 p.m. and gets off at 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner is a careful reporter, often calling sources back to check his facts. 
He's also a fast writer. On a recent visit, a reporter found him taking 20 
minutes to interview a maple syrup maker and write a short story about how the 
sap was running. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Canada and reared in the Detroit area, Turner headed north after 
graduating from what became Wayne State University. His father, a real estate 
developer who was selling parcels on Bois Blanc Island in Lake Huron, persuaded 
the Tribune editor to give young Turner a try. 
</P>
<P>
 After his three-month stint, Turner rejected a job with the Muskegon Chronicle 
at $18 a week. By then he was engaged and reluctant to leave a secure position 
for "a new job that I might not be able to handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the Tribune had boosted him to $15 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Townspeople and colleagues say they can't imagine the Tribune without Turner. 
But his long-postponed retirement might be drawing near. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 88 years old now," he said. "By the time I'm 90, I think I'll be all 
through."

MALIBU FIRE WITNESS SEEKS REFUGE FROM THE LIMELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As authorities continue their investigation into whether two firefighters 
started last year's devastating Calabasas/Malibu fire, a key witness who 
emerged recently said he is leaving town temporarily to escape the 
high-pressure atmosphere surrounding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the grand jury hearing testimony in the case said Friday that 
more witnesses will be called. Earlier, authorities had said they expected the 
grand jury to wrap up its work during two all-day sessions last week. No reason 
was given for calling the additional witnesses, nor was it disclosed who will 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects -- Steven R. Shelp, 29, and Nicholas A. Durepo, 24 -- 
appeared before the grand jury and refused to answer questions on the advice of 
their lawyers, a common practice when grand jury testimony is being used to 
gather evidence against suspects. Others who know the two men, including a 
fellow volunteer firefighter who spoke with one of them just hours after the 
fire, also have testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block has said his department believes Shelp and Durepo 
started the Nov. 2 fire so that they could extinguish it, become heroes and win 
permanent jobs with fire departments. At the time, both were volunteer 
firefighters who had been trying to win highly coveted permanent slots at area 
fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Shelp and Durepo vehemently deny setting the blaze, which killed three 
people and caused $350 million in damage, saying they were merely driving by 
and tried to put it out with a garden hose -- with the assistance of a 
"plumber" who also happened to be passing by.

 The "plumber," actually an underground contractor named Robert Blakeley, said 
Friday that he and his wife and young son need to escape the limelight that has 
followed them since he emerged from obscurity 10 days ago to say he was present 
during the first moments of the fire above Old Topanga Canyon Road. Blakeley 
said Shelp and Durepo arrived at the scene after he did. He then helped them 
fight the fire by providing an adapter that allowed them to hook up their 
garden hose to a nearby fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't gotten much sleep, all the late calls and everything," Blakeley 
said. "I'm kind of overwhelmed by this whole deal. I've received national 
attention from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming forward after seeing his photograph in The Times, Blakeley has 
cooperated extensively with the Sheriff's Department homicide investigators 
handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities won't say whether Blakeley's testimony will help to exonerate 
Shelp and Durepo -- as the two firefighters have claimed it will -- or perhaps 
answer questions that could strengthen the case against them. Authorities have 
said they have a strong circumstantial case against the men, but refused to 
comment Friday on what Blakeley has told them and whether it will have an 
impact on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have an opinion now (about whether the two firefighters may have started 
the fire), but I can't say what it is," Blakeley said. "They (authorities) have 
made sure to let me know I'd be in contempt of court if I say anything, 
anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, a father of a volunteer firefighter who has worked closely 
with Durepo said he is so convinced that the two are innocent that he will 
organize an effort to help them. Frank Safechuck said many fellow Malibu 
residents have volunteered money and other assistance on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like their careers are jeopardized because of all of the publicity," 
said Safechuck, a Malibu art dealer who opened a bank account Friday with a 
check for $100 to start the legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially, right now, both young men are devastated by this," he said. 
"Absolutely, without a doubt, I believe in the innocence of these two 
firefighters. I'm not going to take it any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp, who has since graduated from the Fire Academy and is now a firefighter 
with the Los Angeles City Fire Department, has been placed on administrative 
duty until the investigation is completed. Durepo has been taken off active 
volunteer duty with the Manhattan Beach Fire Department.

CROCODILE ATTACK CAN'T DESTROY HER LOVE OF LIFE; AFRICA: SPIRITED MISSOURI 
WOMAN LOST HER ARM TO DEADLY REPTILE A YEAR AGO. UNDAUNTED, SHE'S PREPARING TO 
REVISIT THE REMOTE FOREST IN ZAIRE WHERE SHE NEARLY DIED.

<P>
 With her left arm snared in the jaws of a killer crocodile, Sandy Rossi had to 
make a life-or-death decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew from the beginning it was a choice between my arm and my life," she 
said. "I chose to fight for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fight she won, losing her arm but escaping from one of the world's 
deadliest creatures. A year later, the 28-year-old Missouri woman is preparing 
to return this fall to the same remote African rain forest where she was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to -- that crocodile still has my watch," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of humor has helped Rossi overcome the trauma of the attack and the 
loss of her arm. The vanity license plates on her car read "BITN." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried for 'HOOK' and they denied me that," she said. "Then I went for 
'LEFTY,' but that was taken too." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred in March, 1993, in Zaire's Epulu River. Rossi was in the 
central African nation as a tutor for the daughters of a husband-and-wife 
research team studying rain forest flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossi, the two girls and another American researcher had gone to the river to 
bathe and escape the oppressive heat and humidity. As dusk fell, Rossi ordered 
the girls out of the water. She took a minute longer to rinse soap from her 
long, strawberry blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the crocodile attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Epulu isn't normal habitat for the Nile crocodile. Apparently, though, a 
lone croc had wandered down from another river. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nile is one of the world's largest and most deadly crocodiles, said 
Charles Hoessle, director of the St. Louis Zoo and a crocodile expert. They 
measure up to 30 feet long and feed on large game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't seek out humans, but they'll attack them like they would any other 
animal," Hoessle said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this crocodile met its match in Sandy Rossi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I outlasted him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the reptile clamped its jaws on her left forearm, it pulled her 
under water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came up groping for air and yelled, 'Crocodile!"' she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, Ken Cochrane, thought she was kidding until Rossi managed to pull 
the animal's snout out of the water, where Cochrane could see his grip on her 
bloody forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was at this point that Ken came running over," she said. "It was also at 
this point that the crocodile knew I wouldn't be an easy kill, so he started 
his death rolls." 
</P>
<P>
 He rolled her under water repeatedly, trying to drown her, but Rossi surprised 
herself by remaining calm and clearheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could just feel the power," Rossi said. "He'd yank me back and forth to 
see if I was dead yet. Then he'd roll me some more." 
</P>
<P>
 With help from Cochrane, Rossi struggled to her feet and, finally, her arm 
"just basically came off." The crocodile, perhaps too exhausted to finish the 
kill, swam away. 
</P>
<P>
 Natives have spotted that same crocodile several times since. A few months 
ago, he attacked and killed a 14-year-old boy in the Epulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoessle said few humans survive in-water attacks by crocodiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very lucky to be alive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the attack, Rossi has become proficient with her prosthesis, a 
lightweight model developed by NASA. She works with weights and does aerobics 
as she prepares for her return to Zaire, where she'll work with the same family 
she left behind last March. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the brutal conditions in Zaire -- hot and humid, with no electricity 
or running water in Rossi's small hut -- she loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, Rossi and other Westerners would gather in a screened-in porch with 
a view of the river. They'd listen to the cackling noises and whistles of the 
rain forest and feel the moist African air on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd sit out there and say, 'God, we're so lucky to be here,' " Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossi befriended a tribe of Pygmies and learned to appreciate their spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life in Africa is very hard on everybody -- there's always some sort of 
disease you can pick up," she said. "One of the ways the Africans get by is 
they laugh at everything. Somehow or another, they're able to see that life 
goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 And like her Pygmy friends, Rossi has learned that life goes on. She admits 
it's tough at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you're ever quite over it," she said. "But then again, I did 
not fight for my life for 20 minutes to come back and be depressed. It's much 
too important to get on with my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to become more involved in rain forest research upon her return to 
Zaire, Rossi has been studying at the Missouri Botanical Garden and the zoo in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 At the zoo, Rossi often finds herself at the crocodile pits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just stand there and look at the crocodiles," she said. "But I don't 
fear them."

QUESTIONS TO ASK THE DOCTOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No federal guidelines and only a few state laws regulate sperm banks and 
artificial insemination. But there are industry guidelines in place that 
couples should know about, and there are questions they should ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would recommend that people stay away from private physicians who are doing 
this unless they know that the doctor is only using certified sperm banks to 
get their products," said Charles Inlander of People's Medical Society, the 
country's largest nonprofit patients' rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples should review a doctor's or clinic's testing and record-keeping 
procedures and demand to see donor medical records, which can be shared if the 
donor's identity is protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Fertility Society and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention recommend that doctors and sperm banks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Use only frozen donor semen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Test donors twice, at three-month intervals, for HIV and quarantine frozen 
semen for six months. A man recently infected may not develop antibodies for at 
least three months and can transmit the virus while harboring it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Obtain detailed medical and genetic histories from donors.

PROFILE OF INFECTED DONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The donor who provided sperm -- and the HIV virus -- to Mary Orsak and Cynthia 
Hallvik was a third-year undergraduate student at UCLA who belonged to the 
Geography Club and the Thespian Drama Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The questionnaire he completed for the Tyler Medical Clinic, which was 
obtained by the Associated Press, said he was 5-foot-11, weighed 150 pounds and 
had thick blond hair and blue eyes.His name and age were omitted because of 
patient-confidentiality laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The donor, who listed his health as "good," first began donating semen in 
1981. He could not have known then that he was carrying the virus; the HIV test 
was not available until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Orsaks and Hallviks said the young man died last year in his 
hometown of Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the two women, the clinic said many of its donors were 
intelligent students from nearby UCLA. At that time, donors received about $20 
per visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The questionnaire asked a lengthy series of questions concerning diseases such 
as German measles, mumps, influenza, gonorrhea and syphilis, but included no 
inquiries about sexual practices.

MOTEL A SURPRISE HAVEN FOR MENTALLY ILL; SAMARITAN: AT HER TRANSFORMED ROOMING 
HOUSE, OWNER HAS SHELTERED, FED AND OTHERWISE TRIED TO HELP HUNDREDS OF LOST 
SOULS FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 Hotel owner Josephine Shaw was almost no one's idea of a Samaritan to the 
mentally ill -- least of all her own. 
</P>
<P>
 She mainly wanted to earn a living. But her simple decency bloomed into 
compassion and ended up transforming both her and her business venture. 
</P>
<P>
 At her Northampton rooming house, Shaw has sheltered, fed and otherwise tried 
to help hundreds of mentally ill and a smaller number of retarded tenants for 
more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always easy or pleasant. Some tenants struck out habitually in rage; 
some poured rent money into booze or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you turn them away?" she said recently, standing in the parking lot 
of her two-story hotel. "They're human. Somebody's got to take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw and her late husband, Donald, began accepting the mentally ill at Shaw's 
Motel around 1960. They bucked neighborhood opposition in this affluent college 
town to participate in an experiment to find community housing for patients 
from the nearby U.S. Veterans Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Shaw acknowledges, she looked upon her new tenants as a way to 
bolster her seasonal tourist income with year-round rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, she complains about expenses and frets about taxes and tenants who 
are late with the rent. "It's like that guy in City Hall told me: 'Mrs. Shaw, 
if you want to run the business with your heart, that's your business. But we 
want our money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaw's act of faith -- that her new boarders, however troubled, were still 
people -- eventually led her to share in their joy and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had many good tenants. They were so happy to be out in the community after 
all that time. They loved their freedom," she said. "Even the bad patients I 
could cope with, because I knew they were sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw started looking in on her new tenants and ended up looking out for them. 
When they needed a meal, she fed them from her home next to the hotel. If they 
needed a reminder to take their medicine, she provided one. If they needed a 
few bucks, she would loan them. If they needed help, she would call for it. 
</P>
<P>
 She eventually accepted mentally ill tenants from Northampton State Hospital 
and mentally retarded residents from the Belchertown State School. In a triumph 
for advocates of community care, both state institutions are now closed. 
</P>
<P>
 One current tenant at Shaw's 16-room hotel, John Borg, calls Shaw "Mom." This 
50-year-old schizophrenic lives alone in his $350-a-month room with dozens of 
discarded dolls, stuffed animals and knickknacks he collects and displays on 
every bit of free space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get mad at her sometimes, as I got mad at my mother. But she understands," 
he said, looking at Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said he needs his medication to keep a grip. "When it's not working, 
poor John doesn't even know me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no tenant has ever attacked her, she said, "I would never turn my back 
on them." Tenants have smashed walls, broken windows and once cracked open a 
police officer's head with a table leg. In 1985, a military veteran took a 
shotgun and killed himself in one of her rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Many tenants have returned to local hospitals for treatment, sometimes 
repeatedly. She believes that some were so sick they could never survive 
outside an institution.

VIRTUAL REALITY GIVES WHEELCHAIR STUDENTS REALISTIC -- BUT SAFE -- LESSONS; 
THERAPY: COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT HELPS TRAIN FIGHTER PILOTS AND TANK DRIVERS IS 
HELPING THE DISABLED LEARN HOW TO NAVIGATE AND COMMUNICATE MORE EFFECTIVELY. 
</P>

<P>
 When 5-year-old Christopher Cobbs straps himself into his electric wheelchair, 
his mother doesn't worry that he'll get dirty plowing through the mud or 
injured in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 With his small hand gripping the joystick and his eyes locked on tiny TV 
screens inside a headset, Christopher zooms through a computer-generated world 
of virtual reality, learning to pilot a wheelchair the same way an astronaut 
learns to land the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put me on speed!" said Christopher, whose cerebral palsy keeps him from 
walking but not from playing Nintendo. "I want to be running through the mud!" 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's mother, Nora Cobbs, drives him 135 miles from Grants Pass to 
practice on the virtual reality rig. He's one of a dozen children enrolled in a 
pilot program at the Oregon Research Institute, which is financed by a $600,000 
grant from the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "On his real one, if he crashes, he'll get hurt," Cobbs said. "They should 
have thought of this a long time ago. It's going to help a lot of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The military has been using virtual reality for years to teach jet pilots and 
tank drivers, and even to stage mock battles. Now the technology is helping the 
disabled navigate and communicate more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think VR is going to be most powerful as a training device. What it will do 
is take us places we haven't been before, in ways we haven't been before," said 
Harry J. Murphy, director of the Center on Disabilities at California State 
University at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 At Loma Linda University Hospital in California, researchers put data gloves 
like those used in virtual reality games on patients who have lost their 
speech, so they can talk with simple hand movements translated by a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is rock 'n' roll science at its finest," said medical student David 
Warner. "This is a technology that, if we don't take control of it, Nintendo 
and Sega will control our future." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Inman, director of the Oregon wheelchair-training project, was frustrated 
in trying to teach children with cerebral palsy to drive motorized wheelchairs 
in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "For kids who have never moved around before independently, these are 
brand-new concepts," said Inman. "They don't understand poles, doors, hallways. 
They don't have any depth perception to speak of, because they've never moved 
themselves around and had to learn about environmental cues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learn to be helpless, because people carry them from place to place," he 
added. "Many times they simply won't do it. We were left chewing on granite 
when we had a motivational problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Inman had been tinkering with a computer world for wheelchairs projected on a 
normal TV screen when his wife came home from a conference on virtual reality 
and urged him to try that. The state Education Department gave him a three-year 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 For about $30,000 Inman was able to buy the hardware and software to create 
the virtual reality world Christopher drives through. He sits on a motorized 
wheelchair that is mounted on a set of rollers wheelchair athletes use to train 
indoors, letting the wheels spin and giving a sense of movement beyond the 
video images. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a baseball cap to help the headset fit, Christopher sees through tiny 
TV screens mounted in front of each eye, making the computer-generated images 
three-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
 When he bumps into something, the wheelchair jolts to a stop. When he hits the 
mud, he goes slower. When he runs off the edge of the world, he flies through 
the sky until he finds the ground again. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Ken Loge is creating four different worlds of increasing difficulty, 
each with a pair of toes at the bottom of the screen. They go from a simple 
floor with black and white tiles, where there are no walls to bump into, to a 
street crossing with traffic lights and passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the computer images have a cartoon quality, Christopher said he feels 
as if he is in a real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the questions is how real does it have to look for it to work?" said 
Inman. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to drive a wheelchair is just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman is seeking a grant to use virtual reality to teach biology, chemistry 
and physics to children with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an idea whose time has come," Inman said.

 And thanks to his viatication, in which investors paid him a portion of his 
life insurance money for the rights to the policy's proceeds, Baez is sitting 
on a pile of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Baez can't help gloating. For premium payments totaling $857, he wound up with 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really not very good at it," he said, of the viaticals' 
life-expectancy forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go through this guilt thing at first. You know they are making money off 
your death," said Baez, a 30-year-old Los Angeles lawyer. "But 99% of the time, 
it's a service that a client is benefiting from more than the people who 
purchase the policies." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 Baez began negotiating with three viaticals, receiving offers of 
$75,000, $85,000 and $100,000 before selling his $150,000 policy to the top 
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately, he went on a spending binge: two new cars, home redecoration, 
college tuition for his siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I sold my policy, I haven't thought about AIDS. What more can you ask 
for than that you forget about your disease?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement led to other fortuitous events. Baez had never gone near the 
stock market before. But his settlement put him in a gambling mood. He plunked 
down $30,000 on assorted stocks, betting on their one-day rise. A year later, 
he had $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people that I know are living longer and are happier," he said. "That is 
the bottom line: Happiness creates longevity." 
</P>
<P>
 Baez is getting ready to viaticate his second policy. It has a face value of 
$500,000. He says he'll probably get $350,000.

'DEATH FUTURES' MAY EASE LIVES OF THE TERMINALLY ILL, PROPONENTS SAY; TRENDS: 
SOME AILING INDIVIDUALS SELL THEIR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AT A CUT RATE TO 
INVESTORS, WHO RECEIVE THE PROCEEDS WHEN THE PATIENT DIES. SO-CALLED 
VIATICATION BUSINESS IS GROWING IN POPULARITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Almost monthly, AIDS patient Clemente Castro gets a check-up call from a group 
of investors who are destined to receive up to $150,000 from the terminally ill 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch: They don't get it until Castro dies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try to be as roundabout as possible, but they are checking to see if 
I've croaked," said Castro, 34, of Los Angeles. " . . . My partner would get a 
little sarcastic and say, 'No he hasn't croaked yet,' and hang up." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the morbid world of viatical settlements -- otherwise known as "death 
futures" -- where the terminally ill sign over their life insurance policies at 
a cut rate to investors who receive the proceeds when the patient dies. 
</P>
<P>
 The business of viatication -- from the Latin word viaticum, referring to the 
Eucharist given to a dying person -- has grown in the last five years from 
several companies to more than 50 firms competing in a $300-million industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought of trading on another person's mortality may strike some as 
grotesque and unseemly. But viatical investors see their service as more 
life-affirming than vulture-like. They say they deliver something the 
terminally ill need: Money to spend while they are still around to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's only fair, they say, that investors get some compensation for putting 
up their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Funeral directors charge you money, ministers charge you money, doctors 
charge you money. There is no such thing as a free lunch. Everybody pays, even 
in death," said Rob Haynie, client services director for the Medical Escrow 
Society, a viatical broker in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to gauge just how lucrative the viatical industry is, since 
most death futures are privately held and many are so new that their first set 
of policies has yet to yield dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any investment, there is risk: a medical cure could be found, investors 
might be sued, interest rates on borrowed money could eat away at eventual 
profits. And, of course, there's the risk of simply being too bullish about how 
quickly a policyholder will die. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, when Castro seemed not long for this world, he was paid 
$97,500 up front for his $150,000 policy. Despite having almost no white blood 
cells left, Castro is holding on, and the investors are still waiting for their 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that when someone was diagnosed with AIDS, they were gone in a 
year," said Bob Banchich, national marketing director for Living Benefits, one 
of two viaticals owned by the publicly held CAPX Corp. "Now, it's more of a 
crapshoot." 
</P>
<P>
 But Living Benefits and other viaticals treat life expectancy as a science. 
Several doctors review medical records from potential clients and advise the 
companies on the likely date of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Living Benefits stays away from anyone with more than two years to live. Other 
companies will accept life expectancies of up to four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,000 policies Living Benefits has bought since 1988, 20% have lived 
past the two-year cutoff. In only 1% of the cases have they been off by more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly the biggest selling point for the industry is that the terminally ill 
themselves are among its biggest supporters. Whether they use the money for 
medicines and alternative therapies or splurge on a dream house or an exotic 
trip, few viators, as they're called, have regrets. They say the cash infusion 
has taken their mind off death and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has given me a new outlook on life," Castro said. "Life is so much more 
comfortable, so much less stressful." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Bill Freeman, executive director of the National Assn. of People with 
AIDS: "We're very much in support. We think it's a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the industry's bad seeds, like viaticals who fail to pay sellers what 
they've been promised, have been driven out, said Nancy Ayoob, senior staff 
counsel for the California Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry remains virtually wide open to buyers and sellers. Only five 
states regulate viaticals -- California, Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico and New 
York. Other states have legislation pending. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean interested viators should leap in blindly, said retired 
financial planner David Petersen, who assisted in the first viatical 
settlement. They should explore other sources of revenue first, he said, such 
as borrowing money using the policy as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 Viators, he said, get a "double haircut" on their money, first in the discount 
on the policy's face value and later during taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another danger is that viators will plow through their money quickly but live 
on, penniless. Meanwhile, the original beneficiaries end up with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobue Janiga's $30,000 February settlement is long gone, but her view of 
viaticals remains rosy. 
</P>
<P>
 Janiga, a cancer patient who was given six months to live in June, took her 
money, paid some bills and went to Reno, Nev., where the balance evaporated in 
a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life insurance policies are such that you pay for them but you won't see it 
(the money) until you die," said Janiga, who has two other policies that she 
plans to keep intact. "I thought, well, why shouldn't I see it while I'm still 
here?"

A HOME FOR THE HOMELESS? GOOD START!; * WESTMINSTER LEADERS DESERVE CREDIT FOR 
COMPASSION; LET'S ALL GO WITH THAT IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Add Westminster to the list of cities trying to alleviate Orange County's 
homeless problem. It is one thing to acknowledge the existence of the homeless, 
it is another to try to do something about it, and something else quite again 
to manage to come up with an approach that is more than a response to urgency, 
but that is innovative and compassionate at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the too common scenario of keeping the homeless out of sight and out of 
mind, those evicted last month from a makeshift outdoor shelter near the Beach 
Boulevard exit of the San Diego Freeway would simply have been left on their 
own to find another clump of bushes to call home. It is to the credit of 
Westminster officials that this group was not simply abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, o a dozen residents of what they had proclaimed "Club Homeless" moved 
into a four-bedroom house. They can stay 60 days while they look for work or 
receive job training. If they need more time, they are likely to get it. 
Sensible rules like no drugs or alcohol were instituted, and those not spending 
eight hours a day looking for a job will have to do volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster Redevelopment Agency approved $10,000 for the program; the 
nonprofit organization Shelter for the Homeless chipped in $4,000 plus a case 
manager. It should be money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide Homeless Issues Task Force last year estimated the number of 
homeless in the county at 12,000, an increase of 20% in two years. Permanent 
homeless shelters can handle fewer than 10%. Clearly, Orange County needs more 
of such innovative solutions to a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of cities are trying to tackle it, as they should. It would also be 
helpful for all the cities, and the county, and churches and nonprofit groups 
to come up with a comprehensive plan to solve the problem, rather than a 
piecemeal approach.

COUNTY SCHOOL SUPT. DESERVES NEW TERM; * JOHN F. DEAN'S VISION, LEADERSHIP ON 
KEY EDUCATIONAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County superintendent of education is not, as the name might imply, 
the leading voice for educational issues in the county by any statutory 
obligation. But as a practical matter, there is a reasonable expectation of 
broader inspirational leadership to be found in someone with that title. The 
question is, can the person holding the office, charged with very specific 
duties, fill the larger bill? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer in the case of the incumbent John F. Dean is a resounding yes. The 
county superintendent has responsibility for youngsters with special 
educational needs and those who have been in trouble, as well as providing 
teacher training and financial services to school districts. Dean has done well 
in all these areas.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the intangible category of being something more -- a leader of and for 
education issues in Orange County -- Dean has answered the calling and filled a 
void in his first term as a reform superintendent. Fulfilling this role has 
become increasingly important as questions about the quality and focus of 
public education have come to dominate the public consciousness and discourse 
across district lines. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first term, it might have been sufficient for Dean to meet his 
budgetary and administrative obligations, and then begin slowly taking on some 
of the larger work of agenda-setting, and serving as lightning rod for 
educational issues in Orange County. He did not wait to accept this challenge. 
To name a few things, he was out front campaigning against Proposition 174, the 
flawed voucher initiative; he has urged the county to do a better job of coming 
to terms with its cultural and language diversity; and he has worked to bring 
business and industry into partnership with the schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Within his own bailiwick, he moved quickly to build a productive relationship 
with the county Board of Education, and with superintendents and public 
officials. In a time when difficult budgetary choices had to be made, he might 
have made more enemies. Yet, morale seems up in the county education hierarchy. 
He has made the difficult budget choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean has a challenger this year, but he is clearly deserving of reelection. We 
are pleased that he has met the high expectations that we held of him the first 
time around and urge him to keep up the good work. Much of the power of this 
office is the power of persuasion, and the willingness of the occupant to take 
up the big causes. In Dean, Orange County truly has a superintendent who is in 
step with the times and who is providing some vision and leadership.

LETTING THE PUBLIC JOIN EL TORO DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Although the May 8 editorial is entitled "Let the Public Join the El Toro 
Discussion," it is critical of our attempts to draw the public into El Toro 
Reuse discussion by circulating a petition which would lead to the designation 
of El Toro as a commercial airport. We believe that the circulation of these 
petitions effects the most direct form of participatory control over the most 
significant land-use decision affecting Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although The Times apparently believes that petitions are signed by people who 
don't know what they are signing, we have found the citizenry informed and 
concerned about the ramifications for the reuse of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 We have chosen the initiative vehicle because the planning agency that has 
been created gives de facto control to the well-documented opponents of 
commercial aviation at El Toro. The El Toro Reuse Planning Authority (ETRPA) is 
structurally set up to approve any alternative for Base Reuse other than 
commercial aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 We know this because of ETRPA's nine members, three come from the Irvine City 
Council (whose General Plan prohibits commercial aviation use for El Toro), one 
is from the Lake Forest City Council (which has adopted at least two 
resolutions opposing airport usage.) We cannot allow two cities with 
predisposed parochial positions to control the economic future of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting that we see evolving for El Toro is a prescription for failed base 
reuse.  
</P>
<P>
 The petition we have circulated seeks land-use designation of El Toro as a 
commercial airport. El Toro is a regional resource whose closure affects far 
more than the communities which surround it; its replication elsewhere would be 
prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, use of El Toro as an airport would infuse economic vitality into a 
region wider than constrained by the myopic group controlling ETRPA. In sum, 
the reuse of El Toro should be determined by a regionally based reuse group 
which has something other than the narrow-perspective members of the currently 
constituted ETRPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Military Base Reuse Task Force found that those military 
facilities which ended up being litigation Super Bowls got that way because 
reuse planning authorities presented only local, narrow and parochial interests 
and not the broad-based interests of the affected region. Our petition is 
designed to draw all of the county into the planning process. Unlike the May 8 
editorial, we have faith in the public's intelligence and right to join the El 
Toro discussion by participating in the initiative process that we have begun.

THE HEADLANDS SHOULD BE FOR ALL TO ENJOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Having read the article, "Future of Dana Point Development in Doubt" (May 
17), I was struck by the statement of M.H. Sherman Co. President Dan Daniels: 
"I would hope the citizens would follow the lead of their elected and appointed 
representatives." It is clear that Mr. Daniels has a very distorted view of how 
our government is supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 What he describes is dictatorship, benign or otherwise, not representative 
government. His perspective on government is only an indicator of the true 
problem Dana Point faces. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue is leadership, true leadership that not only represents the 
will of the people but includes statesmanship, wisdom and vision. The Dana 
Point City Council majority has failed in a unique opportunity to lead, and the 
citizens have taken this opportunity to let them know it. The people of Dana 
Point want to preserve the Headlands for all, not just for the rich who will 
buy the homes Sherman Co. wants to build or the outsiders who can afford the 
price of a weekend stay at the Ritz-Carlton or one of its clones. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed is true wisdom and vision which extends beyond the next few 
years. The potential is present for a truly great and far-reaching decision to 
preserve much, or even all, of the Headlands' unique natural beauty for all to 
enjoy. This indeed is the greater good, for that single act of creation would 
benefit not only the people of Dana Point today but residents and visitors who 
come after us. 
</P>
<P>
 We now have the chance to do something beyond ourselves. It is time to shift 
our society's motivations from a narrow focus on city revenues and corporate 
profits to a wider, grander vision of what our community is about. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine Laguna Beach with resort hotels and gated communities crowded along 
the bluffs in place of Heisler Park and Main Beach. How sad that would be. How 
much greater if the Laguna's waterfront had miles of open space and parks, the 
way Chicago's lakefront is even today. That is so because Chicago's early 
leaders took a long-range view of their duty and responsibility to that city's 
citizens. Let Dana Point's early leaders be so inspired to listen to what the 
people want, to represent them in a truly visionary way, and to find a way to 
serve the community in its greatest sense. 
</P>
<P>
 A good start would be to find a way to preserve more of the Headlands for all 
to enjoy.

FOLLOWING DIFFERENT ROADS ON WHO SHOULD GET HIGHWAY WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Why is (Sen.) Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) allowed to use space in The 
Times (Commentary, "Caltrans Engineers to Contractors -- Our Way or the 
Highway," May 8) to promote and lobby for her special-interest groups? 
</P>
<P>
 While she normally spends her time with builders and big-time developers, this 
time she is concerned with the plight of the local engineering firms and their 
inability to bid on state jobs. Specifically, she mentions Robert Bein, William 
Frost & Associates, big-time entertainers for (former officials of the) Rancho 
Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Give me a break! Is Marian really concerned about the lack of jobs for our 
middle-class constituency, or is she once again pushing for her 
Mercedes-driving lackeys? 
</P>
<P>
 CLIFFORD A. CARD

<P>
 * I was very glad to read something I had wondered about since I arrived here 
three weeks ago. Why is Caltrans everywhere, and why don't I see private 
engineers and surveyors doing highway work? I'm a land surveyor and party chief 
from Hartford County, Md., and have worked in the private sector for 12 years. 
I agree with Sen. Bergeson, many private firms are more sufficient and in some 
cases more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford County and Maryland contract most work, although they reserve final 
approval. I can say from the surveying end that I accomplished with two people 
-- myself and an instrument man -- what the state needed four or more people to 
do and, in some cases, took longer. The private firms are used to scrambling 
for work and depend on a good reputation for getting more, thus are more 
streamlined, especially in communication between the office and field crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Open bidding for state contracts will help the economy and maybe get the roads 
open sooner. Maryland doesn't get many earthquakes but we did survive one 
severe winter, and private firms will be asked to help put some roads back in 
service or get improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, Sen. Bergeson, for your comments. It needed saying. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Desperate times require desperate measures. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the excuse used by those whose cause is almost lost. Frequently, the 
desperate measures include the big lie. State Sen. Marian Bergeson's ongoing 
effort to funnel tax dollars to private firms to work on state contracts 
without any competitive bidding is the latest example. 
</P>
<P>
 Many years ago, the people of this state overwhelmingly approved Article VII 
of the state Constitution. This created a merit civil service system, along 
with a body of work which the state government was assigned to perform to avoid 
a political spoils system which wastes money and invites corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past four years, the Wilson Administration, spearheaded by 
legislation authored by Sen. Bergeson, has given $600 million in state 
contracts, without any competitive bidding, to private firms to design our 
freeways and highways. Historically, this function has been performed by 
engineers employed by Caltrans at half the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Five times in the last four years the courts have told Gov. Wilson that these 
giveaway political patronage contracts violate the Constitution and the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Urged on by Sen. Bergeson, Gov. Wilson has ignored those court orders, 
continuing to waste tax money while his political appointees face contempt of 
court charges. However, the noose is finally tightening on these disgraceful, 
wasteful contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's frenzied reaction was to introduce a proposed constitutional 
amendment which would exempt Caltrans from the Constitution; draft legislation 
which would require government agencies to charge artificially high prices if 
they can do the job cheaper than a private company; and write articles to The 
Times which aren't even within hailing distance of the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to her assertion, the Constitution does not prohibit Caltrans from 
contracting with private firms to perform freeway design and construction 
inspection. It simply prohibits giveaway contracts at inflated rates while the 
governor reduces the Caltrans staff which should be performing the job. 
</P>

 Caltrans engineers have been designing our freeways for decades. They know how 
to do it cheaper, better and faster than private firms, many of which are based 
in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans currently has a hiring list of 2,500 California engineers waiting to 
be employed, but the governor is actually reducing Caltrans' staff so others 
can do its work. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40% of Caltrans' employees are minorities, a much higher percentage 
than private firms.

DISTRICT SHOULD TALK TO PARENTS ABOUT PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We are writing in regard to the recent article about the four La Habra 
students who were suspended for inappropriate behavior during an assembly 
("Students Start Drive to End Suspensions," May 10). We have some comments and 
some questions. 
</P>
<P>
 While we do understand the safety issue of "moshing (slam dancing)" and 
recognize that the students were first assigned detention, it seems to us that 
perhaps communicating with the parents would have prevented the need for the 
suspensions and subsequent arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Without all of the facts at our disposal, we ask: Was the demonstration a 
violent one? 
</P>
<P>
 Is not demonstration, including walking out of a class, a part of basic 
freedoms? Do students not have the right to peaceful assembly? If merely 
walking out of class and demonstrating warrants arrest, why weren't the Canyon 
High School students protesting with Orange Unified School District workers 
arrested? 
</P>
<P>
 It would appear that the administration may have overreacted and come 
perilously close to abuse of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiation by the principal does not have to be seen as "giving in." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools need to realize that just because they are considered surrogate 
parents while the students are in school, they cannot abrogate the student's 
personal rights.

RAMS SHOULD HAVE EARNED FAN LOYALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Georgia Frontiere's comment, "It's like planting corn; if you 
don't have fertile soil, how is anything going to grow?" ("Rams Owner May Sell 
Part of Team," May 9): If the Ram organization had used the ideology regarding 
the fans when they moved to Anaheim, just maybe all those fans they are looking 
for would be there today and would have been there through their lean and 
losing years. Sowing a good crop, feeding it and tending it during good times 
will support you through the rough and bad times. Granted, there are some 
fair-weather fans who will only support a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult for any fan to come out and support a losing team, but it has 
happened all over the league. It is not because those cities financially 
supported the franchise or because there are too many sports organizations in 
the area, it is because their public relations department and management has 
been astute enough to see the need for the team, as a whole, to become part of 
the city and to be available as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, the Dallas Cowboy owner along with the stadium has provided a 
sports center with large-screen TVs by the stadium for fans who can't afford a 
ticket for each game to view home games. Away games are also shown. After home 
games, the owner, Jerry Jones, along with coaches and players, shows up to 
express appreciation for the fans' support. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers conduct fan appreciation day during preseason so fans 
can see the new players and get autographs. Kansas City rewards season-ticket 
holders with the opportunity to sit in the owner's suite during one game for 
helping recruit new season ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Modell, owner of the Cleveland Browns, met with the Browns booster club in 
Los Angeles during one of the team's trips to the area. The San Francisco owner 
frequently meets in the parking lot prior to games to communicate with the 
fans. In a well-publicized turnaround, Chuck Knox turned the city of Buffalo on 
its ear and had all kinds of support from the fans during their lean years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Ram fan for 35-plus years and a season ticket-holder for 10 years, it 
would be a shame to see the Rams leave Anaheim, but if they do, their bad times 
are of their own making. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of wherever they go, they will surely try to plant the same 
cornfield by throwing corn seed to unfertilized earth and expect it to produce 
100 bushels of fans per acre. it may produce for a while, but as it has been in 
Anaheim the yield will wane again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there a chance for the Rams to stay in Anaheim?" is not the question. It 
should be: "What kind of public relations do the Rams need to revitalize an 
old, worn-out cotton field so it will produce a sustaining crop of fans again?"

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON POLITICS; COUNTY HAS BECOME MODEL OF REFORM 
BUT STILL HAS WORK TO DO; CITIZEN INTEREST IS THE KEY TO AVOIDING EXCESSES IN 
LOBBYING, CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND GIFT GIVING TO OFFICEHOLDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY GRINDLE, Shirley Grindle is chairman of the TINCUP Campaign Reform 
Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In March, 1977, the California Journal labeled Orange County the "Dirty Tricks 
Capital of California." Indeed, by late 1977, 43 politicians from Orange County 
(including three supervisors, the county assessor and two congressmen) had been 
indicted on various charges ranging from laundering of campaign contributions 
to using county employees as campaign workers on county time. Most of these 
indictments resulted in embarrassing resignations from office and prison terms 
for the more flagrant violators. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation was also just emerging from the Watergate scandal and Orange County 
residents were disgusted with the county supervisors who were unable and 
unwilling to clean up the out-of-control campaign system that got them elected 
to office. A cross-section of citizens formed a group, TIN CUP (Time Is Now, 
Clean Up Politics), to reform the system. The result was the adoption in 
December, 1978, of the county's first campaign finance ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The TIN CUP ordinance governed county supervisorial elections for more than 13 
years and was considered by many in the state to be uniquely effective in 
broadening the base of contributions, reducing the amount of money collected 
and spent in supervisorial elections and removing the pressure on developers 
for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1990, however, political action committees were prominent in federal 
elections, and several local unscrupulous developers in Orange County were 
forming their own PACs as a way to avoid the limitations of the TIN CUP 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The TIN CUP organization decided it was time to tighten up the original 
campaign ordinance to, among other things, prevent PACs from giving unlimited 
funds to county supervisors. This was done by creating a comprehensive campaign 
contribution limitation ordinance that applied not only to the county 
supervisors but to all the other elected county officials (sheriff-coroner, 
district attorney, tax collector, etc.) 
</P>
<P>
 This time a far more understanding Board of Supervisors (compared to the 1978 
board) willingly placed the new campaign ordinance on the ballot. When the 
final ballots were cast in June, 1992, more than 86% of the voters in Orange 
County approved the new TIN CUP II ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Orange County once again made headlines with the revelation that a 
county supervisor and several employees and officials of the Santa Margarita 
Water District were accepting gifts that were over the limit allowed by state 
law (and not reporting them as required) from individuals and companies that 
were either getting projects approved by the Board of Supervisors or were being 
awarded multimillion-dollar contracts with the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of Supervisor Don Roth, who resigned in disgrace in March, 1993, 
focused attention on the corruptive influence of gift giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the resignation of Roth, the TIN CUP organization, along 
with Orange County Common Cause (the local chapter of the nationwide campaign 
reform organization) requested the Board of Supervisors to enact a ban on gifts 
that would put an end to the insidious acceptance of gifts by county employees 
and elected officials. Much to everyone's surprise, the Board of Supervisors 
agreed and a gift ban ordinance was subsequently enacted in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Free trips to local resort areas, free golf club memberships, expensive wining 
and dining at Orange County's most exclusive restaurants and free tickets to 
sporting events and local entertainment centers are no longer part of the perks 
of county government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is to be commended for adopting the first gift ban 
ordinance in California and for acknowledging publicly what the public has 
always known -- that the wining and dining of government officials is a 
practice that casts doubt on the credibility of government decisions and 
contract awards, and destroys confidence in our political system by reinforcing 
the public's view that government officials are on the take. 
</P>
<P>
 The third act of "cleansing" Orange County politics was the board's passage, 
albeit reluctantly, of a code of ethics in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important part of these policies and guidelines is the "revolving 
door" provision that prevents a former county employee or official from 
returning to lobby county officials within one year. 
</P>
<P>
 This provision was considered crucial in reducing insider influence of former 
aides to the supervisors, who return as lobbyists hired by developers, 
architects and engineers who need a project approved or who are seeking a 
contract award. 
</P>
<P>
 Most county observers would agree that many of the publicly funded major 
contracts awarded in the past 10 years have been substantially influenced by 
those lobbyists, who have great contacts with board offices (former aides). A 
number of local civil engineering and architectural firms still believe it is 
impossible to win a sizable contract in Orange County without hiring a 
lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still many things left to do in Orange County -- political reform is 
a never-ending process of citizen participation. 
</P>
<P>
 We are fortunate in Orange County to have three major citizen reform groups 
(TIN CUP, Common Cause, League of Women Voters) that work together to keep 
local politics clean. Obviously there are many tasks ahead of us.  
</P>
<P>
 Here is the game plan for the remainder of the decade: 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage major cities in Orange County to adopt the TIN CUP II ordinance. 
(The cities of Anaheim, Orange, Huntington Beach and Laguna Beach have already 
enacted TIN CUP II. Irvine and Tustin are considering adoption of the 
ordinance).  
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage all Orange County cities and special districts to ban acceptance 
of gifts from those doing business with their agencies. (Santa Ana is the first 
city in Orange County to adopt the county's gift ban ordinance; Tustin is 
considering a gift ban ordinance for its appointed and elected officials.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish citizen watchdogs to monitor campaign contributions in cities that 
have a TIN CUP II ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage the Board of Supervisors, the Orange County Transportation 
Authority and the Transportation Corridor Agencies to enact contract bidding 
and award procedures for publicly funded contracts that remove the lobbyists 
from the contract award process. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the efforts of reform groups, Orange County is now a leader in 
political reform, not the butt of political jokes. However, the success in 
maintaining this leadership and enacting the above reforms is based solely on 
citizen participation -- your participation.

PREACHING PRAGMATISM ON THE BOLSA CHICA DEVELOPMENT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial "Bolsa Chica Plan Must Strive for Balance" (May 15) correctly 
states the key issue surrounding most developments: developer rights versus 
preservation of the environment. But shouldn't the "pragmatic negotiations" 
start with factual representations of the issues, and doesn't your paper have 
an obligation to discover and print those facts, even on its editorial page? 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard for me to understand then why you would include a picture of already 
restored wetlands in the state's Ecological Reserve with the caption "Koll Co. 
plans to build homes at Bolsa Chica." How many hundreds of people now believe 
that homes will be constructed on top of these wetlands? The vast majority of 
the homes are proposed to be constructed on the bluffs, overlooking what used 
to be wetlands but are now oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll has agreed to restore these wetlands in exchange for entitlement. Why 
didn't your caption read "this is what the wetlands will look like after Koll 
is complete" or include a picture of the oil fields with the caption "this is 
what the wetlands in question look like today?" 
</P>
<P>
 KEN MEDDOCK

</P>
<P>
 * I was astonished that your editorial on the Bolsa Chica failed to recognize 
the potential for a land swap to be a win-win solution and a way to preserve 
one of the state's last remaining wetland ecosystems. This habitat is a 
precious resource that Orange County should be fighting to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Land swaps are not new -- in fact they have been successfully negotiated to 
preserve other critical habitats. The idea has real merit because the tax 
dollars for acquisition are scarce, but government land holdings are plentiful. 
And, contrary to your assertion, much of the government-owned land which might 
be feasible for trade is not polluted. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed land swap should not come as a surprise to the Koll Co. as it was 
first suggested to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt nearly a year ago at a 
forum where Koll representatives were present. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, taking private land for public use, with just compensation to the 
landholder, is authorized by the 5th Amendment. In many cases, the courts have 
upheld regulations prohibiting development on wetlands without any compensation 
paid at all. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Perspective of May 15 was correct in its conclusion about 
a "pragmatic negotiation and careful land-use planning" for the Bolsa Chica, 
but the facts were misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The article made it seem that the Koll Co. had a pristine area to build on. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts are that: 
</P>
<P>
 There is an earthquake fault running right through the middle of the 400 acres 
they are planning on developing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400 acres are the burial site of indigenous people. One of 26 unreported 
human remains in the EIR was 8,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 400 "cogstones" have been found on the mesa. More were found here than 
anyplace in the world. Koll is one of seven other owners of record for the 
Bolsa Chica. They are not the sole owner. 
</P>
<P>
 It is zoned agricultural and Koll doesn't have one permit to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica should be kept as a biodiversity park for generations to come. 
It should not be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's Save It, Don't Pave It. Trade or buy them out. This is our last chance. 
</P>
<P>
 EILEEN MURPHY 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Development rights is one of the phrases in a Times editorial about Koll 
Real Estate Group's proposed massive development of the Bolsa Chica. Excuse me, 
maybe I missed something, but what gives an owner of land that is zoned 
agricultural the right to build anything on it? 
</P>
<P>
 The landowner acquired the land at low cost that reflected the agricultural 
zoning in speculation that one day it would be rezoned, which would 
dramatically increase the value of the land. Now the speculator wants the 
rezoning to occur to allow the proposed massive development. 
</P>
<P>
 This is understandable. But in no way does the owner have the right to have 
the land rezoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group is a speculator, pure and simple, and while some 
speculators win their gamble, others do not. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Bolsa Chica the rights belong to the public, not to the 
landowner. The public has the right, through its elected representatives, the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors, to say enough is enough. We cannot allow 
every square inch of land to be paved over and built on, which is what will 
happen if we do not draw the line. 
</P>
<P>
 And what better place to draw that line and to preserve an area for present 
and future generations to enjoy than the Bolsa Chica, 1,700 acres of coastal 
open space comprising mesas, lowlands and nearly 1,000 acres of wetlands.

ROLLER HOCKEY DESERVES PLAYING AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Orange County roller-hockey players deserve our support. It is time that we 
get the kids off the streets and onto their own roller-hockey facilities.These 
kids should not have to go around place to place looking to have a fun game of 
roller hockey.  
</P>
<P>
 "The police come out and tell us to leave, the principals come out and tell us 
to leave," says Brian Fletcher, 17, who plays for a junior team. Mission Viejo 
roller-hockey coach Mike Dashefsky says, "It's not like baseball, where the 
poor kid in right field plays two innings and might see a fly ball 
occasionally. We have line shifts, put new kids on the floor every two or three 
minutes. Everybody plays, and that's the great thing about roller hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 This to me sounds like what every parent wants their child to learn. We should 
not be taking away their only places to play. 
</P>
<P>
 They need our support, not our chasing them away.

FOOD DONATIONS BRIGHTEN DAY

 * Thank you Laguna Hills! 
</P>
<P>
 In the 13 years I've been a letter carrier here, I've never enjoyed my job as 
much as I did on Saturday, May 14. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day I saw firsthand the generosity you people showed by leaving your 
non-perishable goods at your mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 In our office alone, I saw large hampers full of food, at least enough to fill 
a large semitrailer. And that's just our office! 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine how much food was donated to our food banks in our communities from 
Long Beach to San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never seen such teamwork. What a major accomplishment!

NORMALCY STILL FAR OFF AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Are you back to normal?" is the question that I most often get now that 
it's been four months since our big earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard the question in San Luis Obispo and Pasadena. I heard it in Orange 
County and in Austin, Tex. It's a frustrating question for those of us who live 
in the quake area, because telling the truth feels like whining. Sometimes I 
just answer "yes" because the person would never understand anyway. There is no 
normalcy and there won't be for a long time, but people outside the area have 
no idea what I mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you back to normal?" The question reveals how far removed the rest of the 
world is from us. I had not understood the meaning of alienation before Jan. 
17, even though that was the theme song of the '60s, when I was in college. But 
now I understand alienation. My relatives don't understand. My neighbors 
outside of the quake area don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you back to normal?" It's as if the question is a hope, so they can quit 
worrying about us. The truth is, there is no one who would like to be back to 
normal more than those of us whose lives have been disrupted. We would like to 
be able to go back to those favorite shopping areas and restaurants that we 
used to haunt, but they aren't there anymore. We would like to get in our car 
and drive according to habits rather than to have to think about each trip and 
the likely detours. We would like to quit looking at cracked plaster, broken 
bricks, hanging ceilings and soft insulation. Most of all, we would like to be 
with our friends who have moved away. Some have died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you back to normal?" I know it's a question of hope, and I know that it 
is meant well, but it only reinforces the gulf between us. If someone would 
only say, "I wish you were back to normal." Then I would know that they 
understand.

<P>
 * I am disappointed there has not been more coverage of the 3rd District 
county supervisor election in your newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, The Times endorsed Don Wallace for supervisor. Where is the 
coverage of the June 7 election? I just know we will all soon be inundated with 
mail and glossy photos of what's-his-name telling what a great job he has done. 
Do you feel safe in Los Angeles? I don't feel safe, and I don't want the county 
of Los Angeles turning into the city of Los Angeles.

REALIZING GANGBANGING HAS NO FUTURE; A VALLEY STREET TRUCE OFFERS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO FIND PEACEFUL ALTERNATIVES TO GANG LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Truces that reduce the violence between rival street gangs do have something 
of a positive impact on the general citizenry, but it is a limited one. When 
heavily armed street crews have it out for one another, for example, the 
drive-by shootings increase the likelihood that bystanders will be killed or 
wounded and that innocents will be further harmed in cases of mistaken 
identity. Similarly, a calming of the gang wars means that fewer citizens are 
cowering in their homes at night due to the inelegant rhapsody of nearby 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a caveat attached to gang truces, such as the one that has held 
between street gangs in the Valley since October. Sometimes, the "peace" allows 
them to concentrate on preying on the public. And one must be very wary of 
gangbangers turned peacemakers, because appearances can be deceiving. The 
recent case of a Watts gang warlord who gained national attention in such 
fashion is a case in point. It is now widely suspected that the gang leader -- 
now dead -- was also furthering his criminality: in gambling, drug sales and 
street shakedowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley gang truce and the somewhat decreased tensions with the police it 
has produced represents, at its best, an opportunity. It's a chance to reach 
into the membership of those gangs. It's a chance to try to get them to leave 
the gang life behind altogether. LAPD Officer Angel Munoz and ex-officer Hector 
Rodriquez should be commended for doing exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to them, a street gang that had once terrorized an apartment complex on 
Hayvenhurst Avenue in Van Nuys returned there recently. This time, the 
gangbangers were armed with brooms. They came to clean up an area they had once 
tagged unmercifully and claimed as their turf. "This is fantastic," said 
Rodriguez, who now manages the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for this work, Munoz has agreed to help find honest jobs for the 
gang members. "They're starting to realize that gangbanging has no future," 
Munoz said. The goal has to be to persuade many others to face that fact.

THE CHOICE IS YOURS, BUT IT WON'T BE EASY; SCHOOL VISITS, ACCOUNTABILITY 
REPORTS CAN HELP PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We applauded the Los Angeles Unified School District when last summer it 
finally embraced changes that offered more academic opportunities for students. 
One such step -- launched at seven Sylmar schools -- was public school choice. 
Open enrollment will now be an option in at least 350 schools around the 
district this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Choice within the public schools is a reasonable idea whose time has come. It 
replaces a system that essentially limited choice to those hoping to attend 
magnet schools, and to those parents who were willing to endure a lengthy 
permit process. But school choice is not a painless, magic bullet. We have some 
thoughts on how to view it, and on how to best take advantage of the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the availability of 22,000 open seats in various schools may seem 
substantial, but it represents less than 3.5% of the classroom space in the 
district. There are just 9,100 open seats in the participating Los Angeles 
Unified schools in the San Fernando Valley. Preference may also be given to 
those parents who had already placed their children on a school's waiting list 
under the far more limited transfer program of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Such space constraints put a premium on timely action by parents interested in 
shopping around for better schools. If you wait until the June 13 application 
deadline, you're likely to be left without much choice. It will pay to find out 
as much as possible about prospective schools, as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lightfoot of Canoga Park is going about it in ideal fashion. He has 
already been out, making the rounds at likely schools in Woodland Hills, near 
his wife's office. "One school wasn't well-kept, there didn't seem to be anyone 
to answer our questions, we were looking all over the place for the office and 
no one noticed us," Lightfoot told a reporter in reference to a school that is 
no longer high on his shopping list. 
</P>
<P>
 That part about Lightfoot looking at schools convenient to a parent's 
workplace also spotlights a matter that parents should consider closely. Magnet 
school students are transported to their new schools by the district. That 
won't be provided for students transferring to new schools through the choice 
program. This will be a big hurdle to poor parents, and to anyone who may be 
facing long commutes. Schools that are the most convenient, or the least 
inconvenient, ought to be higher on your list. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you say you're just too busy to follow Lightfoot's example of site visits? 
And the schools you might want to consider might not be able to afford a $400 
newspaper ad touting their attributes? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 state law has mandated so-called "Accountability Report Cards" on every 
school. They have been available in the district since 1990, but few parents 
request copies. The report cards assess a school's academic performance, class 
sizes, teacher assignments, instruction, curriculum, teacher evaluations, 
attendance, dropout rates, and more. The report cards provide an excellent and 
low-cost way to quickly obtain information about individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have also heard that your options are limited for joining schools that 
are already undergoing major reforms. True, but not entirely so. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham, Chatsworth, Kennedy and Taft high schools -- all of which are in 
the Valley -- are part of the district's site-based management reforms. These 
campuses have been given greater autonomy over everyday operations and have 
shown dramatic improvement in reducing dropout and truancy rates. There is 
considerable space at all four, ranging from 150 seats at Kennedy to 600 seats 
at Taft. A team of students from the latter recently distinguished itself by 
winning the U.S. Academic Decathlon, a respected, national scholastic 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Choice is hardly a panacea for the district's many ills, but it is still a 
worthy and necessary option.

FOR COMEDIANS, TIMING IS EVERYTHING; UNDERSTANDABLY, THIS COMIC'S STUNT DIDN'T 
SIT WELL WITH BURBANK FIRE OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the best stand-up comics keep abreast of current events. It can help 
maintain a timely edge in their humor, and it can dissuade them from pulling 
really, really dumb stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Los Angeles, for example, which sat uneasily at the heart of a six-county 
conflagration zone last October/November that resulted in $1 billion in damages 
and $100 million in firefighting costs. Well, May is the month in which the 
firefighters start warning us about ways to prevent such matters. . .and it was 
the month that comedian Bob Goldthwait decided to set fire to the guest chair 
on "The Tonight Show" in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad career move. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather predictably, the stunt angered Burbank fire officials, and now 
Goldthwait has been charged with unlawfully causing a fire and possession of 
something flammable with the intent to burn property. Both are misdemeanors.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait has apologized through his manager. But we have 10 better ways in 
which he might make amends (with apologies to David Letterman): 
</P>
<P>
 10) Switch to decaf. 
</P>
<P>
 9) Volunteer to clean portable toilets at the next Southern California 
Firefighter Combat Challenge competition. 
</P>
<P>
 8) Submit to sitting through every minute of every meeting of the Burbank City 
Council for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Offer to take over Mayor Riordan's joke writing for the same period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Submit to a makeover on the Regis and Kathie Lee show. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Offer to spend a week as a hood ornament on a Burbank City Fire Department 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Offer to play the role of a fire hydrant in the non-animated remake of "101 
Dalmatians." 
</P>
<P>
 3) Commit to bring his own chair to any interviews with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Promise to not apply for a job with the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Take voice lessons.

SINGLE-PAYER PLAN IS NEEDED FOR HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Dr. Melvin Kirschner's commentary " 'Managed Care' Takes Decisions Out of 
the Doctor's Hands" (May 8) is right on the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies have set up a huge new bureaucracy of managers between 
patients and their doctors.This bureaucracy is not only costly, it removes 
decision-making from the doctors' hands while limiting a patient's freedom of 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirschner stops short of recommending what many doctors and patients are 
recognizing as the best solution to our health care crisis: the single-payer 
plan. With this plan, doctors remain in private practice and patients have 
complete freedom to choose their provider. Everyone is insured and has the same 
comprehensive benefits plan. The insurance companies and their myriad different 
plans, forms and bureaucrats are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is "the single payer," paying everyone's health care costs from 
tax revenues. Yes, taxes go up, but health insurance premiums are eliminated, 
and most people would save money. Health care costs are controlled because fair 
costs are negotiated between the government and health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that a majority of Americans favor the single-payer plan, which 
insurance companies are spending millions of our health insurance premium 
dollars to defeat in Congress.

ULTRASOUND HASN'T BEEN PROVEN SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The story "Baby's First Screen Test" (Valley Life, March 11) misled the 
public about the perceived safety of ultrasound radiation exposure to fetus and 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ultrasound is used frequently during pregnancy to assess a 
complication, there are many unanswered safety questions regarding routine 
exposure of the fetus to these high-energy sound waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the International 
Childbirth Education Assn. and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have 
stated that it is advisable to use ultrasound only when medically indicated and 
not as a routine procedure during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Your story quoted one private physician, Fred Schaeffner, regarding the issue 
of safety. It seems irresponsible to have researched the risks no further. 
</P>
<P>
 Using ultrasound strictly for the pleasure of parents viewing their unborn 
baby is a new use of this technology. It is premature to say ultrasound is not 
risky. Research is being carried out to determine the short-term and long-term 
effects of fetal exposure to ultrasound waves.  
</P>
<P>
 While scanning to assess a potential complication of pregnancy may possibly 
outweigh the potential risks of ultrasound, I believe we have a lot to learn 
about this form of radiation exposure before we can casually use it to make 
videos of our children.

MICOR EDITORIAL DIDN'T CONSIDER ALL FACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial "Calabasas Needs to Follow the Blueprint" (April 17), about 
the Micor development, didn't count all the factors that affected the 
"blueprint" for our city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Micor project was excluded by the county's Local Agency Formation 
Commission from the original Calabasas boundaries and was destined for county 
control and typical treatment within the land-use plan (variously calculated at 
between 600-plus dwellings and 81 units, depending on who was figuring). 
</P>
<P>
 This is the county that entertained the adjacent Baldwin Co. project of 2,200 
units, 1.6 million feet of commercial space and a $66-million road through the 
Palo Comado Significant Ecological Area. They ultimately created a development 
agreement that allowed nearly six times the county General Plan density. 
Typical county approvals in Calabasas were six to 10 times General Plan 
allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 We also faced another incorporation denial, as in 1988, if the word 
"moratorium" was even hinted. Plus, history has shown that a moratorium until 
the adoption of a new general plan results in lawsuits from impacted property 
owners and the cost of millions in defense. Calabasas has been creative in 
averting showdowns by sidestepping a moratorium, by enacting significant 
environmental mitigation in the annexation of Micor (including 630 acres of 
wildlife habitat), and by the hard work of Calabasas city staff, the council 
and our citizen volunteers. Calabasas didn't sue to contradict the city. And, 
contrary to The Times' editorial, "cost to the taxpayers" is mischaracterized, 
because litigation costs over this development are to be reimbursed by the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope The Times is aware that the California Legislature created legislation 
that allows a newly incorporated city to process applications for development 
in accordance with its "anticipated" general plan in order to obtain local 
control. The issue of local control is of course one of the primary reasons for 
becoming a city. In this most recent case cited by The Times, the judge did not 
rule on the merits of the Micor project but rather disagreed with the 
legislation adopted by the California Legislature and signed into law by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 This decision was so unanticipated that the author of the law, Assemblywoman 
Dominic L. Cortese, submitted a letter to the California Supreme Court 
requesting that it hear the appeal of this case because the lower court had 
"misconstrued" the applicable state statutes. Even Superior Court Judge Diane 
Wayne, quoted in your editorial, prefaced her ruling with the statement that if 
she would have been the original judge hearing this matter, she would probably 
not have ruled in the same manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas has the trust of its citizens as it continues to strive for the 
goals set in the original incorporation process, to maintain local control and 
to diligently build its general plan. Portions of the draft general plan have 
already been recognized as being in the forefront of sensitivity to the 
environment, preservation of open space and respect for all living things.

CALTRANS DID NOT SPEND TAX MONEY ON A PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On April 21, you ran an article titled "Party Planned to Build Bridge with 
Neighbors," listing Caltrans as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing to reassure your readers that Caltrans does not spend taxpayer 
dollars on parties.Californians have the right to expect their tax money to be 
spent wisely and appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, as administrator of the freeway and state highway systems in 
California, uses this revenue strictly on new projects or repair and upkeep of 
our existing system.  
</P>
<P>
 If a state contractor wishes to host an event to say thank you to a community 
for its patience while work was in progress, that is commendable. But it is 
between the contractor and the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans also is committed to being a considerate neighbor by striving to 
minimize any impact our work may have on a community. 
</P>
<P>
 When we are unable to do that -- as in the case of residents living adjacent 
to the rebuilding of the earthquake-damaged Santa Monica and Simi Valley 
freeways -- Caltrans provided temporary hotel accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 What Caltrans could not do was pay residents to stay in their homes while 
freeway work was under way. If anyone along the Santa Monica Freeway 10 
misunderstood our position, then on behalf of Caltrans, I apologize.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; 2 SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT EMERGE FROM CLAS DEBATE; ONLY FEELINGS 
THIS TEST IS GENERATING ARE FRUSTRATION AND ANGER. IT IS SECRETIVE, SUBJECTIVE 
AND INVASIVE, AND THOROUGHLY INEFFECTIVE AS AN EVALUATION TOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE KEMP HUMMEL, Anne Kemp Hummel of Northridge is a former elementary 
school science teacher and a former executive director of Discovery Pavilion, a 
proposed children's science museum. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been almost a year since I started clipping newspaper articles about 
the California Learning Assessment System. When my daughter's sample test came 
home recently, I concluded that I had no choice but to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 So, to actual questions found in the CLAS language arts sample test, here are 
one mother's actual answers: 
</P>
<P>
 * What feelings do you have about what is happening in the story?  
</P>
<P>
 Frustration and anger. Our kids are being given a controversial test that 
virtually no one is allowed to examine. Parents pass around worn test samples; 
students swap their own tales about the contents. Most lawmakers are not 
permitted to see what they are voting to fund. Critics are all accused by the 
state Department of Education of spreading misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tell us anything else about your understanding of this story -- what it 
means to you, what it makes you think about in your own life, or anything that 
relates to your reading of it?  
</P>
<P>
 One 10th-grade sample test has a story by Kate Chopin about a woman who, after 
hearing that her husband has died in an accident, whispers to herself, "Free! 
Body and soul free!" Later, when the woman sees her husband walk into the 
house, she herself dies "of joy that kills." 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean to the mind of a 10th-grader? One sample "high-range 
performance" answer says, "I think that maybe her husband had . . . limited her 
life to suit him. For this reason I'm glad she can finally be free. Did he beat 
her?" 
</P>
<P>
 I relate to this question by asking whether literature is supposed to be 
directly related to the reader's life. Of course great literature is built on 
powerful themes. But how much of it is "about" our lives -- particularly if we 
are in the 10th grade? 
</P>
<P>
 Is its direct relevance to our lives a measure of its quality as literature? 
And how can we abandon our children in a challenging literary world without 
meaningful context or guidance? 
</P>
<P>
 * Select a line that interests you or makes you think. Then tell why you chose 
that line.  
</P>
<P>
 I chose a quote from the Department of Education's own description of CLAS: 
"Since the construction of meaning is the essence of both reading and writing, 
the new assessment allows students to shape the outcome rather than to identify 
correct meanings that test makers have posited." 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS is repeatedly called a test with rigorous standards. Look at what it 
doesn't ask. It doesn't ask about plot, structure, conflict, cause and effect, 
climax or resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't ask about character development, context, point of view or 
dialogue. It doesn't ask about the author's descriptions, technique, rhythm, 
vocabulary or use of language. 
</P>
<P>
 It asks for thoughts and feelings and questions. How long does it take for 
kids to figure out that having thoughts, feelings and questions is a lot easier 
than actually knowing something? This is rigorous? This is better than 
"mindless" multiple-choice tests? This is reform? 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is a major shift in educational philosophy away from gaining 
knowledge to "constructing meaning through transactions with the text." 
</P>
<P>
 * Below is an "open mind" drawing of the main character's head. If you could 
look into his (or her) mind, what thoughts and feelings might you find?  
</P>
<P>
 Let's look into the mind of the educators and politicians behind this fiasco. 
Frankly, I don't think there's much here to analyze. I'll just leave this 
drawing empty. Empty of understanding of what constitutes a quality education. 
Empty of concern for parents' rights. Empty of intellectual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Share your ideas with your group. Be sure everyone has a chance to share.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the students are asked to discuss their thoughts and feelings in a group 
before completing their final essay. In the true CLAS spirit, I shared my 
thoughts and feelings in a meeting of parents concerned about the future of 
education. We weren't "well-organized" or "well-financed" as those critical of 
CLAS have been described. We were just parents who cared less about what our 
kids feel than what they know. 
</P>
<P>
 * Write what you think is going to happen next.  
</P>
<P>
 I think that the CLAS test will fail. Not only is it secretive, subjective and 
invasive, but it is thoroughly ineffective as an evaluation tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the studies proving CLAS will achieve the "valid, reliable, 
individual" results its makers proclaim? How can each teacher-grader possibly 
examine our children's individual "meaningful encounters" with consistency, 
accuracy, impartiality and undivided attention? 
</P>
<P>
 The "rigorous standards" of CLAS are not keeping our kids up at night. There 
were no sweaty palms and upset tummies at my house. One student quoted in a 
news story was more concerned about his PE final -- "We gotta run the mile 
today. Everyone's pretty nervous. We have to do our personal best." 
</P>
<P>
 Gee. "Personal best" is such an old-fashioned concept. Couldn't they share the 
mile? Why a mile ? Why not let them run 10 yards and then talk about it for 
four minutes?

VALLEY COMMENTARY; OUR SUSPICIOUS MINDS; NEIGHBORHOOD WATCHERS KNOW YOU CAN'T

 Maybe I'm in a state of denial about crime. It does seem to be something that 
happens to the other guy, the people who aren't careful, the people who live in 
bad neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I could be wrong -- but the blood-soaked Los Angeles, the Sarajevo west 
that I read about and see on TV, just doesn't seem to be the one I live in. 
</P>
<P>
 I have an uncle who lives in South-Central Los Angeles in a quiet, well-kept, 
family oriented neighborhood. Whenever I hear news stories about how bad crime 
is in South-Central, I remind myself that those stories are referring to "the 
other South-Central" and not the neighborhood where my uncle lives. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently read the crime statistics that listed North Hills as one of the 
Valley's hot spots. My North Hills? No, I assumed, the hot spot must be "the 
other North Hills." I keep listening for the small-arms fire; I just can't hear 
any. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I haven't gone looking. I am one of the Neighborhood Watch block 
captains for my area, casting a suburban dragnet for suspicious activity. I've 
sought to know the awful underside of society, like the old television cop Joe 
Friday. But this is the best I can do. 
</P>
<P>
 My log: 
</P>
<P>
 September, 1993. I was working the Neighborhood Watch, and neighbors and I 
watched suspicious activity inside cars parked in front of several vacant lots. 
The cars would be parked for long periods of time. The windows would be fogged 
up. We had watched "Cops," and we know prostitution when we saw it. I wrote to 
the captain of the police Devonshire Division explaining the situation. The 
police made extra patrols through the area for a month. Investigation revealed 
no prostitutes. Inside the parked cars were married couples , evidently trying 
to add excitement to their love lives. What ever happened to the drive-in? 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 14, 1994. I finished two days' surveillance of a neighbor's home. Cars 
would pull up, and people would get out of the cars and go into the house. 
After 10 minutes they would come out carrying brown bags. They would be 
smiling. The people were all dressed similarly. Men had bandannas hanging from 
their pockets or around their necks -- gang colors? I spoke with the property 
owner's next-door neighbor, whom I knew. Suspicions were unfounded. It turned 
out the couple sells square dance music to callers and dancers. Call off the 
K-9 unit. 
</P>
<P>
 March 9, 1994. Graffiti had been appearing regularly on a wall in the 
neighborhood, a sign of gang activity. My wife suggested that we move. She 
said, "Next thing you know, some gang's name will get crossed out, and then 
there will be a shooting." A neighbor had been painting it over. When he was 
unable to do it one weekend, I took over for him, and I couldn't believe what I 
read. "Romeo luvs Teresa" . . . "Bobby U R stupd" . . . "Carmen has dog breath" 
. . . "Scool Sucks." We didn't need the SWAT team. We needed a spelling 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 April, 1994. My next-door neighbor and his wife had always seemed too quiet. 
They would keep to themselves. They waved whenever we made eye contact, but 
mostly they appeared to avoid it. I'd seen those news broadcasts -- the dead 
bodies always turn up in the quiet people's home. The earthquake damaged a wall 
that we shared, and we had to talk to one another. It turned out that they were 
. . . very nice, actually . . . just quiet. Cancel that call to "Hard Copy." 
</P>
<P>
 April 27, 1994. Burglar alarm! It was a live "burglar alarm" in my back yard 
-- my dog, earning its keep at last. We'd had the dog since 1990, when we got 
him and a bunch of deadbolts to secure our premises. He had proved to be an 
excellent deterrent. He stayed in the back yard with a sign that said, "Le 
Chien Mechant." In French that means Mean Dog. Now he was barking his head off, 
as if someone was in the back yard who had no business there. My wife and I 
investigated. She led, carrying the flashlight, and I kept one hand on my 
portable phone. Investigation revealed that a neighbor had bought four chickens 
that were walking around in his yard. Police chopper not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 I could tell you about the time my wife whacked a possum on the head because 
he got too close to the dog, but I have to save something for "Real Stories of 
the Highway Patrol." 
</P>
<P>
 If you watch hard enough, everyone becomes a suspect. A woman across the 
street rides her bike for an hour every afternoon, up and down the 
neighborhood. Just up and down the block, smiling and waving. She says she's 
exercising. 
</P>
<P>
 Just be careful, ma'am. Your neighbors are on watch.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; 2 SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT EMERGE FROM CLAS DEBATE; THE EXAM IS 
THE FIRST ONE WHICH ACKNOWLEDGES THAT FEELINGS ARE A PART OF CRITICAL THINKING 
SKILLS. ANALYZING LITERATURE IS NOT A CLINICAL SKILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DAVIS, Chris Davis is a teacher at Crescenta Valley High School in 
Glendale. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers, administrators and students breathed a collective sigh of relief 
once the 10th-grade California Learning Assessment System exams were packed 
back into their boxes and shipped out of our school's classroom until next 
year. That is, if there is a next year, considering all of the controversy 
surrounding CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 I look with skepticism upon anything which takes two weeks away from an 
already fast-moving school year. We have great literature to discuss and write 
about. That's the real business of English classes: reading great literature, 
discussing its impact on our world and ourselves, showing our ideas in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is also what the English CLAS test is about, and this is why I 
believe the state should continue it. It is the first test that really tests 
what English classes ought to be doing. While teaching "to the test" sounds 
like poor pedagogy, good teachers do teach to the test because good teaching is 
directed by what students are expected to know. 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe your children need to know the difference between a dependent 
clause and an independent clause, then their achievement test should ask them 
to identify the two kinds of clauses. This can be simply done using a 
true-false or multiple-choice test. 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe your children need to know how to read critically, identify an 
author's point of view, determine the author's meaning, share their ideas with 
others and write about their interpretations, then the test must ask students 
to read, discuss and write. This can be done only using an assessment such as 
CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 I teach English because as a student I had teachers who valued my verbal and 
written interpretations more than my ability to distinguish any of the various 
arcane rules of English. The real world has never asked me to explain what a 
mixed modifier is, but it has asked me to justify my ideas in verbal and 
written form. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS is the first statewide assessment program which asks our children to read 
with care and write with persuasion. The real world cares about how well we can 
make sense of complex ideas and explain or apply them in oral and written form. 
Teachers must teach students how to do this, and CLAS pushes them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are wrong when they argue that CLAS' primary function is to test 
feelings. However, feelings do serve a function on CLAS and in class. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS asks students to react to the literature they read in all the ways I 
expect my students in my classes to respond to literature: intellectually, 
socially and emotionally. None of these responses function independently of the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 When my 10th-graders reach the conclusion of John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and 
Men," they react in various ways to the tragic conclusion. Some express shock, 
some dismay. Still others see it as inevitable and commend the character George 
for doing something that he had to do. Their initial reactions usually find 
their basis in their feelings, not in their intellect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once my students begin writing about the novella, they use their initial 
emotional response to help determine the central issues in the text. The ideas 
of love, friendship and loyalty don't arise out of a solely intellectual 
response to the work. Unless the reader gets emotionally attached to Lennie and 
George, Steinbeck's most powerful ideas never arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Feelings form an integral part of a classroom where students read and analyze 
literature. Humans can't read "Romeo and Juliet," "Great Expectations" or "To 
Kill a Mockingbird" without experiencing some emotional connection. We get 
angry at the Motagues and Capulets for putting family pride above their 
children. We feel sadness for Pip as he pursues a love of coldness. We feel 
pride in Atticus' noble defense of a black man doomed by hatred and ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS language arts test is the first California state test which 
acknowledges that feelings are a part of critical thinking skills. Analyzing 
literature is not a clinical skill where one diagrams a sentence, counts the 
number of passive-voice sentence constructions and records the answer on a 
computer form. Analyzing literature requires the use of feelings to get inside 
the author's mind, determine meaning and critique style. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS' primary function is not to test students' feelings. It is to get 
students to use their feelings about the literature to develop critical 
analysis of the issues in the text. All Californians should want the next 
generation to think and write critically. The language arts CLAS pushes 
students to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I fear that the voices of a powerful few will force education back to 
a multiple-choice mentality that relegates critical thinking to narrowing down 
your answer to A or B or C. 
</P>
<P>
 This will happen only if the state lets it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 California educators have developed a necessary and valid means of assessing 
students' thinking, reading and writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the state built this test around secrecy. In so doing it has created 
a monster that can consume CLAS. Critics would see this demise as a victory for 
family values and back-to-basics education. I would see it as a tragedy.

TENNIS / ELLIOTT ALMOND; BETTER JUDGMENT NEEDED FROM THE ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sad, sordid affair of Jennifer Capriati, former tennis prodigy, should not 
come as a surprise. Not when future tennis stars are treated like deities 
before they reach puberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing solid ground strokes and good hand-eye coordination is fine, but 
the Nick Bollettieris and Stefano and Denise Capriatis of the tennis world 
might consider character development for the next one to come along. 
</P>
<P>
 And that takes time, like the aging of a fine wine. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Capriati was rushed onto the professional circuit at 13, and because 
we embrace new faces, she was an instant media and fan hit. She did not let us 
down, becoming the youngest player to win a match at Wimbledon, and the 
youngest Grand Slam semifinalist in the French Open. She also reached the 
Wimbledon semifinals in 1991 and won an Olympic gold medal by defeating Steffi 
Graf in 1992 at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has made more headlines away from the courts. She played her 
last match in August, and before this week was in another time zone from her 
public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Many chuckled when she was arrested last December for shoplifting a $10 ring. 
She claimed she forgot she was wearing it when she walked out of the Florida 
store. It was an acceptable excuse from a millionaire child. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week's arrest for possession of fewer than 20 grams of marijuana, and 
her subsequent admission into a Miami Beach drug treatment facility have more 
ominous overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, 18, who is believed to be estranged from her parents, reportedly 
spent a wild weekend in Coral Gables, Fla., with new-found friends. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Mark Black, told reporters he did not know she was a tennis star after an 
all-night party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she was this girl Jennifer having a great time," he said, adding 
that Capriati later told him she simply wanted to be normal. 
</P>
<P>
 If that means experiencing growing pains, the Capriatis are getting all the 
normal they could want. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think we're seeing here is a teen-ager who is going to learn, who is 
learning, how to exercise good judgment," said John Ross, Capriati's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the world also has witnessed is poor judgment by adults who surround 
her. That's not to say Capriati is not responsible for her foibles, but with 
agents, attorneys, coaches and parents thinking more of dollar signs than 
maturation, it is a wonder she lasted four years as a successful pro. 
</P>
<P>
 She will be missed in the French Open, opening Monday at Roland Garros Stadium 
with a vacuum in the women's field. But it's better to leave her be. She was 
right to put tennis on the sideline when she walked away last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 She needs time to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Pete Sampras and Steffi Graf, winners of seven of the past eight 
Grand Slams, drew easy first-round opponents for the French Open. Sampras will 
play a qualifier to be determined today, and Graf will face No. 106-ranked 
Katarina Studenikova of Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi, twice a finalist here, drew three-time winner Mats Wilander as 
his first opponent. Wilander needed a wild-card invitation to make the field, 
and Agassi, ranked 19th, failed to earn a place among the 16 seeded players. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain drew Martin Damm of the Czech 
Republic; two-time winner Jim Courier drew France's Jean-Philippe Fleurian, and 
No. 2-seeded Michael Stich of Germany drew Renzo Furlan of Italy. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Venus rising: Venus Williams, widely hyped as the next big star of women's 
tennis, is expected to make her WTA Tour debut in the Virginia Slims of Los 
Angeles Aug. 8-14 at the Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Richard, said he will seek a wild-card entry for his daughter if 
she maintains high marks in her schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'll tell you something, her grades are ahead of where they should be," 
he said. "So, if I had to make that decision right now, she would play. She's 
going out of her way to bring her grades (up to) exactly where they should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jan Diamond, director of the Manhattan Beach tournament: "If she plays 
our event, we'd be ecstatic. I'll keep my fingers crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 6-feet-2 and 130 pounds, was born in Long Beach and grew up in 
Compton before moving with her family to Florida almost three years ago. She 
will turn 14 on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father said she will be brought along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 14, Venus probably will play one or two tournaments," he said. "At 15, she 
will be allowed to play about four or five. At 16, if she's doing very well, 
she can turn professional, but she shouldn't play more than eight or nine. At 
17, she can play full time." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Diamond: "We don't mind having the exclusive (this year)." Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Local qualifying for the Prince Cup, a national doubles tournament for 
amateurs, will be held today at La Canada Flintridge Country Club. Details: 
(818) 790-4318. . . . Three "opportunity" tournaments -- July 6-10 at Rancho 
San Clemente Tennis & Fitness Club, July 13-17 at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club 
and July 20-24 at Rancho Valencia Resort -- will send their winners into 
qualifying play for the Toshiba tournament, a WTA Tour event Aug. 1-8 at La 
Costa Resort & Spa in Carlsbad. . . . Boris Becker, ranked among the top 10 
this week for the first time since November, is scheduled to make a rare 
Southland appearance in the Los Angeles Open Aug. 1-7 at UCLA. Becker won 
titles at Indian Wells in 1987 and '88, but the three-time Wimblebon champion 
has never played in the L.A. Open. Among others scheduled to compete are Andre 
Agassi, who won the tournament in 1988, and Michael Chang, a finalist in three 
of the last five years.

TRANSFORMER; CONTROVERSIAL KABUKI STAR TAMASABURO BANDO, WHO MAGICALLY BECOMES 
A WOMAN FOR JAPANESE ROLES, VENTURES INTO INTERNATIONAL WATERS IN ANDRZEJ 
WAJDA'S FILM 'NASTASYA.' BUT THIS TIME, THE ACTOR PLAYS MALE AND FEMALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGARET SCOTT, Margaret Scott is a free-lance journalist based in Tokyo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tamasaburo Bando's fame comes from his creations of courtesans and spurned 
women on the Grand Kabuki stage, but this night he's wearing a double-breasted 
suit and standing before a sold-out audience in Yokohama. 
</P>
<P>
 He tilts his head and seems to turn his long, lithe torso in on itself as he 
slips for a minute into a man's idea of a geisha. "In a kimono, I'm a woman. 
It's like switching languages," says the man who is arguably Japan's premier 
female impersonator, or onnagata. Without makeup and despite his suit, 
Tamasaburo conjures up a demure, alluring presence, shy but hinting of the 
erotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Warming to his theme, he moves slowly across the stage, shedding one character 
for another. "Then I had to learn to be a woman in a Western gown," he says. 
"There's more freedom. It's easier to move." 
</P>
<P>
 He draws his 5-foot, 8 1/2-inch frame upright, thrusting one shoulder back and 
his chin out. Now he's a femme fatale; the sultriness is more direct, the 
manner almost haughty. "And then came the hardest part," he says as though 
savoring a minor irony. "I had to learn how to act as a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Tamasaburo (Kabuki actors are known by the first of their stage names) has 
this opportunity in "Nastasya," a film by Polish director Andrzej Wajda 
("Kanal," "Ashes and Diamonds," "Man of Iron"). In this tale of desire and 
betrayed innocence, based on Dostoevsky's novel "The Idiot," Tamasaburo acts as 
both a man and a woman on film for the first time. The film opened in Tokyo in 
April and Tamasaburo was speaking in Yokohama as part of a national tour to 
promote it. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Nastasya," Wajda turned Dostoevsky's last chapter into a screenplay with 
Tamasaburo in mind to play both Prince Myshkin, a frail, innocent epileptic 
thought to be an idiot, and the exquisite Nastasya, a tormented, fallen woman 
who winds up murdered by her lover, Rogozhin. "I don't know of any other actor 
who would give me the chance to create both male and female roles at the same 
time," Wajda says of Tamasaburo, whose acting captivated him during a visit to 
Japan in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Astonished to discover Tamasaburo was a man, Wajda for years nurtured the idea 
of working with him. And last year, in his hometown of Warsaw, Wajda filmed 
"Nastasya" over 13 days. For the film, Wajda transformed the interior of 
Warsaw's Pac Palace into the drawing room of a Czarist Russian bourgeois, the 
dim, candlelit setting for the drama between Rogozhin, played by Toshiyuki 
Nagashima, and Prince Myshkin. The film has a dark, claustrophobic, mysterious 
quality to it. The fact that it is a Russian story performed in Japanese with 
Japanese actors adds to its mysteriousness. The ambiguity of motivations and 
desires is at the heart of "Nastasya," and the story is told through dialogue 
and flashbacks over the course of the night Rogozhin kills Nastasya. 
Tamasaburo's almost dreamy switching from the role of Myshkin to the Role of 
Nastasya, which he does simply by donning a lace shawl and earrings, make 
ambiguity the substance of the film as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 20 years, Tamasaburo's celebrity has been a sort of Japanese 
version of the 1950s Hollywood studio stars. He evokes a similar glamour and 
star quality, yet his career has been molded as a virtuoso in sexual 
ambivalence. 
</P>
<P>
 This ambivalence, his almost childlike androgyny, is one's first impression on 
meeting Tamasaburo. His hair is boyishly cut, Hans Brinker style, and while 
he's 44 now, he still has the looks that made him a matinee idol in his 20s 
among young Japanese women. His manager calls him "young master" as we are 
introduced for our first meeting in a Tokyo hotel suite, and in this and a 
subsequent meeting, Tamasaburo shifts between presenting himself as an 
adventurous actor in search of challenges and as a prima donna of the Kabuki 
world. He is reserved, almost courtly, one minute, and disarmingly funny about 
himself the next. 
</P>
<P>
 We sip Japanese tea and speak through an interpreter. He tells me that acting 
in "Nastasya" was the biggest risk he has ever taken, and taking it has given 
him an extraordinary sense of freedom in the complicated tangle of his personal 
and professional life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be bothered by the confusion. My life has been as an onnagata. But 
am I a woman? No. Am I a man? Not really," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But after playing Prince Myshkin, he says, something clicked. "It fit and I 
thought to myself, 'Ah, I can act as a man too.' Now I take things easier: man 
or woman, it doesn't matter. I am an actor and as long as I can work, that's 
what matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most remarkable part of Tamasaburo's career is that he is one of 
the few Kabuki stars who has ventured out of the cloistered, hierarchical world 
of Kabuki. Curiosity spurred him at first, but there was also the urge to 
escape and a yearning to prove he had talent in addition to his famed beauty. 
He pantomimes pulling, like rabbits, the various roles he has performed out of 
a hat: standards from the Kabuki repertoire, Lady Macbeth and Desdemona from 
Shakespeare, Medea, modern Japanese Shimpa plays. One side of Tamasaburo's 
artistic life remains ensconced in formal, tradition-bound Kabuki, and the 
other is a roving, continuous experiment. Outside of Kabuki, it's as if he's 
rummaging through the world's cultural closet, constantly trying various 
women's roles from different centuries and countries to see how they fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Pierrot," he says, "living in an unfinished dream." Tamasaburo has 
mostly played out his dreams on stages in Japan. While he has toured with the 
Grand Kabuki in the United States, including a stop in Los Angeles in 1985, he 
rarely has taken any of his non-Kabuki work abroad. "There is no risk in Japan. 
But I used to be afraid of being taken as a joke outside," he says. No longer. 
He and Wajda hope to bring "Nastasya" to the United States and Europe later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Going abroad, finding an international audience is Tamasaburo's next 
adventure. "Now I feel free. I used to think no one in the West would 
understand me, an onnagata. So strange. So exotic. But the truth is that 
onnagata is the essence of acting." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be further from the conceit of an international stage than 
Tokyo's Kabuki-za, a fanciful version of traditional Japanese architecture 
standing smack in the middle of the Ginza, one of Tokyo's swankiest shopping 
and entertainment districts. This is the home of the Grand Kabuki, the place 
where Tamasaburo came of age and an imposing symbol of the sealed-off world of 
Kabuki. One is either born into it, or, like Tamasaburo, you are chosen to be 
adopted into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamasaburo was born in 1950 as Sinichi Nirehara. He was the sickly seventh son 
of a Tokyo teahouse proprietress and her ne'er-do-well, playboy husband. A bout 
of polio had left him unable to walk until he was 3 and then on spindly, 
fragile legs. But at the age of 4, Tamasaburo discovered dancing, first as a 
form of therapy, and then as an obsession. By the time he was 6, his dancing 
teacher was about to marry an important but fading Kabuki star, Kanya Morita, 
and Tamasaburo was an implicit part of the marriage for the childless Kanya, 
who was looking for an heir. Tamasaburo's immersion in the 400-year-old 
traditions of Kabuki began. 
</P>
<P>
 The story has it that Kabuki's founder was Okuni, a renegade priestess who ran 
off to Kyoto in the 1580s with an actor. Okuni began performing in a dry 
riverbed, devising a kind of vaudeville street entertainment. Kabuki's 
beginnings were bawdy with dancing geisha performing as a prelude to 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1629, the governmental authorities had banned women from performing, and 
Kabuki was well on its way from low art to the ritualized high art of today. It 
has often been said that without the banning of actresses, Kabuki would have no 
reason to exist, for the onnagata , the highest art form of theatrical 
transvestism in the world, would never have been invented. 
</P>
<P>
 In his dressing room one recent afternoon, Tamasaburo talked about his 
childhood and training to be an onnagata as though it were an inevitability. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I wanted was to dance and be on stage. I never thought about choosing; I 
just was," he says, lounging in Indian muslin drawstring pants and a golden 
yellow silk jacket before he prepared to go on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, day after day, year after year, he came to Kabuki-za, undergoing a 
strict regimen of study, including the Japanese string instrument called the 
shamisen, dancing, singing, acting, even the tea ceremony and, most crucially, 
the ways of onnagata.  
</P>
<P>
 The greatest of onnagata have claimed that the artful rendering of women on 
stage comes from existing as a woman off it. One of the great 17th-Century 
masters, Ayame Yoshizawa, wrote: "An onnagata should act like an onnagata even 
in the dressing room. . . . An actor who fails to live even his daily life like 
a woman will probably never be judged a successful onnagata ." Many have 
adhered to this advice, giving rise to the stories of actors wearing women's 
clothes at home or going to the women's section of public baths. 
</P>
<P>
 The code and craft of onnagata is the creation of an abstraction, a man's idea 
of woman, but a stylized version rather than a specific woman. Because the 
actor is a man, he can create a stylized woman, and from distance and sexual 
tension spring the art. This is the tradition Tamasaburo joined and in which he 
excelled. In his teens, despite his questionable Kabuki pedigree, he landed 
major roles and attracted enormous attention. When he was 20, one of Japan's 
famous modern novelists, the late Yukio Mishima, doted on Tamasaburo and wrote 
of him: "The fascination of this beautiful young man is of another era than our 
own. But it may carry with it a magical power, which by the right and privilege 
of his young age, will succeed in completely overturning the prevailing tastes 
of our time." 
</P>
<P>
 Tamasaburo as Kabuki super-star has been credited with kicking off a Kabuki 
revival by bringing in a new generation of fans. He obliged his fans' taste for 
spectacle, driving around Tokyo in a big Cadillac and posing for pinup posters. 
While Tamasaburo left his feminine roles on the stage, there was a blending of 
the persona and the person. Kabuki leaves no room for improvisation, yet 
somehow Tamasaburo managed to bring a modern sensibility to his roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all those movies I watched," he says, telling of how he'd rush out 
most days between the matinee and evening performances at Kabuki-za to one of 
the nearby Ginza movie houses. His favorites were the glamour queens -- Greta 
Garbo, Vivien Leigh, Rita Hayworth -- but he watched everything from Hollywood 
to Fellini to Bergman. "I would replace the actors with myself and I studied 
how to act like them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until he was 24, Tamasaburo never acted in non-Kabuki roles because his 
adoptive father forbade it. But when Kanya died in 1974, Tamasaburo jumped at 
the opportunity. He tried his hand at Shakespeare and even took on the role 
once played by his heroine, Greta Garbo, in the movie version of Dumas' "La 
Dame aux Camelias." Partly this was a savvy career move since high visibility 
was a way of ensuring that he would continue to get good Kabuki roles from the 
rigid Kabuki hierarchy once Kanya was no longer there as his protector. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tamasaburo's ventures outside of Kabuki also suited his artistic 
temperament. He was chastised by many of the Kabuki elders for tainting Kabuki 
traditions by taking on modern, Western roles. He did it anyway, and by dint of 
his vast popularity, he was always able to return to the Kabuki stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard, finding the right balance," he says now of those years. "I 
just believed that I could go back and forth, and not spoil the onnagata form 
when I came back to the Kabuki world." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Tamasaburo performed outside Japan for the first time, traveling with 
the Grand Kabuki. He made his U.S. debut at the Metropolitan Opera House in New 
York and returned to the United States in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, at UCLA's Royce Hall, he appeared in the Kabuki classic "Kasane," 
playing a spurned woman who becomes possessed by her raging desire for revenge. 
Times dance writer Lewis Segal called his performance "unforgettable: tortured 
and terrifying." Tamasaburo calls the U.S. tours a kind of turning point in his 
career. He was showered with attention, sought after by the likes of Andy 
Warhol. He also remembers, though, how strange onnagata seemed to Americans. 
"One interviewer asked me if my parents were sad when I told them I was going 
to be an onnagata. I didn't know what to say. But it was a natural question." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, Tamasaburo has moved more and more away from Kabuki. He 
says it remains his artistic anchor and he still performs every year at 
Kabuki-za. This year, for instance, he's only appearing there for two months 
out of the year. There are many reasons: He's growing older, the pace of three 
performances a day is too demanding, and as he puts it, "The world outside of 
Kabuki is more interesting to me now." He has directed films and plays, done a 
film series performing traditional dances and regularly takes up offers to 
collaborate with visiting directors or choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, critics or other artists say that Tamasaburo has become a 
dilettante, picking up projects like so many hobbies. His work is dazzling to 
look at, they say, but too much the vision of an interior decorator and not 
enough of an artist with something new to say. But there is always an audience, 
and Tamasaburo says there is something driving him: finding the link between 
the onnagata tradition and other forms of theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamasaburo's method is usually to wait for someone else to make the link. 
Often, when musicians or filmmakers or artists of one sort or another visit 
Tokyo, meeting Tamasaburo is on their list of things to do. "Sometimes I feel 
like a tourist's monument," he says, explaining how visitors from abroad love 
to come to his dressing room and watch him be transformed under the layers of 
rich brocade, the billowy butterfly bow sash, the elaborately sculpted high wig 
and the heavy white makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes these encounters spark an idea. He met cellist Yo-Yo Ma this 
way, and wound up performing a dance to Ma's musical accompaniment. Pianist 
Emanuel Ax, too, was taken with the idea of collaborating with Tamasaburo. This 
month in Tokyo, Tamasaburo is performing a dance he arranged with Belgian 
choreographer Maurice Bejart, and next year he will play Queen Elizabeth I in a 
revival of Spanish writer Francisco Ors' "Contradanza-Contradanza-Contradanza" 
directed by Nuria Espert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some might be tempted to think that all this is the height of camp: playful 
and knowing productions based on Tamasaburo's sexual role-playing. But that is 
not at all how he is seen in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of caricature does not enter into the onnagata's role in Kabuki plays 
or Tamasaburo's non-Kabuki roles. There is nothing reminiscent of Barry 
Humphries as Dame Edna nor the comedy of Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie and Robin 
Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire. Instead, Tamasaburo's appeal seems to rest more on 
the stylized illusion he creates. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite a few theories have been devised on why the theme of sexual ambivalence 
is so popular in Japan, and not just in Kabuki. Comic books for young girls are 
filled with stories featuring androgynous, beautiful young princes or samurai. 
One of the most popular theater groups among young girls is the all-female 
Takarazuka Theater. One reason often given is that in Japan -- like most 
places, but even more so -- part of growing up is learning to play the role of 
one's sex. Hence, from pop culture to high art, the appeal of sexual 
ambivalence is that it offers an escape. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wajda came up with the idea for "Nastasya," the allure of Tamasaburo was 
not the promise of escapism but the power of his stylized acting. Wajda wrote 
of Tamasaburo's "creative stylized beauty" after seeing him perform for the 
first time. Wajda likened the effect to the shock Europeans felt when they 
first saw Japanese artist Utamaro's wood block prints, done in the late 18th 
Century, of geisha and Japan's floating world of the pleasure quarters. Wajda 
wanted that shock, the tension between the creative and the stylized, for 
"Nastasya." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Tamasaburo was wary of Wajda and his project. "I was scared of the 
material, I was scared of the whole idea of switching from man to woman," he 
says, pretending for a minute that he is on the set in Warsaw so he can explain 
how he and Wajda worked together. He perches himself daintily on the edge of 
the couch and mimics drawing around his shoulders the flowing lace shawl that 
in the film represents the character of Nastasya. Her character came easily, he 
says. The imaginary shawl falls away and Tamasaburo takes the part of Prince 
Myshkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wajda would be right here," he says as though it's a rehearsal and the 
director is hovering by his side. "He'd just tell me details and details. How 
to move my hands, how to sit, how to talk, how to find the innocent and lonely 
part of me that is just like Prince Myshkin." 
</P>
<P>
 Tamasaburo is a perfectionist, almost dictatorial about controlling every 
detail around him; "Nastasya" is a study of controlled acting. This desire for 
control is one of the main reasons Tamasaburo has been drawn increasingly to 
film and away from the Kabuki stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I was young, I wanted to create my own world. That's what I am 
doing now by making films," he says. With film, unlike the stage, Tamasaburo 
feels he has been able to capture the exact performance he wants to capture. In 
his dance films, he has set out to preserve his version of his onnagata talent 
in static, unchanging documents. And with "Nastasya," his most unusual venture 
outside of Kabuki has been preserved as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamasaburo says "Nastasya" allowed him to create a world of his own making. By 
working with Wajda, he was able to draw on the onnagata tradition and create 
something new. He no longer believes that being an onnagata is, as the 
17th-Century master Ayame Yoshizawa said, a way of life. He no longer cares 
that many in the Kabuki world think this is heretical. There is no great 
divide, he says, between creating the illusion of a Kabuki courtesan or a 
character out of Dostoevsky. "Maybe Wajda saw something universal in the way I 
act. If I didn't believe this, I could never do what I do. I could never have 
acted in 'Nastasya.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This is the key to Tamasaburo's work: his claim that his acting tradition, so 
utterly vernacular and tied to Japan, can be transformed into something 
universal. He has staked out his territory as if he has become a product of his 
imagination or, as he puts it, a minstrel living out his dreams. In Japan, 
Tamasaburo's territory is an established one; he is about to find out whether 
it travels across borders.

JAZZ; CALL IT A COMMERCIAL BREAK; 'TONIGHT SHOW' BANDLEADER BRANFORD MARSALIS 
ISN'T THRILLED ABOUT SCALING BACK THE SHOW'S JAZZ FLAVOR. BUT HE TAKES THE JOB 
FOR WHAT IT IS: A NICE GIG THAT STILL LEAVES HIM TIME FOR A FEW SIDE PROJECTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 1 o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon, and Branford Marsalis is trying to 
finish an arrangement of a Janet Jackson tune to play during a commercial on 
the evening's broadcast of "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be finished with this in just a minute, man," he says, checking out a 
phrase on the Jackson recording before deftly transcribing it on score paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis, the show's musical director and arranger, is working in his office 
-- a smallish basement-level space, overflowing with electronic musical 
modules, saxophones and computers. Not a particularly imposing layout. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he celebrates his second anniversary on the show this week, his real 
prominence is apparent in that ultimate evidence of show business status: the 
parking spot. His Land Rover, positioned just outside NBC's Studio One in 
Burbank, stands No. 3 in the premiere lineup, superseded only by the luxury 
vehicles of Leno and local newsman Paul Moyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "All done," he says, switching off the stereo and setting aside his orchestral 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Trim and athletic, dressed in T-shirt and slacks, the 33-year-old musician 
doesn't look the part of the most visible jazz man in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually," says Marsalis, "when people talk about jazz, I say, 'I used to be 
a jazz musician.' Because jazz musicians don't do what I'm doing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 " Used to be a jazz musician?" A startling statement -- even said 
semi-humorously -- from a player considered by many jazz experts to be one of 
the two or three outstanding post-Sonny Rollins tenor saxophonists. Much 
praised since the release of his first album a decade ago, Marsalis has 
maintained a solid jazz reputation throughout a variety of other musical 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, ironically, as he has become better known to the television public, and 
his band has emerged as a finely tuned jazz ensemble, many observers -- 
including, according to Marsalis, his own father, Ellis -- have expressed 
concern about the drop-off in the show's jazz content. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis, who has battled network executives on this new musical emphasis, 
seems to have finally given way, to the point where even the on-camera coverage 
of his top-flight ensemble appears to have diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a situation," he recalls, "where some of the people on the show 
felt that a lot of the music we were playing was detrimental to the show 
because of the audience. Warren Littlefield (president of NBC) said it best. He 
told me, 'I have all your records, and I love jazz, and you love jazz, and we 
can curse the world. But the world is the way it is, and the world does not 
like jazz. We think that it would improve the show significantly if you would 
play music people are more comfortable with.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't disagree with any of that, because I'd been through that conflict 
myself, just playing jazz. And it wasn't where they put a gun to my head and 
said, 'You'd better do this or else,' because there's a clause in my contract 
that says 'full artistic freedom.' So I could still do whatever I want. But I 
respected the way it was done. So we changed the format of what we did, and the 
jazz tunes were reduced. Now we play like one jazz tune a night, if that -- 
maybe two a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield confirms Marsalis' recollection of the meeting, explaining that 
one of the principal requirements for the band is "to get the audience into a 
state of energy, excitement and anticipation for what's going to happen next." 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat down with Branford," he continued, "and said, 'Look, here are what we 
think are the important elements in the show. Tell me if they can work for 
you.' I explained to him that our research shows that if we are going to reach 
the broadest possible audience, that the music cannot be too obscure to that 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield added a strong pledge of support for Marsalis and his musical 
concerns, but noted that "there are days when you see the full spectrum of an 
artist's talents, and days when the biorhythms are slower." 
</P>
<P>
 "We pay a lot of money for his service," he continued, " . . . so it's not a 
question of not wanting what he has to offer. I think it's very clear that if 
we weren't in love with what Branford can do . . . then we would ask him to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis, when pressed about his willingness to reduce the jazz content, 
replies simply that he is "a team player." And, although he appears to be 
phlegmatic about the actual need for repertoire changes ("People don't listen 
to the music during the commercial breaks, anyhow; they just watch the 
commercials on the monitors"), he doesn't hesitate to express his distaste for 
some of the suggested substitute programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a phrase we have around here," he says, "called 'upbeat and 
recognizable.' We play a lot of upbeat music. I still can't stomach the 
recognizable -- the contemporary pop tunes they want us to play -- so we don't 
really deal with recognizable. Instead, we play a lot of the '70s, early '80s 
(pop) stuff that we grew up with, and I guess it does help the people to bop a 
little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop tunes from the '70s and '80s were not what was expected from Marsalis when 
the surprise announcement was made two years ago that he would join "The 
Tonight Show" when Jay Leno took over Johnny Carson's chair. Despite his 
prominent appearances with Sting, his film work with Spike Lee and his 
commercial music composing, Marsalis was viewed by most fans as an important 
young artist whose central interest was jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many jazz fans were elated over the possibility that his appointment would 
result in more jazz on late-night television. At the very least, Marsalis' 
presence seemed to guarantee an improvement in both the quality and the 
quantity of music on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 But more jazz on "The Tonight Show" was not necessarily Marsalis' first 
priority. The thoughtful, self-possessed saxophonist had other concerns in mind 
and they involved taking positions that musicians rarely risked in the world of 
television. His first goal was to avoid what he saw as television's 
"historical" pattern of using musicians as "foils." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't mind being a foil, myself," he explains. "But I'll be damned if I 
was going to allow the band to be the foil. It's not that I didn't think we 
shouldn't be the butt of jokes. Hey, Jay knows us. We wouldn't be here if it 
wasn't for Jay. So, if he wants to make us the butt of jokes, that's OK, we 
don't mind that, because it's funny when he does it. But corny stuff like 
'Stump the Band?' C'mon. Some guy asked me that last week: 'You guys still do 
Stump the Band?' And I said, 'No, man, we play Stump the Audience.' It's like 
bands have always been treated like they're playing for a wedding, like they 
shouldn't be taken very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was doing Carson's show a couple of times. The band didn't 
get to play until everything else had been exhausted. You know, Johnny told a 
joke, Ed would say something, and then they'd say, '45 seconds left. Doc, play 
something.' Doc would say, 'Cool.' He'd play, and when they came back from 
commercial, phoom! The band was gone. They treated the music like, 'Hey, we 
need three inches of sausage, real quick.' That kind of stuff really demeans 
the spirit of musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis believes that the changes that have taken place fail to acknowledge 
both the quality and the growth of his ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think you can compare our band with the other talk-show bands," 
he says. "Our band is far more versatile than any of them. Paul Shaffer's band 
is like a '70s party band. The band on Conan's show is a jump blues band. I'm 
not saying they suck. But we can play '70s stuff, and we can play jump blues 
music too. And, of course, we can play jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what surprises a lot of people is that we can do all those things -- 
we can play funk, jazz, rock 'n' roll, and country and Western music, whatever. 
And we can do it good. Musicians who come on 'The Tonight Show' -- no matter 
what style they are -- want to play with this band." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno's support for Marsalis' desire to maintain respect for the musicians has 
been vital since the beginning, Marsalis maintains. His casual, off-the-cuff 
remarks with Marsalis initially had the feeling of an exchange between equals 
-- far different from the deprecating top banana-musical foil interaction so 
common on other talk shows. Lately, however, the interchanges have become 
briefer and somewhat clipped. Nonetheless, Marsalis says that his relationship 
with Leno remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't anybody else's idea to have us on the show, you know," Marsalis 
says. "It was Jay's. And that's the way it works in this business. It takes one 
person to believe in you and to stand up for you. Jay says he's not really a 
music guy, and that's cool, too, because he just says, 'Man, you do what you 
want.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis believes that "The Tonight Show's" drop to the No. 2 spot behind 
David Letterman had a lot to do with perceptions that were present from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got a bad rap from the press," he says. "And once you're labeled, 
you have to live with the label. The label in the beginning was that the show 
wasn't innovative, that Jay and I were nervous, that our mix together doesn't 
work, that the show was cornball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, man," he continues, "Letterman is damn good, but he had 14 years to 
work on his shtick at a time when nobody was paying attention to late-night 
television. He was allowed years to just screw up, to make mistakes; he wasn't 
under a microscope. You look at the first years of that show, and Letterman and 
Shaffer weren't chummy-chummy and buddy-buddy. They got to know one another and 
understand each other's sense of humor over a long period of time. Jay and I 
had to get our (act) together in a year. And we did. But I don't kid myself. I 
know we've got our work cut out for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis was also determined to establish a different employment structure for 
his musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole thing," he explains, "was that you can't really expect to have a 
band of talented musicians who stay together under the old system that existed 
on the show, in which the musicians were essentially day players (working as 
needed on a daily rate). I felt that you had to give them salaries to make it 
worthwhile for them to stay. Treat them with respect. That was something new, 
because the guys on the show before didn't have anybody really looking out for 
their interests, and it was unfortunate. I don't think that they were treated 
fairly, but musicians never are." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis insisted upon full-time salaries for his players. "And it was a hard 
deal to make," he says. "Because whenever you're trying to buck status quo, 
it's difficult. NBC had a point of view and an interest. And it's unfortunate 
that in the entertainment business they're so short-sighted that they negotiate 
from a point of antagonism -- from a point of menace, of intimidation. It never 
really dawned on NBC that they couldn't intimidate us, because they had no idea 
who we were. Their attitude was, 'Who are these pompous (expletives) to come in 
and make demands to us?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But when we got here," he continues, "some of the musicians that people 
around here respected -- you know, popular pop artists -- began making comments 
about how good we were. Like Peter Gabriel said, 'Since Branford's on the show, 
I'm coming on.' And Sting said, 'I never do TV, but since Branford's on, I'm 
coming on.' And Willie Nelson said, 'I want to use that band, those guys are 
great.' That was when everybody's attitude began to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis, with his outspoken and articulate advocacy for his musicians, has 
won a few and lost a few in his continuing exchanges with the network. But he 
views both achievements and failures as part of the process of dealing with the 
corporate world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there was going to have to be some level of compromise when I came 
here," he says, "because I was well aware of the fact that jazz music has never 
been successful on television, and it takes a certain kind of commitment to get 
any of it on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there have been lighter moments to balance the problems which 
have ebbed and flowed during Marsalis' tenure on "The Tonight Show." The 
ensemble -- which consists of Marsalis on saxophones, Kenny Kirkland on 
keyboards, Robert Hurst on bass, Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums, Kevin Eubanks on 
guitar, Matt Finders on trombone, Sal Marquez on trumpet and Vicki Randle on 
percussion -- has what Marsalis describes as "its own skewed sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Situations will come up in which we're laughing and nobody else is laughing," 
Marsalis says. "Everybody else says, 'What the hell is so funny?' But Jay is 
cool. He understands. He's definitely one of the cats. He's opened at jazz 
clubs, and his sense of humor is a lot like ours." 
</P>
<P>
 On one memorable show, Marsalis lost a bet with Eubanks and was obliged to 
appear in a bikini bathing suit. More recently, the band had to accompany a 
group of whistlers, at least one of whom was disastrously out of tune. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, while we're rehearsing with these whistlers," Marsalis recalls, "the 
director says, 'Branford, can I see your face?' And I'm like, 'Man, you don't 
want to see my face. I'm going to do you a favor, and I'm going to keep my back 
to the camera.' Because my reactions show all over my face. Then I look over at 
Kevin, and the camera is right on him. Now, when Kevin laughs, he gets 
uncontrollable. He just falls on the floor. So I said, 'Kevin, the camera's on 
your face. Don't start laughing.' And he says, 'I promise. I won't laugh.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the group starts whistling something like 'Daughters of the Regiment,' 
and Kevin's not playing on this number. He's just sitting there, quietly 
holding his guitar. Then I look at him a little closer, and he's got his mouth 
frozen, and in the corners of both eyes, tears are streaming down his cheeks. 
So now I'm about to lose it, because I know he's laughing so hard inside. And 
I'm about to die, thinking these whistlers are never going to stop. It was just 
one of those great moments that only musicians can really get." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis leans back in his chair and chuckles, a brief bit of relaxation in 
his candid commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 He has packed a remarkable number of accomplishments into a fairly brief 
career. In less than two decades, he has moved from a high school band in New 
Orleans to national celebrity. The eldest of six sons born to jazz pianist 
Ellis Marsalis and his wife, Dolores, his path has moved almost consistently 
upward. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was 21, Marsalis had played with Lionel Hampton, Clark Terry 
and Art Blakey. His debut Columbia album, "Scenes in the City," was released in 
1984; his solo work on his second jazz album, "Royal Garden Blues," was 
nominated for a Grammy, as was his playing on 1989's "Random Abstract" and 
1990's "Trio Jeepy." In between there were more jazz albums, gigs and albums 
with Sting, film music for Lee, performances with the Grateful Dead, touring 
with his trio, a documentary video with filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker and an NPR 
jazz radio series. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Marsalis will make yet another unusual career move when he 
releases "Buckshot LeFonque," his first extended venture in hip-hop. The album, 
which is titled after a pseudonym used by jazz alto saxophonist Julian 
(Cannonball) Adderly in the '50s, is a strikingly collaborative effort that 
features an envelope-stretching encounter between Marsalis and poet Maya 
Angelou on her classic work, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis awaits critical reactions that he expects might be negative. "I think 
the rock 'n' roll press is going to just hope this record'll go away," he says. 
"But that's OK. I just wanted to make a pop record. And the only way I can do 
something like that is my way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the changing fortunes of jazz on "The Tonight Show" have not 
prevented Marsalis from expanding his other musical activities. But the 
question remains of what impact the ups and downs of his first two years have 
had on his jazz, which he continues to identify as his creative core. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, man, this is a good gig," he says. "Don't forget that the first year and 
a half was spent just making peace with my decision to do the show. And dealing 
with what I can do in this environment instead of focusing on what I can't do. 
Sure, I still miss what I can't do. But it's a great job, and I work with great 
people, even if we don't agree philosophically very often." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with three years remaining on his five-year contract, Marsalis has a 
long way to go within the relatively restrictive confines of the show. With 
only five non-concurrent weeks off each year, there is almost no opportunity to 
do the extensive touring that is the meat and potatoes of jazz performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Marsalis says, "Doc Severinsen told me a very interesting thing 
before he left. He said, 'Yeah, man, you're one of the warriors. I'm surprised 
you're doing this gig. One thing you have to remember is that it's not about 
music around here. You just have to put up with this crap, and make them pay 
you enough so that you don't mind.' The only problem is that so far they can't 
come up with enough money to pay me so that I won't mind. I will always mind. 
And I figure I don't have anything to worry about so long as I continue to 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But will the implied take-the-money-and-run attitude be enough to compensate 
for the lost years of serious music performance? How much longer can he risk 
the offhanded comment, 'I used to be a jazz musician?' For all his confident 
self-assuredness, Marsalis seems ambivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there's a price to be paid here," he says. "I don't know how much of a 
price it is yet. We'll have to see when I start making jazz records again. Then 
we'll know. I'm practicing more than I ever have -- two, three hours a day. And 
it's helped a lot, so I'm doing things here. A couple of guys on the old 
'Tonight Show' told me, 'Oh, this is the greatest gig ever, man. You go to the 
golf course in the morning, and then you come to work.' Well, my whole reaction 
when I hear that is, 'At what point in your life did you stop being a 
musician?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not at that point yet," he continues. "And if I were, I'm sure a 
television show is not where I'd like to end up. If I decide I don't want to be 
a musician, I would not want to be in a place where I would constantly be 
reminded of the fact that I'm receiving accolades for what I used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that happens, I would rather just quit and walk away and go back to 
teaching school and playing jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 And could he still do that? Could he still chuck the national visibility, the 
big paycheck and the privileged parking to return to teaching school and 
playing jazz? 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis pauses for a moment, smiling at what he obviously views as the patent 
absurdity of the question. He suddenly seems once again to be very certain of 
who he is and what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a second, bro," he finally replies. "In a second."

THEY CAN TELL YOU WHY; WELCOME BACK TO HOTEL CALIFORNIA: AFTER A SPLIT-UP THAT 
LEFT ANYTHING BUT PEACEFUL, EASY FEELINGS, THE EAGLES ARE TOGETHER AGAIN, DON 
HENLEY AND GLENN FREY ARE WRITING SONGS -- AND THEY PROMISE IT'S NOT JUST A 
MONEY THING

<P>
 "Stop . . . stop ," Glenn Frey shouts during an Eagles rehearsal with enough 
urgency to raise the blood pressure of anyone familiar with the band's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles didn't just break up 14 years ago. The quintet exploded from the 
tensions surrounding it -- chiefly, the pressures they put on themselves to 
live up to huge artistic and commercial expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the up to $300 million in potential worldwide album and tour grosses 
looming for this reunion, it's easy to imagine those pressures returning and a 
single foul-up shattering it. A 1990 reunion attempt disintegrated before it 
even got to rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frey's only concern this afternoon is that he can't hear the piano in the 
sound mix. Looking as trim as he did in the mid-'80s ads for a fitness center 
chain, Frey, 45, leaves the band and walks to the center of a massive 
soundstage in Burbank, where he listens again to the music as an engineer 
adjusts the controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied, he rejoins the musicians on stage. At the end of the song, he 
smiles. "Nice guitar parts," he says to band mates Don Felder and Joe Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 This peaceful, easy feeling is typical of the reunion, says Frey, who with Don 
Henley was a chief architect of the group's musical vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all grown up a lot," Frey says after the rehearsal. "When you first 
break up, the wounds are open. . . . There is going to be some anger and some 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as years go by, all you remember is the good times. I said when we got 
back together, 'I don't live in the past. As far as I am concerned, this is Day 
One. Nobody has to make any reparations.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest surprise is the change in Henley, who was known in the '70s as 
the most intense Eagle -- so fiercely protective of the Los Angeles band's 
legacy that he would dash off heated letters to critics whom he felt slighted 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fun," Henley, 46, says with a disarming grin as he relaxes backstage 
after the rehearsal. "We are musicians. We are supposed to go out and play for 
people. Getting back together is normal. The abnormal thing was breaking up in 
the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Just when no topic seems likely to rattle Henley and Frey, one emerges: money. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much the Eagles talk about coming back together for friendship 
and for the love of music, lots of people are going to suspect that the real 
motivation is the big bucks involved. And the band -- which begins its reunion 
tour on Friday at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre -- certainly made itself a 
big target by charging $115 for top tickets in certain markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley is a proud man, and the accusation stings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a very cynical time," he says sharply. "The press is cynical. The 
public is cynical. . . . The truth is they have been offering us buckets of 
money every year to get us back together and the truth is there's not enough 
money in the universe to get us to do this if we didn't want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley catches himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know what? I don't really give a damn," he says, smiling at the 
return of his old combativeness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fun . 
</P>
<P>
 That's not exactly the word associated over the years with the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fitting that the group is rehearsing this afternoon on a movie sound 
stage. This is a band that has always been surrounded by drama. The name of the 
summer tour -- "Hell Freezes Over" -- is itself a playful reminder of how for 
years this was the one group that no one ever thought would get back together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' first hit single may have been the soothing "Take It Easy" in the 
summer of 1972, but the troubled strains of 1976's "Life in the Fast Lane" were 
a more accurate description of the band's anxious pace, when it was known in 
the rock world as much for internal strife and its reported fast-lane excesses 
as for such gems as "Hotel California" and "New Kid in Town." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether serving up ballads ("Best of My Love"), country-flavored narratives 
("Lyin' Eyes") or bluesy workouts ("One of These Nights"), the Eagles were the 
most consistent makers of quality hits of any American band since Creedence 
Clearwater Revival. 
</P>
<P>
 But those high standards took their toll on the band, whose original lineup 
consisted of Frey, Henley, guitarist Bernie Leadon and bassist Randy Meisner. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Felder was added in 1974 to give the band a harder rock feel, 
there were already reports of grueling recording sessions and screaming matches 
backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first walked in, everything seemed crazy," Felder once said. "Bernie 
was quitting and Randy was talking about quitting. Everyone was yelling at each 
other and fighting. They had just fired their manager and their producer. I 
thought I had joined a band that had just broken up. 'Oh,' I said to myself, 
'smart move.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Leadon finally did leave the Eagles in 1975, followed after "Hotel California" 
by Meisner. They were replaced by Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the "Hotel California" album in 1976 that was the band's crowning 
achievement -- and, in retrospect, its albatross. The work, which spent nine 
weeks at No. 1, chronicled the attitudes of a generation trapped between the 
fading idealism of the '60s and the encroaching greed of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Henley and Frey, who came to Los Angeles from Texas and 
Michigan, respectively, to follow their rock 'n' roll goals, wrote about the 
state of the American Dream, using their experiences in rock to convey the 
innocence, temptations and disillusionment of that pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure of trying to top "Hotel California" caused the making of the next 
album -- 1979's "The Long Run" -- to be a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey at the time described the biggest casualty of those sessions as his 
friendship with Henley. "We always had to worry about doing this or living up 
to that," he said. Walsh described the atmosphere in the band at the time as 
"paranoid." He said the group "lost perspective. We just kinda sat around in a 
daze . . . for months." 
</P>
<P>
 Frey also cites burnout and drugs as contributing factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hesitate to blame it on drugs because that's such an easy (excuse), but it 
is fair to say that cocaine may have brought up the worst in a lot of us," Frey 
says now. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking about the breakup period, Irving Azoff, who managed the band during 
its glory days, has said, "The longer you're in a band, the harder it is. The 
first album was recorded in two, three weeks. The second in four weeks and so 
forth. 'Hotel California' took nine months. 'Long Run' took 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "(By then) they were 32, 33. They've built houses. They've made tons of money, 
but they haven't had time off to really enjoy it. So there are lots of reasons 
to back off from all the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The end came in a phone call from Frey to Henley, shortly after the group's 
final performance -- a 1980 benefit at the Long Beach Arena for then-Sen. Alan 
Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
 When the rest of the Eagles returned to Miami that year to complete the 
group's live album, Frey stayed in Los Angeles. The band had to fly tapes back 
and forth to get it completed in time for a holiday season release. Not even 
the lure of an extra $2 million advance from Asylum Records if the album 
contained two new Eagles songs was enough to breach the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 With wounds still open two years later, Frey ridiculed the idea of ever 
playing with the Eagles again. "There'll never be a 'Greed and Lost Youth' 
tour," he said flatly. He said he'd rather make music on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be another 12 years before he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All five Eagles went on to make solo albums in the '80s, but only Henley 
continued to prosper at anywhere near the same creative and commercial level. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sluggish start with his 1982 solo album, his next two -- 1984's 
"Building the Perfect Beast" and 1989's "The End of the Innocence" -- sold 2 
million and 3 million copies, respectively. The best of the songs, including 
"Heart of the Matter" and "Boys of Summer," also reflected the craft and 
character associated with the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't such smooth sailing for Frey. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such hit singles as "The Heat Is On" and "Smuggler's Blues" in the 
mid-'80s, Frey's recording career stalled. None of his five solo albums made 
the national Top 10. He made some sidesteps into acting, including the lead 
role in the CBS-TV series "South of Sunset," but it was canceled last year 
after one episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Felder, Walsh and Schmit also failed to become consistent sales forces. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was only natural that the reunion rumors would begin circulating. The 
surprise, in retrospect, is that it was Frey -- rather than Henley -- who 
tended to be the holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every couple of years, I'd run into Irving (Azoff) and he'd go, 'You know 
there is a bushel basket of $100 bills waiting for you if you guys could just 
do an album or do a tour,' " Frey says now. "But I'd go, 'Yes, but I have a 
nice life now, Irving. It's not that important to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was generally open to a reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in cycles about it," he says, sitting in a trailer backstage after the 
rehearsal. "I think there were times when I thought, 'Never -- if they begged 
me, I wouldn't do it.' And then there would be times where I would think, 'It 
wouldn't be so bad.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Those thoughts kept going around like that for years, but I don't think I 
ever totally discounted the possibility of it. As our friend J. D. Souther 
always used to say, 'Time passes, things change.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Things had changed enough by 1990 for Henley and Frey to take a stab at 
writing together. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to include two or three new songs in a greatest hits album that 
would be released in conjunction with a U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frey ultimately backed away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't ready," Frey says now of that period. "I had just remarried . . . 
had just had major surgery to remove a section of my large intestine -- a 
congenital thing since birth -- that left me laying on my back in Cedars-Sinai 
with a bunch of staples in my stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something like that happens, you lay back and say, 'What's important?' 
The answer to me was write songs in the morning, play golf in the afternoon and 
have dinner with my beautiful new wife who was just pregnant with our first 
child. The timing was bad for me." 
</P>
<P>
 As late as last January, the timing still seemed wrong -- and all five Eagles 
were making separate plans for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was going to work on songs for his next solo album and overseeing his 
campaign to preserve Walden Woods in Massachusetts. Frey was heading to 
Nashville to make a country-rock album. Between studio sessions, Felder was 
looking forward to spending time with his family on a new boat. Schmit and 
Walsh were also thinking about separate album projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in the change of plans was the success of "Common Thread: The 
Songs of the Eagles," an album that featured versions of Eagles hits by such 
country stars as Clint Black and Travis Tritt. 
</P>
<P>
 Azoff says he put the album together to raise funds for Henley's Walden Woods 
preservation campaign and to kick off the country division of Azoff's Giant 
Records -- not to lure the Eagles back into the nest. However, when sales 
topped 3 million within six months -- it went to No. 1 on Billboard's country 
charts and No. 3 on the pop charts -- the album's popularity underscored the 
public's interest in a reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 But would the five Eagles get along after all these years? Though the 
musicians said they kept in touch, relations between Henley and Frey remained 
delicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, I think a lot of (the conflict) was imaginary," Henley says now 
of his relationship with Frey during the last dozen years. "We were apart, and 
rumors would get back to us about something the other guy might have said and 
it might send us off, but every time we were actually in each other's presence, 
we were fine. Every time we would run into each other, there was no bitterness 
or animosity." 
</P>
<P>
 The test came last Dec. 6, when they all agreed to guest in a video being shot 
in Los Angeles to promote Tritt's version of "Take It Easy" from "Common 
Thread." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmit, 46, knew the importance of the day, but he tried to downplay it in his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went around for a long time after the breakup changing the station when 
Eagles songs came on because it was sad to think about what had happened," says 
the singer and co-writer of "I Can't Tell You Why." 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Tritt video shoot) was fun, but that's as far as it went. I said I am 
not going to start thinking what if . I am just going ahead with my plans for 
the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 The video shoot went so smoothly, however, that steps were soon under way to 
change those plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles reunion always depended on the green light from both Henley and 
Frey, so the matter was in their hands when they got together for lunch with 
Azoff, who manages Henley, and Peter Lopez, who manages Frey, in Aspen, Colo., 
on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Azoff sensed an immediate rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been times over the years in Aspen where Glenn and Don would get 
together and we would try to pretend it was old times, but it always seemed a 
little strained," Azoff says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this time it all felt right. I could feel that things were different . . 
. that after all these years, the wounds were really healed." 
</P>
<P>
 Agreed Lopez, "It was just one of those special moments when Glenn and Don 
realized how much of a bond there was . . . how much history there was between 
them -- and how much they wanted it back." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the timing was finally right. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was free to work with the Eagles, since his own recording career was on 
hold because of a lawsuit with Geffen Records. Frey wasn't tied up with an 
acting or recording project. 
</P>
<P>
 With Henley and Frey on board, calls were made to the other band members and 
plans for a tour were begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this isn't a reunion, but a resumption," says Azoff. "There is a 
thirst in Don to work with Glenn . . . that I think is going to keep them 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley agrees that the goal is to keep the Eagles together beyond the tour. He 
looks forward to writing with Frey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a collaborator by nature," he says. "I went out to Glenn's house the 
other day and I just had the beginning of a song. I threw it at him and he 
picked up on the idea and we finished it that day. It felt wonderful writing 
with Glenn again. I left his house walking on air . . . just to know that we 
can still do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If everything goes right, the five sold-out Irvine Meadows concerts and one 
sold-out Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion show are just the start of what may be 
a yearlong Eagles assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The band has already taped a two-hour special that will be shown on MTV in 
September -- around the release of a live album from the taping. It will 
include studio versions of four new songs -- two of them written by Henley and 
Frey. 
</P>
<P>
 The first leg of the tour is scheduled to end Oct. 8 at the Rose Bowl or the 
L.A. Coliseum, but the shows are likely to continue overseas until next spring. 
In all, the tour could gross up to $100 million in the United States and 
possibly another $50 million overseas, sources say. T-shirts and other 
merchandise at concerts could add another $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The album could gross $125 million to $150 million, based on projections of 10 
million in worldwide sales. But there are complications with the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Because its old Elektra Records contract has expired, the band is a free agent 
that can sign with any label. The problem is that Henley and Frey have 
contracts with Geffen Records and MCA Records, respectively, and both labels 
have warned that they'll sue if the artists make an Eagles album -- on the 
grounds that the artists are tied exclusively to their labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The band could release the album anyway and deal with the lawsuits, or release 
it on MCA-owned Geffen Records, perhaps as a way for Henley and Frey to gain 
their release from the labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen may be willing to take the live album in lieu of two more Henley albums 
on the grounds the Eagles album will outsell them -- and that could end what 
has been a bitter legal squabble. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that all the $300 million will go to the Eagles. Azoff and Lopez decline 
to discuss a breakdown of the potential gross, but sources say bands on a 
stadium-arena tour should walk away after expenses with about 40% to 50% of the 
box-office take and about $2 per album sold. This could conceivably mean $75 
million to $85 million for the Eagles under the best-case scenario. It is 
assumed that Henley and Frey -- as founding members -- will receive the largest 
share of that. Both have earmarked an unspecificed amount -- believed to be in 
the millions -- for various charities, including environmental and humanitarian 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the figures involved, this isn't a case of Don and Glenn being 
desperate for money," says someone close to the band. "They have made so much 
money from Eagles publishing that they can live comfortably the rest of their 
lives. This tour is something they wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the debate over ticket prices and whether "greed" is the motivating 
factor, the reason there is so much interest in an Eagles reunion is the music. 
</P>
<P>
 That must be a bittersweet irony for a band that saw its efforts widely 
criticized in the late '70s by various forces -- including the emerging punk 
generation -- as too laid back, irrelevant and overly cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought every song we did smelled like a rose," Henley says now. 
"There is some of the stuff that Glenn and I listen back to now and we cringe. 
But that's the way it always goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were just trying to figure out our place in the world. It's not so 
different now from all these kids in Seattle and the grunge groups. Anger is 
one of the primary motivators of rock 'n' roll and there is always a certain 
hopelessness out there." 
</P>
<P>
 About the cynicism charge, he adds: 
</P>
<P>
 "Back when we were accused of being hopeless and cynical, I always thought 
there was a lot of hope and idealism in what we were writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to encourage people to stand on their own two feet . . . to 
see that idols of any kind, whether they be rock 'n' roll or religious, 
generally have feet of clay. I think a lot of our songs were memos to 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 With the tour approaching, the mood at the rehearsal was businesslike, even 
subdued -- as if everyone involved was saving his energy for the days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, 46, who is living on a boat in Marina del Rey while earthquake damage 
at his Studio City house is being repaired, compared the six-day-a-week 
sessions to baseball's spring training, where everyone is trying to get in 
shape for the long season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really felt good right away," says the upbeat Schmit, who lives in 
Woodland Hills with his wife and their two children. "There is something about 
playing with a certain group of people that you can't replace . . . a 
connection that works." 
</P>
<P>
 The enthusiasm is tempered by the memories of how everything was torn apart 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the time in the back of everybody's mind there was the kind 
of yearning for it to come back together, yet also kind of afraid of 
re-entering the whole thing," says Felder, 46, a father of four who lives in 
Malibu with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all remember what happened last time and we remember the good and the bad 
. . . and we hope that we are all older, more mature now and can learn from the 
mistakes. So far, it has been great. But I think we are prepared that if it 
stops being fun, it'll stop -- just as it stopped before." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone is counting on that maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 There was such an adult ring to the Eagles' material that it's surprising to 
realize that Henley and Frey were roughly the age of such troubled '90s youth 
spokesmen as the late Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder when they were writing many 
of the Eagles hits. Frey and Henley were in their late 20s when "Hotel 
California" was released in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one big difference is we have learned how to differentiate between 
what to worry about and what not to worry about," says Henley, who is single 
and has a house in Los Angeles -- and who tends to be the most philosophical of 
the band members. "We used to worry about and try to control everything that 
went on . . . instead of just worrying about the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Frey, who also has a house in Los Angeles, is the most outgoing member of the 
band, the kind of guy who could have been the star quarterback and class 
president in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the now deserted rehearsal stage, he is asked about his 1982 "Greed 
and Lost Youth" remark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am prepared to be called 'Jurassic rock' and I'm prepared for certain 
people to not want to believe it is sincere . . . that we are just in it for 
the money," Frey says of the reunion tour. "But we have turned down millions 
and millions in corporate sponsorship on this tour. Besides, I don't think 
anyone who bought the tickets complained about the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Henley earlier on the same topic, Frey catches himself tensing and sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we can prove ourselves is through the music," he says finally. 
"That's why we had to all be committed to this to make it work. This isn't 
something we can just walk through. I wouldn't have gotten near this if I 
thought we were going to embarrass ourselves. My nightmare is to have the 
Eagles end up like the old (washed-up) heavyweight fighters and have people 
say, 'Gee, the Eagles should have never come back. . . . They got murdered.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles open their tour Friday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, and continue 
there Saturday, next Sunday, May 31 and June 1. They play June 3 at the Glen 
Helen Blockbuster Pavilion. All these shows, which begin at 8 p.m., are sold 
out.

LOOKING OUT FOR LASSIE; HOLLYWOOD LOVES ANIMALS (THEY WORK CHEAPER THAN 
ACTORS), BUT THE WELL-BEING OF FOUR-LEGGED STARS ON THE SET IS LEFT ALMOST 
ENTIRELY UP TO THE TRAINERS. ACTIVISTS SAY THAT'S NOT NEARLY GOOD ENOUGH

 During filming in Minnesota last year of Disney's "Iron Will" -- the story of 
a farm boy's triumph in a 1917 dog-sledding race -- a staged fight between two 
dogs resulted in one receiving a cut near the eyelid. The scene was shot in two 
takes, each lasting less than 10 seconds, under the supervision of the film's 
animal coordinator and an officer from the American Humane Assn. Each dog was 
muzzled by use of a clear plastic-coated wire secured around its snout and the 
back of its head. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these precautions, one dog's canine tooth apparently slipped through 
the muzzle. "It was nothing serious or major," says Ed Lish, the American 
Humane Assn. officer at the shoot. "We quit right there." The injured dog was 
taken to a veterinarian and its wound sutured. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident on "Iron Will" serves as a reminder of the dangers that animals 
face when performing in movies and television even under carefully controlled 
conditions. With animal rights now a prominent emotional issue, Hollywood's 
treatment of animal actors is coming under increased scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the familiar disclaimer that appears at the end of movies, the 
welfare of animals used in Hollywood is left almost entirely to the 
professionalism of trainers, some of whom say their bids are increasingly 
undercut by competitors; to movie producers under pressure to control 
below-the-line costs, and to the American Humane Assn.'s ability to police 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Long cherished by studios because they are relatively cheap to produce, movies 
starring animals are especially popular now because they provide unambiguous 
"family entertainment" and can make tons of money on slender budgets. 
(Universal Pictures' two "Beethoven" movies together have grossed more than 
$200 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the use of animals in all types of movies is growing. According to 
the AHA, only 10% of films produced in 1988 employed animals; this spring, more 
than 50% of productions include them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the nonprofit AHA sets lengthy guidelines for the treatment of 
animals used in films, reviews scripts and sends its representatives to monitor 
film and television shoots, it is allowed on sets solely through a clause in 
the collective bargaining agreement between the Screen Actors Guild and the 
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which states that the AHA 
must be sent a script when animals are used and that the AHA representatives 
may be present during shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 While film and television producers cannot bar the AHA's representatives from 
sets, the association's recommendations can, theoretically, be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, says Betty Denny Smith, director of the AHA's Los Angeles office, "it's 
very rare that you come across a production that will want to do something that 
we told them is against the guidelines. They can't kick us off the set; they 
can't fire us. We're there to say: 'No, you can't do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But should AHA representatives witness acts that violate laws regarding humane 
animal treatment -- and the association says its guidelines exceed California's 
strict anti-cruelty laws -- their legal recourse is the same as an ordinary 
citizen's. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can go to the local D.A. and swear out a complaint and bring criminal 
charges if they so choose," says Ingrid Newkirk, chairwoman of People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals, the Washington-based animal-rights group. "How 
many do, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 "The American Humane Association has no power of enforcement," says game-show 
host Bob Barker, an animal activist and outspoken critic of the AHA. "They are 
observers. They have no more power than a stagehand on a set." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith maintains that the AHA's work is primarily preventive; citing filmmakers 
for animal cruelty after the fact runs counter to its mission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The AHA screens movies featuring animals before they are released, then rates 
them Acceptable (the association supervised the production and found no 
cruelty); Believed Acceptable (the AHA wasn't present but is satisfied the 
animal action complies with its guidelines); Questionable (the AHA wasn't 
present, no information available on the film's animal action), and 
Unacceptable (animal cruelty occurred during production). The ratings are 
published in the association's magazine, the Advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker says that the AHA "would have you believe that movie companies cringe 
with fear about being on the Unacceptable list" but charges that the average 
moviegoer does not know the list even exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith says that "if anyone wants the list, they can have it" and that the AHA 
publicizes the ratings by sending them to other humane societies, which print 
them in their own publications. "It's amazing how many people wait to see" the 
ratings before attending movies, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker and Nancy Burnet, director of United Activists for Animal Rights, the 
grass-roots organization Barker is associated with, were sued for libel and 
slander by Smith and the AHA in 1989, partly over allegations made by Barker 
and the UAAR about the 1987 movie "Project X." Barker had charged that 
chimpanzees were beaten and otherwise abused during the making of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by evidence gathered by Barker and UAAR, the Los Angeles City 
Department of Animal Regulation conducted a three-month investigation and 
recommended that the district attorney's office bring criminal charges against 
six animal trainers involved with the film. (The trainers and the AHA, whose 
representatives were present during filming, have denied that the chimps were 
abused.) No criminal charges were filed, because the statute of limitations for 
the charges had run out. Filing civil charges in the case was considered but 
dropped because of conflicting testimony and lack of "overwhelming evidence" of 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker and other defendants finally settled the $120-million suit out of court 
last month for $315,000. Both sides promptly began attacking each other in 
full-page ads in the Hollywood trade papers. Barker says that he was eager for 
the case to go to court, that it was settled only because of his insurance 
company's concern over the expense of a trial and that his attorneys will file 
a motion to have a protective order covering the case lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have material obtained under discovery that we cannot reveal to the public 
because of the protective order," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Information from court documents obtained by the Hollywood Reporter showed 
that the AHA has received more than $100,000 in donations from the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America, as well as financial contributions from other 
organizations with close ties to the film business. The AHA and Smith denied 
that the donations represent any conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker remains critical of the AHA's methods. "I don't feel animals are given 
adequate protection -- I think the system has failed," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the AHA says, the association receives lists of upcoming 
productions from SAG, scripts are searched for animal action, and the AHA 
reviews those scenes with the producers and tries to ensure that they are shot 
in accordance with the association's guidelines. The association also culls the 
Hollywood trade papers for productions that have not submitted scripts, 
requesting that they comply. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The AHA's Los Angeles office, Smith says, reviewed more than 700 scripts last 
year and was present on 340 productions. However, the L.A. office currently 
employs only six regular representatives and one training officer, although 
Smith says the association maintains nine part-time regional representatives 
and calls on local affiliates across the country to represent it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The AHA would admit that certainly they aren't usually (on sets)," says 
PETA's Newkirk. "It's unrealistic and impossible, given all the films in which 
animals are used, for them to be present for even the tiniest percentage of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith says, "I would say we are on almost every set," but she acknowledges 
that on films with "simple animal action in an area where it would be too 
expensive to send someone," they are not. 
</P>
<P>
 When the film industry is left to its own devices, its treatment of animals 
has sometimes bordered on the grotesque. The AHA first found its way onto movie 
sets in 1939 amid outrage over the filming of "Jesse James," in which a stunt 
rider rode his horse off a 70-foot cliff into white water, breaking the horse's 
back. Until 1966, the association was allowed to oversee productions under a 
clause in the old Hays Code. When the Hays office -- and with it, the AHA's 
official access -- was dissolved, the AHA continued to try to attend shoots; in 
one instance it says it was barred, at gunpoint, from the set of "The Legend of 
the Lone Ranger." After the association organized a boycott of "Heaven's Gate" 
at about the same time, in 1980 -- during the filming of which, it says, 
several animals were injured or killed -- the AHA's entree on film productions 
was restored through the present SAG-AMPTP agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 While Smith says that the treatment of animals in Hollywood is "a world above 
what used to go on, from everything I've been told about the old days," others 
contend that animal abuse continues but goes unreported because whistle-blowers 
fear retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who make waves are not popular in Hollywood," says UAAR's Burnet. 
"It's a very closed industry. They know if they talk, they'll be blackballed." 
</P>
<P>
 There are stories of animals drugged ("I know it's been done," says a 
trainer). Of trainers who wildly underestimate jobs when bidding, then find 
themselves completely unprepared to do them once shooting has begun. Of the TV 
producer who, upon seeing a trainer shelter his dog with an umbrella after a 
rigorous take, sneered: "You're kissing his ass -- you're making us all kiss 
his ass." Of the animal film in which the star, according to reports PETA's 
Newkirk received from a source on the set, "was confined all the time, was 
intimidated by its handler, was yelled at" and displayed "the classic fear 
position of its tail between the legs and urinating when spoken to." 
</P>
<P>
 With the emergence of animal rights on the national agenda, philosophical 
schisms are emerging among trainers over acceptable techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the old trainers think in the old ways, like the old circus people," 
Newkirk says. "All that's changed, and the old trainers haven't changed with 
the times. In our dealings with animal trainers, we learned that many don't 
know what the federal animal welfare act requires of them, and their feelings 
are that animals are no more than props that are quite expendable if the price 
is right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is no professional accreditation for TV and movie animal trainers; they 
are hired, like any big-name human star, on the basis of their past credits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have done a big-name film, and all they've got to say is, 'I did 
that,' and the producers don't check beyond that -- that happens a lot ," says 
an animal trainer who has worked in the film business for 20 years. Animals and 
trainers are sometimes contracted through a production's prop department and 
paid accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can still get most animals cheaper than a piece of equipment," says Clint 
Rowe, animal trainer on "Turner & Hooch" and "Down and Out in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gary Gero, owner of Birds & Animals Unlimited, one of the industry's 
leading animal suppliers, says that although animals used in incidental scenes 
may be hired through prop departments, "if the animal is of any significance 
(to the production), it's generally hired through the executive producer, the 
line producer or sometimes the studio head. They do extensive background checks 
before you're called." 
</P>
<P>
 With the increased use of animal actors, competition among trainers has become 
ferocious. 
</P>
<P>
 Gero says the competition has lifted the overall quality of the business. "The 
standards have been rising rapidly, the qualifications are becoming higher," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other trainers say the opposite has occurred. "Each job is: 'This is the way I 
need things done -- I need 15 days,' " Rowe says. "But one of my competitors 
can say, 'I can do it in five.' " Rather than compromise his standards, Rowe 
says, "I have to take the risk of losing that job." 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot, trainers say, is "gimmicking" animal behaviors that normally take 
weeks or months to train. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can gimmick any sequence you want. Of course, when you teach it, it 
becomes more expensive; therefore, you'll lose a job if you're not willing to 
gimmick," says Doug Seus, a longtime animal trainer. "The professional isn't 
going to do these things. To do the job humanely, you need more money and 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Says trainer Jim Colovin: "Whenever you place unreasonable time constraints 
and financial chokeholds on quality trainers, it forces (them) to compete with 
people who are more than willing to 'do what it takes' to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, rather than using a dog trained to limp, a trainer can wedge a 
marble in the paw of an untrained dog. Or a dog can be made to appear to growl 
by wearing a "snarl cup" prosthetic that pushes back its lips and exposes its 
canines. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Camp, the animal coordinator on "Iron Will," says the four-month 
preparation time for the film was "very comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney allowed us to show up (on location) eight weeks in advance to allow 
the dogs to get used to the climate," he says. "Everything I asked for, they 
gave me, but everything I asked for, they checked to see if it was legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the AHA guidelines stipulate that fight scenes between animals "shall 
be simulated," there is no clear-cut definition of what, exactly, constitutes a 
simulated fight or where a real one begins. Some trainers argue that muzzling 
dogs -- which the AHA permits -- effectively allows them to actually fight, 
albeit without usually harming one another physically. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the fight scene in "Iron Will," in which both dogs were muzzled, 
Camp says the dogs were allowed to interact with each other until the more 
dominant of the pair began to assert himself over the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't fight dogs," he says. "All we're doing is letting a dog display some 
of that dominance. We're not even going to the threshold of fighting. If it 
comes anywhere near that, you stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another technique for staging fights -- so-called play fighting, 
which trainer Colovin says he developed 20 years ago. Dogs are trained to 
roughhouse with each other on command, much the way dogs raised together 
sometimes gambol unbidden. Although it looks ferocious, the dogs are not, 
according to Colovin, emotionally or physically fighting. The tip-off: During a 
play fight, the dogs wag their tails (which may be tied down to preserve the 
illusion of aggression). Colovin is convinced that play fighting is "far better 
for humane treatment as well as looking more realistic." But it also can take 
more time and money to train and execute a play fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Rowe, who has used both muzzled and play fights, says he has sworn off 
the former, even though, he says, "if they're done properly, nobody gets hurt." 
But, he adds, "my standard is not to do them. I don't like them; they feel 
violent. And they look phony. I did simulated dog fights on 'White Fang,' and 
they look great." Because the dogs realize they are playing, it's unnecessary 
to muzzle them as they grapple and bare their fangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is you can teach a fight without a muzzle," says 
trainer Seus. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rowe: "We're trainers and should be able to train that. I like to have 
control of what my animals do." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the whole notion of animals performing before cameras has been 
called into question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, an animal in an acting situation doesn't really know why he's 
doing something over and over again," says PETA's Newkirk. "We ask: What's the 
tangible suffering here? Mental stress is very real for many animals." 
</P>
<P>
 PETA, Newkirk says, would "hold filmmakers to a higher standard by far" than 
the AHA does. "They are not opposed to a lot of things that we are, and they 
don't go as far as we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Says AHA's Smith: "We believe animals can be and are used humanely, and that's 
what we're there to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers, meanwhile, aren't eager for the more militant animal-rights groups 
to assert themselves in the film business for fear they would try to greatly 
curtail or even outlaw animal actors altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see animals continue in movies, not only for my own livelihood but 
for the contribution they make," says one trainer. "For some city people, the 
only time they see animals is in films." 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere in this industry and country is very pro-animal now," says 
Gero of Birds & Animals Unlimited. "This industry is very humane. Without 
exception, the people on shows love the animals. It's an insult to the industry 
even to intimate that a crew would let something bad happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my problems with the industry," says Rowe. "Everybody does. It's a 
business, and (the studios') business is to bring (a movie) in at low cost. As 
long the job gets done and the animals' welfare is OK, then you're OK."

IN THE MOVIES, EVERYONE HAS A HOME; HOLLYWOOD REALLY DOESN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT THE 
PROBLEM OF THE HOMELESS, PREFERRING TO MAKE IT SUGAR SWEET AND SERVE IT UP FOR 
THE MASSES; FILM COMMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, Peter Rainer is a Times staff writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 What does Hollywood make of homeless people? In the mythology of popular 
culture, the rich are different from you and me. The idealized poor represent 
moral rectitude in a land of plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless stand for something far more grim and condemnatory. They are 
perceived as being beyond poor -- beyond class, beyond hope. And yet their 
spectral teeming presence on the streets testifies to a rotting within the 
society they seem so marginally, yet fundamentally, a part of. 
</P>
<P>
 The "issue" of homelessness, at least for those of us who are sheltered, pulls 
on our every sinew of political prejudice and guilt. For both the homeless and 
for those who seek to "understand" them and dramatize them, the moral effort is 
finally the same: It's all about the struggle to remain human. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a struggle Hollywood movies -- with their prefab plots and prefab 
people -- are ideally suited for. There is no Hollywood equivalent to an 
uncompromising shocker like Hector Babenco's great "Pixote" (1981), about 
street kids in Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 In those occasional modern instances where our movies have touched on 
homelessness -- in such films as "With Honors," "The Saint of Fort Washington," 
"Life Stinks," "Where the Day Takes You," the action thrillers "Hard Target" 
and "Surviving the Game," "The Fisher King" or, before that, "Down and Out in 
Beverly Hills" and the recently revived "Midnight Cowboy" -- the idealizations 
and evasions are startling and yet perfectly understandable as show-biz 
strategies for coping with the enormity. For the most part, the homeless in our 
movies are depicted as martyred visionaries, sages or chattel. You won't learn 
much from these films about the real causes and conditions of homelessness, but 
you will learn a lot about how these conditions are camouflaged and candied and 
served up for a mass audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The current "With Honors," for example, collides homelessness and Harvard: 
It's high concept with a sociology degree. Monty, played by Brendan Fraser, is 
a senior majoring in political science who plans to work for the government one 
day to "help people." (What people? Help how? It's all kind of fuzzy.) Simon, 
played by Joe Pesci, is the homeless man who, through a series of 
implausibilities, latches onto Monty's only copy of his 100-page senior thesis 
and, in exchange for favors, hands back to the boy a page at a time -- a page 
for each favor. Pretty soon, Simon is camping out in an abandoned VW van in the 
front yard of the house Monty shares with three other roommates. Like Monty, 
they take their time warming up to this ragamuffin. But Monty is fatherless and 
Simon walked out years ago on his wife and son to join the Merchant Marine and, 
well, you can figure it out. Bonding, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 Simon represents the homeless as folkloric sage. The twitty, elitist society 
represented by Harvard -- the world of top-dog achievers -- exists for him to 
tweak. He may look like a Dickensian chimney sweep, but he quotes passages from 
Whitman and he comes bearing the gifts of hard-knocks wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 When Monty takes Simon to his political science class, his conservative 
professor, played by Gore Vidal in full snoot, chastises the boy for his 
squishy notions of democracy. Then Simon goes on the attack, lecturing the 
professor in sporty cadences about having "faith in the wisdom of people." 
Simon is in the movie to give Monty life lessons; he's grooming the good 
citizenry of the future. And the premed roomie who recoils at Simon gets 
slammed hard by him: "You know why you hate me? Because you look the way I 
feel." Touche !  
</P>
<P>
 His truth-telling hooks up to a larger conceit in movies about the destitute: 
that squalor leads to spirituality. In "The Fisher King" (1991), Robin 
Williams' Parry is a knight-errant in his own wild-eyed Manhattan fantasia; his 
crackbrained quest for the Holy Grail has metaphoric pizazz. He's the 
pure-in-heart dreamer whose loony, pained flights are magical transports. He 
even gets his Grail at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than any other film about the homeless, last year's "The Saint of 
Fort Washington" really stockpiles the magic-of-madness metaphors. It's a 
compendium of practically every haloed homily in the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Dillon's Matthew, abandoned by his mother, living in vacant tenements, is 
a diagnosed schizophrenic who takes pictures with a camera with no film in it 
-- metaphor alert! -- and hooks up with a black Vietnam vet, Danny Glover's 
Jerry, in Manhattan's prison-like Ft. Washington shelter. Jerry, who takes to 
calling the boy his son, sees the gentle Matthew for what he truly is: "Maybe 
you aren't schizo," he muses. "Maybe you just a saint." 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe he is. When Jerry's old shrapnel wounds act up, Matthew lays healing 
hands on him. The men dream of buying a station wagon and selling fresh produce 
out of the back. (It's like "Of Mice and Men" on wheels.) Their friendship has 
no racial component. Poverty, it seems, not only sanctifies, it also renders 
you colorblind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Standing apart from these sainted scenarios are movies like last year's "Hard 
Target" and the current "Surviving the Game" that depict the homeless as the 
bull's-eyes of blood sport. The vagrants in these films are still sanctified, 
but now it's as if all of society's viciousness has been unleashed upon them. 
It's the kind of exploitation filmmaking that allows an audience to unleash its 
own frustrations while still pretending social responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The action-thriller format also gets around another problem inherent in movies 
about the homeless. It short-circuits the usual slow slide to oblivion by 
giving its homeless hero a reason not only to survive but to prevail. The point 
is that no matter how far down you go you still have something to lose -- your 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 In these latest pulp reworkings of "The Most Dangerous Game" (1932), the 
homeless are employed as human prey for the delectation of a gaggle of sickos. 
In "Hard Target," one of the prey is a black Vietnam vet; in "Surviving the 
Game," the hunted is an inner-city black man, played by Ice-T, who is first 
seen teaming up with a kindly old white scavenger as they get rousted by the 
cops for trying to steal food.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ice-T character, we eventually learn, went on the skids because the 
villainous local building inspectors didn't care about his run-down 
neighborhood, resulting in the loss of his family in an apartment fire. His 
employers in the ensuing hunting expedition -- this street-smart guy somehow 
believes he's being hired as a "survival guide" -- have each been selected by 
the filmmakers to push a different alarm button in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutger Hauer, the blood sport's ringleader, for example, is the movie's 
all-purpose Aryan super-scum. F. Murray Abraham, playing "one of the most 
feared men on Wall Street," defends the hunt to his cowardly (i.e., humane) son 
by explaining that the prey is "less than nothing." Gary Busey's role is a 
twofer: He's a psychiatrist, and a psychotic, who also works for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surviving the Game" demonstrates how pulp, irresponsibly but effectively, 
often gets at an audience's social prejudices and fears in a way that more 
genteel movies don't. The film places you in the position of being both the 
hunter and the hunted and, in assigning blame for the homeless situation, which 
it casts in starkly racial terms, it punches up a familiar rogue's gallery: 
White supremacists, racist capitalists, mental health workers, predatory 
government agencies. It's all there, in paranoid microcosm. 
</P>
<P>
 American movies, particularly beyond the Depression years, have often been 
notoriously leery about pointing up class differences -- we are, after all, 
supposed to be living in a classless society. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the situations of class are unavoidable in movies about homeless 
people. During the Depression, which is the last time homelessness really made 
it to our screen in a big way, the class system in America was recognized -- 
but only as a kind of mobile walkway that anybody could ride to riches and 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 A comedy like the 1936 "My Man Godfrey" was emblematic of its era: William 
Powell played a millionaire scion down on his luck (because of a woman) who is 
retrieved from a shantytown by a loopy socialite family as the prize in a 
scavenger hunt and then hired as their butler. (How different the hunt was 
then!) Like Simon in "With Honors," Powell's Godfrey dispenses life lessons and 
then, reacquainted with his riches, converts the shantytown into a prosperous 
nightclub with his old hobo buddies as employees.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter how bleak the Depression-era movies were, they almost always upheld 
the traditional institutions of society -- the churches, social agencies, the 
military, even the banks. The struggle in those films for its homeless people 
was how to fit back into that society, not how to drop out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 By the '60s, a film like "Midnight Cowboy" could ride the counterculture crest 
by featuring two essentially harmless dreamers, Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo 
and Jon Voight's Joe Buck, awash in a society too depraved to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Corruption was everywhere, from the heartland to the urban jungle to Upper 
East Side boudoirs. The movie plugged into a sentimental hate-America ethic 
that gave Joe and Ratso's dejection a (dubious) social meaning. These homeless 
waifs wanted to make their home in a society that didn't deserve them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a film like Paul Mazursky's 1986 comedy "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," 
the well-off in society still didn't deserve them, but they coveted them. Nick 
Nolte's shaggy-dog Jerry is a hippie mirror image of his Beverly Hills 
benefactor, played by Richard Dreyfuss. They admire each other's gumption -- 
the movie is a celebration of gumption. And Jerry, too, transmits life lessons 
to his benefactors, changing each of their lives for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal in movies about the homeless has always been to a sense of 
community. (And a sense of community is what we fear we have lost in modern 
life.) During the Depression, the community was the hobo jungles filled with 
Forgotten Men, but the larger community was the traditional moneyed society 
these men (and women) sought to re-enter. In the public mind, these Forgotten 
were blameless for their plight. In the '60s, the homeless were blameless too 
-- they were viewed as outcasts oppressed by society. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless in our current movies operate in a more divided zone. Although 
typically they are portrayed by Hollywood as essentially blameless for their 
condition, the society in which they exist is all too ready to blame them, or 
at least to feel a frustrated compassion. The idealization of the homeless in 
these movies resembles the ways in which Hollywood tends to idealize minorities 
in general. There's an element of condescension and special pleading in the 
attempt, as if we wouldn't be interested in these people if they weren't wiser 
or purer in heart than we are. The treatment denies their rage -- it 
pastoralizes them. It also represents a kind of charity extended to the 
homeless. It's as if a more realistic portrayal would seem unnecessarily cruel 
-- yet one more injury inflicted upon them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This idealization is about something else as well. In most movies we are 
encouraged to regard the characters with no thought that they, in effect, might 
also be looking back at us. But the presence of the homeless in these movies is 
implicitly accusatory. In real life we may want to look away when confronted 
with the real thing -- as we enter or leave the movie theater, perhaps. But in 
the movies we don't look away, and there's a measure of guilt -- of a judgment 
received -- in our response. The romanticization of homeless people is a way of 
dignifying those who wait in judgment. We want them to think well of us. 
</P>
<P>
 What these movies do not acknowledge is that, in the most complicated sense, 
they are us.*

 We all know that "Maverick" started out as a TV series, running on ABC from 
1957 to 1962, with numerous cast changes over the years. In those days, "adult" 
Western dramas ruled the airwaves, much like today's so-called reality shows.In 
1960, there were 21 Westerns on the prime-time schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In Warner Bros.' big screen version of "Maverick," the film's climactic poker 
game shows card tables sprinkled with faces familiar from past TV Westerns. 
Director Richard Donner said he wanted those actors in the film as "an homage 
to the TV cowboy, and especially to Jim Garner. It's my way of saying 'thank 
you.' It may not be a major part, but they all brought something to the movie." 
</P>

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: JURASSIC PORK;

 Even if you think you've heard all the hype surrounding "The "Flintstones," 
chances are you haven't heard much about the chop-bustingly huge food that's a 
large part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding Gargantuan grub was no mean feat: cocktail olives the size of tennis 
balls, deviled eggs the size of footballs and a mouthwatering Brontoburger the 
size of a basketball -- all in the line of duty for food stylist Wendy Loring 
Blasdel. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasdel, a former pastry chef with a Los Angeles-based company, Edible Style, 
spent about four months researching, locating and creating the larger-than-life 
concoctions for "The Flintstones," which opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Try finding several five-foot-long banana squash, four-foot-long "Bronto ribs" 
and foot-wide mushrooms in your average supermarket. But appropriately enough, 
the Hollywood produce market -- in which vendors display their wares each week 
-- did provide a few of the larger-than-life foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasdel, who also whipped up a film feast for 'raptors and children in 
"Jurassic Park," and buffalo livers for Kevin Costner in "Dances With Wolves," 
initially haunted produce markets around Southern California, but eventually 
had to contact special growers in Ventura County and Colorado to fill the 
film's special orders.  
</P>
<P>
 She rode through vegetable fields in Santa Barbara and in the process felt a 
bit like a Lilliputian when she stumbled upon shrub-sized heads of lettuce.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were four feet tall and they had all gone to seed," Blasdel said. "The 
growers couldn't use the lettuce because it had turned bitter. They had kept it 
around just as an oddity." 
</P>
<P>
 She also managed to find the five-foot-long banana squash and foot-wide 
Portobello mushrooms that were used atop giant steaks for a restaurant scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the edible treats, however, had to be created, including two-foot-tall 
strawberries made of plaster and a seven-foot drumstick, which filled a 
refrigerator the size of a walk-in closet. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't find an animal that has a leg that big," Blasdel said.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: CARRY ON, GUV'NORS; 
WORKING TITLE HAS LOTS OF COMEDY TITLES WORKING 
</P>

<P>
 When it comes to movies, one of the toughest exports is comedy. As a rule, 
humor doesn't transcend cultures well. But the London-based Working Title Films 
is determined to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding high on the box-office windfall of their romantic comedy "Four Weddings 
and a Funeral" and what seems to be a growing American appetite for British 
movies, company co-chairmen Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner are banking on five more 
comedies. The secret, they say, lies in films that either have American stars 
with a British sensibility, or English actors with a Hollywood twist -- while 
avoiding political and racial controversies, and emphasizing romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider these: 
</P>
<P>
 * An untitled European romantic spoof, with a screenplay spun by the 
mastermind of the "Naked Gun" movies, Pat Proft, who satirizes Merchant Ivory 
films. Production begins in August. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Paris Match," a $30-million romantic comedy, directed by Lawrence Kasdan 
and starring Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan, that starts shooting in September.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Mr. Bean," featuring a wacky British character played by Rowan Atkinson, 
the bumbling clergyman in "Four Weddings." The $10-million project is set for a 
Christmas '95 release. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Loch Ness," a family adventure about the Scottish myth, scheduled for next 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Moonlight and Valentino," written by Neil Simon's daughter Ellen, also for 
next year.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think these pictures will work because they'll strike a chord, not because 
we're in some sort of British fad phase right now," says Michael Kuhn, 
president of Polygram Filmed Entertainment, the parent of Working Title. 
"There's been a saturation or overexposure of American comedy here with it on 
every TV channel you turn to. People are just looking for something fresh and 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 And at least one American, Russell Schwartz, is going to make the best of it. 
His marketing campaign for the Merchant Ivory spoof: "I'll put that film in 
every theater that every Merchant Ivory film has ever been in." And where 
producer Merchant famously heralds the premieres of each of his movies with a 
feast, "we'll have a food fight!"*

DANA PARSONS: ACLU STANCE ON CAMERA-TOTING COPS WARRANTS SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those "traditional values" people over at the ACLU are at it again. Once again 
their reward for protecting people's rights probably will be to receive a 
pasting from much of the local citizenry and power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 I just don't get it. In a county that supposedly prides itself on traditional 
values, you'd think the ACLU would be most welcomed around here. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well. I guess it's all a matter of whose traditional value is being gored. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union has riled the feathers of Orange County's 
conservative populace more than once over the years. This time, the 
organization is suing Garden Grove for the Police Department's practice of 
taking pictures of suspected gang members who they encounter out on the street. 
The current case involves two Asian American teen-age girls who were 
photographed after being stopped by officers. The girls were not detained for 
any suspected criminal activity but were photographed anyway, all the while 
denying to the police they were gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU jumped into the case (what took them so long?), arguing that the 
girls' rights were violated. Garden Grove and other police departments that 
wield the Polaroid cite it as an effective tool in fighting the county's 
mushrooming gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone supports anti-gang measures, but it should make us nervous that 
police departments are photographing people on the basis of their suspicion 
that they might be gang members. One of the girls involved in the lawsuit 
against Garden Grove said that in addition to photographing her and her friend, 
police took down information about their age, height, weight, eye color, hair 
color, home addresses and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't this give everyone the willies? Why isn't Orange County's corps of 
traditional values groups joining in to support the ACLU? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that "traditional values" are like Silly Putty. They can be 
shaped and hardened to fit the whim of whoever's holding the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU has been bashed in recent years because the public often associates 
their lawyers with defending troublemakers. The ACLU's most celebrated local 
involvement came in its longstanding fight with the Sheriff's Department over 
better jail conditions for inmates. In Orange County, that isn't the kind of 
crusade that will win you many friends, but it's rooted in the traditional 
value of not stripping people of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in New York in 1920, the ACLU attained prominence by supporting John 
Scopes, the Tennessee schoolteacher who wanted to teach evolution, even though 
Tennessee law at the time prohibited it. The organization has taken on a wide 
variety of cases, many unpopular, because they're often siding with minorities 
up against the imposing weight of the system, such as their defense of 
Jehovah's Witnesses who felt that their children saluting the flag in public 
schools violated their religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has been an equal-opportunity irritant. Locally, the ACLU has argued 
against publicly funded Nativity scenes but also opposed Hanukkah 
menorah-lighting ceremonies in a public park. The group went to bat for a young 
hemophiliac who was HIV-positive and who school officials wanted to ban from 
classes. The ACLU has challenged policies as diverse as sobriety checkpoints 
and a school district's decision to deny free breakfasts to underprivileged 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, the ACLU has been steadfast in supporting individual rights. 
In return, it has become a whipping boy for conservatives who apparently like 
some traditional values but not others. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, this country prided itself on individual rights. We gulped 
and said we'd rather let 100 guilty men go free rather than execute one 
innocent man. Those silly gooses over at the ACLU still believe stuff like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU is quite right on the police photographing question, no matter how 
unpopular it may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a point of view needed to counter that espoused last week by Dan 
Quayle, in Orange County to promote his book. In his remarks, the former vice 
president referred at one point to the Clinton Administration in particular but 
no doubt meant to paint with a much wider brush: "They still have somewhat of a 
radical '60s mentality that believes in tearing down the Establishment, 
questioning the police, disdaining authority and trying to radically change our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing unconstitutional or unpatriotic about questioning the police. 
It is not automatically anti-Establishment to do so nor the equivalent of 
anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not paranoid about police but neither am I willing to grant them carte 
blanche to protect society. 
</P>
<P>
 I can live with them carrying guns and nightsticks. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't need cameras, too.

SCOTT HARRIS: KEEP CARDS COMING IN, FROM EI ERLAND

 Rick Rofman in Van Nuys writes: 
</P>
<P>
 Since rain and sleet and snow -- no obstacle to the U.S. Postal Service -- 
have put EuroDisney in the red, the snows of Gorman would render Ei erland a 
bad investment . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I believe (?) tax is included in the price of tickets to amusements, movies & 
sports, and it is added on to the price of toys at Disneyland & the Disney 
store.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Eisner's title is chairman & chief executive officer, not chairman of 
the bored (!!) . . . and the company's ZIP code is 91521, not 90521, which is 
in Torrance.  
</P>
<P>
 Miss Moneypenny? Please step into my office. 
</P>
<P>
 You're fired. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so hard to find good help these days. Thanks to Mr. Rofman, I now 
understand that my former secretary's incompetence must be the reason that 
Michael Eisner hasn't responded to my proposal that we team up to buy Gorman 
and create "Eisnerland." My dream is to build a fantasyland for grown-ups who 
wish to indulge in the lifestyles of the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it "Ei erland" is Rofman's suggestion. It's such a nice touch that 
I've already secured the copyright. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Rofman's doubts, I still have faith in the Ei erland concept. As I 
stated before, I am so confident that I am willing to invest the entire Harris 
family fortune if Mr. Eisner is willing to invest a mere 6 3/4% of his 1993 
earnings of $203.1 million to buy Gorman and form Eisner-Harris Imagineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty part is all the tax breaks we'll get. Mr. Rofman is correct that 
we'll have to charge sales tax on Ei erland toys and T-shirts. But, as Van Nuys 
tax activist Louis Barak can tell you, there will be no 8 1/2% sales tax on 
admission whatsoever! And when we book Barbra into the Eisner Concert Hall, 
when we feature Mike Tyson in his first fight since leaving prison, we won't 
have to charge any tax on those megabucks front row tickets! 
</P>
<P>
 As Mr. Rofman notes, there have been some financial troubles at EuroDisney. I 
would submit that California, business-wise, is a friendlier place than France. 
It is estimated that $800 million in local, state and federal money will be 
spent on freeway off-ramps, roads, parking and utilities to smooth the way for 
the $3-billion expansion of Disneyland. Surely, the politicians would smile on 
Ei erland as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Mr. Eisner will call later today. Meanwhile, there's some other mail 
to get to.

 It was nice to hear from Mrs. McDermott. A year ago, you see, we had a little 
feud. My fear was that I had made a permanent enemy or, worse, lost a reader. 
This time, she wrote concerning a column that delved into the controversy 
surrounding the alleged reading selections on the California Learning 
Assessment System (CLAS) exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Her letter was so terse that I couldn't tell what "what rubbish" referred to. 
Was it her opinion of my viewpoint or her opinion of the anti-CLAS views 
expressed by Debbie Greenfield? Greenfield, readers may recall, is a West Hills 
parent who sued the Los Angeles Unified School District over the controversial 
test. (She lost.) 
</P>
<P>
 Over the phone, Mrs. McDermott assured me it was the latter. She has little 
regard for the CLAS critics who see sinister motives and "anti-family" values 
within the exam. My point in mentioning Little Red Riding Hood was to state the 
obvious: that provocative notions may be found in just about any tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, it's a wonder Disney hasn't encountered CLAS-like 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. Isn't there something a bit weird about "Beauty and the 
Beast"? What happened to Donald Duck's pants? Isn't "Pirates of the Caribbean" 
a celebration of drunkenness, violence and crime? And what should we make of a 
song that goes: "Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Really, now. That seems more appropriate for Ei erland. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see. There's room here for just one more letter. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, I'll pick one that takes a more favorable view of Debbie 
Greenfield's ideas.

 Can you get me the chicken and dumpling recipe made by shredding flour

<P>
 Maybe they'll put it in the food section.  
</P>
<P>
 It's always stimulating to engage readers in a spirited debate over the 
important issues of the day. But then again, we all have to eat. Some readers 
were mortified by a passing reference to chicken-and-dumplings a la Greenfield. 
But some, like Peterson, were intrigued. Here's the secret recipe from the chef 
herself, and you won't find it on the CLAS test: 
</P>
<P>
 "All you do is take flour tortillas, preferably the thick ones, and slice them 
up into squares (about 2-inch by 2-inch), and throw them into the boiling 
broth."

 And some people wonder why I would be willing to give up such a great job just 
to build a theme park in Gorman.

RECORD CROWDS TAKE IN SUN, FUN AT STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL; OXNARD: AN ESTIMATED 
35,000 TO 40,000 ATTEND THE FIRST-DAY ACTIVITIES OF THE 11TH ANNUAL EVENT AT 
COLLEGE PARK.

<P>
 Navigating their baby stroller through the throngs Saturday, Strawberry 
Festival rookies Carol and Keith Carter rolled their eyes in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a little crowded," Downey resident Carol Carter said with a laugh 
while veering out of the path of another stroller on one of the narrow, 
tent-lined avenues at College Park in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard this was a good (festival) and decided to come," Keith Carter said, 
acknowledging that the family was surprised to encounter the massive crowds 
that turned out for the first day of the annual two-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 35,000 to 40,000 people attended the California Strawberry 
Festival Saturday, surpassing first-day attendance figures for past years, 
festival organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen so many people here in one day," said Supervisor John K. 
Flynn, co-chairman of the festival. "This is the 11th year of the event and 
this is the biggest." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70,000 people attended the two-day festival last year, and 
organizers expect to top that figure this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, about 100 people per minute were filing through the main gate 
into the fenced-off area of College Park, Flynn said. The park's capacity is 
about 70,000, he said, adding that the large turnout did not appear to cause 
too much crowding.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big park . . . so the comfort level is still there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn attributed the increase in attendance to the festival's growing 
popularity statewide and Saturday's warm temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather is absolutely perfect," he said. "Plus it's an enjoyable event. 
Everyone I see here is eating -- I've never seen so many people eating in all 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 county nonprofit groups prepared strawberry-oriented foods for sale 
at the event, including strawberry shortcake, crepes and pie. More adventurous 
eaters could choose from an extended menu of strawberry tamales, pizza and 
won-ton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a strawberry freak," said Natalie Solvason of Sylmar. "My favorite thing 
is the strawberry desserts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Solvason and a friend, Jeannie Keasler of Manhattan Beach, positioned 
themselves at the entrance of the festival amphitheater in order to make a 
quick dash to the food booths after The Temptations' 1 p.m. concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had any today," she said of the creamy fruit desserts. "But we'll 
get to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Solvason attended the festival two years ago and said she was surprised by how 
much it had grown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like there's a lot more things to do," she said. "It's a nice day -- 
for five bucks you can't beat it." 
</P>
<P>
 But 12-year-old LariAnne Nakamura of Oxnard said that with the exception of 
the strawberry tart toss contest, where competitors hurl desserts at the 
participants' faces, the festival was short on activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of boring," she said. "There's a lot of stuff to look at but not a 
lot to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard residents David Guera and Lorri Murphy and her son, Danny, found a 
patch of unoccupied grass in the festival amphitheater just in time to hear The 
Temptations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't believe how packed it was," Murphy said. "The whole festival is 
bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 South-Central Los Angeles residents Herschal and Caroline Christian walked 
away from the festival Saturday with their primary objective: a flat of red 
berries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came for the booths, the arts and crafts," Herschal Christian said. "But 
mainly for the berries."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard strawberry grower John Dullam hauled 400 flats of berries to College 
Park, and the Christians' flat was just one of dozens that Dullam sold 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a grower, it's good community relations and promotion for the product," 
Dullam said of the festival. "(And) it's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina residents Richard and Maria Ferra drove two hours with nine family 
members stuffed into their minivan for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to pull the seat out of the Toyota and put air in the tires," Maria 
Ferra said of the family trek. But the traffic, large crowds and long lines for 
food couldn't break their festival spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth it," she said. "It's a nice area and it's nice to get away."

ELECTIONS / CONGRESSIONAL RACES; GOP CONTEST TO CHALLENGE BEILENSON IS A TIGHT 
RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County voters on June 7 will cast ballots in two congressional 
primaries, including a competitive race in the Republican primary for the seat 
held by Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 In the county's other congressional district, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) is unopposed in the primary. Two little-known Democrats are vying to 
face the four-term incumbent in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, a nine-term congressman, faces a Democratic challenge from Scott 
Gaulke, a Sherman Oaks businessman who has run as a follower of political 
extremist Lyndon LaRouche. Five candidates are involved in a combative 
Republican primary in the same district, which includes Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are Mark Boos Benhard, a one-time aide to former Rep. William 
Dannemeyer of Orange County; Robert Hammer, a Newbury Park banking consultant; 
Sang Korman, a Newbury Park businessman; Emery Shane, a commercial real estate 
broker; and Richard Sybert, a former senior aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 All five candidates agree on the need to reduce crime, lower taxes, create 
more jobs and to curb illegal immigration. They also oppose President Clinton's 
five-year economic plan and his universal health care program. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the candidates are focusing their attacks not only on Beilenson, but 
on Sybert, who moved to the district less than a year ago to run for the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert is the apparent favorite of local officials, many of whom have endorsed 
him. And he has the most money to spend, having loaned his own campaign 
$430,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to distinguish themselves, all of the candidates are emphasizing 
their personal business or government experience as well as their differing 
philosophical and social views. Mark Boos Benhard  
</P>
<P>
 Benhard, 29, said he is the most conservative Republican and as such, "I am 
the only candidate that represents a real contrast to Tony Beilenson." 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard is almost as critical of his Republican opponent, Sybert, as he is of 
the Democratic congressman. He said both are career politicians who are 
originally from outside the 24th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I represent the opposite," Benhard said. "I've lived in the district all my 
life. And I'm a true fiscal conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard counts among his conservative supporters the California Republican 
Assembly as well as Rep. Robert K. Dornan and Dannemeyer, both known for their 
anti-abortion and anti-homosexual views. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Benhard said he would push to cut the capital gains tax, while 
providing tax relief to working families, including a $500 tax credit per 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will put an extra $1,000 or $1,500 back in people's pockets," he said. 
"I think they in turn will invest it back into the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard is also a strong supporter of "Save Our State," a proposed statewide 
initiative that would bar illegal immigrants in California from public 
hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're spending about $5 billion a year on illegal immigrants," said Benhard, 
the San Fernando Valley chairman of SOS. "That money could be used to build new 
infrastructure, schools and transportation systems." 
</P>
<P>
 His critics say that at 29, Benhard is too young and too inexperienced to be a 
congressman. But the candidate, who holds a bachelor's degree in political 
science from UCLA, said the three years he served in Washington as a 
congressional aide qualify him for the job. Robert Hammer  
</P>
<P>
 Hammer, 44, said his first priority if elected will be to turn back the "tax 
and spend" policies of the current Democratic administration, while reducing 
government regulations on business. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former business manager at First Interstate Bankcard Co. and now the 
owner of his own international banking consulting firm, Hammer said he would 
bring a strong and varied business perspective to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate wants to form a coalition of California's 52 representatives to 
help attract new businesses to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to work together as Californians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To further stimulate the California economy, Hammer said he would provide 
incentives for businesses to expand, including tax credits to businesses that 
buy their supplies locally. "We need to have 'Made In California' incentives," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer said he would also push for a fast-track teacher credentialing program 
to allow laid-off aerospace and defense workers to teach math and science 
classes in the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has accused Hammer, who holds a master's degree in psychology from the 
University of Kansas, of being unfit to serve in Congress because he has been 
an infrequent voter since moving to California in 1985. Since then, Hammer has 
voted in five elections, and most were after 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer notes that Sybert has never voted in the district. "What voters ought 
to be saying is, 'What have you done in this district?' " he said. "I've raised 
a family, and I've created jobs." Sang Korman  
</P>
<P>
 Korman, 56, has not run an active campaign, although he is registered as a 
candidate in the June primary. He did not return numerous phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Korman, who spent more than $800,000 of his own money in three previous 
Republican congressional bids, apparently had not spent more than $5,000 by 
mid-March, because he did not file a required finance statement. 
</P>
<P>
 A Korean American immigrant who made a fortune building shopping centers, 
Korman has said in the past that he would like to serve in Congress to help 
resolve U. S. trade problems with Far East nations. Emery Shane  
</P>
<P>
 Shane, 37, said he is the most qualified to help bring jobs to the 24th 
District because of his experience as a commercial real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the tax incentives that are needed," he said. "I know the regulations 
that need to be changed. I know what companies are looking for when they decide 
to relocate." 
</P>
<P>
 To make Southern California more attractive to business, Shane said government 
must first get a handle on crime. Himself a victim of an armed robbery, Shane 
said if elected he would push for federal funds to put more police officers on 
the street and to increase gang prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to stop crime first if we want to stop businesses from leaving 
California and our schools from going down as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his opponents, Shane said he supports tough legislation that would deny 
medical and education benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to fight a system that gives a welfare check to illegal immigrants, 
but makes potential employers wait years to get the proper permits to build," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane holds a bachelor's degree in international relations from the University 
of California and has been in the real estate business for 15 years. He is 
currently employed with the firm of Marcus & Millichap in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 While his critics point out that Shane has no government experience, he sees 
this "as an advantage." He said his business background is all the experience 
he needs to serve in Washington. Scott Gaulke  
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Beilenson's race in the district's Democratic primary is low key. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaulke, a 37-year-old LaRouche supporter, has run unsuccessfully for Congress 
three times. A property manager, he proposes to nationalize the Federal Reserve 
Board in order to extend $600 billion worth of credit to the public and private 
sectors to create new jobs by building schools, transit systems, waterways and 
other infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a depression, and we have to build our way out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaulke said he believed that illegal immigrants were being made "scapegoats 
for our economic collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal immigration is not what shut down our steel industry or our aerospace 
industry," he said, adding that Beilenson and others have tried to exploit the 
immigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He blamed the bad economy on banking and credit institutions. "When you 
control the credit of the country, you control industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, Gaulke said he opposes gun control and abortion -- except in 
cases where the mother's life is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 With no money and little name recognition, Gaulke said it doesn't matter if he 
loses the primary because his campaign is part of a larger movement by 
like-minded Democrats around the country to "take back the Democratic Party." 
Richard Sybert  
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, 41, has impressed party regulars and local officials with his 
government experience and his willingness to use his personal wealth in the 
race. An attorney, Sybert previously served for three years as director of the 
governor's Office of Planning and Research and is now president of Lanard Toys 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert's campaign has raised $473,000, including his large personal loan. 
Among his rivals, Hammer has the most money to spend, after loaning himself 
$61,160 of his $70,367 in contributions, according to statements filed in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a supporter of the death penalty, said crime is the No. 1 issue in the 
race. He proposes using military police to help patrol crime-plagued cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first duty of government is to provide safety for its citizens," he said. 
"Without it, nothing else will follow." 
</P>
<P>
 A supporter of the proposed "Save Our State" initiative, Sybert also proposes 
reforming the country's legal immigration laws to strictly limit new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate says his experience is unmatched by opponents. A Harvard Law 
School graduate and former partner in a Los Angeles law firm, Sybert was a 
White House Fellow and special assistant in the U. S. Department of Defense in 
1985-86; an assistant law professor at Loyola Law School from 1982 to 1990, and 
as state planning director from 1990 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert describes himself as a moderate Republican, one who is conservative on 
fiscal issues but with a "strong libertarian streak" on social issues. Along 
with Hammer, he is the only Republican candidate who supports abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his wife, Greta, is a former resident of Thousand Oaks, Sybert's 
opponents say he is vulnerable as a "carpetbagger," since he has lived in the 
district for less than a year. The former Pasadena resident now lives in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has no relevance as to who is best qualified to represent this 
district," Sybert said. "I was walking precincts in Los Angeles County for 
Ronald Reagan when Bob Hammer was still living in Kansas and before Mark 
Benhard was old enough to vote." Anthony C. Beilenson  
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, 61, who is in his 18th year in Congress, said he knew little about 
Gaulke and did not feel obliged to respond to "his nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he believes that illegal immigration is one of the most serious 
problems facing California, Beilenson said he does not support the proposed 
state measure that would ban essential benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he supports legislation that would provide money for more border 
guards and equipment and that would require the federal government to reimburse 
states for the cost of imprisoning illegal immigrants. He also backs a proposal 
to deny automatic citizenship to illegal residents' children who are born here. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he supports Clinton's crime bill that would provide 100,000 
additional police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Gaulke, Beilenson is pro-abortion rights and has been supportive of 
some gun-control laws, such as the Brady bill, the new federal law requiring a 
five-day waiting period to purchase a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's Republican opponents believe he will be vulnerable in the general 
election in November. They point out that the 1990 reapportionment of his 
district thrust the Westside-based Democrat with some liberal positions into a 
San Fernando Valley-based, mostly Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson surprised many Republicans by easily defeating former 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), an arch conservative, in 1992 to 
retain his seat. Elton Gallegly  
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura County-based 23rd district, Gallegly, 50, is unopposed in the 
Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he spent $862,061 to win reelection in 1992 in a hard-fought campaign 
against Democrat Anita Perez Ferguson, Gallegly has predicted that President 
Clinton's defense cuts will boost Republican candidates' chances in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an off-election year, and President Clinton has done a great deal to 
help the Republican Party," Gallegly said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who was first elected to Congress in 1986, has already stockpiled 
$133,073 in contributions for his campaign in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent will face either Ventura resident Kevin Ready or Frank 
Stephenson, a college placement consultant from Ojai, in the fall general 
election. Kevin Ready  
</P>
<P>
 Ready, 41, a Santa Barbara County deputy county counsel, describes himself as 
a moderate Democrat who strongly supports both Clinton's economic and health 
care programs. Ready said he does not support the proposed California 
initiative to cut benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is literally going to throw hundreds of thousands of kids out on the 
street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Ready proposes a crackdown on employers who hire undocumented 
workers. "We have good laws now," he said. "We're just not enforcing them." 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, Ready said the government needs to streamline the appeals process to 
make it tougher for prisoners to file frivolous appeals and lawsuits. 
"Thirty-three percent of our cases in federal court come from people already in 
prison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready graduated from the University of Denver College of Law. He has worked as 
a federal prosecutor and as an executive vice president of a petroleum 
exploration firm. He has also managed his own law practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready has received the endorsements of Ventura County Supervisor John K. 
Flynn, Santa Barbara County Supervisor Naomi Schwartz and several labor groups, 
including the California chapter of the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say he has neither the money nor the name recognition needed to wage a 
serious campaign against an entrenched incumbent like Gallegly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ready, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Iowa in 1984, said he 
believes he can raise enough money for the general election to wage an 
aggressive campaign focusing on the "ultra-conservative" voting record of 
Gallegly. Frank Stephenson  
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, 53, said he wants to redirect government efforts to assist the 
children of poor families. He said society is wasting its time and energy 
building prisons when it should be improving the living conditions and 
education of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to start at the beginning," he said. "Our economy, our crime rate, 
our welfare state, it's all a result of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson proposes taking money from public schools and universities to 
develop public boarding schools on military bases throughout the state to help 
change the lives of at-risk youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Civility is the foundation of civilization," he said. "We've got to teach 
kids to respect and love each other, not kill each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson agreed that the way to control illegal immigration is to fine 
employers and beef up border patrols.

SMALL CITRUS RANCHES FEARFUL OVER SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Small-scale citrus ranchers who have helped keep Ventura County's lemon and 
orange production tops in the state fear they will be unable to survive the 
demise of an industry quota system that had shielded them from competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cruising for a bruising," said Richard Pidduck, who farms 42 acres of 
citrus near Santa Paula. "You bet it's a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 The threat is the federal government's decision last week to abolish a 
Depression-era quota system that let growers prop up citrus prices by 
withholding fruit from the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the system, citrus farmers would estimate their groves' yield at the 
start of each year. A board dominated by the Sunkist Growers cooperative would 
then allot each rancher a market share. Finally, federal agriculture officials 
would approve the quotas, specifying how many fresh lemons, grapefruit and 
oranges each grower could sell. 
</P>
<P>
 In abolishing the system, the U. S. Department of Agriculture called the 
quotas divisive and ordered the citrus industry to let free enterprise reign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was closely watched in Ventura County, where lemons are the No. 1 
cash crop and where annual citrus sales top $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our membership is divided between those who favored the system and those 
opposed," said Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
"It's a very hotly debated issue. I know enough not to get in the middle of 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 Because the quota system has been suspended since December, 1992, the 
government's decision is not expected to immediately affect citrus prices or 
supplies. Theoretically, however, consumers should enjoy lower prices and a 
more bountiful selection in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 But in that same long run, local growers fear that unregulated competition 
will drive them out of business. For decades, they have relied on the quota 
system to keep prices stable and guarantee them a steady revenue stream, if not 
constant profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see the small grower squeezed because we don't have the 
ability to sustain long periods of low prices," said Jim Gill, who farms 40 
acres of citrus near Camarillo. "I'm not surviving now. It's just a matter of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, Gill said, he has watched agribusiness conglomerates 
drive family farmers out of vegetable production. Given license to romp through 
the market unfettered, he said, citrus giants could take the same tactic and 
wipe out vest-pocket lemon groves. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with intense competition, citrus farmers fear a never-ending cycle of 
drastic price swings. Watching the wild fluctuations in celery and avocado 
prices, they said they have come to appreciate the buffer built into the quota 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, of course, most growers chafed under the tight volume controls. When 
they produced bumper crops, they would have to sell top-quality fruit to juice 
makers for a fraction of the price that fresh citrus would fetch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although they grumbled, most abided by the system. And in bad years, they 
appreciated the quotas, which guaranteed them a share of the market by 
restraining their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system would help us all get a piece of the pie," Camarillo citrus 
rancher Will Gerry said. "We would all sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the industry stable, Gerry said he hoped his fellow ranchers would 
replace mandatory quotas with voluntary volume control. And indeed, some 
industry insiders said they expect such self-policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all working for the same people -- the growers," said Maurice Meza, 
manager of the Santa Paula Orange Assn. packing house. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we flood the market, prices will go down and the growers won't get any 
money back," Meza said. "And if we run the growers out of business, we'll put 
ourselves out of work too."

YOUTH WANTED IN BRAWL VANISHES WITH FAMILY; MISSING: THE LEES HAVE APPARENTLY 
FLED THEIR EXPENSIVE WESTLAKE VILLAGE COMPOUND, AND, POSSIBLY, THE UNITED 
STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four large dogs that once guarded the $1-million compound are gone. The 
phones are disconnected. And the two Mercedes-Benzes have not been seen on the 
Lee family's curving driveway for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 With 16-year-old James Lee set to stand trial for his role in a violent, 
race-tinged brawl, his entire family has apparently fled Westlake Village and, 
possibly, the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where he is," said John Vanarelli, the deputy district attorney 
handling the case. "All I know is he's gone. He could be sitting up in Ojai, 
for all I know." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vanarelli and other authorities suspect the worst: that Lee and his family 
have returned to their native Taiwan, a country that has no diplomatic 
relations with the United States and no extradition treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are in Taiwan, even if we know they are there, there's almost no 
chance of us extraditing them from that country," Vanarelli said. "Especially 
when all we've got on James is that he whacked some guy with a stick. If he 
shot the President, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, to the Thousand Oaks community, the charges against James Lee 
represent far more than whacking some guy with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 On his 16th birthday, Lee allegedly climbed into a car with other Asian youths 
and drove to North Ranch Park intent on humiliating a white football player who 
had beaten him, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the Asian mafia," the students reportedly announced as they piled out 
of five cars with baseball bats, two-by-fours and guns. The chaotic fight that 
day in February left two football players hospitalized with gunshot wounds and 
four Asian youths facing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the incident left the Thousand Oaks community facing the uneasy 
truth that violence and gang activity had crept into their most exclusive 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 One angry resident lashed out at the Lee family. "Take your criminal family 
and your criminal son James and go back to Taiwan with your Asian gangs where 
you all belong," read an anonymous note that came to Lee's father, his lawyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial hatred bothered the Lees, said their pastor, Curtis Lowe. But the 
family seemed most distressed about the future of their youngest son. Barely 
able to speak the language, the Lees had no understanding of the justice system 
that kept their child in custody for six weeks after the fight and threatened 
to send him to jail for four years on assault charges, Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when he visited the family home in April, Lowe had no idea they would 
vanish by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to figure out why he fled," said Lowe, a pastor at the Chinese 
Christian Church in Thousand Oaks. "I think that they wanted to stay here. And 
they wanted a life for their children here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't figure out why someone would leave so much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees arrival in Westlake Village was as quiet as their departure. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1989, they paid $1.1 million for a Spanish-style home and 
three-acre estate on Oak Grove Place, a tree-lined cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors do not remember seeing any moving vans, just trucks from furniture 
stores delivering new merchandise for the six-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
 That month, Hsin-E Lee registered two new Mercedes-Benz cars and a Dodge van 
with the state Department of Motor Vehicles. The Mercedeses, with license plate 
numbers just seven digits apart, were apparently purchased on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee set out to protect his domain, installing a metal fence around the estate 
and buying four large dogs -- a Rottweiler, two German shepherds and a Tibetan 
mastiff. He spent more than $60,000 on landscaping, installing a run for his 
dogs as well as trees and flowers around the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see where the parents maybe got him out of the country, but they've got 
to come back," said Jan Fekkes, a Thousand Oaks contractor who did much of the 
landscaping work. "You just don't leave a house like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But that seems to be just what the Lees have done. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors suddenly noticed that the dogs were no longer roaming around the 
yard. The cars, likewise, are no longer driving up and down the cul-de-sac. One 
neighbor said the mail carrier had been instructed to put the family's mail on 
hold for five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured they probably fled," said a neighbor, who asked not to be 
identified. "Everybody knew they would." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently court officials didn't. A Superior Court judge set a $5,000 bail 
for James Lee at a March 23 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Vanarelli had argued for a $20,000 to $50,000 bond because of the 
nature of the offense and the fact that James' brother, Frank, had been missing 
ever since the Feb. 3 fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Lee reportedly threw the first punch in the fight and helped recruit the 
Asian youths for the melee. Police waited outside the Lee house to pick him up 
after the fight, but he never appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli raised that issue in arguing for a higher bond for James Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I had gotten what I wanted, I don't think that would have kept him 
from leaving," Vanarelli said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Hsin-E Lee paid the $5,000 bond and brought James home. The 
family appeared at an April 6 preliminary hearing, but did not show up for an 
April 27 arraignment. When James did not appear at a makeup hearing on April 
29, the judge raised the bond to $100,000 and issued a warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Local authorities so far have made only cursory attempts to find him. 
</P>
<P>
 With no evidence that James is at home, police have no probable cause to 
search the house, said Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Ernest Montagna. 
Instead, officers routinely stop by the Oak Grove address to check for any 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an estate with gates," Montagna said. "The best thing you can do is 
use the call box and hope someone answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Crimestoppers of Thousand Oaks has offered a $1,000 reward for any tips on 
James Lee's whereabouts. But Montagna said he hasn't had much success tapping 
the Asian community for information. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV records show a second address for the Lees about an hour away in northern 
Los Angeles County. Tax statements indicate that a woman named Bea Lee owns the 
three-bedroom frame house set in a housing development in the hills near 
Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say Bea Lee has relatives in Ventura County and received frequent 
visits from her mother, who drives a Mercedes and speaks little English. 
</P>
<P>
 Bea Lee gave only vague responses when asked about her relationship with the 
Westlake Village family. "I have a very large family," she said. When asked 
about the Lees' disappearance, she said, "Maybe the gangs kidnaped them." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli, the prosecutor, is putting arrest warrants for both James and his 
brother, Frank, on the FBI's National Crime Information Center computer, a 
network that would enable police all over the country to pick up the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he doesn't expect to find the Lees in this country. So he is 
preparing paperwork for the FBI to search for them under the statute for 
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 That would enable FBI agents abroad to work with foreign agencies in finding 
the Lees. U.S. Customs officers could also look for the family and alert the 
FBI of their return to the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We owe it to everyone, including the kids still sitting in custody," 
Vanarelli said. "We shouldn't give this kid a 'bye just because he has the 
money to bail out." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's alleged accomplices in the Feb. 3 fight, three Asian American juveniles, 
have been ordered to stand trial as adults in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Vanarelli added: "From what I've been told, I shouldn't expect too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without an extradition treaty, Taiwan is under no obligation to return one of 
its own citizens to the United States. "We do make overtures, but for the most 
part the laws of the country say you don't have to send them back," said Alfred 
Gonzalez of the American Institute in Taiwan, an agency handling the United 
States' informal relations with the Asian nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of formal ties, the countries do try to cooperate and can 
sometimes arrange extradition, said Eric Chao, of Taiwan's Coordination Council 
for North American Affairs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the youth is not returned to the United States, he could face 
punishment in Taiwan, Chao said. "We can find a way to do things," he said. He 
said Ventura County officials have not contacted him about the Lee case. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Thousand Oak residents would like to see James Lee come back to face 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's right that anyone gets away with this and gets to flee 
from the court," said Kathy Behling of Thousand Oaks, whose son David was one 
of the two football players shot and hospitalized following the melee. "It may 
solve (James Lee's) problems here, but if he's that kind of kid, he's going to 
have trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is no one really knows what kind of kid James Lee is. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fight, he became known as the instigator who rounded up 15 purported 
gang members for a racial clash in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the February incident, James had no criminal record. Neither did 
Frank, a UCLA student who police say helped gather Asian youths from three 
counties for the fight. Some of the youths who fought with them that day have 
admitted gang ties. But Vanarelli acknowledged that he had no firm evidence 
"beyond a reasonable doubt" that James Lee was a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 James was described by neighbors as quiet and polite. But there were signs 
that he might be falling in with a "fast crowd," one neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, graffiti was painted on the cul-de-sac curb, and a neighborhood 
child said he saw James do it. A neighbor approached Hsin-E Lee, who agreed to 
have his son clean off the paint, but was adamant that his son did not deface 
the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went around with his son and had him explain to all the neighbors that he 
hadn't done it," said one resident who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the same neighbor noticed several young men visiting James. "They 
really looked like wanna-be gangsters," she said. "We were really surprised 
when they were." 
</P>
<P>
 But other neighbors and friends of the family doubt James was seriously 
involved with gangs. Rather, they felt he was harassed into the fight. A family 
friend recalls seeing a car full of white students drive up to the Lees' gate a 
week before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were tough-looking guys, and they looked like they were looking for 
trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 James had reportedly been feuding with football player Curtis Simmons for the 
better part of a year. In an earlier fight, Simmons had broken James' nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, James threatened to shoot him. Simmons responded: "If you pull a gun, 
I'm going to break your neck," according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 3, the pair agreed to meet at the neighborhood park for a fistfight. 
Simmons brought along about 10 other football players. James brought Asian 
youths, most of them armed with bats, boards or guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very sad story, because he was planning to take his SAT test, planning 
to go to college," said James' attorney, Thomas Mesereau. "The fellow did not 
know who to turn to."

VALLEY BRIEFING: PEOPLE VS. PIGEONS; LIFE IN THE URBAN AVIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Research by DAVID BRADY / Los Angeles Times

<P>
 Woody Allen has called them "rats with wings." Satirist Tom Lehrer once sang 
of poisoning them in the park. One wag described them as "the roaches of the 
sky" before a recent Glendale City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 They are pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 Beloved by breeders and fanciers for their abilities as racers and message 
carriers, the ubiquitous birds have frequently drawn the ire of cities unhappy 
with the mess created by their droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a problem with no easy solution. Some people blamed pigeons for ruining 
an area's aesthetic beauty, as in Glendale, where an estimated 10,000 are said 
to reside in the business district, fouling fixtures and folks alike. Others 
will cite the sentimental image of feeding pigeons in the park, arguing that 
the birds contribute to an area's charm. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle continues. Pigeon Profile 
</P>
<P>
 Although "pigeon" is a general term often used to describe any of the nearly 
300 species of pigeons and doves in the family Columbidae , the common North 
American pigeon is known as the rock dove (Columba livia) . 
</P>
<P>
 Size: Approximately 13 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Coloring: Generally blue or ash gray with a white rump and a purplish-green 
area around the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Diet: Fruits, grains, nuts and occasionally insects, snails and worms 
</P>
<P>
 Voice: A deep, rolling series of coos. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesting: Pigeons are generally monogamous and will build their nests on the 
ledges of buildings or cliffs; young pigeons, known as "squabs," will leave the 
nest after two to three weeks 
</P>
<P>
 Range: All of North America except for the northern tundra 
</P>
<P>
 History: Domesticated in Egypt around 3100 B.C. Glendale's Bird Battle 
</P>
<P>
 On April 12, Glendale's City Council declared war on pigeons, voting 
unanimously to stem the burgeoning bird population by contracting with Los 
Angeles County to trap and kill the creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, city officials beat a hasty retreat after it was learned that 
one of the county's past extermination methods involved gassing the birds by 
attaching sacks of them to car exhaust pipes. That method was not proposed for 
the Glendale birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale is now considering a measure that would prohibit feeding pigeons in 
certain areas, although a report drafted by Director of Public Works George A. 
Miller noted that in cities where similar laws were passed, "enforcement ... is 
a low priority at best." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale is also in the process of drafting a request for proposals to 
relocate the birds, so long as "no harm is to come to the pigeons once they are 
trapped." Population Control  
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, a variety of methods have been used to reduce pigeon 
flocks, some simple, some sophisticated: 
</P>
<P>
 * San Diego: Bird feed spiked with a contraceptive. 
</P>
<P>
 * New York and Washington D.C.: Bird-repellent netting draped across building 
tops. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Francisco: Trapping and relocating. Pondering Pigeons "Pigeons on the 
grass alas." -- Gertrude Stein  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm old fashioned. I believe that people should marry for life, like pigeons 
and Catholics." -- Woody Allen 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not abstain from sowing for fear of the pigeons." -- French proverb 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The only difference between a pigeon and the American farmer is that a pigeon 
can still make a deposit on a John Deere." -- Jim Hightower The Great Mystery 
</P>
<P>
 It is a riddle that has vexed many over the years -- "Why don't you ever see a 
baby pigeon?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simple. Squabs have an extremely high metabolic rate and eat a 
large percentage of their body weight in food during their time in the nest. So 
by the time they're booted into the world, pigeons are nearly full size.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OAK PARK; SEASON'S 1ST BRUSH FIRE BURNS 3-ACRE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A grass fire in Oak Park on Saturday afternoon was the first brush fire of the 
season, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze burned a three-acre field next to a residential area on the 6500 
block of Oak Springs Drive about 4 p.m., the spokeswoman said. The cause of the 
blaze is still under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 It took firefighters -- using seven engines, a water tender and a bulldozer --

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OJAI; 2 YOUTHS CHARGED WITH RACIAL ASSAULT 
</P>

<P>
 Two Ojai teen-agers have been charged with misdemeanor assault for the April 8 
beating of a 14-year-old boy near Matilija Junior High School, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, both 17, face up to six months in jail for the alleged battery, 
which law-enforcement officials have described as racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, a white Matilija student, was walking home from school when seven 
Latino youths yelled threats from their car, Sheriff's Cmdr. Joe Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told the kid, 'You better run,' " Harwell said. When the boy didn't run, 
the youths allegedly jumped from the car and punched and kicked him. Witnesses 
said one assailant yelled "Brown power!" before striking the boy, Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the youths knew the victim, who was treated for minor injuries, 
Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This boy was knocked to the ground and kicked in the head at least once," 
Harwell said. "There appears to be no motive other than the racial remarks that 
were made." 
</P>
<P>
 Four suspects, a 14-year-old Matilija student, two Nordhoff High School 
students ages 15 and 17, and a 17-year-old student at Chaparral continuation 
school, were questioned the next morning and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Two youths were charged with assault this week, Deputy Dist. Atty. John 
Cardoza said. Arraignment has not been set. TRACY WILSON

 Residents in a neighborhood north of Oxnard were awakened early Saturday 
morning by a man covered with blood knocking on their doors, a California 
Highway Patrol spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Highway Patrol officers and Ventura County sheriff's deputies arrived at the 
scene about 4 a.m. and found Richard Allen Glass, 30, of Oxnard stumbling down 
Will Avenue with severe cuts to his head and face, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass had been driving east on Simon Way when he veered his vehicle into a 
parked car, according to authorities.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA HARBOR; RESCUE OF 3 NEARLY TURNS INTO DISASTER

<P>
 An attempt to rescue a teen-ager caught in a rip current Saturday at Surfer's 
Knoll beach just south of the Ventura Harbor almost resulted in disaster, a 
Ventura Harbor spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people, including the girl's boyfriend, were rescued by lifeguards or 
pulled onto a Ventura Harbormaster boat, said Senior Deputy Harbormaster David 
Glaser. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very common when non-swimmers get into trouble and other non-swimmers 
try to come to their rescue," Glaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, 14-year-old Sara Norton of Acton, was swimming just south of the new 
jetty when she got caught in a rip current. When her boyfriend attempted to 
help her, he also was caught in the current and then one of their friends went 
in after them, Glaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group tried to signal for help, he said, but for close to half an hour, no 
one realized they were in distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Carpenter, 37, of Virginia, saw the three waving for help and swam out 
with a body board, using it to keep the girl afloat until rescuers could pick 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very close call if he had not gone out there," Glaser said. "She'd 
be dead right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Harbor Patrol pulled Sara, her boyfriend and Carpenter into their 
boat about 300 yards offshore, Glaser said. The couple's friend was pulled to 
shore by a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara was listed in good condition at Ventura County Medical Center, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 A group of young men who tried to crash a birthday party in Thousand Oaks may 
have fired four gunshots into a truck parked in the driveway after being asked 
to leave, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies answered a call of a large party disturbing 
the peace 1200 block of Sheffield Place about 9:30 p.m. Friday.Witnesses told 
deputies that three men tried to crash the party and shouted what they believed 
to be gang slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently the people asked to leave had some gang affiliations," Sgt. Terry 
Hughes said. The party hosts said they thought the men threw some firecrackers 
and left. But about 9:30 a.m. Saturday, deputies were called back to the 
Thousand Oaks house after the resident found four bullet holes in his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials suspect that what the witnesses thought were firecrackers 
were actually gunshots. TRACY WILSON

3 SHOT, 1 IS CRITICALLY WOUNDED DURING EL RIO PARTY ALTERCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three people were wounded, one critically, during an altercation at a party in 
El Rio Saturday night, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Mike Gullon said the violence occurred after an unknown number 
of men crashed a large baptismal party in the 2600 block of Balboa Street 
shortly after 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings took place in the ensuing scuffle, during which two others 
suffered minor injuries and were taken to local hospitals by friends, Senior 
Sheriff's Deputy Craig Adford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adford said deputies had been monitoring the large party, said to have been 
attended by more than 100 people, before the violence broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies would not release names of the shooting victims, but one was taken to 
St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he was reported in critical condition 
and was being prepared for surgery about 10 p.m., a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others were taken to Ventura County Medical Center with abdominal wounds, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies closed a two-block stretch of Balboa Street for a time after the 
shooting while they questioned suspects, but no arrests had been made by 10:15 
p.m., Gullon said.

GOOD FOR GOBIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: Endangered tidewater gobies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hueneme / Ormond estuary has suffered through years of abuse and neglect 
and yet its unique habitats continue to sustain an incredible diversity of 
wildlife. This area contains habitat essential for the survival of many 
threatened and endangered species, including California least terns, brown 
pelicans, western snowy plovers, salt marsh bird's-beak, and many federal and 
state candidate species. 
</P>
<P>
 The various habitats (salt marshes, lagoons, estuaries, southern coastal 
foredunes and others) at Hueneme are already considered to be endangered and 
are supposed to be protected. A recent discovery of tidewater gobies by UC 
Santa Barbara biologist Dr. Kevin Lafferty doesn't appear to create any new 
problems, although it means additional work is now clearly needed to make all 
the determinations necessary in creating a recovery plan. 
</P>
<P>
 This discovery may have the positive effect of focusing attention on a number 
of issues dealing with water quality and quantity. Such attention would be 
beneficial to all area wildlife and to the ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic value of protecting wetlands is well understood by sport 
fishermen, commercial fishermen and many farmers as well. According to the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, three-quarters of the nation's $4-billion 
marine fish and shellfish harvest is made up of estuarine-dependent species 
(fish that use vegetation for spawning, rearing and feeding). Marine fisheries 
contribute more than $50 billion to the GNP. Twenty million American 
recreational fishermen fish for estuarine wetlands-dependent species, adding 
enormously to our economy. In California alone, more than 1 1/2 million sports 
fishermen pursue this resource and more than $200 million in seafood is 
delivered to the docks. Loss of wetlands correlates with decline in annual fish 
harvests and lost jobs in this industry. Therefore, any focus on protecting 
wetlands is good economic news. What's good for gobies ends up being good for 
all of us.

150 GATHER TO MARK OPENING OF NEW HOME FOR PATIENTS WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After four years of hard work by family, friends and volunteers, Betty Jean 
Dye was able to open the door to her son's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Dye, who had hoped to build a home for people with AIDS in Ventura 
County, succumbed to the disease in 1990 before he could achieve his goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday, more than 150 people gathered outside a 100-year-old renovated 
Victorian on East Thompson Boulevard in Ventura to celebrate the grand opening 
of Christopher House. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," Dye said, gesturing to the home. "You know he's watching 
over all of this. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid upstairs made us all work."  
</P>
<P>
 Listening to the band Rux Reid and the High Society Men perform jazzy 
renditions of Cole Porter songs, the crowd took quick tours of the two-story 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this place when no paint was on the walls," Dye said, standing in the 
freshly painted entryway of the home. "This is beautiful. How can you not be 
impressed?" 
</P>
<P>
 The six-bedroom house and two cottages behind it will function as a home for 
12 AIDS-infected and HIV-positive residents. The residents will have keys to 
come and go, and each will pay a minimal rent, about 30% of their Social 
Security payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what he wanted," Dye said. "This is for people who are being kicked 
out of their homes because they have AIDS, or who might not have anywhere else 
to go but a fleabag hotel. This will be their home." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents -- including one couple and their young daughter who are all 
HIV-positive -- will move into the house and cottages beginning June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 David, a 39-year-old Ojai resident suffering from the disease, will be one of 
the first people to move in. He asked that his last name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel lucky," he said as he walked gingerly to an armchair in the living 
room. "I've been out of circulation since I first went into the hospital last 
February. It's nice to know all these people care about me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David said he believed that the three meals a day and care from local 
volunteers would help him focus on staying healthy. He said he felt weak from 
losing more than 50 pounds after a recent illness but hoped his new 
surroundings would put him back on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The event included a silent auction of donated items, including an autographed 
poster from the movie "Philadelphia" with signatures from stars Tom Hanks and 
Mary Steenburgen, a print signed by artist David Hockney and a poster signed by 
Whoopi Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised from the auction will help pay the $200,000 a year needed to 
operate the facility.  
</P>
<P>
 Trisha Davis, Christopher Dye's sister and vice president of the Christopher 
House Foundation, said all the hard work over the last four years by her family 
and her brother's friends, as well as dozens of volunteers, was well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing the people you're helping gets you through all the tough times," she 
said. "This is what it's all about, a real home for people. It's what 
Christopher wanted."

'STUDENTS 1ST' POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally, the Ventura County Community College District Board of Trustees and 
administrators are waking up to the disaster of declining student enrollments 
that have been plaguing higher education for the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgotten by them is the basic fact that our students are the lifeblood of the 
educational industry.Simply, more students mean more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, when we begin to treat our students less like tokens and more like 
customers, our enrollments will start to increase. When we give better service 
and more value to our students, they will return to the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 How? By instituting "student first" policies such as registration by phone, no 
lockouts on core curriculum classes, and reduced prices at our campus 
bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 These "student first" policies have the power to turn this nasty student 
decline around if the trustees and administrators have the will, ability and 
energy to implement them.

MAY FAIR CELEBRATES AMERICANA, QUAKE RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Margaret McKendry Rainey recalls a Fillmore May festival 61 years ago almost 
as clearly as her latest trip to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember being in the parade when I was 8," Rainey said, relaxing 
Saturday at her hometown's biggest annual event, the Early California Days 
Festival. Or simply the May Fair, as many in Fillmore -- population 12,000 -- 
call it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a buggy, dressed up as an old lady," Rainey, now 69, said with a 
proud smile. "I had white powder on my hair, and I sang -- oh, what was that 
song?" 
</P>
<P>
 She hummed a few bars. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet,' " she said triumphantly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a big deal, being in the fair's annual parade, getting to wave and grin 
from the middle of the street to your admiring friends and family crowded on 
the sidewalk. Many Fillmore residents march or ride in the parade at least 
once, and most remember each time. 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year, nearly everybody who lives in Fillmore, or who once lived in 
Fillmore, or who is just particularly fond of the quaint town nestled in the 
citrus groves, lands on Central Avenue the third weekend in May. They cheer on 
an old-fashioned parade, feast on slow-cooked barbecued beef and beans, ride 
the old-time train and pitch baseballs into straw baskets for stuffed animals 
at the carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 Staged in the city since 1910, the fair on Saturday was part quake-recovery 
celebration, part vintage Americana, as residents spoke of getting their town 
"back on track" amid a scene that looked like a stage set out of Rodgers & 
Hammerstein's "Carousel." 
</P>
<P>
 A block from the boarded-up storefronts and crumbling facades of quake-ravaged 
downtown, parade-goers weathered an unforgiving sun to clap enthusiastically 
for Miss Fillmore 1994, Liliana Morales, perched atop an electric blue Mustang 
in a sparkling green gown; Miss Teen Fillmore, Kelly Wilson, enveloped in a 
froth of pink lace and white tulle; Fillmore Fair Queen Leslie Mozley; Young 
Miss Fillmore Stephanie Cardona and about half a dozen other queens and 
princesses, down to Miss Baby Fillmore, all waving, all smiling.  
</P>
<P>
 The junior karate classes showed off their wood-plank-splitting skills. The 
school bands marched, and the flag girls twirled their flags, mostly at the 
same time. The "Domino Dudes," a favorite children's parade tradition in 
Fillmore, succeeded as they have in years before at standing on their knees in 
the middle of the road, then falling to the ground one after another, like a 
stack of dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We practiced for three weeks," said Rebecca Hernandez, 11, clad in the Dudes 
uniform of black pants and a black sweat shirt with white dots. "I was nervous, 
because sometimes I fall before the others." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lifelong Fillmore residents Paula and Victor Garibay brought their two 
toddlers down to Sespe Avenue to watch the parade go by. Later, they planned to 
go to the carnival down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fair's the only thing going on in Fillmore," said Victor Garibay, 26, who 
marched with his soccer team in the parade when he was 12. "We took the kids to 
the carnival last night also, and they loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Avila, who marched with the drill team when she was in high school, 
said two of her five children were thrilled to march with their tee-ball team 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why, but this year the fair seems to be better than ever," she 
said. "It's a good thing for Fillmore, because you don't worry about what 
happened (with the earthquake), you just have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters billed the fair -- which began Thursday and runs through today -- as 
a chance for Fillmore residents to celebrate their resiliency in the face of 
the January quake. Fillmore Mayor Linda Brewster, in the spirit of rebuilding 
the town, came dressed up as a house painter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council is working to rebuild Fillmore, so we're all dressed as 
workmen," she explained, standing alongside the downtown park's gazebo and 
balancing a plate of barbecued meat and beans in her hand. "The town's looking 
a lot better than it used to, don't you think? It's looking decent, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Laboring to make Fillmore look better than decent, about 20 volunteers 
eschewed the fair Saturday to build a makeshift restroom and kitchen facility 
in the parking lot of a local Catholic church. The temporary facilities will be 
used by volunteers for Habitat for Humanity and other nationwide organizations, 
who plan to move into Fillmore for the next year or so to help rebuild the 
quake-damaged houses of residents who can't afford to pay a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers will live in trailers parked near the temporary facilities, 
which will be ready for use by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say these are holidays with a purpose," said volunteer Jeanette Brouwer, 
who traveled to Fillmore from her home in Alberta, Canada, after a church-aid 
group called and said the town needed help.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolas Witoski can help anyone looking for quake damage in Fillmore. Three 
years old and fascinated by earthquake debris, Nicolas pointed out rubble as he 
rode with his grandmother on an old-fashioned train that traveled four times 
Saturday from Fillmore to a canyon just west of Piru, and back again to 
Fillmore. The train was a special, weekend-only feature of the Fillmore 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lookit, lookit those tractors packing things up there, because there's a lot 
of earthquake damage," Nicolas demanded, pointing out the train window at a 
tractor parked amid the orange trees.  
</P>
<P>
 Rocking and rumbling, traveling at 10 m.p.h. through farm fields while vendors 
sold gleeful children soda pop and Gummi Bears, the Hollywood Movie Train was a 
hit with old and young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the nostalgia," said Ventura resident Valerie Byhoffer, ensconced with 
daughter Brandy, 3, in a velour-cushioned compartment. "When I watch the old 
movies on cable now, I can really relate to what (those train rides) are like." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale resident Charles Holliday said he was disappointed that the train was 
not steam-powered. Still, he said, he was having fun at the festival, although 
his children and grandchildren dragged him there. 
</P>
<P>
 He always enjoys going to Fillmore, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it," he said with a shrug. "It's a small town." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Early California Days Festival will continue today in Fillmore, with hot 
air balloons from dawn until midmorning and the carnival from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
at the intersection of Mountain View and Santa Clara streets. The train will 
run four times, leaving on its first hourlong round trip at 10:40 a.m. The hot 
air balloon rides cost $75 per person, the train rides cost $12.50 for adults 
and $7.50 for children, and admission to the carnival is free.

ORGANIST, PROF. RONALD HUNTINGTON DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman University Prof. Ronald M. Huntington, who taught religion and 
philosophy at the school for 42 years, died last week. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Santa Ana, Huntington was an accomplished organist who performed 
throughout Southern California for 20 years. He also taught others how to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron not only studied the confluence of worship and the arts, he lived it," 
said Chapman President James Doti in a message to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "During his four decades of service to Chapman, we were fortunate to share in 
his gifts, as were the residents of our wider community who heard his many 
organ performances at churches and in concerts," Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
 He died May 15 and is survived by his son, Rommie, and brother, Robert. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Chapman 
Auditorium in Orange. A private funeral will be held at Saddleback Chapel in 
Tustin.

COASTAL PANEL, LONG BEACH REACH CURFEW COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission has settled a dispute with Long Beach that 
will allow the city to close its beaches at 10 p.m. in most areas in an effort 
to cut down on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the accord, city officials said they will drop a lawsuit that 
sought court approval for the curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, said Long Beach officials 
demonstrated enough evidence -- about 250 arrests in beach areas during 1993 -- 
to determine that an earlier curfew was in the best interest of public safety. 
Beaches in the city previously were closed from midnight to 5 a.m. Most of the 
arrests involved disorderly conduct and curfew violations, according to 
commission staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote May 12 by the commission, which has authority over coastal 
lands in the state, marks the second time in its 23-year history that members 
have allowed a city to set a beach curfew. The city's midnight curfew was 
imposed before the commission was created. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the compromise, however, the public will have access to 
"wet sand" strips of beach near the water until midnight. Also, one beach area 
near the Belmont Pier will remain open until midnight. Tourists and residents 
often stroll in the area -- between the pier and the Belmont Pool -- after 
meals at nearby restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach also must hold public hearings every three years to determine if 
the curfew is still warranted, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will come before the City Council this week for formal approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue surfaced when the council voted for an earlier curfew last June, 
shortly after William Shadden, 26, a student at Cal State Long Beach, was shot 
and killed in Belmont Shore near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Douglas S. Drummond pushed for tighter restrictions on beaches and 
parking lots, saying that undesirables were loitering there and contributing to 
the city's crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 When Coastal Commission members learned of the council's action, they told 
city officials that the new curfew -- and the decades-old midnight to 5 a.m. 
curfew -- violated the state Coastal Act, which guarantees public access to the 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission staff members said the city could keep the midnight-to-5 a.m. 
curfew because it was enacted before the passage of Coastal Act in the 1950s. 
But the new curfew was too broad, they said, and the city did not demonstrate 
specific evidence of a crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials filed a lawsuit in Long Beach Superior Court, challenging the 
Coastal Commission's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Although signs listing the new 10 p.m. curfew were posted along the beaches, 
police did not enforce the restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said the new curfew does not violate the Coastal Act because the 
ordinance does not prohibit access to public waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 "This protects both public access and public safety," he said. "It was 
precisely the type of balancing we feel is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the agreement, most beaches will be closed from 10 p.m. to 
5 a.m., but people will not be cited for walking across the sand to get to the 
water line. People will be permitted to stand on the "wet" sand -- defined as 
the sand wet as a result of waves or tide -- to jog, walk, or fish. Swimming 
will also be allowed until midnight, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said he supports keeping the wet sand accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone's out jogging on the wet sand it doesn't bother me at all," he 
said. "We have grunion runs and people who fish, and those activities should 
not be discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said the congregation of troublemakers on dry sand was his main 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the loitering and partying and all the problems that come with it," he 
said. "But we also wanted to make sure there were sections open for people who 
want to enjoy dry sand (until midnight), and regulate it so we can provide 
security."

FEMALE UMPIRE BECOMES BIG HIT; SOUTH BAY: RONNA ROSEMOND-JOHNSON, WHO NEARLY 
QUIT AT ONE POINT, IS NOW A RESPECTED OFFICIAL AT HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL AND 
SOFTBALL GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only once in Ronna Rosemond-Johnson's umpiring career has she felt so 
discouraged that she wanted to quit. As one of only a few female umpires in the 
South Bay, Rosemond-Johnson, 28, was making tough calls a couple of years ago 
that a coach didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy started yelling at me in Spanish," she said. "I couldn't really 
understand what he was saying, but I knew that they weren't nice things." 
</P>
<P>
 After that night, Rosemond-Johnson vowed never to umpire again. "I'd just 
started, and I was doing the best I could, and this guy was making it 
impossible," she said. "It was just a nightmare.' 
</P>
<P>
 But she stuck it out. In the last two years, with the support and 
encouragement of members of the Los Angeles unit of the California Softball 
Officials Assn., most of them male, Rosemond-Johnson has become a well-known 
and respected umpire, officiating at softball and baseball games for local high 
schools and for Parks and Recreation Department leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of support from the other umpires," she said. "They convinced me 
that quitting is not the answer. They told me that umpiring is about facing the 
challenges of the big mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Now when Rosemond-Johnson officiates the team that nearly made her quit, "they 
love me," she said. "I've improved. I'm more consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 When the same coach makes comments in Spanish, "I still don't know what he's 
saying," she said, "but I assume it's something good." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemond-Johnson, who lives in Lawndale, is among about half a dozen women in 
the Los Angeles unit of 60 umpires, said Garfield Finley, a Hawthorne resident 
who works for the Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department and 
instructs aspiring umpires. "We've always looked for female officials," he 
said. "There just haven't been that many."  
</P>
<P>
 Few women work as umpires, Finley said, because historically few women have 
played organized baseball or softball. "Now we're getting more females into 
high school softball, so we're seeing more women umpires."  
</P>
<P>
 Rosemond-Johnson started her softball career at 7 when she joined a girls' 
sandlot league in Los Angeles. She remained in the girls' league until she 
switched to high school ball. While in school, she also played basketball and 
tennis.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the oldest of three kids, and the other two aren't athletic at all," she 
said. "Neither are my parents. But they were so supportive. They took me to all 
the games and practices, and they came to my games. They were there for me." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing softball for El Camino College, landing a job with the Gardena 
Parks and Recreation Department and marrying former Green Bay Packer Ken 
Johnson, Rosemond-Johnson became a free-lance umpire for softball and baseball 
games. She spent $45 on training and earns that much for each game she 
officiates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the sport so much," she said. "I like the authority, the quick 
thinking, using your judgment, being accurate, running around. I just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, both male and female teams were surprised to see her. " 'A woman?' 
they said. I just smiled and said, 'Yeah, a woman,' and went on with the game. 
The men really like to flirt," she said. "They'll say, 'You're the cutest 
umpire I've ever seen.' " She paused. "It doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Some games try her patience, especially when the crowd, the players or the 
coaches become unruly. Not long ago, when she was behind the plate, a batter 
threw his bat. It smashed into Rosemond-Johnson's head, knocking her 
unconscious. Though she went to the hospital, she refused to go in an 
ambulance. "I'm too tough for that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps her greatest asset is her ability to ignore screaming criticism. "I 
let it go in one ear and out the other," she said. "My focus is on the game."

CHIEF OF UCLA POLICE FORCE NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Capt. Clarence Chapman, a veteran 
lawman who earned widespread praise as West Hollywood's top cop, will be the 
new chief of UCLA's embattled police department, university officials have 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, a 28-year Sheriff's Department veteran, is scheduled to be sworn in 
June 1. Among his most immediate concerns, he said, will be improving morale in 
a department that has become a breeding ground for civil rights and personnel 
complaints filed by disgruntled officers and civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really got to hit the ground running," Chapman said. "The problems in 
that department dictate immediate attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-member force, riven by backbiting and what many describe as a hostile 
working environment, has been buffeted by budget cuts and upheaval caused by 
last year's retirement of longtime Chief John Barber. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaffection, particularly among minority workers, runs high. No fewer than 
eight current or former Police Department employees have filed lawsuits in the 
past three years against the university alleging harassment, favoritism and 
discrimination by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The union for campus police officers, frustrated by the slow pace of 
departmental reform, directed a vote of no confidence earlier this year against 
the acting police chief, Karl Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally," Chapman said, "just a real unhappy work force is what you've got 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 A Pepperdine University graduate, Chapman joined the Sheriff's Department in 
1966. He was promoted to captain in 1990 and was assigned to the Marina Del Rey 
station for a year and West Hollywood for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the top sheriff's official in West Hollywood, he won kudos in many circles 
for expanding community-based policing programs that helped temper longstanding 
perceptions that the Sheriff's Department was insensitive to the city's large 
gay population. 
</P>
<P>
 A city referendum to replace Sheriff's Department service with a local police 
force was soundly defeated in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West Hollywood experience really did matter," said Administrative Vice 
Chancellor John Curry, who led a seven-month, nationwide search for a new 
chief. "It was a complex job at a difficult time, and Clarence, by every 
indication, did a stellar job of working with that community." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's career has not been free of controversy. While serving in West 
Hollywood, he earned $70,000 providing expert testimony and other assistance in 
35 civil cases pivoting on excessive force. Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul Turley 
conducted an inquiry into the matter, and concluded earlier this year that 
Chapman violated a 1990 ordinance that bans county employees from receiving any 
pay outside their regular salaries for such testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ordinance contained no provision for sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence suggests," Turley wrote, "that Capt. Chapman has engaged in a 
variation of double-dipping. . . . While such a practice may offend elementary 
principles of propriety, it does not support the filing of a criminal action." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman denied in interviews that he double-dipped, and was supported in his 
assertion by Sheriff Sherman Block. He was subsequently reassigned by the 
department to handle risk management matters -- such as preventing lawsuits -- 
full-time.

CASINO DEVELOPERS PUTTING THEIR MONEY ON POMONA; ECONOMY: FIRM HOPES TO DEVELOP 
CARD CLUB IN AN ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX. AREA CITIES WEIGH TAX REVENUES VERSUS 
CRIME CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's tough to find people who look like they're actually having fun at Los 
Angeles County's five card clubs. The sea of green-felt card tables in these 
casinos is dotted throughout with the stony faces of poker players assessing 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Tradewinds. 
</P>
<P>
 The group hopes to build the first card club in the San Gabriel Valley, 
proposing to bring more than a touch of Las Vegas to the Southern California 
gambling scene. Theirs is the most ambitious of five casino proposals during 
the past several months that seek to gain a toehold in the San Gabriel Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tradewinds plan calls for a complex on leased land at Los Angeles County 
Fairgrounds in Pomona with the look of Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean" and 
featuring live bands, stage productions, ethnic restaurants, and rooms for 
playing video games and shooting pool. In addition to poker and Asian card 
games, the center would offer off-track, satellite wagering on horse races. 
</P>
<P>
 The main building at Tradewinds would be fashioned after a make-believe 
shipwreck turned upside down; palms and waterfalls would aim for a tropical 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you went to the Bicycle Club (in Bell Gardens) and didn't play cards, 
you'd be bored out of your skull," said Jon Langbert, who is forming a 
corporation with three Pomona architects to build and run the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the trend in this country away from just games and toward a 
whole product with multiple forms of entertainment, like the new Treasure 
Island resort in Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Langbert -- now an employee of New Jersey-based Capital Gaming, which manages 
casinos on Indian reservations in several Western states -- also sees the theme 
park aspect as his best chance for wooing customers in a business that's 
getting more competitive as proposals for card clubs blossom around Southern 
California in general, and the San Gabriel Valley in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another group in Pomona is proposing a club on farmland along the Pomona 
Freeway. The promoters say their casino, to be called Champs, would cater in 
part to Asian Americans, with a first-class Chinese restaurant and a variety of 
Asian card games. 
</P>
<P>
 The council paved the way last week for both developers to come forward with 
formal proposals. The council voted 5 to 2 to allow card clubs in areas zoned 
for light industry and at the fairgrounds. Also on a 5-2 vote, the council 
modified its existing gaming ordinance, first adopted in 1964, to allow dancing 
and alcohol sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casino promoters Michael Meczka and Frank Santin have vowed to take their 
casino proposal to Irwindale voters after a harsh rejection from that 
community's City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 The partnership proposes to build the 40,000- to 60,000-square-foot club on 
Arrow Highway near the San Gabriel River Freeway. They say the club would 
create about 500 jobs and generate at least $3 million in annual gaming tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * In South El Monte, one of Southern California's lowest-income communities, 
the City Council voted 3 to 2 earlier in the month a to put a card club 
proposal to a vote in an Aug. 9 special election. A newly formed corporation 
called San Gabriel Valley Enterprise is behind the proposal, according to that 
group's attorney, Jerry Neuman. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuman said the developers want to build a 50,000- to 70,000-square-foot 
building with roughly 150 game tables on about 22 acres south of the Pomona 
Freeway at Santa Anita Avenue, less than 200 yards from South El Monte High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the landowners, a joint venture of WB-Core Co. and South El Monte 
Associates, have offered to compensate the city for the cost of the special 
election to decide the casino's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 protesters marched May 12 at City Hall to oppose the council 
vote. Citing fears of crime, prostitution and drug use spawned by the card 
club, residents and Catholic priests demanded unsuccessfully that the council 
force card club proponents to collect signatures for a ballot initiative before 
the issue is put to the people. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Monterey Park, some believe a card club proposal by BCTC Development 
Corp. may resurface now that a new council is in place. BCTC officials did not 
return phone calls. But former Councilman Sam Kiang speculates that the company 
was funding opposition to him and two other losing candidates who oppose 
gambling in that town. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiang took the lead in opposing BCTC last year when the company made its 
tentative plans known. None of the three newly elected council members have 
opposed the prospect of gaming in town. 
</P>
<P>
 BCTC's name popped up toward the end of the council campaign in the Monterey 
Park election when about 13,000 city residents received an official-looking but 
anonymous flyer printed in English and Chinese that warned of $10,000 fines and 
imprisonment for those who disobeyed voting laws. The flyers were traced to 
Steven G. Mott, a consultant to BCTC. Kiang said he believes the flyers were 
aimed at suppressing turnout by his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1984 state law placed the decision on card clubs in the hands of voters in 
Irwindale, South El Monte, Monterey Park and other cities that had no gambling 
law at the time. But because Pomona already had a gaming ordinance on the books 
before that law was passed, the council votes on card club proposals.  
</P>
<P>
 As they mull the casino issue, some council members question whether they've 
been dealt a royal flush or a losing hand. When it comes to approving card 
clubs, they fear, it's a case of "damned if you do, damned if you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say that, over time, card clubs breed crime and tarnish a city's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pomona has a bad enough reputation as it is," said community activist Bob 
Jackson, a council critic and onetime unsuccessful council candidate.  
</P>
<P>
 But Pomona is hurting financially, with one of the state's highest utility tax 
rates (10%), one of the county's highest unemployment rates (11.9% in February) 
and the city's biggest budget deficit ever ($4.5 million). 
</P>
<P>
 As they grapple with these difficulties, council members are eyeing 
communities such as Commerce, which makes $1 million a month from its gaming 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling has always been that addictive behavior is not something you want 
to encourage," said Councilwoman Paula Lantz, a self-described fundamentalist 
Christian. "But then I have to think, 'Should the city refuse revenue from bars 
or grocery stores that sell alcohol and cigarettes?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eddie Cortez says he is a teetotaler who abhors gambling because, like 
alcohol, it could have a deleterious affect on families. 
</P>
<P>
 The question they face, Lantz and Cortez said, is whether the money and jobs 
are reason enough to eschew moral concerns. Both voted for the card-club zoning 
and updated ordinance last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tradewinds developers want to build their 60,000-square-foot casino to 
capitalize on the thousands of weekly visitors already going to the Fairplex 
for conventions, trade shows and, of course, the County Fair in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tradewinds developers say they will spend $12 million to build their 
casino at the Fairplex, using local builders and suppliers. Langbert estimates 
that once completed, Tradewinds would employ about 540 people -- mostly locals 
-- and contribute $3.7 million in game tax revenue to the city the first year 
and as much as $10 million by the fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradewinds will also need a thumbs up from the County Fair Assn.'s board of 
directors, which was waiting for the council to decide on the plan before 
studying the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, businessman Leo Chu, owner of a women's apparel company in Los 
Angeles called California Ivy, has applied for an operating license for a 
proposed 55,000-square-foot card club to be called Champs, which would be 
located on Reservoir Street south of the Pomona Freeway.

LEFTWICH TAKES CHANCE, WINS; ANGELS: HE GIVES UP FOUR HITS, STRIKES OUT EIGHT 
IN 7 2/3 INNINGS OF VICTORY OVER THE ROYALS.

 Phil Leftwich prepared himself for the inevitable a couple of weeks ago. 
Judging by his manager's comments, he was going to the minors to make room for 
Mark Langston. Everything was set but the travel itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he got another chance. Starting pitcher Brian Anderson suffered a 
broken left thumb the next night, and Leftwich was allowed to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 After Leftwich's performance Saturday night in the Angels' 3-0 victory over 
the Kansas City Royals, Manager Marcel Lachemann is making sure Leftwich isn't 
going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching perhaps the finest game of his career before 30,436 at Anaheim 
Stadium, Leftwich yielded only four hits while striking out a career-high eight 
-- four caught looking -- in 7 2/3 innings. Mike Butcher, who got the Angels 
out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, retired the final four for his first 
save this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (20-24) now are 3-0 under Lachemann and have moved into a 
first-place tie with the Texas Rangers in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, yeah," Lachemann said, "I'm kind of surprised I haven't screwed things 
up more than I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, little has gone wrong since Lachemann assumed command on Thursday. 
He started second baseman Rex Hudler for the first time this season Saturday 
against a right-handed pitcher, Tom Gordon, and Hudler hit a homer in the third 
inning. There was a bases-loaded jam in the eighth with switch-hitter Brian 
McRae at the plate. Lachemann brought in Butcher to make him bat left-handed, 
and McRae was left staring at a called-third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The man has not made a false move yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, the players deserve all the credit," Lachemann said. "In the last 
72 hours, we've gone through some turmoil and have played pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny how a few victories also quiet the unrest created by the firing of Buck 
Rodgers. While there still may be no one calling the Angel offices and 
congratulating General Manager Bill Bavasi, the uproar is quieting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say what you want about the guy," one American League general manager 
said, "but he's got guts. For a first-year GM to fire a popular manager, 
believe me, that takes a lot of courage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee you if those guys come back and win that division, they'll be 
calling Bavasi a genius." 
</P>
<P>
 There at least is evidence that can be quite comforting to Bavasi knowing what 
happened the last time a general manager dared to fire a manger whose team was 
within two games of first place. The last time a manager had been fired with 
his team any closer was Pat Corrales in July 18, 1983, with the Philadelphia 
Phillies tied for first. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies won the National League pennant under Paul Owens before losing in 
the World Series to the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unknown how far the Angels will go this season, but certainly their 
chances will be greatly enhanced with performances such as that of Leftwich 
(2-4). He was so dominant that Gary Gaetti's second-inning double was the 
hardest-hit ball off him the entire game. No baserunner even reached third 
until Brent Mayne's two-out single advanced Greg Gagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lachemann: "The only thing I knew about Leftwich is that he roomed with 
my son (Bret) in the minors." 
</P>
<P>
 While Leftwich was proving that he belongs in the rotation, designated hitter 
Chili Davis' showed the new boss that he can hit sacrifice flies. His 
statistical oddity finally ended when he drove in Chad Curtis with a sacrifice 
fly in the sixth inning, Davis' first sacrifice fly since Sept. 29, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The streak spanned 838 plate appearances. Setting the major league record last 
season with 112 RBIs without the benefit of a sacrifice fly, Davis had gone 198 
games and 153 RBIs in between sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of proud of the record," Davis said, "but I can't tell you how many 
times I tried to get a sacrifice fly last year but it never worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann joins Norm Sherry as the only new Angel managers to win their first 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can ever get comfortable," Lachemann said. "I don't care if 
you've been managing one day, two weeks, or whatever. Just when you feel you're 
comfortable, the game grabs you by the back of your neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned in this game you can't take anything for granted."

LEFTWICH MAKES MOST OF SECOND CHANCE, 3-0; ANGELS: HE GIVES UP FOUR HITS, 
STRIKES OUT EIGHT IN 7 2/3 INNINGS OF VICTORY OVER ROYALS.

 Phil Leftwich prepared himself for the inevitable a couple of weeks ago. 
Judging by his manager's comments, he was going to the minors to make room for 
Mark Langston. Everything was set but the travel itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he got another chance. Starting pitcher Brian Anderson suffered a 
broken left thumb the next night, and Leftwich was allowed to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 After Leftwich's performance Saturday night in the Angels' 3-0 victory over 
the Kansas City Royals, Manager Marcel Lachemann is making sure Leftwich isn't 
going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching perhaps the finest game of his career before 30,436 at Anaheim 
Stadium, Leftwich yielded only four hits while striking out a career-high eight 
-- four caught looking -- in 7 2/3 innings. Mike Butcher, who got the Angels 
out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, retired the final four for his first 
save this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (20-24) now are 3-0 under Lachemann and have moved into a 
first-place tie with the Texas Rangers in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, yeah," Lachemann said, "I'm kind of surprised I haven't screwed things 
up more than I have."

REDS OUT OF ORDER; DODGERS WIN; BASEBALL: LASORDA PROTESTS BUT WITHDRAWS IT 
AFTER 6-4 VICTORY MOVES L.A. 2 1/2 GAMES UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After his team had once again made the ninth inning an adventure Saturday 
night, Manager Tom Lasorda had little to say about the Dodgers' 6-4 victory 
over the Cincinnati Reds at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, showing reporters the evidence -- the Reds' official lineup card -- 
Lasorda talked about which Cincinnati player he thought should have come to the 
plate in the second inning after he reported the Reds for batting out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Manager Davey Johnson had a little more explaining to do, such as 
why he let Jeff Brantley pitch to Brett Butler in the eighth inning with the 
bases loaded when left-hander Tim Fortugno was warmed up. Fortugno had struck 
out Butler the night before on three pitches. But Johnson, too, talked about 
the batting-order incident and the protest he filed -- Johnson thought the 
umpires were wrong, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler didn't have any explaining to do, though he spent the game trying to 
get an explanation about the umpires' action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The umpires said, 'Why do you want to know,' " said Butler, whose two-out 
single broke a 2-2 tie in the Dodgers' four-run eighth-inning rally. "I said, 
'Who knows, I may be a major league manager some day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when the Dodgers took a 2 1/2-game lead over the San Francisco 
Giants in the National League West, the principal subject of conversation was 
the baseball rule book. The official lineup card, which was given to plate 
umpire Gerry Crawford before the game (and used by Lasorda), had Brian Dorsett 
batting seventh and Bret Boone eighth. The lineup on the Reds' dugout wall had 
Boone batting seventh and Dorsett eighth, their usual order. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said he noticed the change before play started, but waited to say 
something until either of the involved players had gotten on base, which 
Dorsett did in the second inning with a walk -- after Boone had led off the 
inning by grounding out. 
</P>
<P>
 As pitcher John Roper, the Reds' ninth batter, walked to the plate, so did 
Lasorda, who told Crawford the Reds had batted out of order. Crawford thereupon 
pointed at Dorsett, standing on first base, and told him to go to the dugout. 
Then he called Roper, who had not had a pitch thrown to him yet, out, and said 
the next batter should be the one who follows Roper in the order, leadoff man 
Barry Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, who said later that he recalled a similar situation when Ron Cey and 
Dusty Baker were on his team, protested. "I wanted Boone to come back and hit 
in (his listed) spot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, taking full responsibility for the lineup mishap, thought the next 
batter should be Roper. "The guy called out is in the eighth spot and the 
pitcher should hit -- you don't skip the next guy," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that mattered is what Crawford and umpire crew chief Bruce Froemming 
thought. "Here's the deal," Froemming said. "When you bat out of order, you 
never go backwards. Boone was the proper batter when Dorsett had a pitch thrown 
to him. Dorsett was batting out of order, so Roper is the next batter and he's 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy filed a protest, then Davey protested because he just wanted to 
protest. So we said, 'What the hell, we just let everybody protest.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsett's at-bat was nullified. Roper was scored an out by the catcher, 
unassisted. Boone's scoring remained the same, grounding out to first base, 
unassisted. Boone and Dorsett changed places in the batting order to align with 
the official lineup card when they came up again in the fourth inning, and the 
game went on. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Lasorda called off his protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez (3-2) pitched well for the fourth consecutive start, holding 
the Reds to two runs, one earned, before being lifted for pinch-hitter Jeff 
Treadway in the eighth with runners on the corners and two out. Treadway walked 
before Butler, who has a .375 average against Brantley, scored pinch-runner 
Garey Ingram from third base. "I had Fortugno up, but when Brantley got out the 
(No. 8) hitter, I thought he could get out of it," Johnson said of Brantley, 
who had held opponents to a .116 average with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort held the Reds scoreless in the eighth, but pitched what 
Lasorda called a "nerve-racking" ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort gave up three singles and a walk, but was hurt by Delino DeShields, 
who was trying for a double play and couldn't get the ball out of his glove. 
The Reds went on to score two runs to narrow the Dodger lead to 6-4 and had 
runners on second and third when Dreifort got Dorsett to ground out to first.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like it's always an adventure in the ninth inning," Dreifort said.

THE FUTURE IS NOW FOR BARKLEY, 104-94; PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER ROCKETS ELIMINATE

PLAYING.

 Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns answered the question before it was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the next question is, 'Was this my last game?' I honestly can say I 
don't know," Barkley said Saturday after the Houston Rockets scored a 104-94 
victory in the seventh game of the NBA Western Conference semifinals before a 
sellout crowd of 16,611 at the Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets, who advanced to the Western Conference finals for the third time 
in franchise history, will face the Utah Jazz in a best-of-seven series 
beginning here Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sun has set on Barkley's agonizing season, and perhaps on his 10-year 
NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved that this year is over because I don't want to play in the pain 
I played in this year," said Barkley, plagued by a back injury throughout the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley said he plans to meet with Sun physician Richard Emerson and two back 
specialists and will retire if they recommend major back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the doctor can make me feel better, then I'm going to play again . . . and 
if he can't -- hey it's been a great ride," Barkley said. "It's that simple. 
I'd love to win a world championship, but I feel that I've accomplished 
everything I set out to do as a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to make people wonder all summer what I'm going to do. If I 
can play without being in pain, I'll be back. I read somewhere where somebody 
wrote that I was doing this to get my contract redone or to get attention. But 
I honestly don't know if I'm going to play again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any human should have to take injections in his back in order 
to play. I don't want to go through this for 82 games again. That's not the way 
it's going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley said he talked to former Boston Celtic star Larry Bird, whose career 
was cut short by a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry told me that it was going to get worse before it got better," Barkley 
said. "I'm never going to have major back surgery. If they can do something 
with laser (surgery), then that's great. But if my option is to have major back 
surgery, then I'm done." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley was a shell of himself as the defending Western Conference champions 
became the second team in NBA history to lose a seven-game series after winning 
the first two games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he took a pain-killing injection before the game and two at halftime 
after he took a second-quarter charge from rookie guard Sam Cassell that 
knocked him to the court, Barkley maintained that he was ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, who grimaced in pain as he ran the court, made nine of 19 shots and 
scored 24 points and grabbed a team-high 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just in the way," Barkley said. "I couldn't run and I couldn't jump. A 
couple of times I wanted to make something happen, but I just couldn't do it 
physically." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley was ejected from the game with 7.4 seconds remaining after he 
intentionally shoved center Hakeem Olajuwon to the court as Olajuwon was going 
in for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket guard Vernon Maxwell, who was also ejected, ran over to retaliate and 
Barkley shoved him away before they were separated by Sun forward A.C. Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley said he shoved Olajuwon, who had 37 points, 17 rebounds, five assists 
and three blocked shots, because he felt the Rockets didn't need to score any 
more points. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shouldn't have tried to score again, so I knocked Hakeem down and then 
Vernon ran up in my face and I pushed him," Barkley said. "You don't celebrate 
like that when the game is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Olajuwon: "I think he was just frustrated. I don't have anything negative 
to say about Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles is the ambassador of the league. I'd hate to see him retire. He's 
like Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Olajuwon, who probably will succeed Barkley as the NBA's most 
valuable player, averaged 28.7 points, 13.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.9 
blocked shots in the seven-game series, Cassell and Maxwell kept the Rockets 
from crashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell scored 22 points, the most by a Rocket rookie in a playoff game since 
Olajuwon scored 32 against Utah in a 1985 first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell did a good job of guarding Dan Majerle, who averaged only nine points 
in the series.

DEVILS PARLAY EMOTIONS INTO SERIES-TYING EFFORT; NHL PLAYOFFS: WITHOUT 
NICHOLLS, BRODEUR STOPS 20 SHOTS IN A 3-1 VICTORY OVER RANGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<P>
 If there's an attitude that has characterized the New Jersey Devils under 
Coach Jacques Lemaire, it's us against them. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they get no respect from anyone and definitely no breaks from the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a 2-1 deficit in the Eastern Conference finals against the New York 
Rangers and the league's one-game suspension of center Bernie Nicholls, the 
Devils reached inside and came up big Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Brodeur stopped 20 shots and the fired-up Devils beat the Rangers, 3-1, 
Saturday night behind goals by Stephane Richer, Bill Guerin and Valeri 
Zelepukin. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sent the best-of-seven series back to New York's Madison Square 
Garden tied, 2-2. Game 5 will be Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been this team all year long," Devil defenseman Ken Daneyko said. "We 
don't have two or three guys who can carry us for a game. We count on 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 And everyone came through for New Jersey in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was the Devils' best in the series and it came in a game where 
they might have had a letdown. Losing Game 3 in double overtime was bad enough, 
but having the NHL suspend Nicholls for cross-checking Alexei Kovalev of the 
Rangers made it worse. 
</P>
<P>
 However, New Jersey dominated from the start, scoring two first-period goals 
to drive Ranger goalie Mike Richter from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholls didn't know if the suspension sparked the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just know they knew how important this game was," he said. "I think they 
showed it the first period. They came out and I can't recall us playing as good 
a first period. We set the tempo of the game and we determined how the game 
would go. We're a good team when we get the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils played so well they had Ranger Coach Mike Keenan scrambling all 
night. He shuffled his lines and benched several players, including star 
defenseman Brian Leetch. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan refused to explain why Leetch sat on the bench for stretches of seven 
and eight minutes in the first and second periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't play very well my first three, four or five shifts," Leetch said. 
"It was Mike's reaction to my actions on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Leetch wasn't alone in sitting. Center Craig MacTavish and wing Brian Noonan 
didn't play the second and third periods and defenseman Jeff Beukeboom sat when 
Leetch sat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers did get within 2-1 midway through the second period on a 
power-play goal by Stephane Matteau.  
</P>
<P>
 But Brodeur kept the Rangers at bay afterward with his best stop coming on 
Steve Larmer early in the third period on a give-and-go with Adam Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our play improved after the first period, but Brodeur was 
spectacular," Keenan said. "He came across with the leg and stopped Larmer. 
That was a game-saver for them."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TAPANI'S ARM IS ENOUGH FOR TWINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Minnesota Twins scored 20 fewer runs than Friday but still had enough 
behind the strong pitching of Kevin Tapani to defeat the Boston Red Sox, 1-0, 
Saturday at Minneapolis for their seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a roll," Minnesota catcher Matt Walbeck said. "Our confidence is 
really high. We don't think we're going to win, we know we are. After winning 
by 19 runs, to come back and win a one-run game like this shows how good our 
confidence is." 
</P>
<P>
 Tapani (4-2) allowed seven hits in 8 1/3 innings, walking three and striking 
out five as he outdueled Boston rookie Gar Finnvold (0-1), who worked seven 
innings and held the Twins to five hits -- 17 fewer than they had Friday when 
they set or tied eight team records in defeating the Red Sox, 21-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watched batting practice and it was pretty flat before the game, so we 
knew we were in for a rough go tonight," said Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly. "We 
were fortunate to get one run. We pitched a tad better than they did, just a 
tad." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knoblauch's fifth-inning single drove in the only run for the Twins, who 
had been 0-11 when scoring fewer than four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapani, who had a 7.78 earned-run average after seven starts, has allowed only 
two runs in his last two games. He is 6-0 against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Oakland 5 -- Lance Johnson broke a tie with a two-out, run-scoring 
single in the eighth inning and Robin Ventura had four runs batted for the 
White Sox, who rallied from a four-run deficit at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura hit a three-run homer and added a ninth-inning sacrifice fly to 
provide most of the offense for Chicago, which leads the majors with 265 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 7, Milwaukee 6 -- Travis Fryman drove in three runs and Chad Kreuter 
became only the 18th player to hit a home run out of Tiger Stadium as the 
Brewers' lost their 10th consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers trailed, 7-2, going into the ninth inning, but scored four runs 
with two out against Mike Henneman when Dave Nilsson and Turner Ward hit 
consecutive homers. Henneman finally retired Brian Harper to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got close, but that doesn't count," Milwaukee Manager Phil Garner said. "I 
like the fact that we got something going, though. We haven't had a lot of big 
innings in this stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Winner Mike Moore (4-3) allowed two runs on eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. Loser 
Jamie Navarro (2-4) gave up five runs on 13 hits in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Baltimore 4 -- Bob Melvin hit his first home run of the season, a 
three-run shot that capped a five-run first inning for the Yankees at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Melido Perez (3-2) allowed six hits and three runs over five innings for the 
victory. Steve Howe picked up his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Palmiero set an Oriole record by extending his hitting streak to 23 
games with a run-scoring single in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 9, Cleveland 7 -- Paul Molitor hit two home runs, singled twice and 
drove in four runs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Carter drove in his major league-leading 52nd run as the Blue Jays opened 
an 8-1 lead in the third inning against Chris Nabholz (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto's Al Leiter (3-3) ended a three-game winless streak, allowing five 
runs and eight hits over six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 13, Texas 2 -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit his major league-leading 19th home 
run and Luis Sojo hit his first grand slam as the Mariners pounded the Rangers 
for the second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Buhner, Tino Martinez and Eric Anthony also homered for the Mariners, who 
hit five homers on Friday night in a 19-2 rout of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey homered for the eighth time in 10 games, giving him 12 home runs in 
May, the most ever by a Seattle player in a month.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TEWKSBURY GETS EIGHTH VICTORY, 7-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury keeps pitching just well enough to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old right-hander struck out six and walked one in eight innings to 
become baseball's first eight-game winner as the St. Louis Cardinals defeated 
the Florida Marlins, 7-5, Saturday night at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to finish," Tewksbury said. "But if I can go out and pitch eight 
innings each game, I'm happy with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (8-1) allowed nine hits, including Benito Santiago's two-run homer.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a better pitcher this year," St. Louis Manager Joe Torre said about 
Tewksbury, who had won only one of his previous three starts and who won 15 
games in 1993. "Last year everybody was bragging he could throw a strike 
anytime he wanted to. The thing that's most impressive this year is that he 
doesn't throw a strike every time he wants to. You can't zero in on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida starter Chris Hammond extended his club-record streak of scoreless 
innings to 24 but left in the third because of tightness in his lower back. 
Robb Nen (2-2) pitched four innings for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 6, Montreal 0 -- Jon Lieber gave up only three hits in eight 
innings at Pittsburgh for his first major league victory, and Kirk Rueter 
finally lost after opening his career with a 10-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieber survived two inning-opening doubles to make his second strong start 
since being recalled from triple-A Buffalo 10 days ago. He lost to the 
Phillies, 1-0, in his debut last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh got single runs in the second and seventh innings before adding 
four in the eighth on two-run homers by Jeff King and Orlando Merced. 
</P>
<P>
 Rueter (2-1) fell two victories short of matching former Giant pitcher Hooks 
Wiltse's 90-year major league record of 12 consecutive victories at the start 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 9, New York 8 -- Milt Thompson continued his dominance over 
pitcher Bret Saberhagen with a three-run home run that sparked a six-run second 
inning at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can't explain it," said Thompson, now seven for 10 against 
Saberhagen. "Even if I could, you don't like to say anything when things are 
going good." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Wells (1-0), one of five Phillie pitchers, worked only two-thirds of an 
inning to get his first major league victory. Doug Jones pitched a perfect 
ninth inning for his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 4, San Diego 2 -- Reliever Todd Jones pitched out of a bases-loaded, 
none-out jam in the sixth inning at Houston, as the Padres' club-record losing 
streak reached 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones preserved the victory for Shane Reynolds (2-1), who gave up eight hits, 
both runs and struck out six in five innings. Mitch Williams pitched a perfect 
ninth inning for his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Benes (2-8) took the loss, going six innings and giving up eight hits and 
four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 12, San Francisco 10 -- Steve Buechele had a home run and four runs 
batted in and Sammy Sosa homered twice for the Cubs at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth consecutive victory for the Cubs, who had to overcome two 
home runs by Matt Williams and a two-run ninth-inning homer by Mark Carreon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Grace had three hits and three runs in Chicago's 15-hit attack. Jim 
Bullinger (1-0), who relieved in the fourth, pitched 2 1/3 innings for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 5, Colorado 4 -- Tony Tarasco homered and drove in three runs and Kent 
Mercker had a perfect game until the fifth inning at Colorado, as the Braves 
defeated the Rockies for the 15th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker (3-0), who pitched a no-hitter on April 8 against the Dodgers and who 
collaborated with two relievers on another no-hitter in 1991, retired the first 
12 batters before Andres Galarraga led off the fifth with a single.

BUTCHER IMPRESSES THE NEW BOSS; BASEBALL: LACHEMANN CALLS ON RELIEVER, WHO TOOK 
LOSS MONDAY. HE RESPONDS BY EARNING SAVE IN ANGELS' 3-0 VICTORY OVER KANSAS 
CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers may have been quick with the quip and always quotable, but as far 
as Mike Butcher is concerned, Marcel Lachemann is the great communicator. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lachemann took over as Angel manager, he said Joe Grahe would be his 
closer. But Saturday night, with Grahe having pitched in three of the last four 
games, Butcher was told he would be the man called on to nail down a victory if 
the situation arose. 
</P>
<P>
 About three hours later, with the bases loaded and two out in the eighth 
inning and the Angels clinging to a 2-0 lead, Lachemann went to the mound and 
signaled for Butcher. Butcher worked the count to 2-2 and thought he had struck 
out pinch-hitter Brian McRae on a curveball. But when he didn't get the call, 
he came back to freeze McRae with an inside fastball for a called strike three. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher retired the side in order in the ninth to pick up his first save since 
Aug. 28, 1993, as the Angels beat Kansas City, 3-0, at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Butch did an excellent job," Lachemann said. "You've got a .300 hitter at the 
plate and a base hit ties the game. It's a big plus to have two power pitchers 
who can close like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, who got the loss Monday night when he gave up two runs after 
inheriting a 5-4 lead in the seventh inning, momentarily lost his 
bad-boy-relief-pitcher glare when he struck out McRae. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got him with the fastball I guess I showed a lot of emotion, but it's 
been a long time since I felt that good," he said. "That was a really big out 
for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't feel like I had my best stuff, but it's a good feeling 
knowing you can get the job done without your best stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher was recalled May 7 from triple-A Vancouver after rookie starter Brian 
Anderson suffered a broken thumb. He was optioned to the Canadians on April 24 
after staggering to a 16.62 earned-run average in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting all over now and I don't want to look back," Butcher said. 
"We're looking forward now to the future of this team. Good things will happen 
to this team if we keep playing like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann has helped make it easier for Angel relievers to succeed, according 
to Butcher, because he has spelled out each players' role. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has established who is going to be doing what and I think that's a big 
plus for everyone in the bullpen," he said. "If you know your role, it gives 
you a little more time to get ready. You can walk away from the other guys and 
get your thoughts together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we kind of knew, but we weren't as sure. I'm not saying Buck didn't 
do a good job, but you just know that Lach is going to do a great job with the 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just knows how to handle a pitching staff. He knows how to talk to you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel pitchers had Rodgers talking to himself . . . not to forget voicing 
his complaints in public, which might have led to his firing. Lachemann is 
relying on happy talk right now and why not? The Angels are 3-0 since he took 
over as manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in first place now," Butcher said, smiling, "and that's what it's all 
about."

JAZZ CANCELS DUBIOUS DATE WITH HISTORY BY STAVING OFF UPSTART NUGGETS; NBA 
PLAYOFFS: MALONE SCORES 31 IN 91-81 VICTORY, SETTING UP DUEL FOR TITLE SHOT 
AGAINST THE ROCKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Utah Jazz, desperate to avoid one of the most embarrassing defeats in NBA 
history, finally ended Denver's memorable playoff run Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone scored 31 points as Utah halted its playoff skid against the 
upstart Nuggets with a 91-81 victory in Game 7 of the Western Conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loves Cinderella, everybody loves the underdog. So it was neat to 
get the job done," Malone said. "I love to hunt and fish in the summers, but 
I'm not quite ready to do that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz led, 3-0, in the series before Denver rallied to square it at 3-3. As 
the 17th consecutive home team to win a Game 7, Utah avoided the embarrassment 
of becoming the first team ever to lose an NBA playoff after leading 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we wanted it a little more," Malone said. "Contrary to what happened 
earlier this week, everybody just stuck together and played hard." 
</P>
<P>
 He made 12 of 23 shots and also had 14 rebounds as the Jazz earned only its 
second trip to the Western Conference finals. In 1992, Utah lost in six games 
to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malone said it was too early to rejoice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houston will be tough," he said. "Until we touch untouched waters, I have 
nothing to celebrate. We've been to the Western Conference finals before." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek scored 18 points for the Jazz, who now will face Houston in a 
series that starts Monday at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Williams had 17 points, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 14 and Brian Williams 13 for 
the Nuggets, who were making their first conference semifinal appearance since 
1988. Dikembe Mutombo got 12 points, 17 rebounds and two blocked shots to 
extend his NBA playoff record for a series to 38. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malone told me as the game ended, 'It was a hell of a series, great job.' And 
I wish him well, and good luck," Mutombo said. "I'm happy with the excellent 
season we had, for me being able to block all these shots, break these 
records." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver Coach Dan Issel wasn't discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids have gotten some incredible playoff experience," he said. "I'm 
tickled to death. We've exceeded expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended a remarkable playoff run for the Nuggets, who fell behind 
Seattle, 2-0, in the first round, only to win, 3-2, and become the first 
eighth-seeded team to eliminate a top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
 Down by 19 points midway through the fourth quarter, the Nuggets rallied, as 
they had in each of their victories. This time, however, the Jazz found the 
answer in their halfcourt offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz owner Larry Miller, usually a Delta Center fixture, was not on hand to 
see his team win. Miller agreed to a two-game NBA ban from his arena after 
scuffling with several Denver fans during Utah's 109-101 double-overtime loss 
here on Tuesday.

SOUTHERN SECTION TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; PUGMIRE'S DOUBLE HELPS CARRY 
ESPERANZA GIRLS TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no denying Courtney Pugmire at the Southern Section Track and Field 
Championships on Saturday at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't exactly sure it would happen. Her coaches were positive it would. 
Most importantly, she did everything and more in leading Esperanza to the 
Division II girls' team title. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior opened the afternoon by winning the 1,600 meters, pulling away from 
Santa Barbara's Mary Cobb to reach the line in 5 minutes 6.62 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Battling the heat and a fierce finishing kick by Santa Margarita freshman 
Katie Nuanes, Pugmire then turned in a superb encore in the 800, winning in 
2:16.64, barely ahead of Nuanes (2:16.76). 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think that I could do this today," Pugmire said of her double 
victory. "I hoped for it and knew I could if I really worked hard today." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Esperanza Coach Al Britt: "Her attitude is that 'I'm going to do whatever 
it takes, because I want to win.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a real person on a mission this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Pugmire, who last season narrowly missed advancing to the State meet by one 
spot in the 800, scored 20 individual points, and combined with 16 chipped in 
by teammate Kristy Kierulff, it was enough to propel the Aztecs to the team 
title they lost a year ago to Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anything ever goes according to plan," Britt said. "But without 
Pugmire and Kierulff, we would really be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Kierulff won the high jump (5 feet 8) and finished third in the long jump 
(18-3 1/4). She and Pugmire ran legs on the third-place 1,600 relay team that 
secured the victory for the Aztecs, who scored 50 points to edge Moreno Valley 
Canyon Springs (45). 
</P>
<P>
 The top nine overall times or marks from the four divisions advanced to 
Friday's Masters meet at Cerritos College. The top five finishers there advance 
to the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Jaime Martinez of Orange and Carrie Garritson of Buena Park easily 
qualified in their 3,200 races. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez pulled away from the Division II field in the last mile to post the 
second-fastest time of the day, a personal season-best 9:13.77. Palmdale junior 
Antonio Arce ran 9:13.30 to win the Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a pretty good double today," said Martinez, who also finished third in 
the 1,600 with a county-leading 4:14.01. 
</P>
<P>
 Garritson ran 11:00.12 to win the Division II girls' race, running 5:33 for 
the opening mile and racing home in 5:27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt really good," she said. "I wanted to try and run a little faster, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was Orange County's talent depth more apparent than in the girls' 800 
Saturday. In addition to the Division II race between Pugmire and Nuanes, 
divisions I and III featured some of the county's finest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division I, Edison senior Julie Koudelka ran a blistering opening lap of 
1:02 and held on to win in a county-leading 2:16.19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I went out so fast," said Koudelka, the county champion. "I 
guess I was a little excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Division III featured a duel between Laguna Hills' Tiffany Boykin and Trabuco 
Hills' Peggy Hall. The two juniors ran neck-and-neck through the 500 mark, but 
Boykin's speed and strength allowed her to outrun Hall, 2:16.35 to 2:19.38. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor senior thrower Gina Heads advanced in the Division II shotput 
(a winning 42-9 3/4) and discus (second in 136-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback twin brothers Mel and Matt Lete kept their seasons alive, Mel 
finishing second in the Division II 300 intermediate hurdles (38.72), and Matt 
racing to a third-place spot in the 400 (48.83). 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the first hurdle, and my steps were off at every hurdle the rest of the 
race," Mel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill boys, led by senior pole vaulter John Bain, kept most of their 
team intact for another week. Bain outlasted the Division II field, winning 
with a season-best tying 14-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' 1,600 relay, with Don Oliver running injured, still won in 
3:20.80. Oliver, hampered by a hamstring injury since finishing second in the 
county 400 final in late April, ran a 48.2 split to give Ethan Taub a 20-meter 
lead heading into the anchor leg. Taub brought Foothill home in 49.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Taub's individual effort for a return to the State meet was not as successful. 
After running boxed in behind several runners in the 800, Taub finally broke 
wide, but his kick fell short, and his 1:56.04 failed to advance him to the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tustin junior Reggie Curry won the Division II triple jump title with a 
leap of 46-6. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Woodbridge sprinter Gary Young finished second in the 100, running 10.70 
into a slight head wind, then returned to finish second again in the 200 with a 
personal best 21.39, also into the wind. Bryan Howard of Canyon Springs won 
both, in 10.50 and 20.76, a Division II record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Corona del Mar's Jason Boyce advanced in the Division II long jump (second 
in 22-9 1/4) and 100 (fourth in 11.04). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laguna Hills' Jesse McDonald threw 164-7 to win the Division III discus and 
advance to the Masters.

SOUTHERN SECTION TENNIS INDIVIDUAL PRELIMINARIES; POWER OF PERSUASION LIFTS 
CORONA DEL MAR PAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 With each of Tyler Stonebreaker's wayward volleys and inept serves, Corona del 
Mar's Jed Weinstein saw his high school tennis career slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 But after nearly two sets of agony Saturday at Edison High, Weinstein decided 
to try and pull his doubles partner out of his funk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I should be the one stressing out and getting upset," Weinstein 
said. "I'm the senior. This could be my last match." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein's amateur psychology worked as Stonebreaker started hitting winners 
and began pulling his share of the load. And with the two of them playing well, 
they eventually defeated Canyon's Jerry Liao and Heath Kula, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, and 
advanced into the round of 16 of the Southern Section individual doubles 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein and Stonebreaker, the Edison sectional's top-seeded team, advanced 
along with University's Robbie Wilkins and Jason Meyers, Villa Park's Chad 
Smith and B.K. Chang and Burbank's Phil Cano and Brad Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Weinstein's pep talk, his team was trailing, 4-3, and down a 
service break in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous," said Stonebreaker, a sophomore who transferred from Mater 
Dei. "Jed was the only reason we stayed in it. I had a lot of pressure on me. 
But Jed told me not to worry about it. Many things just built up, I guess. But 
Jed told me to relax, and that really helped me. I needed to know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Stonebreaker's sore shoulder and Kula and Liao's excellent play didn't make it 
any easier. During the first set and a half, Kula and Liao dominated at the 
net. Kula was nailing overheads, and Liao was hitting winning volleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were on the net," Stonebreaker said. "They took the game away from us. 
But coach (Tim Mang) told us to start attacking, and that worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Liao said he and Kula began to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took things a little too easily," said Liao, who went 50-3 with Kula this 
season. "And we started going for big shots instead of just getting the ball in 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's Smith, who reached the round of 16 doubles for a second 
consecutive year, kept the ball in play long enough to beat Roy Kim and Jack 
Lui of Burbank, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4, in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had problems similar to Stonebreaker's. 
</P>
<P>
 "B.K saved me," Smith said. "My mental focus wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 In singles, Ocean View's Jakub Pietrowski, Villa Park's Ryan Hollis, 
Foothill's Ryan Thompson and Newport Harbor's Geoff Abrams advanced to the 
round of 16 without dropping a set. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollis, who wasn't seeded, won three matches despite battling a severe cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of trouble sleeping (Friday) night," Hollis said. "I had a real 
sore throat, and I couldn't eat anything (Saturday) morning. I had half a 
pancake." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hollis, a senior who teamed with Smith last year, regained his appetite by 
the afternoon and routed fourth-seeded Derek Munchow of Long Beach Wilson, 6-3, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's matches at Seacliff Racquet Club begin at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At Yucaipa High: 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, Johnson advance -- Trabuco Hills' Nolan Cooper and Bryan Johnson 
advanced in doubles by winning three times, including a 7-5, 6-2 victory over 
Kris Mueller and Brent Masi of Riverside Poly.

NCAA SOFTBALL REGIONALS; RED-FACED TITANS OUST WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton kept its hopes alive Saturday for a seventh regional 
softball championship and berth in the NCAA World Series, and it did so with an 
unusual source of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had been humiliated, 9-0, by host Cal State Northridge in a game 
stopped after five innings because of the eight-run mercy rule. The loss sent 
Fullerton into the losers' bracket and a do-or-die situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (34-28), ranked 20th in the country, then upset No. 10 Washington 
for the second day in a row to advance to today's 12:30 p.m. final against 
Northridge. The Titans must win twice to reach the World Series, and it won't 
be easy. The Matadors (48-7) have won 13 in a row and are 22-2 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's 4-0 victory over Washington on Saturday came after the Huskies 
(44-21) had ousted Maine, 10-0, in a game also halted by the mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all wanted to just crush the ball and get our anger and frustration out," 
said Titan first baseman Rose Garces, who staked Fullerton to a 2-0 lead with a 
run-scoring double in the first. "We got creamed (by Northridge). We just 
decided we were going to take it out on the next team we played." 
</P>
<P>
 Garces had one of four doubles for the Titans and the game's only RBI when she 
hit an opposite-field line drive off the base of the fence in left-center to 
score Traci Fischer from second. 
</P>
<P>
 The first run of the inning came when Jstone Vines hit a ground ball through 
the legs of Husky first baseman Michelle Cash, took second on a passed ball and 
came home on a single to left by Fischer and a fielding error by left fielder 
Shelley Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton added two runs in the second with singles by Monica Bagalayos (two 
for three) and Laurie LoForti and two more errors by Washington, which finished 
with four. All four Fullerton runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman pitcher Trinity Johnson, in the most important game of her young 
career, threw a six-hitter, striking out eight and walking one for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of confidence in myself, and I don't worry about what a team has 
done before," said Johnson (14-11), who began the game with a 2.12 earned-run 
average. "My defense saved me a few times. That was nice." 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson, who has five screws in her throwing hand from a 1993 car 
accident, stopped Washington's biggest threat herself. With runners at first 
and second and one out in the third, she struck out Jennifer Cline and Michelle 
Church. Johnson wasn't aware that Cline had two home runs (including a grand 
slam) and seven RBIs against Maine.

KLOPAS SCORES TWO BUT CAN'T HEAD OFF U.S. LOSS; SOCCER: DEFENSE BREAKS DOWN IN 
SECOND HALF AS BAYERN MUNICH WINS, 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In most countries, Frank Klopas' hot head would have earned him a place on 
front pages, billboards and perhaps even ballots for political office. With his 
two goals Saturday, both on headers, he has six in the last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Greek first division veteran is now playing soccer in the United 
States, where six or even 60 goals and a couple of dollars still will not buy a 
glass of ouzo. He also is playing for a side, the U.S. national team, that 
often cannot win even with an exceptional performance from one of its 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the situation at Municipal Stadium, where a crowd of 16,492 left not 
in elation over Klopas' goals but in distress over the final score. It was 
Klopas 2, Bayern Munich 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it would not be fair, it would be easy to second-guess U.S. Coach 
Bora Milutinovic for removing Klopas from the game at the end of the first 
half, when his team had a 2-1 lead. But Milutinovic is more concerned about 
this summer's World Cup than he is about beating Bayern Munich and wanted to 
see Ernie Stewart, who arrived 11 days ago after finishing his season with a 
Dutch professional team, play the striker position. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it was not the offense that cost the United States the game but the 
defense, which broke down often in the second half, giving up two goals within 
one particularly stupefying four-minute stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 So now there are only three games remaining for Milutinovic to find the 
answers to his prayers before the United States opens play June 18 against 
Switzerland in the World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked about U.S. chances in that monthlong tournament, Bayern Munich's general 
manager, Uli Hoeness, said: "If the United States plays like that, it will be 
very difficult for them."  
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. coaching staff did not panic after Saturday's loss for a couple 
of reasons, one of them having to do with the strength of its opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayern Munich, the champion of Germany's first division, would be a match for 
a number of national teams, and one of its assets is its depth. Among the five 
starters absent Saturday was striker Adolfo Valenica of Colombia, but Mehmet 
Scholl moved up from his usual position in the midfield and scored two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the United States was unveiling a new defensive scheme, and it is only 
natural that there was some confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the charitable analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 It is less charitable to point out that some U.S. defenders not only were a 
step behind in their movements against Bayern Munich but also in their 
thinking. And they did not appear to be thinking at all when Scholl dribbled 
unimpeded down the middle of the field to score the winning goal in the 60th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was more astonished than U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who was left in 
the unenviable position of having to face Scholl one on one. 
</P>
<P>
 All three Bayern Munich goals resulted from errors in front of Friedel, which 
he no doubt hopes the coaches will note as they try to decide whether he or 
Tony Meola will be the starting goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Klopas' streak, the coaches also will be faced with an unexpected 
difficult decision concerning the starting striker. Until recently, it was 
assumed that the job belonged to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that it's the striker's job to score goals," U.S. 
assistant Steve Sampson said. "Anyone with a history of scoring goals, 
especially a recent history, has got to be a strong contender to be in the 
first 11. Klopas is quickly making a name for himself."

 Tom Lehman held the 54-hole lead at Jack Nicklaus' Memorial tournament 
Saturday, as he did six weeks ago in the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, th lead he held after Saturday was four strokes instead of 
the one-shot edge he had at Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a third consecutive five-under-par 67 for a 201 total, well ahead of 
second-place John Cook and eight shots better than Donnie Hammond and David 
Edwards, who are tied or third. 
</P>

TRACK AND FIELD / SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS; BELL GARDENS' GRANVILLE SETS 
U.S. MARK IN 800 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 There is such nobility in solitude. 
</P>
<P>
 And Michael Granville of Bell Gardens High found much of it Saturday at the 
CIF Southern Section interdivisional track and field finals at Long Beach 
Veteran's Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville was so far in front of the rest of the field in the Division I 800 
meters that he seemed to be running the race alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville's winning time of 1 minute 48.98 seconds broke the national 
sophomore record of 1:50.8, which was was shared by William Contee of Woodson 
High in Washington D.C., who ran the time in 1976, and Fred Bronner of Morris 
Hills High in New Jersey, who ran it in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville's time was the fastest time in the nation this season by 1.89 
seconds and also broke the Southern Section Division I record, set by Eddie 
Davis of Compton in 1981, by 0.45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville burst out to a blazing start, putting an insurmountable distance 
between himself and the rest of the field. The second-place finisher, Matt 
Teeson of Ayala, crossed the finish line 4.69 seconds after Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just overwhelmed with every step I took," Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
 So was the crowd of 8,210, which applauded loudly when Granville's time 
flashed on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Granville won the 800 at the Arcadia Invitational for the second 
consecutive year. He also was the Track and Field News high school indoor 
athlete of the year this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville's training method resembles the way he runs races: in solitude. 
Granville does not train with the Bell Gardens track team but trains with his 
father, also Michael Granville, at a nearby park. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville's father, who ran the quarter- and half-mile at Cal State Northridge 
in 1975-76, said he trains his son on grass because "it makes you work harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Granville set the national freshman record in the 800 with a time 
of 1:51.03. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville had extra motivation on Saturday because he found out shortly before 
running the 800 that he had been scratched from the 200. 
</P>
<P>
 An Accutrack malfunction at the preliminaries last weekend forced a run-off of 
six different races, including the 200, at Gahr High on Thursday. But after a 
misunderstanding between officials and Granville's father, Granville didn't 
attend the 200 run-off and was scratched from the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 800 final, Granville's father had some words of advice: "Get so far 
ahead that there's no doubt who won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Granville took the advice to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Haslip of Pasadena Muir won the 110 high hurdles in 14.21 and the 300 low 
hurdles in 36.87, breaking the Division I record set by Yki Vallery of 
Hawthorne in 1987 by 0.01 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir also won the 1,600 relay in 3:18.32 and won its second-consecutive 
Division I boys' team title with 65 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Morningside won its third consecutive boys' team title, this year in Division 
III, with 78 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners: Division II, Arroyo Grande, 57 points, and Division IV, Serra, 
84 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' competition, Aminah Haddad of Long Beach Poly won the 100 in 
11.81 and the 200 in a record 23.23, breaking the Division I record set by 
Paulette Blalock of Compton in 1984 by 0.31 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad also ran the anchor leg of the winning 1,600 relay to lead Poly to its 
third-consecutive Division I team title with 82 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morningside girls won their fifth consecutive team title, this year in 
Division III, with 78 points. Other winners: Division II, Esperanza, 50 points, 
and Division IV, Cate, 46 points.

A SWEEP FOR UCLA IN PAC-10; TRACK AND FIELD: REED HELPS BRUIN MEN TURN BACK 
TROJANS FOR THIRD STRAIGHT TITLE; WOMEN ALSO REPEAT.

 Sprinter Marcus Reed swept the 100 and 200 meters as UCLA again won both the 
men's and women's titles in the Pacific 10 Conference track and field 
championships Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's men, winning for the third straight year despite a spill by defending 
champion Ross Flowers in the 110-meter hurdles, scored 135 points to 121.5 for 
runner-up USC. Washington State was a surprising third with 109. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruin women, champions for the second year in a row, had 127 points, 13 
more than second-place Arizona State, with Arizona another 18 back. The Trojans 
were fourth with 53. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's male distance runners exceeded expectations. Creighton Harris finished 
second in the 3,000-meter steeplechase Friday and third in the 5,000 meters 
Saturday, and Brian Gastelum's second place in the 1,500 meters was "a big one 
no one had counted on," said Bruin Coach Bob Larsen, who added: 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had enough of a cushion to withstand one disaster. (Flowers' 
mishap) was our one disaster. We just had to go on with our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen's teams have won six of the last eight Pac-10 titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, a senior from Canoga Park, took the 100 in 10.47 seconds, the 200 in 
20.57. He also ran the third leg on UCLA's 400-meter relay team, which won in 
39.69. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a pretty good day," he said. "There was some good competition, and the 
weather was nicer than yesterday (when it was cold and rainy)." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate John Godina retained his two conference titles, winning the shotput 
Friday and taking the discus Saturday with a throw of 189 feet 7 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Greene paced USC's efforts, winning the 400 meters in 46.15, placing 
second in the 200 in 20.80 and anchoring both relay teams -- the Trojans won 
the 1,600 in 3:06.64 and were second in the 400 in 40.01. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Bolden, UCLA's first-year women's coach, said: "We had a team meeting 
last night that was just tremendous . . . talking about pulling together and 
team unity, about not conceding, not making mistakes and staying together." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin Roshanda Glenn won the women's triple jump with a leap of 43-2 1/4, and 
teammates Candy Roberts and Sarah Andrews placed 1-2 in the discus at 169-0 and 
161-2, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State's Josephat Kapkory added a third men's distance title to his 
weekend collection Saturday, winning the 5,000 meters in 14:16.65 after taking 
the 3,000-meter steeplechase and the 10,000 meters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Cougar Coach John Chaplin's last home meet on the Mooberry Track. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaplin, 57, resigned after 21 years as head coach in the wake of a scandal 
for exceeding scholarship limits and awarding improper tuition waivers. The 
conference revoked Washington State's 1985 and 1991 conference titles and 
banned the team from postseason competition last year.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGIONAL BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; SOPHOMORE PITCHER FILLS IN FOR 
RANCHO SANTIAGO

 Rancho Santiago got a lift from an unexpected source Saturday as the Dons beat 
Riverside, 12-6, in a Southern California community college baseball playoff 
game at Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Ethan Wyckoff, who had a 6.37 earned-run average, pitched 5 2/3 
innings of shutout relief, replacing staff ace Brandon Hoalton, who gave up six 
runs in 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, defending State champions, advance to play Citrus at 11 a.m. today 
at Harbor with a berth in next weekend's State tournament at Cerritos College 
on the line. Citrus beat Riverside, 7-4, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus will have to beat Rancho Santiago (37-10) twice to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons lost three of four games to Riverside (34-10) this season, but Rancho 
Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said the difference Saturday was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time we played them, we walked 11 or 12 batters. Today we threw 
strikes, and that was the difference," Sneddon said. "Ethan has done that for 
us in the past. He was able to get his curveball over and keep (Riverside) off 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago scored seven runs in the first three innings, led by Darren 
Troilo's first-inning, three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tigers chipped away at the lead, scoring two runs in the second, third 
and fourth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyckoff took over for Hoalton in the fifth inning with one out, a runner on 
third and Rancho Santiago leading, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyckoff kept the lead, getting Rusty McNamara to ground out to Corey Doll at 
shortstop and then getting Dennis Konrady to pop out to Doll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came in trying to throw strikes," Wyckoff said. "They just got some 
timely hitting earlier in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago followed by scoring a run in the fifth inning and two runs in 
the sixth and seventh, building a 12-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been scoring more runs lately," Sneddon said. "I think we're starting 
to get into a groove offensively, and that can be especially good when other 
teams have to start using more of their pitching staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Darryle Ward and Doll each had three hits, and Troilo had five runs batted in.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGIONAL BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; CYPRESS' FRANCE SHUTS OUT 
SOUTHWESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitching has been the story of the playoffs for Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron France pitched a three-hit shutout Saturday as host Cypress beat 
Southwestern, 9-0, in a Southern California playoff baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 France's shutout was the second in a row for Cypress, which has not allowed a 
run in 22 innings. Josh Belovsky pitched a two-hitter Friday in a 4-0 victory 
over Chaffey in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if the pitching is better or the hitting is worse (this 
season)," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "I just know that our pitching has 
never been this good." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (38-10) plays Cuesta at 11 a.m. today at Cypress for a berth in next 
weekend's State tournament at Cerritos. Cuesta defeated Southwestern, 12-5, 
Saturday. The Chargers would have to lose twice not to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Hendren (9-2) will start today for Cypress, which has won 12 consecutive 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 France (12-3) tied Cypress' single-season mark for victories. He won the 17th 
of his career, also tying a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 France, a sophomore right-hander, didn't give up a hit for six innings but 
lost his no-hit bid when David Sanchez lined a single to left-center to start 
the seventh. France finished with nine strikeouts, including the side in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "His curveball was outstanding today," catcher David Trentine said. "He had 
everything working." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Chargers didn't blow the game open until they scored eight runs in 
the seventh inning, it was key that France dominated batters early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aware of the no-hitter," France said. "It made me sharper. I knew I had 
to go after the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 Trentine had an RBI single in the first inning to give Cypress a 1-0 lead. 
That held up until Jason Hodges walked with the bases loaded to drive in the 
first run of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 The next run scored on a balk, and three more came home when Trentine doubled 
into the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw me a curveball that kind of hung," Trentine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Stevens had an RBI single, and Dominick Ruggiero had an RBI groundout, 
and the final run scored on an error.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS; LONG BEACH USES DOUBLE STEAL TO OUST 
CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cypress College's bid for the State softball championship ended Saturday night 
when the Chargers were defeated, 1-0, by Long Beach in the double-elimination 
tournament in Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (40-6) scored the game's only run with a double steal in the second 
inning.With runners at the corners, the runner on first broke for second and 
drew the throw. Brenda Rogers, who had reached base on an error, then scored 
from third. 
</P>
<P>
 After an 18-inning loss Friday night to College of the Sequoias, Cypress 
stayed alive for two games Saturday behind the pitching of freshman Jenny 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers shut out Fresno, 3-0, behind Lopez and Jackie Ruiz, who relieved 
in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (45-17) scored one run in the fourth inning and two in the sixth, and 
all three runs came with two outs and as the result of errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress then defeated San Joaquin Delta, 1-0, in 10 innings when Briana 
Yoshina drew a two-out, bases-loaded walk.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS; FULLERTON'S CARLSON WINS 
HIGH JUMP TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Carlson's first season of high jumping at Fullerton College was pretty 
much a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, the State high school champion as a junior at Katella, went out for 
track and field at Fullerton in the spring of 1992 but struggled adjusting to 
new coaching and surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, he couldn't even clear 6 feet 6. In 1993, he decided 
to concentrate on basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 But his second try at community college track and field ended in a State title 
Saturday when he jumped 7-0 1/4 in the championship meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning, Carlson had the bar raised to 7-2 1/2 in an attempt to break 
the Fullerton record but missed three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little disappointing," Carlson said. "But the State title feels 
great. That's all that matters in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 The event came down to Carlson and Moses Kearney of Merced; both had jumped 7 
feet earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson cleared on his first try at 6-10, but Kearney didn't until his third 
jump. Carlson and Kearney both missed on their first two attempts at 7-0 1/4, 
but on his third jump, Carlson cleared and stood up with both hands raised as a 
crowd of family, friends and supporters cheered him on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was confident I could make it," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson won when Kearney missed on his third try. 
</P>
<P>
 For other Orange County competitors, fourth place was the favorite position. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Mark Cullum (9 minutes 35.66 seconds) was fourth in the 3,000 
steeplechase. Golden West's Mark Crowley had a javelin throw of 189 feet, which 
was good for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Also fourth were Golden West's Lisa Mote in the 1,500 (4:44.01) and Rancho 
Santiago in the men's 400 relay (41.42). 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Courtny Leonard was fifth in the 400 hurdles in 1:06.77, and 
Orange Coast's Ulysses Trammell was sixth in the 100 in 10.73. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside and Long Beach tied for the men's title with 100 points, and 
Riverside won the women's title with 110 points. Rancho Santiago was the top 
county men's team with 11 points for 21st place; Saddleback topped the county 
women, finishing 23rd with eight points.

CAL LUTHERAN CONFIDENT OF SUNDAY PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The members of the Cal Lutheran baseball team are so confident that even 
losing doesn't bother them. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after the Kingsmen lost, 10-7, to UC San Diego in the third game of the 
NCAA Division III West Regional on Saturday, the players were still all smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go out and win it tomorrow," third baseman Scott Sebbo said. 
"We haven't lost confidence one bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran can afford such talk because Marc Weiss pitched a three-hitter in 
an 11-0 victory over the Tritons earlier Saturday at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen (31-7-1) have a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series that 
determines the West's representative in the eight-team Division III 
championships next week in Battle Creek, Mich. The series continues at noon 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the driver's seat," Sebbo said. "One more (victory) and we've 
got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-ranked Cal Lutheran, gunning for its third consecutive appearance at 
the Division III championships, rallied but fell short in an attempt to end the 
series Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen fell behind, 7-1, after two innings, but they chipped away and 
pulled to within 9-6 on Sebbo's two-run home run in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 10-7, in the ninth, the Kingsmen loaded the bases with two out for 
John Becker, the hottest hitter on the team. Becker has nine runs batted in and 
three home runs in the series, but he popped up to shallow left field against 
closer Kurt Luhrsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was upset (that Becker flied out)," Sebbo said. "He's been carrying 
us. He'll be the one who will win it for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker hit his 12th and 13th home runs of the season in the first game and 
barely missed another in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just seeing cantaloupes now instead of baseballs," Cal Lutheran Coach 
Marty Slimak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebbo was also hot Saturday. He was four for five in the first game and two 
for five with three RBIs in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 But all the Cal Lutheran offense in Saturday's first game was more or less 
academic. The Kingsmen hardly needed it with Weiss on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovering from back problems and a 6.51 earned-run average in his last three 
starts, Weiss pitched his third shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss (10-1) gave up three singles and four walks. He struck out six and 
retired 15 batters on ground balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt good," Weiss said. "I was hitting my spots and my adrenaline 
was pumping." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second excellent performance in the series by a Cal Lutheran 
pitcher. Sam Arroyo pitched a complete game in a 5-3 victory in the series 
opener Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you've got to have to win a tournament -- great pitching," Slimak 
said. "We did in the first game and we didn't in the second game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen were down to No. 3 starter David Jaglowski for Saturday's second 
game. Jaglowski (5-2) lasted only 1 2/3 innings and he gave up seven runs, 
three on left fielder Craig Birk's second home run of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 The question for both teams heading into today's play is: Who's left to pitch? 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-ranked Tritons (29-6) will start sophomore right-hander Marc 
Abrams, who is 3-1 with a 4.45 ERA in five starts. Cal Lutheran will counter 
with junior left-hander Kevin Koschik, who is 2-2 with a 2.78 ERA in 22 2/3 
innings of relief.

NOTHING IS REALLY SOMETHING FOR MATADORS; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: NORTHRIDGE POSTS 
ANOTHER SHUTOUT WITH 9-0 VICTORY OVER FULLERTON IN SECOND ROUND OF REGIONAL 
PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mercy, this Cal State Northridge softball team means business. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge collected 12 hits, including two home runs, to fuel a 9-0 
five-inning victory over Cal State Fullerton on Saturday in the second round of 
the NCAA Division I regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Matadors' third consecutive victory in which the game ended because 
of a mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge beat Cal State Sacramento, 10-0, in five innings in its final 
regular season game to clinch its second consecutive Western Athletic 
Conference title. In their regional opener Friday, the Matadors pounded Maine, 
8-0, in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-ranked Matadors (48-7), who fizzled in postseason play last season, 
are definitely peaking at the right time. Northridge has hit seven home runs in 
the last five games and 32 hits in the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 And seven of the last eight Matador victories have come by shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this as good as it gets? Not according to second baseman Tamara Ivie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can play better than this," said Ivie, who went three for three 
against Fullerton. "I think we have the potential to score runs every inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's hitting now and that's what we need going into the World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 To earn its second berth in the College World Series at Oklahoma City, 
Northridge will have to beat Fullerton one more time. And they'll have two 
chances to do it if need be. Today's championship game in the 
double-elimination tournament begins at 12:30 p.m. If necessary, a second game 
will be played immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (34-28) beat Washington, 4-0, in the late game Saturday to advance 
to the championship round. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory over Washington helped ease the pain for the Titans, who were 
overpowered by the hard-hitting Matadors just a few hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge leadoff batter Terri Pearson ripped the first pitch of the game at 
second baseman Monica Bagalayos, who seemed a bit surprised by the hard-hit 
grounder and booted it. 
</P>
<P>
 After Beth Calcante's sacrifice moved Pearson to second, Ivie hit a bouncer up 
the middle that shortstop Traci Fischer fielded with a dive. Fischer jumped to 
her feet, but threw late to first base, while Pearson came around and scored on 
a slide under the tag of catcher Shannon Dolan.  
</P>
<P>
 Ivie went on to second, beating Dolan's throw. After advancing to third on a 
wild pitch, Ivie scored on Scia Maumausolo's line single to left-center and the 
Matadors were off to the races. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the ball explodes off the bat like that in the first inning, it just 
sets a tone," Fullerton Coach Judi Garman said. "We never got on track and we 
couldn't stop them. They were like a runaway train. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't seem to matter what we threw. They were clobbering it." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge got at least one hit in each inning and scored in all but the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante ripped the 32nd home run of her career to lead off the third. Five 
batters later, senior Kelly Hunt hit her first home run as a Matador, a 
three-run shot that gave Northridge a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hunt, who played three seasons at Fullerton before transferring to 
Northridge last fall, the home run against her old teammates was extra sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives me a chance to say that I went on and that I'm working hard and 
trying my best to be successful," said Hunt, who went two for three. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Amy Windmiller (23-2), who pitched a no-hitter against 
Fullerton in the teams' last meeting, finished with a three-hitter and struck 
out three.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / KENNEDY COSGROVE: VALLEY AREA GETTING OFF A FEW VOLLEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 This has been a breakthrough year for area boys' volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the four teams that will play in the Southern Section Division II 
semifinals Wednesday are local squads -- longtime power Royal, its Marmonte 
League rival Thousand Oaks, and the newest of the newcomers, Highland, in only 
its third year fielding a varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Royal has always been there, so it's nothing new for them," Highland Coach 
Mike Bird said. "But I think it's real neat for us and for Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders have advanced to a Southern Section final for five consecutive 
seasons. Thousand Oaks has never advanced to a section final and Highland lost 
in the first round of last year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most representation this area has had in volleyball," Royal Coach 
Bob Ferguson said. "We've had teams do well, like us and Harvard-Westlake, but 
now you've got five area teams (that are strong)." 
</P>
<P>
 He referred also to Harvard-Westlake, which was ranked near the top of the 
Division I poll all season long before falling to Huntington Beach on Friday 
night, and Canyon, which lost Friday in five games to Highland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, whose Royal team will compete in Division I after this season, said 
the keys to the strong local showing are the suddenly burgeoning volleyball 
programs in the Golden League. 
</P>
<P>
 "The desert area has just gone crazy," he said. "Highland, Canyon and Hart are 
going to dominate Division II in the next few years. They've got some talent up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Volleyball sites: Royal's quarterfinal match against South Torrance will be 
played Wednesday night at 7 at Mira Costa High in Manhattan Beach. Highland and 
Thousand Oaks will meet at Quartz Hill High. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Memo to the Southern Section: Stagger. 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff contests for the three main spring team sports -- baseball, softball 
and volleyball -- were all scheduled for Friday, creating a jumbled morass in 
which 200 playoff contests (92 baseball, 96 softball and 12 volleyball) were 
played in the space of about six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is it a logistical headache for section administrators to have so 
many events taking place at once, but it hurts the fans and the media, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Several area schools, including Simi Valley, Newbury Park, Hart and Crescenta 
Valley, had two teams competing at the same time at different locations. 
</P>
<P>
 And many out-of-area schools such as Esperanza, Peninsula and Millikan had 
three teams play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when high school sports need as much support -- financial, emotional 
and promotional -- as they can get, such a setup forces fans and students to 
choose which team's game they will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Media outlets also must allocate their resources accordingly, and oftentimes 
worthwhile events are not covered, and the so-called "minor sports" -- i.e. any 
sport other than baseball, football and boys' basketball -- get overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having the first round of baseball and softball and the volleyball 
quarterfinals on the same night is kind of crazy," Bird said. "For instance, 
our local paper was doing a great job keeping up with us all through the 
playoffs, but now that baseball and softball have started up, we're kind of 
getting lost a bit in the shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
 One solution would be to stagger the days each sport played, which would 
probably result in increased attendance -- and therefore, higher ticket sales 
-- and more consistent media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Volleyball, in its quarterfinal round, could have been showcased by playing 
Thursday night, when neither baseball or softball played. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a new idea. Because of gym availability, boys' and girls' 
basketball playoff games are usually played on different nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week will be better, when volleyball playoffs are on Wednesday and 
Saturday, baseball on Tuesday and Friday and softball on Tuesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But more consideration should be given in all rounds of the postseason to 
stagger the events, which would have numerous benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes more sense to me," Royal's Ferguson said. "The burden on the 
Southern Section office is incredible. And though it hasn't really been a 
problem for us, I know Esperanza had every team in the playoffs, and for fans 
that would be a big bummer." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A good run: The Harvard-Westlake volleyball team's season came to a close 
Friday night, ending the high school careers of a fine trio of Wolverine 
players who played together for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Sebree, Court Young and Seth Rodsky played for the Wolverines and on the 
same club team for the past three seasons and, though not the most physically 
imposing athletes, they possessed uncanny cohesiveness and court savvy to lead 
Harvard- Westlake to the Mission League co-championship and victories over then 
top-ranked Loyola and powerful Mira Costa on the same week in April. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth Wolverine teammate who played on the same club team, Doug Park, quit 
Harvard-Westlake for personal reasons only a week before the season started, 
surprising his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Park's absence was a blow to the Wolverines, whose roster was about as deep as 
a puddle. But Sebree said the team learned to compensate for Park's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it pulled our team closer together and we became more of a unit," he 
said. "We all became friends and are a real tight-knit bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 They showed their character in rallying from two games down to tie Friday's 
match against Huntington Beach, but suffered a blow when Sebree sprained a knee 
at the end of game four when he collided with an opponent who accidentally 
rolled under the net. The Wolverines lost game five, 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat marked the final high school match for Sebree, Young and Rodsky, 
but not their final match together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to both of them today," Sebree said. "It's hard because we're all 
so close. We're sad, but we're not done for good." 
</P>
<P>
 The trio will compete for Santa Monica Beach Club in the Junior Olympics on 
July 7-10 in Austin, Tex. The national tournament features more than 80 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a chance left (to end on a winning note)," Sebree said. "That 
would take a lot of the pain out of what we're feeling now."

NCAA WOMEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; DEFEAT HELPS PHEBUS FOCUS ON THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY GLIER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA's Keri Phebus didn't win an NCAA tennis championship Saturday, but at 
least she has the consolation of knowing she'll have two more cracks at it. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after upsetting top-seeded Laxmi Poruri in the NCAA singles tournament, 
the Bruin sophomore from Newport Beach, was beaten in the championship match, 
7-6, 6-2, by Georgia's Angela Lettiere. Lettiere, third-seeded in the 
64-player, single-elimination tournament, was spurred by a home crowd of nearly 
4,000 at the University of Georgia tennis complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus, a former Corona del Mar High star, was the first UCLA player to 
advance to the singles final in the 13 years of the NCAA women's tennis 
championships. She was the first unseeded player to reach the final since 
Clemson's GiGi Fernandez in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still gunning for a championship and I've got two more years to do it," 
said Phebus, who finished the season with a 32-8 record. "I'm not stopping 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, however, Phebus wondered if she should stop playing tennis. 
After losing in the first round of the Pac-10 indoor tournament in Seattle, 
Phebus, the No. 1 singles player at UCLA, said here this week, "I wondered if 
tennis was really meant for me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Phebus, 20, erased those doubts with five victories in this week's singles 
tournament, despite not being seeded among the top 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted this for myself, not to prove anything to anybody," said Phebus, who 
was 12th in the final rankings. "I thought I was worthy of being seeded." 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus looked fit to win the singles national title, especially when she 
defeated Poruri of Stanford on Friday in the semifinals, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. But 
Phebus hit a wall against Lettiere (46-12). The UCLA player said her serve 
finally cost her a match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggled a lot with my serve all season and it showed through today," said 
Phebus, who double-faulted 11 times. "I hung in there with it all tournament, 
but it was the bad point of the match for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point in the match, according to UCLA Coach Bill Zaima, didn't 
come during the first-set tiebreaker, but earlier in the set when Phebus led 
four games to three. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could have gone up 5-3, but there were two points where Keri netted two 
easy shots when she hit some soft shots," Zaima said. "My feeling was if she 
plays those two points more aggressively she wins the first set, 6-3, and it 
doesn't even go to a tiebreaker." 
</P>
<P>
 When the first set went to the tiebreaker, Lettiere took control by winning 
the first four points. The senior from Vero Beach, Fla., won the tiebreaker, 
7-4, and the first set, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 After she lost the first set, Phebus felt the emotion drain out of her. "I 
play a lot on emotion," she said. "She came out for the second set with a lot 
of determination and I came out flat." 
</P>
<P>
 At 2-2 in the second set, Lettiere took over the match for good. She won the 
next four games, mostly with well-placed lobs over Phebus when the Bruin came 
to the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hit a lot of lobs that I could have come down on, but to be honest, my 
body wouldn't get there," Phebus said. "She came out with a lot of energy . . . 
I thought she would be dead after all the matches she had played in the team 
tournament. I was dead . . . I was worn out."

TANSLEY'S PERSONAL BEST PUTS HIM 'ON BUBBLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton distance runner Mike Tansley ran the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase in 8 minutes 52.53 seconds on Saturday at the Adidas Oregon Track 
Classic, putting himself "on the bubble" for qualifying for the NCAA 
championships, Titan Coach John Elders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley improved his top mark by more than three seconds while finishing ninth 
in a field that included many of the top U.S. steeplechasers. 
</P>
<P>
 His time must be among the NCAA's top 18 to make the national meet, and Elders 
said it should place him between 14th and 18th.

RAYBURN, PHIPPS CRUISE AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Craig Rayburn of Santa Clarita and Dave Phipps of Simi Valley left their 
respective packs behind while driving to easy main-event victories before a 
crowd of 3,317 Saturday night at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayburn, fifth in the Sportsman points race, inherited the lead for good after 
a smoky six-car pileup narrowed the field considerably only five laps into the 
40-lap main event.Rayburn, en route to his second victory of the season, opened 
and maintained about a half-lap advantage over Sean Woodside of Saugus, who 
began the evening second in points. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Peacher of North Hills finished third. Points leader and defending 
champion Pat Mintey Jr. of Lancaster finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Phipps, defending three-time Grand American Modified champion, took the lead 
on the fourth lap of the 30-lap main event and roared unchallenged to his 
second main-event victory in three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the win moved Phipps ahead of John Watkinson of Canyon 
Country and into the points lead. Gary Nazaroff of Covina finished second, Dave 
Blankenship of Reseda finished third and Robert Rice of Hawthorne took fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Bratschie of Northridge easily won the 25-lap Street Stock oval main 
event, moving from second place into the lead to stay on the second lap to 
claim his first victory of the season. Mike Price of San Pedro, Richard Minor 
of Northridge and John Bower of Northridge followed Bratschie across the finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Randy Goldsmith of Cerritos won the 15-lap Street Stock oval 
main event to lead four drivers who advanced to the main. Richard Russo of 
Newhall, Steve Cremin of Saugus and Mike Gilmore of Van Nuys also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkinson and Rayburn won Sportsman heat races.

WITH VICTORY IN SIGHT, MUSTAFA FALTERS, TAKES 2ND IN DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The task was well understood by Isaiah Mustafa of Moorpark College, heading 
into the final event of the decathlon in the state junior college championships 
at Cerritos College Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa had to stay within five seconds of Jon Parry of Taft in the 1,500 
meters to win the state title. Mustafa held a 32-point over Parry after nine 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa shadowed Parry for the first 800 meters but fell behind by six seconds 
at the 1,200-meter mark in 3:59. Parry pulled away to finish in 4:48.46. 
Mustafa slowed considerably and finished in 5:21.32. 
</P>
<P>
 Parry picked up 622 points to Mustafa's 443 to overtake the Moorpark College 
sophomore, who led the two-day competition through all but the first event, and 
win with 6,875 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa finished with 6,722 points, smashing his previous best of 6,417 points 
set at the Southern California championships but finished in the runner-up spot 
for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Bigham of Fresno City College was third with 6,646 points and Chris 
Kanowsky of Long Beach City, the Southern California champion, was fourth at 
6,326. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just pushed it as far as I could go," Mustafa said. "My legs just cramped 
up and I could barely move when I finished. I came in second last year and I 
didn't like the feeling and I still don't like the feeling. It doesn't leave a 
good taste in your mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4, 205-pound Mustafa started Saturday's competition with an 
87-point lead over Parry -- 3,791 to 3,704. He timed 15.08 in the 110 high 
hurdles and opened a lead of 262 points in the discus, by winning with a toss 
of 124-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa cleared 12-5 1/2 in the pole vault, but Parry closed to within 151 
points by clearing 13-9 1/4. Parry, who scored 6,379 points to place third in 
the Northern California championships, gained 119 points in the javelin with a 
throw of 162-10 to Mustafa's 136-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would take a score of 7,000 to win and I know I'm capable of 
it," Mustafa said. "In this event, you can't think you're going to win just 
because you have one good event. Anything can happen. You have to pull together 
all at one time and I haven't mastered that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean McKeown of Moorpark broke his school record in the discus with a toss of 
164-11 to place second, and was third in the shotput with a personal-best of 
53-2 3/4. McKeown led the discus until David Dumble of Bakersfield, the final 
thrower of the competition, passed him with a throw of 168-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark was sixth in the team competition with 27 points. Long Beach tied 
Riverside for the title with 100 points -- its 11th title in 16 years under 
Coach Ron Allice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside women, bolstered by Astia Walker's victories in the 100 (11.66), 
200 (23.41) and 100 hurdles (13.76), and a meet record by Dawn Williams in the 
800 (2:06.30), outdistanced Long Beach by 15 points to win its second 
consecutive title with 110 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Blackburn of Ventura finished second in the discus at 139-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Issac Turner of Glendale was fourth in the women's 800 in 1:51.58, and 
teammate Auria Roberto was sixth in the 1,500 in 4:45.10. Yeko Ladzepko of 
Canyons was fourth in the women's 400 hurdles in 1:06.32 and teammate Robert 
Landtiser was sixth in the 400 intermediate hurdles in 53.60.

INJURY DAMPENS WATSON'S WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathy Watson of Saugus High experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of 
the feet, er, make that the ankle, within a span of 30 seconds in the Southern 
Section track and field championships at Long Beach Veterans Stadium on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, a senior, cleared a personal best of 5 feet 10 inches in the high jump 
to win her second consecutive Division I title, but as she pranced around the 
infield in celebration, she dislocated her right ankle and had to call it a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury, which Watson initially sustained while playing for the Centurions' 
basketball team earlier this year, appeared serious at first, but after being 
examined by a trainer she expects to jump in Friday's Southern Section Masters 
Meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it when it happened," Watson said. "I said, 'Oh God. No, 
no, no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The injury ended what had been a perfect competition for Watson as she cleared 
5-0, 5-2, 5-4, 5-6, 5-8 and 5-10 on her first attempts. Her jump of 5-8 topped 
her previous personal best of 5-7 and her 5-10 jump moved her into a tie for 
fourth on the all-time regional list with Linda Soja of Poly (1980) and Allison 
Walker of Hoover (1981). 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for someone who was competing in only her fourth outdoor meet after 
being academically ineligible for the first part of the season. "I came in here 
shooting for 5-8," Watson said. "When I got over that, I said, 'Yeah.' " JOHN 
ORTEGA

HOLLYWOOD PARK; LONGSHOT STRIKES HIGH NOTE, WINS THE WILL ROGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unfinished Symph isn't paying any attention to his pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 3-year-old colt was, he would know he really isn't supposed to enjoy 
the turf or long races. 
</P>
<P>
 A $13,500 purchase about a year ago by trainer Wesley Ward for owners Nancy 
Rice, Terry Hatcher and Joe Johnston, Unfinished Symph has improved since 
switching distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after finishing second behind Fumo Di Londra in the Spotlight, the 
16-1 shot overcame some trouble and beat Silver Music by a head in the $109,600 
Will Rogers Handicap at Hollywood Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Gary Baze, Unfinished Symph provided Ward, a former jockey, with his 
biggest victory as a trainer. Unfinished Symph completed the 1 1/16 miles on 
turf in 1:40 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Nature, the 4-5 favorite who was racing two weeks after nearly falling 
on the first turn in the Kentucky Derby, pressed the pace set by Cois Na Tine, 
then faded to third, five lengths behind Silver Music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse just didn't run his race today," jockey Laffit Pincay said of the 
favorite. "He broke OK, but he never really wanted to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make an easy lead if I could even if I had to use him a little 
bit to do so. But he just couldn't go on. He just wasn't himself. I suppose it 
was the trip (from Kentucky) that took something out of him. He didn't feel 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Able to save ground throughout, Unfinished Symph lacked room entering the 
stretch, and in the meantime, Silver Music and Chris Antley, racing on the 
outside, had drawn clear. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Unfinished Symph, once clear of trouble, took off and won for the 
third time in seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This colt has always shown a lot of ability and he was running well in 
sprints earlier in the year," Ward said. "But in his last few (sprint) starts 
he didn't seem to want to show any more speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he would stretch out, and basically, the only stakes for him were on 
the turf. He moves like a grass horse when I gallop him in the morning. I know 
his breeding doesn't say it, but he travels and floats over the grass the way a 
lot of turf horses I've ridden in the past did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks after his five-race winning streak ended in the El Rincon Handicap 
at Santa Anita, Megan's Interco is the 5-2 favorite in the $109,200 Shoemaker 
Handicap today at Hollywood Park.

 Stalking the pace set by Norwich, who also is in the Shoemaker field, Megan's 
Interco was unable to make up the necessary ground and wound up beaten by 
nearly two lengths at 7-10 odds.

 Before the El Rincon, the 5-year-old gelding had three successive stakes 
victories -- the California Cup Mile, the Turf Paradise Breeders' Cup Handicap 
and the Arcadia Handicap. Trainer Jenine Sahadi said he won't be restrained 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Of Barking, third behind Arcangues and Misil in the John Henry Handicap 
on May 1, is the 3-1 second choice. He has three victories and three thirds in 
six starts on the Hollywood Park turf course.

 Hollywood Park stewards Pete Pedersen, Ingrid Fermin and Tom Ward issued a 
ruling Saturday disqualifying Stalvoy, who ran on April 29 as Johnny Mc, from 
the purse money he earned after finishing fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Mc's owners, the Mirage Stable of James and Madeline Auerback, were 
ordered to return the $550 to Hollywood Park and the money will be 
redistributed to the owners of Jericho's Prospect, who was moved up to fifth by 
the disqualification.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; THE VIEW FINDER; HE HAS SEEN THINGS AND GONE PLACES NO 
OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS DARED. BUT HOWARD BINGHAM'S BEST SHOTS HIT VERY CLOSE TO 
HOME.

 Howard Bingham is chatting easily through his power lunch, explaining between 
mouthfuls how he goes about snagging the photos that have eluded some of his 
peers. He is not at Morton's, enjoying an icy martini as he destroys a filet 
mignon and Caesar salad. Nor is he perched on a leather booth at Maple Drive, 
noshing on homemade turkey sausages washed down with an interesting little 
Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he is hurtling south on the Harbor Freeway -- well above the posted 
speed limit -- crunching on a taquito swimming in a lethal salsa verde and 
taking gulps of Snapple from a bottle clenched between his knees. Not a drop 
spills on his handmade ostrich-skin cowboy boots, which, despite their beat-up 
appearance, cost more than many middle managers make in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 That lunch says a lot about how Bingham sees himself and his work. He is a 
homeboy who has done well and who is still firmly attached to his home in 
southeast Los Angeles. Although he has documented the glamorous and famous, 
Bingham's eye wanders to the undocumented parts of the city, to the people who 
often serve lunch rather than "do" it. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 35 years, he has captured African American life here, doing his 
work with an unobtrusiveness that has become his trademark. "I can't recall 
exactly when I met him," former Mayor Tom Bradley says with a shrug, "he was 
just there. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 His face may seem naggingly familiar, his name may or may not register, but 
Bingham's photographs garner instant recognition: an elegantly glowering Huey 
P. Newton, the former (and very late) chairman of the Black Panther Party, 
surrounded by party faithful; black Angelenos shouting at tense, 
weapon-brandishing LAPD officers; Muhammad Ali, glistening with sweat, after 
championship bouts in Miami, Zaire, Manila; Bill Cosby mugging for his Kodak 
ads; Robert Redford on his illuminated steed as the Electric Horseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham's photo files are too disorganized to be called archives. Still, as 
drawer upon drawer of his filing cabinet opens, pieces of forgotten local 
history come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is former Peace Corps Director Sargent Shriver (father of Maria, 
father-in-law of Conan the Republican) cutting the ribbon that opened the Watts 
Family Health Center on Compton and 103rd during the Watts Festival, once an 
annual cultural celebration. In his summer suit and boutonniere, Shriver looks 
like a benevolent colonial come, from the mother country, to inspect the 
natives. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are Burt Lancaster, Marlon Brando, Sammy Davis Jr. and James Brown, all 
young and slim and frightfully earnest, sharing a dais at a Hollywood 
fund-raiser for Mississippi Freedom Riders. And a dashiki-clad Maulana Karenga, 
book-ended by look-alike security guards, addressing mourners at the Coliseum 
in April, 1968, after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.  
</P>
<P>
 And, a year or so later, an almost willowy former opera student named Coretta 
Scott King in solo concert at Second Baptist Church. Budd Schulberg instructing 
his proteges at the Watts Writers' Workshop. The eerily pristine Watts Towers, 
without scaffolding. Malcolm X, as agog as any other fan, leaning back to snap 
a photo of Muhammad Ali at a Miami lunch counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has lived here nearly all of his life, Bingham was born in 
Jackson, Miss., in 1939, the first of seven children. His parents, the Rev. 
Willie E. Bingham Jr. and Willie Emmaline Bingham, sought to escape the 
suffocating weight of segregation and struck out for a new beginning in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 The family settled near 49th and Hooper but soon moved out to Imperial 
Highway, a bucolic place where young Howard and his friends could finish their 
chores and fish in a nearby canal surrounded by tall grass meadows. "We lived 
one block east of Central, right on the canal -- we used to catch crayfish down 
there," Bingham says. "The canal's still there, but it's all concrete now." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood contained a little bit of every ethnicity and was a world 
unto itself. "There was a mom-and-pop store run by a Mexican couple on the 
corner; we had an account there," Bingham recalls. "And on the next corner was 
a drive-in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bingham children rode the Red Car to San Pedro, Long Beach and Downtown. 
"We had a bus line -- the Southern California Transportation Company -- that 
would take you anywhere. You could go to Compton or Huntington Park for a 
dime." 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents didn't worry, partly because they were quite clear on the 
consequences of "acting out" -- the Rev. Bingham was a strict disciplinarian -- 
and partly because the streets were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham attended Compton public schools, graduating in Centennial High's 
second class in 1956. Several classmates went on to successful athletic 
careers: Roy White with the Yankees, Bobby Thompson as a New York Giant, Reggie 
Smith with the Dodgers and Charlie Dumas as a world-class high-jumper.  
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled in Compton Junior College and started to have fun. Fun, of the 
social sort, had been forbidden in the reverend's strict household. "To this 
day, I don't know how to dance," Bingham says with a laugh. "My parents didn't 
allow it." 
</P>
<P>
 But his considerable charm compensated for a lack of motor skills, and to his 
amazed delight the college ladies favored him -- despite a machine-gun stutter. 
"They don't know why I do it," he says. "One doctor told my mother it was 
because I kept too much in when I was a kid. But in my father's house, you 
watched what you said if you didn't want to get whupped." His new social life 
was wonderful but threatened to torpedo his academic status. "I was actually a 
music major. I'd taken piano and could play the violin. As a child, I'd been 
told I had a gift for music, but," Bingham says sheepishly, "I lost interest in 
it because I always had to practice while other kids were out playing 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 He left college, where he had failed a photography course, and went looking 
for work. He found it at Vons, mopping up and moving stock. After two years, it 
dawned on him that it was useless to aspire to bagging or checking, "because 
black folks didn't have those kinds of jobs back then." 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham decided to do what he most wanted. "A couple of my neighbors were 
photographers, La Vern and Myron Hodson, so I'd go over there and watch them 
work." It wasn't the picture-taking that he found so attractive: "I liked their 
(modus operandi) -- they always had girls over the house, for photo contests." 
</P>
<P>
 After appearing at the door of the Los Angeles Sentinel for a solid week to 
beg for work, photo editor Cliff Hall took pity on Bingham and allowed him to 
observe. ("He told me 'Come in -- but don't touch anything!' ") A week later, 
Hall consented to inquire whether Bingham might be hired. To their mutual 
surprise, management agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went off on jobs, came back with underexposed film, blurred film, no film 
-- and I always had an excuse for what went wrong," Bingham says of his early 
on-the-job training. Under Hall's guidance, Bingham's photos improved and were 
reproduced regularly, and he spent much of his time chronicling the daily life 
of black Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, private clients wanted the photographer to capture weddings, church 
functions and other social events ignored by the mainstream press. ("Black folk 
made very infrequent appearances in the (regular) paper, unless the crime was 
big-time and/or against whites.") Moonlighting increasingly interfered with his 
day job, and the Sentinel ultimately fired Bingham 18 months after hiring him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated at first," Bingham admits, "but actually, in retrospect, it 
was the best thing in the world that could have happened to me. Because if I'd 
stayed at the Sentinel, I never would have done half the things I've done since 
then." Such as documenting the career of his best friend, Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham met Cassius Marcellus Clay when the Sentinel assigned him to cover the 
sleek young fighter's bout with George Logan at the Sports Arena. Driving down 
Broadway, near 5th, a few hours after the fight, he spotted Clay and his 
brother hanging around, soaking up the ambience of a city much larger than 
their Louisville, Ky., hometown.  
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled over and asked them what they were doing, and they said, 'Looking at 
girls.' I told them I could drive them around, show them a little L.A., but 
they'd have to come with me while I did some errands first." 
</P>
<P>
 The two young men hopped into Bingham's car and saw such exotic sights as his 
photo lab and a Compton bowling alley before he took them to see black Los 
Angeles and finally to his mother's for a meal. By day's end, a rapport that 
would strengthen and deepen over the years had been established. Whenever the 
boxer was in town, he tagged along with the photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham photographed Clay's rise and metamorphosis into Muhammad Ali while 
also covering the burgeoning unrest in America's cities. But when Watts 
imploded in 1965, he was out of the country. "In Sweden, with Ali," he says, 
shaking his head. "Here we were, surrounded by white people, while L.A. was 
burning up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, a second "mini-riot" broke out. Jordan Bonfante, then Life 
magazine's L.A. bureau chief, caught Bingham at home and asked him to shoot. 
"They'd sent all the white photographers down there that evening, but the next 
week, they only ran my photos," Bingham says. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were some photos. His shots of a weapons cache -- rifles, handguns 
and ammunition neatly aligned on a yellow towel -- were an exclusive peek into 
the explosive potential of angry teen-agers. "The rioters knew I was with 
Life," Bingham recalls, "and in order to help me, they took me to where their 
ammo was stashed. They knew I'd not tell on them." 
</P>
<P>
 "He became a fixture free-lancer after that," says Bonfante, now L.A. bureau 
chief for Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people fussed about those photos when they were published," says Danny 
Bakewell, Brotherhood Crusade president and an old friend of Bingham. "They 
thought Howard should have turned those brothers in to the police. But Howard 
was able to get those pictures because he didn't violate press ethics -- but he 
didn't violate the brother-in-the-street's ethics, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such unusual access, Life put Bingham on summer retainer. He 
crisscrossed the country, covering urban uprisings in Buffalo, N.Y.; 
Bakersfield, and San Francisco. ("Have riot, will travel," he says with a 
grin.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Things got more grim the next summer in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wild, bullets everywhere. I didn't know if we were going to get out 
alive," Bingham recalls. "I got on the floor of my hotel (room), called my 
mother and Jordan Bonfante," and prayed until dawn -- "when I got the hell out 
of there." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Bingham's last riot. "I got tired of war duty," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, he went to Chicago to cover the Democratic National Convention. 
Thinking back on the vicious police beatings of anti-war protesters there, his 
face hardens: "I always say that if I had had a gun that night, I wouldn't have 
minded going to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Those photos were also widely circulated in Life, and Bingham became the 
second black contract photographer, after Gordon Parks, in the magazine's 
history. He brought back a graphically stark portrayal of the Mississippi 
Delta's black poor. And, closer to home, chronicled the rise of the Black 
Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers allowed the photographer and writer Gilbert Moore unprecedented 
access for a story that Life ultimately chose not to run. ("It scared them," 
Bingham says.) But the weeks-long project became "A Special Rage," a book in 
which Moore wryly describes how Bingham almost blew it on their first day with 
the group in Berkeley: 
</P>
<P>
 "You not taking no pictures in here -- mother------," a voice behind us said. 
We spun around to confront another Panther. He couldn't have been more than 
eighteen, but his voice had all of the raspy authority of an Army master 
sergeant. Howard whipped out his press credentials. In his haste to show that 
he was "clean," his hand obscured half of the press pass. The visible portion 
read: "Los Angeles Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panther was astonished. "You a pig?" he asked. "Now I know you not takin' 
no pictures 'round here." 
</P>
<P>
 They were saved by Bobby Seale -- a Panther and the only black member of the 
infamous Chicago Seven -- who vouched for them and went on to give them a 
valuable piece of advice: "If you cats are gonna be taking pictures, better 
watch your step. These brothers are not playin'." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham's dealings with such groups as the Black Panthers and the Nation of 
Islam might have blocked his entree into other, more mainstream venues. It 
hasn't. A.S. Doc Young, the grand old columnist of the Sentinel, credits 
Bingham's affability. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's genuinely a nice person. You cannot find anybody to say bad things about 
him. Really, it's miraculous, because for all of his loyalty to Ali, for 
instance, he never got drawn into the controversy surrounding the Black 
Muslims. So he could be close to Ali, Elijah Muhammad, even Malcolm X at a time 
when to associate with Black Muslims, you were shunned by the media." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has he been touched by the tawdry side of boxing. "People who may be on 
the fringes of that other world would never think of Howard doing wrong, or 
asking him to," former Mayor Bradley says. "He's just accepted as part of the 
club for who he is." 
</P>
<P>
 And who he is still very much the reverend's son. He is unfailingly polite to 
virtually everyone. Calls to check on the neighborhood old folks. Visits his 
mother, who was widowed in 1985, almost daily. Does not confuse legitimate 
black anger with wanton violence. ("Look, those guys who beat Reginald Denny, 
that verdict was a joke. They should be under the jail, in cells right next 
door to those cops who beat Rodney King. Both groups were wrong.") 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham's low-key personality, touted by Bill Cosby to network management, 
also helped him break into the entertainment industry. He became one of the 
first black members of Local 659 of the cameramen's union. He would later 
become one of the first black still photographers on a movie set, shooting such 
box-office successes as "All the President's Men," "The Electric Horseman" and 
"The Candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Between movie gigs, he continued to accompany Ali around the globe, acting as 
an anchor in the boxer's turbulent personal life. A photograph taken near 
Boston in 1975 shows Ali with three attractive women. Standing slightly behind 
the fighter, linking arms, are his regal second wife, Belinda; the woman who 
would soon be his third wife, Veronica Porche, and Lonnie Williams, the shy, 
freckled young Louisville neighbor who would become his fourth wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be sure to say 'his fourth and last wife,' " Lonnie Ali says with a laugh 
while trying to dress wiggle-worm Assad, the couple's 3-year-old son. "Howard 
often tells me, 'I was here before you, and I'll be here after you go.' He was 
laughing when he said it, but he wasn't kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham married only once, to Carolyn Turner, with whom he has two sons, 
Dustin and Damon. The marriage succumbed after 14 years to Bingham's 
single-minded focus on his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, this was his way out of Compton, and it took him around the world," 
says Regina Jones, a longtime friend who is fond of both Binghams. "Howard saw 
his work as his only means of caring for his family. And it took him away a 
lot, which, to a wife, doesn't feel very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Damon, 21, lives with his dad and manages a rap group. Seventeen-year-old 
Dustin is in Redlands with his mother but often spends weekends with Dad. The 
kids seem unfazed by their father's connections, and for good reason: A family 
photo shows infant Damon carefully cradled in one of Ali's arms, while the 
other shakes a mock fist at him. A huge pastel portrait of Dustin by LeRoy 
Neiman hangs over the fireplace ("to -- and for -- Dustin"). They both have 
closetfuls of boxing mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Bingham's trip from his modest stucco bungalow in southeast L.A. to the 
exotic wood-paneled private planes of the glitterati doesn't mystify anyone who 
knows him well. "He's personable and very funny, and this has given him entree 
everywhere," Time magazine's Bonfante says. "Doors fly open before him. With 
all sorts of people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Howard," explains Nashville, Tenn., businessman and political operative John 
Jay Hooker, "is the world's best professional guest. There's nobody who has 
more dignity and worthwhileness." 
</P>
<P>
 And he has remained, in the words of former Life reporter Gil Moore, "jes' 
plain folks." 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person who has achieved what Howard has achieved would normally 
not be living in his neighborhood," agrees the Sentinel's Young. "They'd be in 
the Hollywood Hills or Beverly Hills somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Bingham doesn't see the point. "I have always lived south of Imperial," he 
says with pride. "It makes me crazy when they call everything south of Wilshire 
South-Central. All of black L.A. ain't South Central. And Watts is one mile by 
one mile." 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of community fueled Bingham's quixotic run for Congress in 1978. 
"He did it because he genuinely wanted to use his connections to help his 
neighborhood," Bradley says, "but he hadn't given careful thought to the 
enormity of the House campaign -- fund raising, the necessity of getting the 
message out, things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Bingham is amused at his own naivete. He organized a 
fund-raiser with an all-star roster (friends Marvin Gaye, Richard Pryor, Redd 
Foxx, Barry White, Louis Gossett and Sammy Davis Jr. came to help), but 
neglected to delegate such critical details as publicity. "Nobody came. Instead 
of financing my campaign, I went deep into the hole -- but the party afterward 
was fantastic!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the publication last fall of "Muhammad Ali: A Thirty-Year Journey" (Simon 
& Schuster), Bingham has achieved a longtime goal: Here, finally, is the fruit 
of three decades of travel and friendship with the person he knows best. (Ali, 
in turn, says he has been blessed with Bingham's friendship. "We met in Los 
Angeles in 1962, and we've been friends ever since.") That accomplished, might 
Bingham take some time off? 
</P>
<P>
 "I should," he murmurs, looking distractedly at his jumble of a living room, 
where plaques of appreciation are stacked vertically like storm windows waiting 
to be hung. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a few things to take care of first. The phone rings constantly; 
one day's backlog of messages is astonishing: Lonnie Ali, with whom he speaks 
several times daily; Camille (Mrs. Bill) Cosby; producer Scott ("The Firm") 
Rudin; television journalist Charlayne Hunter Gault; Sen. Orrin Hatch (Yes, 
that Orrin Hatch. "He's a friend. When Anita Hill testified, I was in 
Washington, and he got me in and got me a good seat."); Madonna's office 
("She's a boxing fan."). And King Hussein would love for him and Ali to visit; 
would that be possible? 
</P>
<P>
 All these messages, letters and faxes from power centers across the country 
and the world, and they land, not in the salt-misted Palisades or the 
cloistered wealth of Bel-Air. Instead, they land just shy of the Century 
Freeway, in a small house crammed with the detritus of a too-full life. Far 
east of La Cienega. Way south of the 10. Mr. Bingham's neighborhood. Howard

CAMPAIGN FOR THE 45TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; FRONT-RUNNERS STRESS THEIR LOCAL TIES; 
BILL MABIE, CHIEF AIDE TO OUTGOING ASSEMBLYMAN RICHARD POLANCO, POINTS TO HIS 
EXPERIENCE AND COMMITMENT TO AREA PROJECTS AND EVENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a recent community meeting in Lincoln Heights, Bill Mabie stood amid the 
largely Spanish-speaking crowd. Many in the audience were surprised when he 
began fielding questions in perfect Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Assembly candidate is comfortable in many different settings. 
He has been a Peace Corps worker in Honduras, a deep-sea fisherman in Alaska 
and a legislative aide in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first attempt to win public office, the 32-year-old Mabie is one of two 
front-runners in the June 7 Democratic primary in Northeast Los Angeles' 45th 
Assembly District. The winner is virtually assured of going to Sacramento after 
the November general election because 62% of the district's registered voters 
are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie said his travels and diverse experiences have helped shape his views 
about himself and others: "Wherever you are in the world, people want the same 
things. You learn not about how different you are, but how much you have in 
common." 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie is the chief of staff for the district's current representative, 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who is running for the state 
Senate.  
</P>
<P>
 Some Latino politicians are upset that Polanco has endorsed Mabie, who is 
white, for a seat that has been held by Latinos since 1972. But Mabie and many 
district residents say the candidates' qualifications are the issue -- not 
their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe my abilities, my accomplishments and my commitment to representing 
the residents of this district are what matter most," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Polanco's chief aide, Mabie helps identify problems that can be solved by 
the office and takes leadership on issues such as crime, economy and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what we have asked of him, he has always responded quickly," said 
the Rev. Juan Santillan, a respected community leader and priest at Our Lady of 
Help Christian Church in Lincoln Heights. "He cares a lot about the entire 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Santillan recalled how Mabie impressed residents at the March community 
meeting attended by officials from several city departments. Mabie was the only 
official able to address the audience in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got an overwhelming applause," Santillan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie's Spanish-language fluency comes from his 1985-87 Peace Corps stint in 
Honduras, where he managed and built fish hatcheries, among other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a period of upheaval in Central America. The United States backed a 
right-wing government in a civil war in El Salvador and supported a 
Honduras-based rebel army that was fighting a leftist government in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly six months Mabie lived in a small town near the Honduras-Nicaragua 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the fighting spilled into Honduras, he and other Peace Corps workers 
were reassigned to another part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. government had more to do with inciting violence in Central America 
than extinguishing it," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a difficult time to serve because we were trying to deal goodwill 
while the U.S. and Honduran military were conducting maneuvers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is running as a Democrat, Mabie was a registered Republican until 
about four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Registering with the GOP, he said, was a youthful reaction to having grown up 
in a Republican household in the eastern Los Angeles County city of Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie said he does not believe that his Republican background is a campaign 
issue because he was never actively involved in the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be a lot different if I had supported Republican 
candidates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie registered as a Democrat in spring, 1990, after working as a campaign 
volunteer for state Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) and several other 
Democratic candidates that primary season. "I took a look at who I was as a 
person. The party I fitted into was Democrat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie graduated from California State Polytechnic University at San Luis 
Obisbo in 1985 with a political science degree.  
</P>
<P>
 One professor remembers Mabie as active in protests against the nearby Diablo 
Canyon nuclear reactor. But unlike other student demonstrators, the professor 
recalled, Mabie was "not blinded by ideology." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a much more pragmatic focus to Bill, " said Prof. John Culver, who 
taught Mabie in several political science classes. "I thought that showed a 
tremendous amount of maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 During the spring and summer of 1984, Mabie left Cal Poly to work as a 
deckhand on a halibut fishing boat in Alaska to get experience for his Peace 
Corps application. He also worked in a cannery there, putting in 12-hour shifts 
on a "slime line," where he gutted fish on a conveyor belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty neat because you have people from all over the world doing it," 
said Mabie, who met Israelis, Australians, Canadians and Eskimos during his 
Alaska experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie moved to the 45th Assembly District in 1989, about a year before he 
began working for Polanco. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie and his wife, who is expecting a baby in July, live in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, as he campaigned door-to-door near his home, he touted 
his involvement in organizing the local Christmas parade and heading the 
Highland Park Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly care about this area. I live here. I'm going to raise my kid here," 
Mabie said. "That's what I'm about." 45th Assembly District

CAMPAIGN FOR THE 45TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; FRONT-RUNNERS STRESS THEIR LOCAL TIES; 
ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA SAYS GROWING UP POOR GIVES HIM THE BACKGROUND AND THE 
TOUGHNESS HE WILL NEED TO REPRESENT THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Antonio Villaraigosa canvassed the hilly Echo Park precinct, a voter asked 
why he should support his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I've taken on tough battles," said the Democratic Assembly candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether graduating from high school on time after dropping out for a year or 
arguing for better bus service for area riders, Villaraigosa has not shied away 
from a challenge. Today, he is locked in a tough primary battle in the 45th 
Assembly District in Northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you grow up as poor as I did, you learn to be able to scrap it 
out," said Villaraigosa, 41, who was raised by his mother in City Terrace. "You 
have to be able to get in there and mix it up. That's the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first attempt to win public office, Villaraigosa finds himself one of 
two front-runners in the June 7 race to fill a seat being vacated by 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who is running for the state 
Senate. The winner is virtually assured of victory in the November general 
election because 62% of the district's registered voters are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The other main candidate is Bill Mabie, chief of staff to Polanco. Some Latino 
lawmakers have said they are upset that Polanco is endorsing Mabie, who is 
white, for a seat that has been held by Latinos since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Villaraigosa and many district residents do not believe that race is 
an issue in the campaign. "I think it's demeaning to both of us to package us 
as white or Latino candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 25 years of area community work, Villaraigosa has been involved in 
issues ranging from voter registration to union activism. But he is perhaps 
best known for speaking out for the tens of thousands of low-income bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a board member of the now-defunct Rapid Transit District and currently 
is County Supervisor Gloria Molina's alternate to the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority's board of directors. With both agencies, Villaraigosa 
has been a leading advocate for affordable bus fares and increased security on 
crime-ridden bus lines.  
</P>
<P>
 "Antonio is a person of integrity, with a strong sense of social justice and 
the ability to fight for what's right," said Lisa Hoyos, an activist who has 
worked with Villaraigosa on a number of transportation and union issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa said he also is a coalition builder: "You can get a lot more with 
honey than vinegar. But when you can't get it done with honey, youhave to do it 
with vinegar." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his life, Villaraigosa's name was Antonio Villar. But when he 
married in 1988, he dropped the r on his last name and added her maiden name, 
Raigosa. "We both were progressive-minded people and wanted to combine our 
names," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife live in Mt. Washington and have two children. Villaraigosa 
also has two other children from two previous relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, he canvassed the precinct near the lake in Echo Park. "I 
have a better sense of the heartbeat of this district," he said as he walked up 
a steep hill. "When you grow up in the area and see the changes, you're part of 
the (community) fabric." 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa's road to the Assembly race has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of four children raised in a small, two-bedroom apartment. Dinner 
often consisted of rice, beans and tortillas; meat was a luxury the family 
could rarely afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lived an incredibly tough life," Villaraigosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a neighborhood where opportunities were few and where the temptation to get 
in trouble was great, many of his acquaintances joined gangs. Villaraigosa 
describes himself as an "at-risk youth" who could have followed that path. "I 
could have gone either way." 
</P>
<P>
 In 11th grade, Villaraigosa dropped out of Roosevelt High School. He said he 
was more interested in working part-time jobs and running around with his 
friends than in studying. 
</P>
<P>
 But Villaraigosa went back to school his senior year for one reason: "I had a 
mother who never stopped believing in me and turned me around." 
</P>
<P>
 A former secretary who worked her way up to an administrative position with 
Caltrans, his mother was a woman who realized the value of education and hard 
work. Villaraigosa said she persuaded him to go back to school so he could have 
a better life than she did. She died in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa attended night school and graduated with his class in 1971. One 
Roosevelt High teacher who taught Villaraigosa is not surprised that he 
graduated on time and became successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a really bright kid," said Herman Katz, who is now a part-time 
counselor at Roosevelt. "I knew right away that this kid was college material." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was Katz who paid for Villaraigosa's college placement 
examination. Villaraigosa had no money and said he would not have taken the 
test had his teacher not helped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa went on to attend East Los Angeles College before transferring to 
UCLA, where he graduated with a history degree in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Since UCLA, Villaraigosa has been involved with many groups and causes. He has 
knocked door-to-door for the Greater Eastside Voter Registration Project, been 
president of the Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union and worked as a local representative for United Teacher Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been battling to increase opportunities for everyone all my life," he 
said.

11 VIE FOR ASSEMBLY SEAT MOORE IS VACATING; ELECTIONS: NINE DEMOCRATS AND TWO 
REPUBLICANS WILL SQUARE OFF FOR NOMINATIONS IN THE JUNE 7 PRIMARIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision by 47th District Assemblywoman Gwen Moore to seek higher office 
after 16 years in the Legislature has triggered a lively race to replace her, 
with nine Democratic candidates seeking the party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Republicans are vying for the GOP nomination, but given the district's 
voter registration figures -- 75% are Democrats -- Moore's successor likely 
will be the Democrat who wins the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's eclectic district is essentially a chunk of mid-Los Angeles that runs 
west from the San Diego Freeway almost to Western Avenue between Wilshire 
Boulevard and Slauson Avenue. It includes the Crenshaw District, Ladera 
Heights, Baldwin Hills, Cheviot Hills and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was drawn to favor the election of an African American, and all 
but two of the 11 candidates are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the district is largely affluent, the candidates describe the 47th as 
one of the premier African American legislative districts in the country, a 
good base from which to move up the political ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Democrats, the wide-open nature of the race means a winner could 
emerge with less than 30% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Democrats who have significant money, endorsements or grass-roots 
community ties are attorneys Geoff Gibbs and Kevin Murray, congressional aide 
Ed Johnson and community activist Valerie Lynne Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would include a fifth name on the list of the apparent first tier of 
candidates: Jimmie Woods Gray, a teacher and union activist who is underfunded 
but well-known in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining contenders are attorney Marsha F. Kimble, writer Neil Liss, 
businessmen Leslie Roberson and Rudolph Valentino Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican candidates are businessman Jonathan Leonard and attorney 
Kathleen Lee Brundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who is running for secretary of state, has ties to the Westside-based 
political organization of Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 As her successor, both men have endorsed Johnson, a longtime deputy to Rep. 
Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles). Johnson also won the endorsement of the state 
Democratic Party at its convention last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson has stiff opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, for instance, is backed by his father, Assemblyman Willard W. Murray 
Jr. (D-Paramount). 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Murray is a veteran state legislator, so the younger Murray has some 
big-name backers of his own: Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), 
to name a few. Kevin Murray also has the advantage of gaining a spot on his 
dad's mailings, which targets black voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidacy of Shaw is also getting some attention from political 
prognosticators.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who used to be an aide to Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, 
was recently rated along with Johnson and Murray as one of the top three 
candidates in the race by the political newsletter Calpeek. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs has been a standout in fund raising. The former deputy to Illinois Sen. 
Carol Moseley Braun, who two years ago became the first black female to hold a 
U.S. Senate seat, had loans and contributions of roughly $75,000 by the March 
17 filing period. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is not a longtime Angeleno, and many question whether his local roots 
go deep enough to enable him to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray could surprise if she gets a large bank of volunteers from the teachers 
union to knock on doors for her. 
</P>
<P>
 With the large number of African American candidates likely to split the black 
vote, the district's white voters may prove the deciding factor in the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a scenario was played out two years ago when Yvonne Brathwaite Burke beat 
state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) in the race for a county supervisor's 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the estimated 8,000 Jewish households in the district, the backing from 
Berman and Waxman should help Johnson, as will his ties to the popular Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 But as all the candidates admit, it's a field of relative unknowns, making the 
outcome difficult to predict. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race is going to be won by the person who shakes the most hands," said 
political newcomer Roberson. "And I'm a-shakin'." 47th Assembly District

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE CENTER; TREES GIVE BOOST TO 'STREETSCAPE' 
PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
 The 10 crape myrtle trees planted May 14 along 7th Street and Irolo Avenue as 
part of a Wilshire Center revitalization project aren't expected to blossom for 
another two years, but the effort to rally the community around the 
beautification idea already is showing results. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees, and another 2,500 to be planted this year, are one element of the 
Wilshire Center Streetscape Project, a $4.5-million plan to spruce up the area 
with new benches, bus stops, lights and signs, a median strip down the 
boulevard, and other landscaping and physical improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all starts with the trees," said Gary Russell, the project manager. "The 
simple act of planting a tree shows that with a little effort you can make a 
change in your environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilshire Center businesses and office buildings have been hit hard by the 
recession and by the noise, dust and physical obstructions of Metro Rail 
construction. The Wilshire Chamber of Commerce conceived the "streetscape" 
project as a way to spur a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to say that this area is worth investing in and doing business 
in again," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, organizers have commitments for about half of the project's projected 
budget from federal, state, city and private sources. In addition, the chamber 
and others are lobbying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide 
$16.2 million for programs to mitigate the negative effects of subway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA approved a $27.7-million mitigation program for the Hollywood area 
that includes money for graffiti abatement, marketing programs for affected 
businesses, noise-reduction measures and parking validation incentives. 
Wilshire Center businesses say they deserve similar assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Subway construction is "making it tougher for us to be competitive," Russell 
said. "There's a lot of anger out there. If there are no businesses left here, 
there's no reason to have a (Metro Rail) station here. The MTA has made a major 
investment in this area and they need to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, head of a Wilshire Center architectural firm, said that although 
business people have taken the lead in the "streetscape" program, residents 
will play a more important role as time goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 With residential neighborhoods on either side of the Wilshire Boulevard 
commercial strip, "we're not an island," Russell said. "We have to listen to 
where the community wants to go with this and not just impose it." 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment managers are vital to the project, said Frank Tysen, a member of the 
Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles and the chairman of the chamber's 
apartment committee. "To organize neighborhoods, you have to go block-by-block, 
and you need a group of managers who will do graffiti abatement, get rid of 
couches left on the sidewalk and coordinate anti-crime walks," Tysen said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of work but a lot of fun too," said Abel Ramos as he took a break 
after digging a three-foot hole for one of the trees.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, an apartment manager, said he and a few of his colleagues try to make 
their block a better place to live: "We talk to our tenants and tell them that 
if they're going to drink and play music to do it inside their apartments. We 
clean the street every day except Sunday. If we like to live in a nice 
neighborhood, we have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The "streetscape" project will start July 9. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: PICO-UNION; STREET VENDORS CLAIM POLICE HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Street vendors in Pico-Union, Westlake and East Los Angeles say police are 
harassing them and violating the spirit of the city ordinance that will make 
street vending legal in specific areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a pilot program Jan. 4 to permit vending in eight 
districts. The districts are to be established through a permit procedure that 
will require approval from residents and merchants in the commercial areas 
where the vendors want to work. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be months before the first vending districts win approval. The 
ordinance states that in the interim the council "shall adopt a humane and 
comprehensive enforcement policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Javier Rodriguez, administrator for the Street Vendors Assn., last week 
told members of the Police Commission that vendors have been subjected to "a 
constant campaign of harassment that we have seen escalate since Jan. 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said police have arrested or ticketed vendors on 6th Street and Pico 
Boulevard and, in some cases, confiscated their merchandise. He said that 
police arrested 10 vendors at Pico Boulevard and Mariposa Avenue on April 17, 
levying more than $1,000 in fines and confiscating more than $4,000 worth of 
equipment and merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Many vendors in Pico-Union and Westlake have seen their weekly earnings drop 
by more than half since January because of police actions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capt. Nick Salicos of the Police Department's Rampart Division denied that 
his officers' actions have been excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have cut (the vendors) slack," he said in an interview. "In fact, we're 
not being as tough as the ordinance allows us to be. Vending is still illegal, 
but it is a very low priority in Rampart." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Salicos said that until the special zones are established 
officers will continue to take enforcement action "if vendors are not complying 
with the rules." He said vendors must have a license and a pushcart, cannot 
impede pedestrian traffic on sidewalks and must move if a merchant complains 
about a vendor's proximity to his or her business. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commission President Rabbi Greenebaum said the commission staff will 
look into the complaints and the enforcement actions of the police. JAKE

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; VIDEO PROMOTES DOME VILLAGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the Genesis I dome village have produced a 30-second animated 
video to promote their transitional shelter project and to inspire creative 
solutions to homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The village of 20 fiberglass igloo-like domes was established last year on a 
lot west of the Harbor Freeway between 8th and 9th streets as an experimental 
shelter and social service program for a trial group of 24 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The domes are part of a plan conceived by activist Ted Hayes and 
Justiceville/Homeless USA to give the homeless the support they need to find 
permanent housing and jobs. The project is funded through a $250,000 Arco 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birth of a Village" is the first in a series of arts projects that will bring 
together homeless people and artists under the sponsorship of Street Without a 
Name, a nonprofit corporation organized to use the arts as a forum to address 
homelessness. The video will be offered to TV stations as a public-service 
announcement and used in fund-raising projects. 
</P>
<P>
 With the assistance of Anim-Action, an educational program that helps 
teen-agers produce animated films, several Genesis I residents drew and colored 
the 300 frames of the film and participated in other production tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddy Georges, a village resident, said the film, which features a sanitation 
crew of homeless people, has two messages: "First, everyone should make an 
effort to keep the city clean. Second, it's good to have people from all 
different walks of life talking and working together." JAKE DOHERTY

 Construction crews broke ground last week at the Midtown Shopping Center where 
a supermarket and a drugstore are scheduled to open by next winter. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-service Alpha Beta supermarket and a Sav-on Drugs will be anchor 
tenants in the shopping center at San Vicente and Pico boulevards, replacing 
two stores destroyed in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores are expected to create more than 150 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Space for small retail stores and restaurants is also included in the 
renovation plan and an existing swap meet, known as the Midtown Shops, will be 
remodeled as part of the $20-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project can provide a jump-start for revitalization and create a ripple 
effect in the community," developer James R. Young said at the Thursday 
groundbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Some community groups have called on Young to replace the swap meet with a 
chain retail store such as Target or Wal-Mart. But Young has said leases with 
the vendors and a lack of interest by large retailers preclude that option for 
now. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; GALLERY'S NEW HOME IS MORE HOSPITABLE 
</P>

<P>
 After 14 years of running a nonprofit art gallery out of a Downtown warehouse, 
Lydia Takeshita decided it was time for a change of scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshita vacated 3,500 square feet of gallery space in a three-story building 
on Mateo Street and moved LA Artcore Center to a commercial complex in Little 
Tokyo on 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 What eventually drove her away, said the 67-year-old center director, was 
exactly the same thing that chased her gallery visitors from the area: Downtown 
blight. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the influx of transients and prostitutes on and surrounding Mateo 
Street, "people were beginning to get scared to come Downtown," Takeshita said. 
"No matter how much we put on a good show, people wouldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're open 11 in the morning till 4 in the afternoon, to have just one 
or two people come in, that's kind of sad," she said. "Finally, we moved, and 
things are working out better." 
</P>
<P>
 So much better that LA Artcore Center's opening reception at its new home 
attracted 500 in March -- doubling its largest crowd ever. The 
1,500-square-foot gallery at 420 E. 3rd St. now draws 15 to 20 people daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Artcore's move mirrors the recent Downtown exodus of other nonprofit 
galleries, such as the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), which 
relocated to Hollywood last April after spending seven years in the warehouse 
district on Industrial Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although LACE now caters to a different crowd, Takeshita said she still wants 
her gallery to serve as a cultural arts center for Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Downtown Arts Development Assn., Jon Peterson, has 
criticized LACE for its move and applauds Artcore's commitment to keeping the 
Downtown art scene alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like, to me, they're expanding," Peterson said. "I think they're a 
vital part of the community down here." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception in 1980, Artcore has featured the works of young, emerging 
artists just out of college as well as that of experienced and professional 
artists on the brink of mainstream recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 This core group of artists gives the center its name. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshita, who faced racial prejudice as a second-generation Japanese American 
during World War II, said the gallery's concept developed when she was a 
professor of art at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very close, intimate relationship with the (graduate) students," she 
said. "They wanted to exhibit their works. They wanted a place to just contact 
other professional artists." 
</P>
<P>
 College officials agreed to experiment with the opening of a gallery in Old 
Town Pasadena in 1979. Its success then brought on the idea of establishing a 
nonprofit public art center independent of Cal State L.A., Takeshita said. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Artcore was opened on Mateo Street with a $20,000 donation from 
one of Takeshita's former art students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out with a membership of 30, and then we had 50," Takeshita said. 
"And by the time we closed and moved, we had about 70. We're just starting now 
to be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
 The center operates on a yearly budget of $130,000, of which $80,000 goes to 
printing its quarterly magazine, Visions. The gallery is currently featuring 
artist Sandy Bleifer's "Hiroshima Memorial Exhibition," which consists of 35 
figurative paper sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Artcore is rather unique because they're nonprofit and they're 
very organized," said Barbara Mendes, 46, a Downtown artist who once lived 
across the street from the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old-fashioned galleries are fading away," Mendes said. "It's a lot of 
trouble to make nonprofit (work), so most artists just open their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshita plans to stick around. Artcore, along with some performing arts 
groups, is slated to move by 1996 to a permanent home across the street at the 
Union Church of Los Angeles. "This is my family -- family of arts," she said, 
holding out her arms to the surrounding paper sculptures. "I'll never retire."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ELYSIAN PARK; POLICE PUT BRAKES ON ILLEGAL DRAG-RACING 
</P>

<P>
 It turned out to be a real drag for the 400 who recently showed up to 
participate in or watch drag-racing along a quarter-mile stretch near Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on neighbors' complaints about engine exhaust, noise and a street 
littered with empty beer bottles, 25 police officers issued 305 citations to 
the speedsters and spectators on Stadium Way. No arrests were made, but six 
vehicles belonging to drivers without valid licenses were impounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they'll be back for a couple of weeks -- if they're smart," 
said Sgt. Carlos De La Roca of the Police Department's Northeast Division. 
</P>
<P>
 One 34-year-old resident who asked to remain anonymous for fear of harassment 
said she has found herself caught in the middle of some of the races when she 
drives home from work late at night.  
</P>
<P>
 "They could be coming at you and you're figuring, 'Oh, my God,' " said the 
woman, who added that she has had to brake to avoid accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The races, she said, also rattle nerves at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine lying in bed and just starting to doze off and hearing this sound of 
engines winding and tearing down the street and brakes slamming. It's not your 
usual gunshots. . . . (but) it's just a kind of thing that startles you." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers blocked off Stadium Way at Lilac Terrace and at Chavez Ravine Road 
and rounded up the crowd after observing one or two races the night of May 
12-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them got away before we were able to close everything down," Lt. Mark 
Perez said. But the others "were just caught dead on their tracks. Officers 
lined them up in their cars and one-by-one cited them." 
</P>
<P>
 Races normally begin at the 1700 block of Stadium Way, reaching speeds of up 
to 85 m.p.h. before the finish at Lilac Terrace, police said. Spectators would 
watch from a city-owned parking area or sidewalks near the center of the drag 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as much a social affair as racing," Perez said. "That's where the kids 
like to go meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those ticketed were 17 to 24, some coming from as far as West Los 
Angeles and Montebello, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators who cheer on the racers can be cited for aiding and abetting in 
drag-racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those cited have been ordered to appear May 27 in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court's traffic division. If found guilty of misdemeanor drag-racing or aiding 
or abetting in drag-racing, each could face a maximum $1,000 fine and/or six 
months in county jail, said Ted Goldstein of the Los Angeles city attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Roca said that the races, which have drawn large crowds in past summers, 
restarted earlier this year -- mainly late on Thursday nights. Police said they 
had been getting about five calls per week from residents in the hills above 
Stadium Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said drag-racers will be taking their chances if they decide to return: 
"We may be nipping it at the bud by taking this vigorous action now." TOMMY LI

<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials on Monday night will make a 
final review of residents' suggestions for revamping Glendale Boulevard before 
a traffic study is submitted to the MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 The community meeting will take place at 7 p.m. at Gateways Hospital and 
Mental Health Center, 1891 Effie St. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials and the MTA agreed to spend $300,000 for the study, 
which covers a 2 1/2-mile stretch of Glendale Boulevard from the end of the 
Glendale Freeway to Beverly Boulevard, said Steve Brye, project coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for oil and silent-film industries in the late 1890s and early 1900s, 
Glendale Boulevard has since turned into a thoroughfare for commuters traveling 
to and from Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for commuters," said Susan Borden, an Echo Park resident. "(But) 
it's just a barrier for residents." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the study, officials say, is to find ways to slow traffic flow 
and make the street more appealing again to residents and Echo Park's 
surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials have held community meetings with residents since November. 
Their recommendations include more traffic signals, car-pool lanes, a bike 
route for residents, trees and bus shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brye plans to turn in a final draft of the study June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board is expected to review the proposed project in late June. TOMMY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; GROUP TAKES PEACE MESSAGE TO THE BOARD 
</P>

<P>
 The Rev. Romie Lilly didn't look for spiritual counsel when he needed help to 
deliver his message of peace in the 'hood. Instead, Lilly took his cue from 
liquor and tobacco companies that advertise their products on billboards 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing is using the same media that carries a lot of negative 
messages, but we're using it to carry a positive message," Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilly is executive director of the Southern Area Clergy Council, a group of 75 
area church leaders who are sponsoring a billboard campaign that aims to 
increase awareness and prevention of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards already are up in parts of Compton, Lynwood, Willowbrook, Watts 
and South-Central carrying a simple message: "Keep It Good, in the 'Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign began nearly two months ago after Lilly and other pastors 
enlisted the support of community businesses and other leaders to help create a 
three-month season of peace in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way to convince all the kids, but maybe you can make a small 
group of kids recognize the importance of this message," said Banh Le, who owns 
a small printing shop in Compton and is a member of the campaign. "Since the 
riots, no one has come up with my idea to educate the youth and they (the 
clergy council) have been doing good work in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 The bilingual message is not solely aimed at stopping gang-related violence, 
Lilly said, but all types of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our responsibility is not only to make the truce between the Bloods and the 
Crips, but to strike a truce between husband and wife," he said. "The fact is, 
domestic violence is the most common type of violence in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 50 billboards, the group is passing out 500,000 flyers to 
schools, homes and on street corners across the five communities. The majority 
of the funding for the $30,000 project was donated by businesses such as Le's 
and Nix Check Cashing. 
</P>
<P>
 The clergy council's members said the campaign is part of a project that will 
include workshops such as an upcoming meeting at the New Mt. Calvary Baptist 
Church in Compton on the "three strikes" anti-crime law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come to the conclusion that if we're going to make our communities a 
better place, we have to make it better because we're the ones that live here," 
Lilly said. "No one else is going to do it for us." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 There is no bell to mark the beginning of class at this school. Instead, the 
seven teen-age fathers file into a sparsely furnished classroom and begin the 
day's lesson while exchanging talk about friends, children and probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, is everybody here?" inquires Kevin Sparks, a coordinator for the Fresh 
Start program during one of the many classes he teaches at three probation 
schools in the city. There was a brief silence. One student was absent -- 
hospitalized with a gunshot wound. Sparks used the incident to start the day's 
discussion on parenting and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to think: Where are you going?" Sparks said. "You have to think: Do 
you want to see your kids again, right? You want to watch them grow up, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in T-shirts and jeans, the youths take part in parenting and 
counseling classes provided to students in South-Central and Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is an outgrowth of a similar project started nearly two years ago 
at a Saugus juvenile detention camp by Karen Pines, a licensed therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 She developed the Fresh Start program for Family Service of Los Angeles, a 
nonprofit organization that provides youth and adult counseling at six centers, 
including this one at the Firestone Community Day Center. The project was 
started with $100,000 in private and public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks and other Fresh Start counselors visit probation education sites weekly 
to help teen-age parents get their lives back on track by offering counseling, 
job training and mentors. Teen parents are referred to the program by the Los 
Angeles County Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an optimum time to talk to them about parenting because being a parent 
is a catalyst in their lives," Pines said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 12-week program, teen parents practice job-interviewing skills, 
work on filling out job applications and discuss child development. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths meet weekly with one of three counselors and are paired with a 
mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has graduated its first class of teen parents, who stay linked to 
the program for as long as three more months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get the kids to identify their goals and get started on working 
toward them, they'll be well-established to get there," Pines said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is currently funded to assist 40 students. "We haven't turned 
anyone away, but we aren't everywhere we should be. There's a great need in 
other places," said Pines. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term effect of the program has yet to be seen, but Pines said she 
hopes it will help reduce the number of teen-age parents who become victims of 
violence and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two generations of kids at risk for abuse and neglect. And this is an 
opportunity to break the cycle of poverty and crime because these kids have 
high hopes for themselves as parents."

 With the precision of a military strategist, Monica Williams used to carefully 
plan her weekly grocery shopping trip, an excursion that included a 20-minute 
drive from her home. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, the Athens resident was happy to be able to pick up some 
vegetables less than five minutes from her home on 121st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here three times already," said Williams, pushing a cart through 
the newly opened produce section at Food 4 Less. "It's nice to just be able to 
stop by and pick something up, and it's not as expensive as so many other 
places." 
</P>
<P>
 The store at Western Avenue and Imperial Highway is the first major 
supermarket to open in Athens in nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Its May 12 opening has changed everyday life in a community where many had 
become accustomed to driving to neighboring cities to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so good to have a supermarket in the area," said Alice Grant, who 
used to travel from her home on 92nd Street to Inglewood for groceries. "In 
this area we are so used to having to drive to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a tremendous need in the area," said Darius Anderson, a spokesman 
for Food 4 Less Supermarkets Inc. "The inner city has traditionally had a need 
for grocery stores and we are committed to serving those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The store will employ about 120 people, said Anderson, adding that most 
employees will be hired from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a week after the $2.5-million, 60,000-square-foot warehouse-style store 
opened, customers and money have been pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's doing very well so far, beyond our expectations,' said Anderson, who 
declined to provide figures. "It will be one of our top producers because of 
the size and the fact that the customers are in need in that area." SANDRA

<P>
 Barrio Planners Inc. has been awarded a $100,000 contract to complete a 
feasibility study as part of the Adelante Eastside plan to revitalize Boyle 
Heights and El Sereno neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The study to determine whether the area meets the state's criteria for public 
and private redevelopment funding was one of 11 recommendations made by several 
groups involved in Adelante Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 That 16-month study of commercial, industrial and residential buildings in a 
10-square-mile section of Boyle Heights and the Valley Boulevard industrial 
corridor of El Sereno was completed last summer. The housing component was 
dropped from that report, at the request of Councilman Richard Alatorre, to 
focus on economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the councilman's office wanted to approach this in stages and see if 
we can do the business and commercial (buildings) and establish a track 
record," said Raul Escobedo of Barrio Planners, an East Los Angeles 
architectural firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Community Redevelopment Agency last week awarded Barrio Planners 
the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The six- to eight-month technical study will document the conditions of blight 
as defined by state law, whether in buildings, streets or other physical 
characteristics, said Escobedo. It will also study the area's economy and 
determine what tax revenues would be generated. 
</P>
<P>
 After the study is completed and the redevelopment agency's community advisory 
committee gives its approval, the City Council would be asked to consider the 
area for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be the goal," Escobedo said. "In the meantime, the community has 
lobbied to get it into the federal empowerment zone, to get as many (funding) 
tools in the area as possible to get what we need." 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency continues to keep residents informed with community 
meetings. The next one is scheduled Wednesday at 6 p.m. at the El Sereno Senior 
Citizens Center, 4818 Klamath Place, said project director Al Santillanes.  
</P>
<P>
 Adelante Eastside, also known as the Eastside Neighborhoods Revitalization 
Study, found that the area has some of the oldest housing tracts in the city, 
suffers from overcrowding and lacks sufficient open land for new housing or 
business development. Other recommendations include a senior citizen housing 
project and a community shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Argomaniz, a Legal Aid Foundation paralegal and Boyle Heights resident, 
has distributed 10,000 flyers in the last two weeks to get more residents 
interested in the continuing study of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 He contends that the Community Advisory Committee, with 45 appointed members, 
does not encourage enough citizen participation. One of the biggest complaints 
residents have, he said, is that the Adelante Eastside study was never 
translated into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is really familiar with the study," Argomaniz said. "We're not saying 
it's a bad project, but we should be aware of things going on in the community. 
They should allow them the opportunity to know what's happening so they can 
make decisions about their community."  
</P>
<P>
 Legal Aid was to have had a workshop Saturday at the Community Service 
Organization regarding the ongoing revitalization efforts through Adelante 
Eastside.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to recognize that this could have a significant impact," 
Argomaniz said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; BELVEDERE TEACHER HONORED FOR WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Saturday night, Belvedere Junior High teacher Adolfo Martinez was to be 
recognized by the Chicano Music Awards for his work with Mariachi Olimpico. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez has worked at Belvedere 17 years and started the youth mariachi 
group.He teaches music and performs locally with the group Chico. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth annual Chicano Music Awards were held at the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium to raise money for the Quetzalcoatl Memorial Scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to host the event was radio personality "Sancho," who is Daniel 
Castro, associate dean at East Los Angeles College. The scholarship is named 
after Castro's son, who was killed in an automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said Castro's effort epitomizes the kind of work that needs to be 
done in schools to decrease dropout rates.  
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the negative cycle of high school dropouts and declining 
college completion rates can be broken by investing in the education of our 
youth and encouraging those that succeed to return and lend a helping hand," 
Castro said. "Martinez does exactly that, and we wanted to honor him for that." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's concert raised $70,000 for college scholarships awarded to Chicano 
students with a strong academic record and a commitment to serve their 
communities after college. 
</P>
<P>
 Past recipients of the award include Lalo Guerrero, Eddie Cano and Vikki Carr.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; BILINGUAL VOLUNTEERS EASE PATIENTS' PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For seven years, Rudy Aguilar has trekked twice a week from his Hacienda 
Heights home to County-USC Medical Center to help patients understand their 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar, a 63-year-old retiree, translates from Spanish to English and vice 
versa in the diabetes clinic, helping patients, most of them Latino, understand 
their doctors' instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many volunteer translators, Aguilar's job has become more than just 
words passed between patient and doctor. The volunteers are a source of comfort 
for people in pain who may speak little or no English and who need to 
communicate with doctors and nurses who do not speak their language, said 
Marjorie Dolinski, director of volunteers at General Hospital in the county 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our volunteers are usually very trusted by our patients," Dolinski said, 
adding that translators often help make appointments, give directions and make 
certain the patients understand their prognosis and treatment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar also educates patients, many of whom have their own myths and folk 
cures, about diabetes. Latinos and Native Americans are particularly 
susceptible to the disease, which when properly treated is manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 One elderly patient had his insulin cut off at night by his daughter, who told 
Aguilar that she did so because her father was going blind. She thought the 
insulin, not the disease, was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar said that despite his pleadings to resume the insulin, the daughter 
refused, and her father was dead within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people (Latinos) don't think that insulin is a part of life," Aguilar 
said. "Diabetes attacks the eyesight, the feet, the heart, the liver and 
kidneys. Many people have had their feet and legs amputated." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting-room gossip can sometimes scare patients into thinking that insulin 
will do them more harm than good. Occasionally, blood-sugar levels are high 
enough to warrant emergency treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way things are here in the clinic," Aguilar said. "I'm coarse as 
hell when I need to be coarse, only because our people have to be educated." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital relies on adults fluent in Spanish, Tagalog, Korean, Armenian and 
Chinese to help the patients, Dolinski said. Only about 25 of the more than 400 
volunteers are translators, she said, and more are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers do not need to know medical terms but must undergo four hours of 
training and a TB test. Dolinski asks volunteers to commit to 100 hours of 
service.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; PARENTS CAN TAKE CLASS ON HOMEWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Latin American Professional Women's Assn. is offering classes for parents 
to learn how to help their children with homework. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization received a $1,500 grant from the Annenberg Math and Science 
Project and the ARCO Foundation to buy books and materials, and to send parents 
to museums and other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will involve training designed to increase the parents' awareness 
of math and science so they can motivate and help their children in these 
subjects, said Linda Quarry, the group's publicity chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major problem is children have no one to help with their homework at 
home," Quarry said. "If they don't have anyone to help, it doesn't get done." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 a.m. classes, which started Saturday, will continue for six weeks. 
Parents who missed the first class may sign up for the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions are at the Latin American Professional Women's Assn. home office, 
3514 N. Broadway, and are taught by board members.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: WEST ADAMS; HOUSING-MARKET PROJECT UNDER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time the southwest corner of Adams Boulevard and Western Avenue had 
anything on it -- about 10 years ago -- Bill Hardy frequented a liquor store 
there that was owned by a man who made a killer roast beef sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner moved his business to Gardena, and Hardy has been waiting ever since 
for something besides weeds and rusted chain-link fence on the lot that once 
boasted a vibrant commercial strip. Their wait may soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of negotiations, plans to build a mixed-use commercial and 
residential development were announced last week at a groundbreaking ceremony 
in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The development) has been a long time coming," said Hardy, a West Adams 
resident and caterer. "Western Avenue could come back up and thrive like it 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams West Town Center, a $7-million village-like project, will provide 52 
housing units for senior citizens, plus an 11,000-square-foot supermarket. The 
project will be built by the Bedford Group, a private developer, and Food 4 
Less Supermarkets. Construction should be completed by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperating entities include the California Community Reinvestment Corp., the 
Century Freeway Housing Program, the Community Redevelopment Agency and Wells 
Fargo Bank. Officials at the ceremony said it is precisely the mix of public 
and private funds that makes the development exemplary, but also made it very 
difficult to pull together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like giving birth to an elephant -- a very long and arduous process," 
said Charles Quarles, president of the Bedford Group. "It's been in the womb a 
very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden said simply getting all the groups to sit down and talk 
to each other was an accomplishment. "We've been trying to get this corner 
going a long time, since (former City Councilman) Bob Farell's time," he said. 
"It was bounced from his district to mine. It's about time the community gets 
what it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment agency spokesman Ed Burkovitz said that despite the project's 
slow evolution, it is a timely one that fulfills several pressing community 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings together housing, a new commercial facility, and with it, new jobs 
in the neighborhood," he said. "It also sends the message to other private 
sector businesses that they should be investing in communities like these." 
</P>
<P>
 The site was once a bastion of black-owned businesses that included the famed 
jazz club the Rubiyat Room, but over the years was ravaged by fire and decay. 
Ira Massey, a Holden aide, said bureaucratic bickering dating Farell's time 
slowed the process of rebuilding to a snail's pace.  
</P>
<P>
 But now, he said, the site has a chance of recapturing its former glory. "It 
should be a showplace again, a symbol, like the Golden State Mutual Life across 
the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Calloway, a 40-year West Adams resident and community activist, said 
she will be happy to be rid of an eyesore. "When people see vacant lots like 
this, the devastation, it's hard to convince them that this is a great area." 
</P>
<P>
 Calloway, a resident of West 25th Street, said: "Socially and economically, 
this development is wonderful. It will help restore the dignity of West Adams."

<P>
 Southeast cities have united on two fronts to form an economic development 
coalition to attack social problems in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders in eight cities have voted during the past month to form a nonprofit 
community development corporation that they hope will help give the region 
clout, making the area more eligible and more attractive to public and private 
funding groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, six cities have created a consortium to apply for joint 
designation as a federal Enterprise Community, part of a program under the 1993 
Budget Reconciliation Act that would make the area eligible to receive 
investment incentives for businesses and as much as $3.5 million in social 
service grants. The act authorized the creation of 12 development corporations 
and 65 urban enterprise community zones nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects "create some joint vision on the region in terms of identifying 
needs and solving the area's problems," said George Cole, a Bell councilman and 
founding member of the development corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-city area represented by Bell, Bell Gardens, Commerce, Cudahy, 
Huntington Park, Maywood, South Gate and Vernon has lost thousands of jobs and 
millions of dollars in revenue as industry has left the area. Up to 70% of the 
area's adults have not graduated from high school, and unemployment hovers at 
10%, according to development corporation statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 If designated, the Southeast Enterprise Community, which would be eligible for 
specific federal funds, could funnel resources to its umbrella organization, 
the Southeast Community Development Corp., to be used for economic and 
community development, job training, housing and other projects that address 
the area's social needs, said Dolores Sanchez, a spokeswoman for Assemblywoman 
Martha Escutia (D-Huntington Park). 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, the Southeast has lacked the strong community-based 
organizations that have the support and qualifications to go after large 
federal dollars and private foundation money," and the new development 
corporation can fill that gap, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation has already submitted an application to the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development for up to $1 million in tax credits for 
employers, she said. MARY HELEN BERG

<P>
 The City Council has approved a new, temporary schedule at City Hall that will 
have city offices open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. every weekday. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other Southeast L.A. County cities, South Gate government offices have 
been closed on Fridays during the past year to reduce employee commutes and 
meet Air Quality Management District standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most employees prefer the four-day workweek, and when I was campaigning I 
heard very few complaints about it from residents," said Councilwoman Mary Ann 
Buckles, who cast the lone dissenting vote May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-day week would could mean a reduction in customer service because City 
Hall employees would stagger their work schedules, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 For the next three months, staff may choose to come to work five eight-hour 
days or take Monday or Friday off.  
</P>
<P>
 The council will evaluate public demand for service and then negotiate new 
hours with the employee unions, officials said. MARY HELEN BERG

COVER STORY; FOR DETECTIVES, A CASE OF TOO MANY MURDERS TO SOLVE; THE CASELOAD 
FOR HOMICIDE INVESTIGATORS ON THE EASTSIDE AND IN SOUTH-CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST 
LOS ANGELES IS TWO TO THREE TIMES THAT OF MOST OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS, LAPD DATA 
SHOWS. AS A RESULT, MANY KILLERS ARE NEVER CAUGHT.

 Muriel Polk sensed that something was terribly wrong when she heard a knock on 
the door early that morning. On her porch were two detectives who informed her 
that her 21-year-old son had been shot to death on a South-Central street. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than three years after Patrick Polk was found slumped over the 
steering wheel of his car, the case remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelmed by more recent killings, detectives say they have been unable to 
devote the time needed to solve Polk's slaying. So, in her own quest for 
justice, Polk has sought the help of a private investigator and visited the 
crime scene herself to interview witnesses and gather statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating because (the police) don't have enough people to follow 
through on murders like they should -- I can vouch for that," she said. "They 
get new murders every day, and you get pushed further and further back." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Eastside and in South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles, homicide 
detectives in 1993 investigated two to three times more cases each than did 
thier counterparts in most areas of the city, Police Department data shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's busiest homicide detail last year was the Eastside's Hollenbeck 
Division, where six detectives investigated 68 murders, or 22.6 cases per 
two-person team. In the Central Division, which covers Downtown, six detectives 
handled 32 homicides, or 10.6 cases per team. On the Westside, six detectives 
in the Pacific Division investigated 17 homicides, or 5.6 per team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bureau, which consists of four divisions and covers most of 
South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles, 43 detectives investigated 412 
killings last year, or 17.9 cases per team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollenbeck Division and South Bureau details last year had the lowest 
percentage of arrests for homicide cases in the department, a result that 
commanders blame in large part on their detectives' heavy workloads. In both 
details, investigators often work 18-hour days and juggle half a dozen or more 
cases at once, only to be interrupted by yet another slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer a team handling on the average 10 to 12 homicides a year," said 
Detective Ben Lovato, the Hollenbeck commander. "That gives you enough time to 
do a really thorough investigation and to do a thorough job in following the 
case as it is prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity in workloads raises serious questions about how detectives 
should be deployed, city officials say. The way the detective details are 
staffed now, the investigators in the deadliest neighborhoods have the least 
amount of time to work the greatest number of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every place needs more detectives, but they should be spread out more 
evenly," said Gary Greenenbaum, president of the Los Angeles Police Commission. 
The current deployment "makes no sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that anybody presented with these numbers would agree that something 
has to be done," said Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose 9th District in 
South-Central had 191 homicides within its boundaries in 1993, more than any 
other council district. "The allocation for the deployment of personnel should 
be according to the need in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials contend that a more accurate measure of detective 
workloads at each station should not only take into account homicides but also 
crimes such as robbery and burglary that are handled by other detective 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can look at the single issue of homicide and determine 
fairness," said Lt. John Dunkin, a department spokesman. "You have to take into 
consideration the entire detective workload." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said each station is allotted detectives based roughly on the number of 
all crimes reported in each area. "It's kind of a subjective thing that's 
evolved over the years." It is up to the individual station commanders to 
determine how to use their detectives, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in an effort to take a more centralized approach to deployment, Chief 
Willie L. Williams' command staff recently formed a strategy committee to 
determine how to better utilize detectives citywide, department officials said. 
Recommendations are expected later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But police officials say that all investigative details are stretched to the 
limit in the department, which has decreased from 8,450 sworn personnel in 1991 
to about 7,600 now because of hiring freezes caused by the city's fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, just adding more detectives to a detail would not ensure that more 
cases will be solved. Criminologists and detectives say a host of other factors 
also come into play: the type of slaying, cooperation of witnesses, 
investigators' individual ability and persistence -- and luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some cases that you are not going to solve, regardless of how many 
people you deploy," said Deputy Chief Robert Gil, commander of the department's 
Central Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives refer to the easiest cases to solve as "smoking guns" or 
"self-solvers," such as domestic killings in which the suspect confesses at the 
scene. Those are very different from gang- and drug-related killings, in which 
witnesses often refuse to cooperate or go into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hollenbeck Division, 64% of the homicides last year were related to 
gangs or drugs. In the South Bureau, 60% of all homicide cases in 1993 required 
witnesses to be relocated or guarded for their own protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area where there is some of the greatest resistance to work with 
law enforcement because of the fear of retribution," said Lt. Sergio Robleto, 
commander of the South Bureau homicide detail. He said other details have 
similar problems, but "the percentage of those things is greater on the south 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologists and detectives say there is no standard figure on what 
constitutes an acceptable workload. But in general, they say, investigators 
have a greater chance for success if they have more time to work on a case 
without being interrupted by another killing. That is especially true during 
the first 48 hours of a case, when evidence is still fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once an event takes place, you have to ask yourself how much time and energy 
police have to follow up on the case and whether they can maintain that same 
intensity over a period of time," said Albert Cardarelli, a University of 
Massachusetts criminologist who has done extensive research on homicide 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Police Department homicide details with the lightest caseloads 
generally had the highest clearance rates -- the percentage of homicide cases 
in which arrests were made. In the Northeast Division, where six detectives 
investigated 6.6 cases per team, 96% of the cases were cleared. The six 
detectives in the Central Division cleared 104% of their cases (that figure 
exceeds 100% because it includes cases that originated in 1992 for which 
arrests were made in 1993). The clearance rates were 60% in Hollenbeck and 63% 
in the South Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patrick Polk killing is an example of a case that has suffered because of 
the workload facing South Bureau detectives, Robleto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Polk was dead from a single gunshot wound when officers found him in his car 
near Century Boulevard and Gramercy Place on the night of Feb. 28, 1991. His 
1973 Buick Regal had smashed into a wall and a light post. Because the 
investigation is still going on, detectives declined to discuss a possible 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 From the onset, detectives faced the difficult task of obtaining information. 
No witnesses had been immediately identified, and investigators on the case 
were constantly interrupted by new killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about a year after the slaying, the backlog of cases became too 
great. The original investigative team passed Polk's case to the South Bureau's 
unsolved-murder team, a now-defunct unit of two detectives who handled the 
slayings that other investigators no longer had time to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case that needed a lot of legwork, and that team just didn't have 
the time because of the volume of fresh homicides that were a priority," said 
Detective Carolyn Flamenco, who took over the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Flamenco and her partner's job was to develop new leads through old-fashioned, 
time-consuming detective work: knocking on doors and reinterviewing witnesses 
and suspects. But the new team fell victim to the same problem that scuttled 
the initial investigation: fresh killings. The unsolved-murder team was 
disbanded last summer after a wave of bloodshed that left 24 people dead within 
the bureau's jurisdiction in early July. "It was just a monstrous week," 
Robleto said. "That's when we started getting completely blown out of the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Robleto added that he had little choice but to break up the team. "In order to 
keep the emotional stability of the workers, it was important to throw more 
people into the front-line fray." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the lack of progress, Muriel Polk took matters into her own 
hands. Despite the obvious risk, she revisited the crime scene several times to 
interview residents. She wrote down their statements and gave them to 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it is dangerous," she said. "But he was the only son I had." 
</P>
<P>
 Polk, who has a 16-year-old daughter, also enlisted the help of a friend who 
is a private investigator. But no new leads developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Flamenco said she squeezes in work on the Polk case among six other 
homicides that she and her partner are investigating. "That's the nature of the 
beast here," she said. "I try to work on his case every chance I get." 
</P>
<P>
 An unemployed insurance claims examiner, Polk spends her days looking after 
her 2-year-old grandson, Patrick Polk Jr., who was born eight months after his 
father's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Polk realizes that the detectives are doing their best, she said it 
is difficult going to bed each night knowing that her son's killer is probably 
roaming the streets. She also realizes that her situation has become an 
all-too-familiar occurrence in many Central Los Angeles neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death of a young man like that was senseless," she said. "I know there's 
a lot of other mothers like me. There's too many of us out there." A Heavy 
Workload 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department's two busiest homicide details are in the Eastside's 
Hollenbeck Division and the South Bureau, which consists of four divisions and 
covers most of South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles. In 1993, detectives in 
those two details each investigated two to three times more cases than their 
counterparts in most other areas of the city. Although a number of factors 
contribute to a detective's ability to solve cases, the Hollenbeck and South 
Bureau squad commanders say the heavy workload impedes their efforts to 
investigate homicides. On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from the Police Department's South Bureau examine the murder scene 
at a May 12 shootout at 120th Street and McKinley Avenue, marking off the shell 
casings with chalk circles on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastside, South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles homicide detectives are 
investigating two to three times more cases each than their counterparts in 
other areas of the city. Investigators in the deadliest neighborhoods have the 
least amount of time to work the greatest number of cases. The workload 
disparity raises questions about how detectives should be deployed, officials 
say.

CRENSHAW HIGH, 52 OTHER SCHOOLS JOIN LEARN REFORM PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education voted unanimously last week to allow 
Crenshaw High School and 52 other schools to join its community-based reform 
program, a year-old effort to shift power from the district's central 
bureaucracy to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools will join 34 campuses in the reform plan, which was devised by a 
coalition of educators, parents, and business and community leaders known as 
the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now (LEARN). 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN officials said their reform efforts will be given a boost by the 
addition of Crenshaw and four other high schools. The program relies on 
collaboration among elementary, middle and junior high schools so they can 
coordinate curricula.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents, teachers and students from some of the new schools expressed hope 
that LEARN will improve school maintenance, encourage parental involvement and 
help students get jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in Central Los Angeles that have been added to the program also 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 Arco Iris Primary Center, Cudahy; Eagle Rock Elementary/Gifted Magnet; El 
Sereno Children's Center; El Sereno Elementary; Farmdale Elementary; 52nd 
Street Elementary; 1st Street Elementary; Grape Street Elementary and 
Huntington Park Elementary New Site No. 2, Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools added to the program are: Latona Avenue Elementary; Magnolia 
Avenue Elementary; Murchison Street Children's Center; Murchison Street 
Elementary; Ritter Elementary; 32nd Street/USC Magnet and Youth Opportunities 
Unlimited Alternative.

 If the West African saying "Dance makes us children of one family" holds true, 
then the fourth annual Dance Roots Festival at the Los Angeles Theatre Center 
this weekend should be a real family reunion, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The free two-day event features 13 Los Angeles-based performance groups, which 
will present classical and ceremonial dance from Cambodia, prehistoric dance 
from the Yaqui Indians of Mexico and works from Bali that depict 18th-Century 
harem rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's eclectic programming also includes contemporary works that show 
influence from a variety of cultures, said Leslie Sisson, the show's producer 
and curator. American tap, jazz and hip hop will be highlighted. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, sponsored by the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, was 
launched in 1991 to acknowledge the diverse cultures and dance traditions found 
throughout the city.

LACK EVIDENCE OF BELL GARDENS VOTER FRAUD, ATTORNEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four candidates who alleged voter fraud after they lost the race for two Bell 
Gardens City Council seats last month do not have enough evidence to legally 
challenge the balloting, their attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Peter Wallin said his clients have been unable to gather enough 
testimony to prove that newly elected council members Maria S. Chacon and 
Ramiro Morales won their seats through illegally cast votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallin is representing former incumbents Rosa Hernandez and Josie Macias and 
challengers Hugo Escalera and Maria Victoria Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't prove that people were (illegally) picking up the ballots, I can't 
invalidate the election on those grounds," Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wallin said his clients may still challenge the election based on 
candidate misconduct, a charge that is considered easier to substantiate than 
voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The four had alleged that the Chacon and Morales campaigns falsified absentee 
ballots, registered non-citizens and encouraged them to vote absentee, and 
bribed or bullied voters into supporting them. 
</P>
<P>
 But to challenge the election, the four needed to demonstrate that at least 
550 votes were cast improperly, Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chacon and Morales have consistently denied the charges of voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Soto, Escalera's campaign manager, said she has documented at least 
100 voters who have complaints, but few will publicly testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every single person we talked to said there was some form of fraud 
involved, that the voting process was interfered with," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most voters are afraid to come forward with their complaints, the candidates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went door-to-door to ask people to come forward, and they said, 'Somebody 
told us you were coming and that we shouldn't say anything because we'll get in 
trouble,' " Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't understand the magnitude of what's going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud has been alleged in the city's last three council elections. Hernandez 
said that after one race she submitted more than 40 statements to the district 
attorney from voters who claimed they were victims of illegal tactics but that 
the complaints were not taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the district attorney's office is investigating allegations, she 
said. The district attorney's office has refused to comment on the case.

MIRACLE MILE SOUTH BUILDINGS DISPUTE: THE PAST VS. PASSE; REDEVELOPMENT: AN 
EIGHT-YEAR FIGHT BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS HEATS UP AGAIN OVER A PROPOSED 
'HISTORIC PRESERVATION ZONE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to Miracle Mile buildings, what some see as historic others deem 
dilapidated. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in essence, is the issue fueling an eight-year dispute between landlords 
and tenants over a proposal by city planners to turn the Miracle Mile South 
neighborhood into a "historic preservation overlay zone." Such a designation 
would force owners and developers to seek consent from a city-sanctioned 
association before altering or demolishing the buildings, some of which date to 
the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants concerned about rapid redevelopment during the mid-1980s real estate 
boom unsuccessfully rallied for such a zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a pro-preservation group is gearing up for another fight June 9 at a city 
planning department hearing. The proposal will then go before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point in the near future, we're going to have nothing left of our 
beautiful neighborhood, just some stucco buildings with big balloon signs that 
say, 'Apartments for Rent,' " said Denise Robb, founder of the Miracle Mile 
Action Committee, a residents group that supports the proposed zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents argue that such a designation, which would cover Miracle Mile South 
bounded by Detroit Street on the east, Hauser Boulevard on the west, 3rd Street 
on the north and Wilshire Boulevard on the south, would protect buildings and 
neighborhood character while preserving owners' rights to make needed changes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some landlords say that the zone would lower property values, add a 
useless layer of bureaucracy and preserve buildings of questionable 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason for a building from 1929 to be a historical monument," said 
Horst Beil, a member of the Miracle Mile Apartment & Commercial Owners Assn. "I 
was born in Germany, and my town goes back thousands of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Stefanos Polyzoides, a Los Angeles architect and USC professor, said that 
preservation efforts are necessary to ensure well-planned communities. "The 
more this city becomes like Swiss cheese, with open lots everywhere, the more 
uninviting it becomes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone, which would become the city's eighth, would include a number of 
Depression-era buildings designed by architects such as Max Maltzman and Milton 
Black, said Nancy Fernandez of the city Cultural Heritage Commission. Each zone 
has an association commission that reviews construction plans. Appeals are 
heard by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion for a Miracle Mile South historic zone died in the City Council in 
1987. About that time, a spate of redevelopment ultimately led to the 
demolition of about 50 apartment buildings in the area over several years. (A 
zone covering Miracle Mile North, which is north of 3rd Street, south of 
Beverly Boulevard, west of La Brea Avenue and east of Gardner Street, was 
passed in 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 Robb and others said the issue has apparently been revived because of 
residents' dissatisfaction with 1992 "downzoning" rules, which sought to 
control runaway redevelopment by lowering the number of units built per lot. 
Residents fear that the new regulations are too weak to curb further 
rebuilding.

FOR BELL ATHLETICS, IT'S ALL D'S; A COACHING PHILOSOPHY THAT EMPHASIZES 
DISCIPLINE, DEVOTION AND DEDICATION HAS GIVEN THE SCHOOL ONE OF THE AREA'S TOP 
SPORTS PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As South Gate pitcher Alonso Lopez was pulled from the game after giving up 
another run, his team trailing Bell, 4-3, the Eagles dugout serenaded Lopez: 
</P>
<P>
 Na-na na-na . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Na-na na-na . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hey, hey, hey . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Goodby.  
</P>
<P>
 Coach Henry Santiago, standing outside the dugout, quickly turned and scolded 
his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't taunt other players," Santiago told them. "We encourage our good 
play but we don't discourage others. That is not the type of players you are. 
That is not the type of player I want on this team. The next person (to repeat 
that song) will not take the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Exchanges like this between Santiago and his team are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discipline is real high in our programs," said the three-year varsity coach. 
"(It's all about) winning with class and losing with class." 
</P>
<P>
 That philosophy and the positive interaction between coaches and athletes, 
faculty and students has made Bell home to one of the area's top all-around 
high school sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the key is that we have a very dedicated staff and when we show the 
kids how to play a sport, they are very aggressive at learning," said 
volleyball Coach Mike Mayfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's volleyball squad has reached the playoffs each of Mayfield's eight 
years as coach, including a 15-8, 15-12, 15-10 loss to City Section 4-A 
Division Champion University in this season's semifinals. And Bell reached the 
City Finals three of the four years, 1986-90, it competed in City Section 3-A 
Division volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the fact that Bell's volleyball players don't receive club-level 
instruction like many Valley school players, their accomplishments are even 
more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have the outside coaching advantages, so they rely on us at 
school," Mayfield said. "(Coaches) have to put in a little extra time and so do 
the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The dependency that athletes develop on their coaches for instruction and 
guidance is vital, said Athletic Director Sue Kamiyama. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get the true athlete in ninth grade, so they have to develop. 
Coaches do a good job of teaching them good fundamental skills," said Kamiyama. 
"Coaches teach them from the ninth grade on, so that they (can) become leaders 
as 11th- and 12th-graders." 
</P>
<P>
 Kamiyama, who has been at Bell in some capacity since 1972, the past 10 years 
as athletic director, has "seen a real growth in our girls' and boys' 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell offers 20 different sports, the most in the area, to its students. Golf 
and gymnastics are the only exceptions. Bell did offer golf until 1991 but cut 
it due to Los Angeles Unified School District budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's 23 coaches, all certificated teachers, are involved in all the 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamiyama believes the variety of sports at Bell attracts students to get 
involved: "Kids that come to Bell find a place with our sports. We keep a lot 
of kids in school through sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have found their niche in Bell's sports society have reaped the 
benefits of a vastly successful program. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1979, Bell has won City Championships in football ('85), girls' 
volleyball ('87), baseball ('87), cross country ('91), wrestling ('93 and '94) 
and soccer ('89).  
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Bell basketball team lost, 66-63, to Banning in the City 3-A 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 9, Bell reached the City 3-A Team Tennis final for the first time 
before losing to Van Nuys, 18-11 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Blazing trails is nothing new for Bell, last year having become the first team 
outside the San Fernando Valley to win a City wrestling championship since 
Franklin won in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Coach Frank O'Connor, Bell's wrestlers repeated as City champs this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the teams are successful at Bell," O'Connor said. "It's the nature of the 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 And Santiago hopes to add to Bell's long list of City champs by winning the 
school's first baseball championship in seven years. "This is the best 
all-around team I have had by far," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bell's title drought has not been without accomplishment as the 
Eagles finished as City 3-A runners-up in '88 and '89. Last year Bell lost to 
Crenshaw, 3-2, in the City 3-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell is 19-4 this season and won 13 consecutive games -- a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old Santiago, who is also the mayor of Maywood, will assume the 
reins as full-time varsity football head coach in the fall after sharing a 
co-head coaching position with Ray Galarze for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the coaches encourage their players to improve, they do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago, as well as several other coaches, attend coaching clinics and 
classes in the hope of "finding ways to better ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall's Clinic in Anaheim and Cal State L.A. offers instruction in baseball; 
USC and UCLA football clinics teach the lastest drills and techniques.

 "When the kids see that the coaches are dedicated and have high standards, 
they want to be successful," Kamiyama said. "The kids realize that success 
comes through hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many factors responsible for Bell's athletic prosperity is the stress 
on academic excellence. Coaches concern themselves with the athlete as a 
student during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bell, it is rare for a sport to lose more than five students to 
ineligibility during an academic school year, Kamiyama said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis is on student-athlete and not just athlete," Kamiyama said. 
"Sports and school go hand-in-hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Just like winning and winning.

 QUAKE HOT LINE: Still shaking from the Northridge quake? If so, a new hot line 
offers help. The U. S. Geological Survey, Federal Emergency Management Agency 
and others have set up a toll-free number, (800) TREMOR2, people can call for 
advice on how to reduce the risk from another quake. . . . "Earthquakes can be 
terrifying," said Peter Ward, a USGS scientist. "But we do not lie helpless in 
their path." 
</P>
<P>
 THAT'S DEDICATION: Al Merkel apparently wasn't teed off when a pickup truck 
lost its brakes and crashed into his Cadillac Sedan de Ville parked at the 
Oakmont Country Club in Glendale. According to the Associated Press, Merkel, 
65, left his golf game only long enough to survey the damage. . . . Then, he 
returned to the fairway, saying "Nothing I can do here." 
</P>
<P>
 URBAN GARDEN: Immigrants from many nations grow fruits and vegetables not 
found in many local supermarkets on the Arleta Community Garden Club's 7 
1/2-acre plot. Fava beans, bitter melons and purple basil are but a few of the 
crops grown here by the club's 95 members. . . . Above, Mel Vargas, club 
president, waters his vegetable crop (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 TOP STUDENT: Too often, the only teen-agers saluted run fast, throw hard or 
jump high. But USA Today recognizes students who use their minds. They call it 
the All-USA Academic team, and one student who made the third squad is David 
Golombek, 17, of Hart High in Santa Clarita. . . . Said Golombek, who plans to 
attend MIT: "I'm very pleased. That's tough competition." 
</P>
<P>
 THEY'RE BAD: For two decades, the support of a political organization named 
BAD, headed by Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Rep. Henry Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles), has been key to winning legislative seats. But BAD, once quick 
to king-make, has yet to endorse anyone in two important Assembly races. . . . 
Some say the organization is regrouping after a 1992 election season when three 
of its top candidates lost (A3).

ROUNDING 'EM UP; THOUSANDS JOIN COWBOYS AT RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA RODEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Out here beneath the twin Saddleback peaks on the flat plano trabuco , on what 
they now call Rancho Santa Margarita, the whistles of cowboys that pierced the 
air Saturday meant it was rodeo weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of people like weekend cowboy Steve Dulmage, local volunteer 
Bonnie Watson and Rancho Santa Margarita newcomer Renee Bazinet, it's one of 
the finest times of the year -- a chance to get out the 10-gallon hat and 
boots, squeeze into a pair of jeans and mingle with the local throng of rodeo 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been to a rodeo since I was 14 years old," said Bazinet, now the 
mother of a 13-year-old son, as she stood in the hot midday sun. "We'll be 
going to the rodeo, then the dance and Cooks Corner afterward. We love it." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth annual Rancho Santa Margarita Fiesta Rodeo is a four-day event that 
was launched with a genuine cattle drive Thursday. The cattle were brought from 
Rancho Mission Viejo's Chiquitas Corral at Oso Parkway to the Rancho Santa 
Margarita rodeo grounds, which was about a five-mile ride. The event will 
continue with the grand finale rodeo today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This rodeo gets us going for the whole year," said Watson, a member of one of 
the first 50 families to move to Rancho Santa Margarita. She became the first 
president of the Community Activities and Services Assn., which holds the 
event. "It allows us to put on the other activities like the Easter egg hunt 
and our Christmas party." 
</P>
<P>
 About 7,000 people attended the junior rodeo Friday and more than 5,000 came 
Saturday, festival organizers said. Along with the rodeo, they found an 
assortment of Western-themed food and crafts booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who didn't come fully prepared could buy a hat or boots from one of the 
booths, and at least walk the walk of rodeo cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Dulmage, 25, of Trabuco Canyon, a CASA volunteer and an amateur rodeo rider, 
has real cowboy dreams. He has been riding bulls for more than two years and 
has reached the point where his wife feels a little more comfortable with the 
idea of him doing so, Dulmage said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do some bull riding, but I'm in it for the fun," he said. "I'm at the point 
of just staying on. The good guys are milkin' 'em and spurrin' 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the rodeo grounds, members of the Sierra Circuit of the Professional 
Rodeo Cowboys Assn. competed in seven events -- everything from bareback bronc 
riding to steer wrestling to calf roping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Circuit is one of 13 PRCA circuits that stage rodeos nationwide. 
Sierra Circuit cowboys hold rodeos throughout California, where the sport is 
growing in popularity, Dulmage said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't know about it but there's a lot of rodeo in Southern 
California," he said. "I guess sometimes it gets lost with all the football and 
basketball on television." 
</P>
<P>
 Dulmage scoffs at protests that the animals are mistreated in the rodeo world. 
It is actually just the opposite, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulls the cowboys ride are pampered and well-fed, sell for about $1,500 
each, and "work only about 15 or 16 seconds a week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the animals, these contractors wouldn't be in business," 
Dulmage said. "They're really taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 The rodeo grounds open today at 10 a.m. with a chili cook-off. The rodeo 
begins at 2 p.m.

SUSPECT IDENTIFIED IN WOMAN'S FATAL BEATING NEAR BAR; CRIME: RECENTLY PAROLED 
RAPIST VOWS TO POLICE THAT HE WON'T GO BACK TO PRISON. AUTHORITIES ASK FOR HELP 
FINDING MAN THEY DESCRIBE AS 'AN EXTREME DANGER TO SOCIETY.' 
</P>

<P>
 Authorities were searching Saturday for a recently paroled felon who is 
suspected of beating a 23-year-old Huntington Beach woman to death after 
meeting her in a bar early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police asked for the public's help in finding Edward Patrick Morgan, 28, of 
Orange, who has a history of violence and rape and was described as an "extreme 
danger to society." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Morgan talked with police and vowed that he would not be taken 
back to state prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a guy who should be out on parole," Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne 
said. "Our department is very concerned with why he was out on parole in the 
first place. His history is pretty frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan is wanted in connection with the slaying of Lenora Annette Wong in a 
parking lot across the street from the Australian Beach Club Restaurant and 
Nightclub, where the two had met, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said he had no car and was believed to be traveling on foot somewhere 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can run, but he can't hide," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 He described Morgan as 5-foot-8 and 200 pounds. The parolee also has several 
tattoos, including a lightning bolt, Asian language characters, a mermaid and 
the name "Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said they spoke to Morgan early Saturday morning, when he 
phoned his own apartment -- possibly from a friend's residence. Despite pleas 
from police that Morgan turn himself in within an hour of the call, a friend of 
Morgan's relayed the suspect's response: He had no interest in surrendering.  
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday, Wong's body was found in a parking lot across the street from 
the club a few hours after she was reported missing. She died of injuries to 
the neck, head and pelvis, Browne said.  
</P>
<P>
 One piece of valuable evidence may turn out to be a videotape from a 
surveillance camera outside a pharmaceutical company across the street from the 
nightclub, police said. Investigators had not reviewed the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange police got an anonymous tip Friday night that pointed to Morgan as a 
suspect in the killing, Browne said, adding that the same night, Morgan called 
several other women he met at the bar to set up dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sent a SWAT team to Morgan's Orange apartment at 1:20 a.m. Saturday, 
Browne said. Neither Morgan nor his roommate were home, so officers staked out 
the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives entered the apartment again at 8 a.m., this time armed with a 
search warrant, and Morgan called there two hours later, Browne said. Police 
answered, telling Morgan they wanted him to meet them to discuss his parole 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the telephone rang again. This time, it was a friend of Morgan's, 
who was calling to ask questions about why police wanted to see Morgan. 
Investigators told him they wanted Morgan to turn himself in by 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the deadline, the friend called police again to say Morgan 
would not return. At that point, Browne said, "we told him we wanted him for 
murder."  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Morgan -- who was released from prison in March -- was a 
frequent visitor to bars in Huntington Beach and was seen with a group of white 
supremacist "skinheads" near the Huntington Beach Pier within the past two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every reason to believe he'll be out on the bar scene again," Browne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Corrections records indicate that Morgan was sent to the 
California Institute of Men at Chino in January, 1985, after he was convicted 
of a felony, and was paroled in September, 1986, to New York. Authorities said 
the conviction was for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sent to Chino again in April, 1991, transferred to Avenal State Prison 
in Kings County, and released on parole the following September, according to a 
Corrections Department official. The offense: unlawful sex with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was sent to Folsom State Prison for another offense in March, 1993, the 
corrections official said, and was released on parole late last March. The 
details of the third conviction were not available Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 As police identified a suspect in the case, Wong's father tried not to think 
about Morgan, but focused on his only daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong graduated from UC Riverside in business in 1993, and was recruited out of 
college to be an assistant manager at a Foot Locker shoe store in Westminster, 
said her father, Ben Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 "She only had two months to go until she would become manager," Ben Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store employees at Wong's workplace said they were too stunned to talk. "A lot 
of us are at a grieving point right now," the store's manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid tennis player, Wong had a lot of friends from work but was "on the shy 
side," her father said through tears. She liked to dance at clubs with friends 
but usually could be counted on to be the designated driver because she didn't 
drink alcohol, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for Wong will be held Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. at Preston 
and Simons Mortuary, 3358 7th St., in Riverside. Her father asked that in lieu 
of flowers, people make donations to their favorite charity in Wong's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities request that anyone with information about Morgan call the Orange 
Police Department at (714) 744-7444. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar where Wong disappeared is offering a $5,000 reward for information 
about the case.

PARENTS WANT ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON CLAS; EDUCATION: MORE AND MORE ARE LOSING 
CONFIDENCE IN THE TEST, AND SOME HAVE REQUESTED THAT THEIR CHILDREN BE 
EXEMPTED, CITING THE SCORING DEBACLES, SENSITIVE TOPICS AND THE SECRECY OVER 
EXAM CONTENTS.

 Sue Stewart edits the parent newsletter at Dana Hills High. For more than a 
decade, she has been a classroom volunteer; last fall she defended the state's 
public schools in debates against the voucher initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the time came for her son to take the state's controversial 
California Learning Assessment System test this spring, Stewart joined hundreds 
of Orange County parents in protesting the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried by personal questions the fourth-grader asked after his first day of 
the test, she had him skip the exam afterward, concerned over the scoring 
debacles she had read about in the newspaper and suspicious about why the state 
would not let parents see copies of the tests.  
</P>
<P>
 "How can you get any real results from this when there is such a controversy?" 
said Stewart of Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacks on the state Department of Education's new tests began when several 
conservative Christian groups challenged them in court last month. But now the 
opposition has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a state law that requires districts to administer CLAS, protesters won 
a proclamation from the state saying parents could have their children opt out. 
Now, the $26-million test intended for every fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 
10th-grader is missing a small chunk of children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buena Park, Janet Laird joined the anti-CLAS group at her daughter's 
softball game, where the bleachers were abuzz with parents worried about the 
test. Talk radio convinced Kent Yaden, whose children attend Brea Olinda 
schools. Bad news about the exam has been sizzling through Luana Wells' Costa 
Mesa telephone for weeks. None of their children are taking the test this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Newport-Mesa, where the school board voted to require parental 
permission slips, only one-fifth of the students took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether it's being a product of the '60s, but sometimes 
(government) won't change things unless they know that people are unhappy," 
said Allyn Enke, whose daughter was one of a handful of Santa Ana High 
sophomores exempted. "I hate to use the word protest, but that's what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Launched last year, CLAS tests reading, writing, math, science and social 
studies, measuring performance against tough statewide standards. Instead of 
multiple-choice questions, it uses essays, diagrams and other exercises 
designed to evaluate students' thought processes as well as their ability to 
derive correct answers.  
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they will not know how many students have opted out until 
the summer, after all the booklets have been collected. Local districts, 
though, have some numbers: 100 exemptions in Irvine Unified, 40 in Brea Olinda, 
28 in Los Alamitos and 122 in the county's largest district, Santa Ana Unified. 
 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, students opting out simply went to the library. Some parents 
kept their children at home during testing days; other students went in late, 
after the testing was over. At one school, those who opted out missed a chance 
to get 75 points toward their English class grade. But after parental protest, 
the students got a different assignment to earn the extra points. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is reversed in Newport-Mesa Unified, where 80% of the students 
opted out. Test-takers were sent to the library, while the others remained in 
class, many for fear they would fall behind in regular schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS typically is given in class for an hour a day over a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The test "became compromised because it no longer was a pragmatic decision" to 
take it, said Karen Evarts, whose son Graham was among only 16 sophomores 
Friday to participate at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 Evarts said she made Graham take the test -- and even tried to start a 
mini-movement among her neighbors to support it -- because she believes tests 
like CLAS can help improve teaching in the long run.  
</P>
<P>
 But other parents did just the opposite. Some have specific concerns -- a 
reading selection seems offensive, or news about erroneous scoring of last 
year's exam made them lose confidence. Some say the whole idea of measuring 
critical thinking is bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Laird, whose two children skipped the tests this month, said the state should 
better explain the need for the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the parents need to know. If they're trying to change the overview of 
an education, of where we're going, then explain why. If they're going to ask 
some hot topics such as religion and race, they need to explain why," Laird 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've become very protective: Why aren't they telling me what this test is 
about? What are they trying to hide that they don't want me to know? I don't 
know what they're looking for. I guess until I know what they're looking for 
I'm not going to (let my children) take it." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials insist that they have only kept the exam content secret to 
maintain its integrity. In response to parental outrage, the State Board of 
Education has decided to expand CLAS advisory committees to include more 
members of the general public and has promised to release segments of the test 
once all students have taken it this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the rumors are flying about questions on the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumored questions include something about a boy killing a kitten, a 
Chinese girl's tongue being cut, two girls of different races competing for one 
school jacket based on grade point average, a pastor stealing a baby, and a boy 
getting jumped on his way to the store. As for writing, children supposedly are 
asked to discuss their least favorite teacher, recount a family fight, and 
construct an argument persuading their parents to say yes when they already 
said no -- or something similar.  
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the one parable about the apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, it seems, has heard about a question involving 17 apples and four 
children -- and how, when asked who should get the extra apple, test-takers are 
supposed to say "the neediest child." One woman even called the state 
Department of Education complaining of a question concerning one apple and 17 
people, including the U.S. President, on a boat. The President gets the apple. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are no apple questions at all on the test, said Department of 
Education spokeswoman Jan Agee. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's never been on the test. It's folklore," she said. "They're reacting to 
rumors." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who are opting out admit they do not really know what the tests 
contain, but say they do not like what they do know: that only a sample of the 
exams will be graded this year, that reading selections include some racial and 
religious issues, and that many questions probe personal and family life 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many controversies going on right now. I just feel that they're 
tearing the family down by asking too many questions," said Rita Caira, a 
mother of six who lives in La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't really grade this test," added Jeannie Underwood of Fullerton. "It 
doesn't test their academics, it's testing their psyche and invading their 
personal life and asking them questions they don't have any business asking." 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Younglove, president of the Parent-Teacher Assn. at Kaiser Elementary in 
Costa Mesa, said the current situation is "ironic -- or moronic." 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the CLAS test? It's a test about critical thinking, looking at the 
problem from all angles," Younglove said. "The people who wrote the test didn't 
do that. They didn't critically think about the test they were putting out."

DAUGHTER IN MEMORY CASE FEELS BETRAYED; LAW: THE IRVINE RESIDENT BELIEVES 
JURY'S DECISION TO SIDE WITH HER FATHER AGAINST THERAPISTS 'GAVE HIM AMMUNITION 
TO ATTEMPT TO DESTROY ME MORE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years after she summoned the courage to confront her father over what she 
claims were 11 years of repeated molestation, Holly Ramona says she is once 
again shattered and betrayed -- this time by a jury's decision to side with him 
against the therapists she believes helped her overcome her nightmarish 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she wasn't the target of the May 13 malpractice verdict that awarded 
her father, Gary Ramona, $500,000 in damages, Holly Ramona sees the decision as 
a personal affront that will also seriously undermine her own attempt to win 
acknowledgment in court that he had abused her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really hurt by the verdict," Ramona said Friday evening in an interview 
at her Irvine apartment. "The jury, whether they meant to or not, gave him 
ammunition to attempt to destroy me more." 
</P>
<P>
 The Napa Valley Superior Court jury concluded that Holly Ramona's therapists 
"negligently reinforced" false memories of abuse and ordered them and a 
hospital to pay damages to Gary Ramona, who had filed suit in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict told Holly Ramona "there are an awful lot of people out there who 
don't understand abuse, especially incest," Ramona said. "I think people are 
afraid to look at reality. I don't think it makes sense to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old Pepperdine University graduate student said she still has no 
doubts that her father repeatedly molested her when she was between the ages of 
5 and 16 -- abuse she claims gave rise to terrifying memories that first began 
to emerge as flashbacks in 1990, when she was a student at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona originally sought therapy from Marche Isabella, a family therapist, for 
bulimia and depression, before undergoing an interview at Western Medical 
Center-Anaheim administered -- at her request -- under the influence of the 
hypnotic drug sodium amytal. The purpose of the session, Ramona contends, was 
to confirm that her memories of abuse were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabella and Dr. Richard Rose, formerly chairman of psychiatry at Western, 
helped her cope with the memories, which began before the therapy began, she 
said. Both were ordered to pay part of the damages in the jury verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona said she emerged stronger from the therapy. "I have gotten my 
self-respect back and my right to speak," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she still suffers flashbacks and spontaneous anxiety attacks, often 
triggered by changes in the weather or the scent of after-shave lotion she 
associates with the abuse but can't explain. She said she has always feared her 
father. She knew that when she took him to court "all hell would break loose 
and he would go after me. But I didn't know how." 
</P>
<P>
 And now she feels betrayed by the legal system as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought that all you had to do was just walk into court and just 
tell the truth and things would work out OK," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She believes the jury seemed less concerned about her suffering than the 
losses her father sustained from her accusation -- his loss of a $400,000 job 
as a winery executive, his divorce and his estrangement from Holly and two 
other daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although jury foreman Thomas Dudum stressed after the verdict that jurors were 
still uncertain whether Holly was molested, Gary Ramona said he believed he had 
been vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it may no longer be practical, Holly Ramona believes, to go to 
trial with her lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages. The suit is pending in 
Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Baruch, Holly Ramona's lawyer, agreed that the jury verdict "has caused 
some major problems" but said he still hopes to persuade a judge that Ramona 
deserves her day in court. He added, however, that any jury hearing Ramona's 
lawsuit would "know there has been a decision and it has been adverse to Holly. 
That is what they will remember." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a clever move," Ramona said of her father's lawsuit. "I think he knew 
exactly what he was doing. He doesn't look bad. He looks like the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ramona and his attorney could not be reached for comment on Holly 
Ramona's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona, who graduated from UC Irvine and expects to obtain a master's 
degree in psychology from Pepperdine University in July, said she resents the 
implication that she could be made to believe abuse if it hadn't occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone should be held responsible for their memories, it should be me," 
she protested. "They were good therapists and they helped me and this is what 
they get for it?" 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Ramona smiled easily as she moved about her sparsely furnished 
apartment, whose condition, she said, reflected that her father has cut her off 
from financial help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona said she works by day as an intake worker in an Orange County 
psychiatric hospital, which she declined to identify. Three nights a week, she 
attends Pepperdine classes at an office building in Newport Beach. Ramona said 
she relishes the newfound independence and assertiveness she gained through 
therapy, a confidence she said contrasts sharply with her demeanor as a quiet, 
obedient girl growing up in an economically privileged family in Napa Valley. 
Back then, she said, she was afraid to do or say anything that would cross her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the beneficial side effects of the court battle, Ramona said, is that 
it has drawn her closer to her mother and sisters, who have stood by her. She 
said she also has received support from friends at school and work. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the trauma they have caused, Ramona says she is grateful that the 
painful memories resurfaced because they helped her explain the "strange 
relationship" she had with her father and gain control over eating binges and 
depression that had made her consider suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she wants to work as a child therapist. "I know what it feels like to 
grow up in a family that is dysfunctional," she said, "and I want to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona is concerned about the potential effect the verdict may have on mental 
health professionals. The verdict, which may be appealed, could set legal 
precedent, opening the door for non-patients to sue therapists on the grounds 
they were harmed by the outcome of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 People in therapy, especially victims of child abuse, will be worried that 
anything they say to their therapists about parents, spouses and others could 
become part of a court record, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patients want to feel safe, that they have privacy, and all of a sudden we 
are being told we can't have it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona said she is "trying to make sense out of all this. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe my role in this is just to speak out. My main goal now is to help other 
victims of child abuse. I want to get the message out it can happen in those 
'perfect' families where everything appears fine."

ANIMAL LOVERS DISTRAUGHT AT BEAR'S DEATH; WILDLIFE: KILLING IN AZUSA PROMPTS 
NUMEROUS CALLS. A MAJORITY ON A RADIO TALK SHOW SEEMED TO AGREE WITH THE 
DECISION, BUT POLICE SAY MANY WERE UPSET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When police shot and killed a lumbering bear as it caroused through an Azusa 
neighborhood, they downed the animal but touched a nerve: Images of the furry 
creature lying dead in the street incensed some animal lovers and lit up 
switchboards Saturday at a local radio talk show as well as at the beleaguered 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hearing quite a bit about it," said Sgt. James Collins, a watch 
commander at the Azusa Police Department and the officer who was in charge of 
the bear-shooting scene Friday. "They're upset the bear got killed. Well, we're 
upset the bear got killed, too." 
</P>
<P>
 At KFI radio, talk show host Bill Press stirred the pot by suggesting that 
police were wrong to kill the animal, a 350-pound California black bear that 
had wandered out of Angeles National Forest and into an Azusa carport. When the 
bear shrugged off two tranquilizer darts and slipped past two police cars, four 
shotgun-wielding police officers cut short its gambol. 
</P>
<P>
 One caller to Press' show compared the plight of the bear to that of Native 
Americans crowded out by white settlers. A few others joined in and criticized 
the police for snuffing out what seemed to them a lovable creature. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, Press was outvoted. Station officials said most calls ran in 
favor of killing the bear rather than letting it stroll through the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Try telling that to Joel, who was working the cash register at the Upstart 
Crow, a bookstore and coffeehouse that carries a series of books in which the 
featured bears are the teddy-bear kind, not the big, lumbering type that wander 
into neighborhoods uninvited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's kind of awful that they shot it," said Joel, who did not want 
his last name used. "There are certain ways that we should conduct ourselves as 
human beings. They should have netted this bear or something." 
</P>
<P>
 On busy Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, less than a mile south of Angeles 
National Forest, some Saturday night strollers echoed his passion. Those who 
had seen television coverage of the bear shooting thought that Azusa police 
overreacted. For them, the bear's death sparked heated opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked that they shot the bear," said Jeff Schrier, 25, of Studio 
City. "It didn't look like it was going to hurt anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the TV and the bear was just ambling along," said Mary Phillips, 57, of 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Mann, 27, of Los Angeles said experts on bear behavior should have been 
called to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But mention of the bear prompted debate among some couples. When Alvin 
Bracewell, 41, of Los Angeles suggested that more tranquilizer darts should 
have been used, his companion, Tracy Frazier, 28, of Los Angeles interrupted. 
"I think you really have to take into consideration the homeowner, the 
neighborhood, the children and safety," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the police station, Collins conceded that most callers were closer to 
Joel's view of the incident than the police's. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to know why we didn't dart it more, why we let it get out of the 
containment," Collins said. "They don't realize how strong and powerful these 
animals are." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Collins added that by afternoon, the calls were beginning to taper off 
and a few voices of support were making their way through. "About one out of 
every 10 is somebody saying: 'You guys did the right thing,' " Collins said. 
"It's nice to know somebody has some common sense."

1,500 VOLUNTEERS MOUNT 2ND ANNUAL EFFORT TO CLEAN UP L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Liz Gonzalez wanted her nephew to learn about Los Angeles, about something 
more than the familiar images of earthquakes, fires and riots. She wanted to 
give 8-year-old Esteban Serrano a truer portrait of her city. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Saturday, she made him plant a tree. Along with dozens of other 
volunteers, Gonzalez and her nephew helped root 250 apricot trees along a bare 
strip of Arroyo Seco Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to show him what we're all about," said Gonzalez, packing the dirt 
around a newly planted sapling destined to blossom and bear fruit. "This city 
isn't about rebellion. It isn't about fires and earthquakes. It's about people 
working together and it's about a spirit of community." 
</P>
<P>
 That same spirit moved more than 1,500 volunteers to fan out across Los 
Angeles on Saturday in a massive one-day urban renewal effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-annual Work-A-Thon, sponsored by the nonprofit L.A. Works, matched 
volunteers with community service projects in areas from Northridge to Long 
Beach. Near Echo Park, volunteers helped spruce up a center for pregnant 
teen-agers. Along the Los Angeles River, they picked up trash and plucked 
rusted shopping carts from the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, nearly 40 projects were tackled by city officials, company executives 
and hundreds of other volunteers who gave up their Saturday to lend a hand to a 
city that in recent years has had its share of hard luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've really tried to do is highlight community service concerns in Los 
Angeles," said Bob Johnson, co-chairman of L.A. Works. The group seeks to 
provide a labor force for volunteer projects while bridging the gap between 
communities, rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go," Johnson said. "But it's evolving and we 
think it's capturing the spirit of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers met Saturday in Exposition Park, where they gathered into teams and 
prepared for a long day of work. Actress Whoopi Goldberg, battling the flu, 
managed to walk on stage and deliver some words of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an honorable thing," she said. "It's not forced. It's something you 
choose to do. If we can wake other people up to choose to volunteer, I think it 
will do us a lot of good." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 volunteers boarded Bus 32 and headed to the edge of a 
graffiti-scarred neighborhood bordering the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, workers began picking up piles of trash dumped along the concrete 
banks of the river. Braver souls marched into the thick vegetation below, 
encountering shopping carts and abandoned homeless encampments. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Frederick was the first to wade through this jungle, explaining how much 
of the junk washes downstream during storms and eventually finds its way to the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city needs me, it needs all of us," he said, pulling out his fourth 
shopping cart of the day. "If nothing else, I'm building up good karma. In a 
mean city, you need all of the good luck you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Near Echo Park, a small army of volunteers helped turn an old Baptist church 
into a center for pregnant teen-agers and their babies. The Parent and Special 
Infant Toddler Program is planning to move into the center across from St. 
Anne's Maternity Home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wagar, president of Cigna HealthCare of California, led a team of workers 
helping in the transformation effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't be a corporate citizen that takes," Wagar said. "This is a 
neighborhood for us. We have facilities around here. This is exactly the kind 
of thing the health care community needs to be investing in." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagar will get no argument from Carol Lee Thorpe, executive director of the 
home for pregnant teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People of influence need to be aware of what teen-agers are dealing with," 
said Thorpe, watching some of her girls help paint a mural at the new center. 
"Not only do we get our facility cleaned up, but people come away with a lot 
clearer picture of what our community is all about."

LIVE TO TELL; TEEN-AGERS FROM L.A. SCHOOLS PACK FIRST DISTRICT-SANCTIONED GAY 
PROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For weeks, 18-year-old Jake Sareerak had been driving his prom date crazy with 
repeated phone calls about what color their matching accessories should be: 
soft blue, pale pink or all white? They settled for traditional black. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was where attention to convention came to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Sareerak, a Fairfax High School senior, took his boyfriend to 
Friday night's prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sareerak and his date, Vincent Tam, a 20-year-old UCLA communications major, 
smooched, dined and danced thisclose for what organizers said was the first gay 
and lesbian prom ever sanctioned by a public school district in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers from 30 Los Angeles high schools -- as well as some from nearby 
districts -- packed a pink and white balloon-filled ballroom at the Los Angeles 
Hilton and Towers Hotel for the prom, billed as "Live to Tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The students said they were reveling in their right to a rite of passage, 
enjoying the freedom to dance and romance at the formal event without fear of 
being ridiculed, rebuked or bashed for being gay. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of same-sex couples, the prom had all the trappings of a 
straight prom: Shiny limos, corsages and boutonnieres, deep-house/tribal/techno 
music and a photographer standing by to capture couples in their glamorous 
outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by the Los Angeles Unified School District's Board of Education, the 
event was co-sponsored by the district's Eagles Center -- a school for gay and 
lesbian students who choose not to attend traditional high schools -- and the 
board's Gay and Lesbian Education Commission, which champions the rights of gay 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which had not been widely publicized outside the schools, drew a 
handful of protesters from the One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism Christian 
Church in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sidewalk outside the hotel, the protesters waved anti-gay and 
anti-district posters and chanted "God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!" 
as students arrived, many making androgynous style statements and a few in full 
drag. 
</P>
<P>
 Navapol Junniephol, 17, made an unforgettable prom entrance as "Tamy," a saucy 
and statuesque drag queen in a tight black gown with a bow resting on his rear 
and a six-foot chiffon train sweeping the floor behind him. "Tamy" was not the 
least bit bewildered by the demonstrators who shouted "Are you a boy or a 
girl?" He just waved a little black handbag at them, gathered his train and 
headed to the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The students seemed to take the protest in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about equal rights, not gay rights," said Rachel Prindle, 17, 
sporting a Sinead O'Connor haircut. "The protesters have proved nothing. 
They've just wasted their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my time to be myself. Nothing can spoil our night," she said before 
joining a frenzied group of young men and women dancing to a 1970s Donna Summer 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Rivera, 16, a junior at Diamond Bar High School, arrived with his date, 
Chris Barlow, a 17-year-old pen pal he met through the Gay and Lesbian Center 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera, who in the past has struggled with suicidal feelings over his sexual 
identity, said he realized two years ago that "I can't run away from my gayness 
the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still tough at school," he said. "Every time I walk down a hallway I'm 
always shoved or somebody gives me a bad look or calls me 'faggot' and 'queer.' 
By the end of the day I feel emotionally and physically tired." 
</P>
<P>
 But on this night, Rivera did not have a worry in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always dreamed of going to a prom with a guy. I just didn't know how I 
would do it. I'm ecstatic about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For K.C. Barrow, 18, an Eagles student, the prom served as a blind date 
arranged by a social worker. Barrow and his date, William Ballantine, 17, a 
student at St. Monica's Catholic High School in Santa Monica, met just hours 
before the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both pretty nervous," Barrow said. But soon the jitters faded. By the 
second hour, the two were striking poses for prom photos under a balloon arch, 
Barrow's cheek pressed against Ballantine's. By the third hour, the two were 
inseparable as they danced nonstop into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna-Lisa Parra, 17, a senior at Buena Vista High School in Corona, attended 
with Cindy Rosales, 17, a senior at South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The two lesbian friends -- both dressed in menswear, including pin-stripe 
trousers, oversize shirts, suspenders and ties -- have known each other for 
four years and are openly gay at their schools. They also are members of 
Project 10, a districtwide gay and lesbian counseling program that gets its 
name from the estimate that 10% of the nation's population is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This prom is showing that the gay rights movement is taking a big step 
forward," Rosales said. Two weeks ago she attended South Gate's senior prom 
with her best male friend, who is straight and knows she is a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
 At that event, she was voted the prom princess and accepted the crown in a 
creme-colored, tight-waisted, tea-length gown. "When I sat down it was very 
uncomfortable," said Rosales, adding that she was more comfortable in the 
clothes she chose for Friday's prom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outspoken in an academic way," said Rosales, who is vice president of her 
senior class and is involved in youth, feminist, lesbian and Latino issues at 
school and in her community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that I have my rights as a lesbian. I don't promote my gayness but 
I take pride in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her date, Parra, said that last year she attended South Gate's junior-senior 
prom with a girlfriend but felt unwelcome there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We danced and took our pictures together, but we could feel the bad vibes. We 
left. That, obviously, is not happening here tonight," she said, soon after 
telegrams from school board member Jeff Horton and Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, openly gay politicians, were read to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Gill, the Gay and Lesbian Education Commission's director, joined other 
organizers in expressing gratitude to several gay and lesbian groups and 
well-wishers for donating $6,000 to help underwrite the prom. Student 
participants paid $15 apiece; no public funds were spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Uribe, Project 10 founder and a science teacher at Fairfax High 
School, said: "This kind of affirmation is imperative for gay and lesbian youth 
because a lot of our kids are faced with life-and-death situations. The prom 
says to them: 'You have dignity and we respect you and you're not lesser in 
anyone's mind.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The prom-goers echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our night to celebrate and to dance in a classy ballroom with our 
friends and our lovers," said Christine Soto, who made a speech welcoming her 
peers to the prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other prom-goers, Soto, a 16-year-old Eagles Center student -- her hair 
fashionably slicked back, her outfit a mix of brocade vest, baggy pants and 
zoot-suit pocket chain -- saved up for the prom. She paid a friend $100 to 
drive her and her date to the prom and later to Santa Monica Beach where the 
two young women watched the sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight is a night we can claim as ours," she said, her voice breaking with 
emotion as shouts of "Go on, girl!" came from the audience. "Tonight is a night 
where we don't have to worry about nobody telling us that we don't fit in. 
After tonight we will live to tell about our struggle to achieve equality and 
human rights."

BILL BOYARSKY: SIZING UP THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My assignment was to write an essay about the issues in the June 7 state 
primary and how they affect Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll read my essay next Sunday in a special section devoted to the election. 
But before I sat down at my computer to write it, I had to see for myself how 
the candidates act on the campaign trail, to get a sense of them as people. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been many years since I first engaged in the odd mixture of friendliness 
and hostility, trust and suspicion that makes up the relationship between a 
candidate and a reporter. Although I've gone through the exercise many times, I 
felt the same sense of challenge, mystery and adventure as I began my four days 
of chasing candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I started with Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, one of the Democratic 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi is running for governor as if he were cutting trees at his Mokelumne 
Hill ranch with a big ax, heavy-handed, dogged, one tree at a time. But instead 
of cutting trees, his task in this campaign is visiting every county, even the 
most lightly populated and remote. 
</P>
<P>
 I caught him on a Saturday when he was helping Pastor Clevester Williams and 
congregants of the Assembly Church of God in Christ cook the delicious barbecue 
they sell each Saturday at the church, which is on East El Segundo Boulevard in 
the Watts-Willowbrook area. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi is obsessed with facts, figures and policies. In that respect, he's 
like Bill Clinton, but without the President's charm, country-boy smile and 
quick moves. Nor can the short-funded Garamendi campaign afford the image 
makers who translated Clinton's data-packed thoughts into understandable 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, a big, friendly man in small groups, communicated well at the 
church as he listened to troubles and offered solutions. But on another day, at 
a meeting of the Valley Industrial and Commerce Assn. at Sportsmen's Lodge in 
Studio City, his speech was dull and nothing could stop the steady clanking of 
luncheon knives and forks. At such events, Garamendi often sounds angry and 
frustrated, bellowing his message at people rather than talking to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, state Sen. Tom Hayden, another Democratic candidate, has figured 
out the art of communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he came out of his divorce from Jane Fonda with a bundle to ease the 
pain, Hayden has the face and manner of a man who's been beat up by life. His 
manner has changed, and the old arrogance is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 He's as obsessed with data as Clinton or Garamendi, but understands how to 
communicate it. When he was talking about malathion spraying to some San 
Gabriel Valley Democrats, you'd think his own car and back yard had been 
sprayed. But his real medium is television. The screen is perfect for his soft 
delivery. Although Hayden is too far to the left, and too underfunded, to win 
the nomination, he's my long shot to win this week's debates between the 
Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to cover an underdog such as Hayden, who had time to drop me off at 
The Times parking structure when we returned from the San Gabriel Valley. 
Catching up with the favorite in the Democratic race, Kathleen Brown, is 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign manager, Clint Reilly, specializes in giving his candidates the 
appearance of accessibility while hiding them from situations that might 
imperil their lead. That's what he did with Mayor Richard Riordan during last 
year's mayoral election. A Reilly candidate tends to bustle from one 
out-of-the-way spot to another, avoiding big news conferences and debates. My 
interview with Brown was at 9:30 p.m. Thursday in San Francisco -- not exactly 
convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Brown the same question I posed to the others: What would she tell a 
52-year-old Redondo Beach aerospace engineer who can't find a job. She told me 
she'd suggest a community college job training program or "opening up his mind 
and vision" to new job opportunities. That sounds like career counseling, I 
told her, not gubernatorial action. It took her a moment to figure out what I 
was after and then she changed gears, launching into a description of her jobs 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I wondered about this answer. Why was Brown being so literal-minded? 
Was she finding it difficult to picture herself as governor? Or was this narrow 
answer just an example of the famous Brown caution? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown is playing defense, the man she hopes to defeat, Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson, is playing the role of a killer. Or, as the law-and-order governor 
might put it, the role of an executioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has changed over the years. As mayor of San Diego in the '70s, he was 
fun to write about -- an upbeat young reformer taking on the corrupt 
troglodytes who ran the city. He's become grim, unforgiving of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 During our conversation at the J.W. Marriott in Century City last week, he 
spoke in a flat, joyless voice. He only smiled at the end, when we talked about 
a mutual friend, Zan Thompson. He was very tough. I wouldn't want to run 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, there's Ron Unz, a 32-year-old Silicon Valley computer software 
entrepreneur who decided to invest some of his substantial wealth in a race 
against Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz sounds like a computer nerd who, in his late 20s, began reading the 
newspapers and listening to Rush Limbaugh. I can imagine his shock when he read 
about workers' comp: What? he said. They pay people who aren't working? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know much about him, except that he's very pleasant. After our 
interview, he gave his beeper number, then sent me a fax with a friendly note 
and more information. If I had asked, I'm sure he would have given me his 
E-mail address. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's being accessible.

THE PLOTS THICKEN; GARDENS: ARLETA CLUB'S LAND IS FLOURISHING WITH FRUITS, 
VEGETABLES AND COMPANIONSHIP THAT LINKS PEOPLE OF MANY HERITAGES. 
</P>

<P>
 Beneath a towering row of power lines, a meeting of nations is taking place at 
the Arleta Community Garden Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Simone, 70, of Sun Valley is hacking away some devil's grass from neatly 
tended plots where she is growing fava beans, escarole, dandelions and that 
most Italian of vegetables -- tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I show you a tomato!" says the vigorous Simone, pointing to the product of a 
handful of seeds she brought back from Italy last year. "I like this work." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Harut Chakmakchian is kneeling beside his purple basil, to be used in 
Greek foods for family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salad," says Chakmakchian, who knows almost no English, pointing to the tiny 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter melons of Filipino Rene Daliva lie next to Chinese-American Donald 
Chu's garden, along with the crops of Mexican, Japanese and Central American 
immigrants -- 95 members in all, growing fruits and vegetables they couldn't 
find in most San Fernando Valley supermarkets, as well as garden staples like 
corn and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1976, Arleta's garden club is now bigger than ever -- with 20 new 
members and two new parcels of land to till -- after resolving a dispute with 
the Department of Water and Power last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP, which lets the club farm below its electrical towers along Canterbury 
Avenue, discovered that it had unknowingly paid the bill for a large portion of 
the garden's water over the years -- about $35,000. The DWP asked the club to 
pay more for water, not farm within 50 feet of any tower and create a 16-foot 
access road through the middle of the garden, or leave the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blamed for the way the DWP was neglecting their property," said 
garden-master David Winseman, who spends about three hours a day on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden club -- mostly made up of senior citizens and low-income families 
who rely on the garden for sustenance or entertainment -- grudgingly agreed, 
expecting to have to raise their members' yearly water rates from $8 to $20 per 
plot to meet the demand. The increase was significant, since many of the 
gardeners work up to a dozen of the 15-foot plots. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a compromise, the rates were only raised to $10. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials have since revised regulations on watering gardens citywide, 
making it cheaper for urban garden clubs to water their crops. The DWP 
maintained throughout the controversy last year that it never considered 
expelling the garden club, and simply asked the club to support itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, relations with the DWP and a handful of neighbors opposed to the 
garden have blossomed, and the club now is allowed to farm on about 7 1/2 acres 
of DWP land, up from about six acres, according to Winseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents are still less than supportive of the garden, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a 12-foot window and it overlooks this stupid garden," said Sheila 
Badger, 69, one of the few residents opposed to the club who hasn't moved out. 
"Our main concern is the beer drinking and urinating that goes on over there. 
And they've been growing some kind of sugar cane to make alcohol. We're the 
only English-speaking people around here. Those old men sit around there all 
day long. What can they do with 40 tomato bushes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of losing members as a result of the water rate increase, the club has 
significantly grown instead, and there is a waiting list for garden plots, 
Winseman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Holdstock, 65, of Panorama City has been working in the garden for 15 
years. Now that he is retired, the garden is a way to stay active and get out 
of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time I started, I was working, so it was just fun," he said. "Now, I'm 
retired, so it helps me get the cobwebs out. I don't bowl or anything like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the members feel a kinship with others who enjoy working the land. The 
club is planning a picnic for the end of June, when members can enjoy the 
fruits of each other's labor as well as their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," said club president Mel Vargas, 64, a former employee of the Los 
Angeles County Arboretum. "One of the reasons I fought the DWP for a year is 
that these are mainly poor people who don't have much money, or things to do, 
so they need this."

AIDS PATIENTS CALL 'MIRACLE' A MEDICAL HOAX; LAWSUIT: PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING 
NINE HIV-INFECTED MEN, SAY THEY WERE HUMAN GUINEA PIGS IN AN EXPERIMENT WITH A 
USELESS DRUG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Helen MacEachron lay on her bed, blinking back tears as she made another entry 
in her videotaped diary. With her camcorder whirring, she talked quietly about 
trying a new drug, Viroxan, that she hoped would stop the lymph cancer that was 
slowly killing her. 
</P>
<P>
 "This experimental treatment is a godsend," said MacEachron, a former legal 
secretary and aspiring writer in Santa Monica. "If this doesn't get any better 
-- this is just a nightmare, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 But things quickly went wrong with Viroxan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a later, more jarring video segment, MacEachron unbuttoned her shirt to 
examine the plastic catheter that had been surgically implanted between her 
breasts so she could take the drug intravenously. What she saw panicked her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe -- oh God! This thing has blood. . . . Oh God! This wasn't 
here before," she said. "I somehow accepted the idea that I'm doing this. But 
I've not accepted the idea that it could feel or be bad." 
</P>
<P>
 When a serious infection later landed her in the hospital, and her catheter 
had to be removed, MacEachron decided that Viroxan indeed was bad. In late 
1991, she sued two San Fernando Valley doctors who installed the catheter and 
another physician who invented Viroxan. Joining the lawsuit were nine Los 
Angeles men infected with the AIDS virus who also had taken Viroxan. 
</P>
<P>
 MacEachron and one other plaintiff have since died, but the first phase of 
their suit has recently gone to trial in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for both sides and outside legal experts say they believe it is the 
first civil trial in the United States involving allegations of AIDS fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 But noticeably absent from the proceedings in Department 41 is the central 
figure in the Viroxan saga: Stephen D. Herman, the articulate, handball-playing 
former radiologist who formulated the drug in a guest house behind his $700,000 
Orange County home. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Herman, who has since moved to Florida, declared bankruptcy, 
automatically halting all litigation against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Five people are known to have died after taking Viroxan, but each had been 
seriously ill, and state medical investigators could not directly link Viroxan 
to the deaths. But investigators insisted that the demise of two men with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome was hastened by their involvement with 
Viroxan and negligent treatment they received from Herman and a North Hollywood 
doctor, Valentine Birds, who helped him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Viroxan was never approved for human testing or consumption, Herman 
claimed it was a miracle drug that could halt the progression of AIDS and cure 
cancer, warts, sunburn, psoriasis, arthritis and athlete's foot. He injected it 
in at least one patient even before he knew if it was toxic to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested in 1990 and later convicted of false advertising related to 
Viroxan sales. After state medical officials charged him with incompetence and 
negligence in 1991, Herman surrendered his doctor's license rather than face a 
trial. Birds was tried on similar charges and lost; his license was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 State authorities said the disciplinary actions were the first in California 
against AIDS quackery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit brought by the late MacEachron and her co-plaintiffs charges that 
Viroxan -- a citrus derivative infused with ozone -- has no medical value. By 
being put on it, they argue, they were deprived of crucial time in which to 
take legitimate drugs such as AZT, the first AIDS drug approved by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also alleges that the doctors and another defendant, the Medical 
Center of North Hollywood, where catheters were installed, conspired to use the 
plaintiffs as human guinea pigs in an unethical "experiment" designed to 
generate test data that could help market Viroxan. The plaintiffs want $10 
million apiece in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants deny the charges. They say those who took Viroxan suffered no 
serious harm and are not entitled to damages. They also claim that recent 
studies indicate that AZT is more toxic and less likely to extend the life span 
of people with AIDS than originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman injected Viroxan in dozens of patients, saying it caused dramatic 
increases in their T-cell counts, a measure of immune-system health. Some of 
those who took it have claimed the drug saved their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But independent AIDS experts said Herman's limited data proved nothing, since 
T-cell counts often rise and fall sharply, even with no medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, shots of the syrup-like drug were excruciatingly painful -- so much 
so that even patients who believed it was keeping them alive went off it. To 
get around that problem, Herman hit on the idea of having catheters implanted 
in patients' chests, so they could take Viroxan intravenously. 
</P>
<P>
 The physician who arranged for catheter implants was Birds, a pleasant, 
gray-haired osteopath who advocated holistic treatments and had unconventional 
ideas about treating AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when Birds was recommending Viroxan, only one drug -- AZT -- had been 
approved by the federal government for use against AIDS. But Birds urged 
patients not to take AZT, saying it was "poison" due to its toxic side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he recommended Vitamin C and typhoid vaccine -- substances that are 
not standard treatments for AIDS. In an interview with The Times, Birds said he 
learned about typhoid vaccine from an article in a rock 'n' roll magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 By late 1989, Birds had referred about 10 people for catheter implants, he 
said. A number of those who received the tubes soon developed infections that 
led to blood poisoning and dangerously high fevers. One, a Beverly Hills floral 
designer suffering from AIDS, died after being found in a bathtub where he had 
lain for three days, in shock and suffering from pneumonia, blood poisoning and 
a bad staph infection. State authorities said the infection was related to his 
catheter. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1991, 10 ex-patients sued Herman, Birds, the Medical Center of 
North Hollywood and a Sherman Oaks doctor, Rajindra Sethi, who performed the 
catheter surgery. In February, five of the plaintiffs went to trial (the others 
were sent to another courtroom for trial later). 
</P>
<P>
 But after 2 1/2 years of preparation and pretrial arguments, the legal battle 
has taken a toll on many of those involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Herman, Birds and Sethi have declared bankruptcy. Although the state took 
no disciplinary action against him, Sethi voluntarily closed his practice last 
year, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main plaintiff lawyer, Raymond Henke, is so caught up in the Viroxan case 
that he often seems obsessed with it. A medical malpractice specialist, he quit 
a handsomely paid job at a Los Angeles law firm to pursue the case full time. 
</P>
<P>
 With no salary since 1992, the tall, 40-year-old attorney, with collar-length 
hair, is so deeply in debt that he stopped paying the mortgage on his small 
West Hollywood home, which now serves as his office. Visitors find it difficult 
to avoid tripping over the heaps of legal briefs, depositions and medical 
textbooks that fill nearly every available surface in Henke's living room. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for day-to-day trial expenses, not to mention groceries, he depends on 
a $5,000 monthly loan from his parents. Preparing for the trial took so much of 
his time that he often brought along his 8-year-old son when he interviewed 
witnesses on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 With the trial in full swing, Henke dispatched his wife to be with her family 
in Costa Rica so he could concentrate better. He has so little cash, he cannot 
afford to pay the man who services his rented copying machine. At one point, 
police seized his car -- and booted Henke and his son out of it -- because 
Henke had failed to pay his registration fees for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assisting him in court is Sterling Wolfe, 30, a UC Berkeley law school 
graduate who has not been paid in two years and recently had to declare 
bankruptcy himself. On top of that, his fiance dumped him, upset that he was 
"working for a cause" instead of having a job with a regular salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nowhere near as idealistic as Ray," said Wolfe, who, along with his boss 
often seems exhausted in court, the result of regular 100-hour workweeks and 
little sleep. "If the clients were not the best people I ever met, I'd be 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Henke, however, insists he has no regrets about what he is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very liberating to know that the richest man is the man who needs the 
least," he said. "I really believe that that kind of humility is something I 
could have learned only in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Henke has carried his crusade against Viroxan far beyond the courtroom. He 
testified against Herman and Viroxan before a congressional subcommittee in 
Washington. When Herman was trying to get a Kenya medical institute to test and 
manufacture Viroxan, Henke tried to undercut him by sending letters to the 
institute and the World Health Organization detailing Herman's legal problems 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyers have mostly harsh words for Henke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen anyone so obsessed with a case," said Andrew Lloyd, an 
Orange County attorney who formerly represented Herman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is so self-righteous about it. Oh, you're evil if you disagree with him. 
This is just a case, Ray. It isn't Hitler against the world. I tell him, 'I'm a 
lawyer, you're a lawyer.' I tell him the other lawyers are nice. He says: 'No. 
They're wicked, despicable, evil.' But no, they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Henke said he is going after the doctors and the hospital with such a 
vengeance in order to send a message that defrauding desperate people with 
terminal illnesses is unacceptable and will be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these guys are extremely cynical physicians whose object clearly was 
to take advantage of AIDS patients for their own gain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henke charged that the doctors' bankruptcies were deliberate efforts to delay 
the trial until his clients died. Defense lawyers scoff at that contention, 
saying the doctors filed because they have no medical income and heavy debts. 
(Henke was able to persuade federal bankruptcy judges to let him pursue Birds 
and Sethi in Superior Court.) 
</P>
<P>
 In contending that his clients were subjected to medical experimentation by 
the defendants, Henke repeatedly has compared them to Joseph Mengele, the 
infamous Nazi doctor who performed depraved medical "tests" on concentration 
camp inmates -- an analogy the defense rejects as ridiculous and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the trial has unfolded, defense lawyers have poked a number of holes in 
Henke's case. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Henke said that plaintiff Rod Garcia developed a catheter 
infection so bad he had to be hospitalized and later was bedridden at home for 
six months. So shaken was Garcia by the experience, said Henke, that he swore 
off any further contact with doctors and thus has gone without AZT or other 
treatment for his AIDS since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But on cross-examination, defense lawyer David O'Keefe, who represents Birds, 
produced records that he said indicated Garcia refused other doctors' advice to 
take AZT, before and after meeting Birds. In 1992, according to one record, 
Garcia told a West Hollywood physician he was "a macrobiotic" who did not use 
conventional drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Keefe also challenged Garcia's contention that he and his mother had given 
Birds more than $25,000 for typhoid vaccine shots and other unapproved AIDS 
treatments. O'Keefe displayed billing records that he said showed Garcia had 
paid Birds less than $3,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Henke has pledged to file separate lawsuits later against Herman. But with 
Viroxan's creator absent from the courtroom, the trial has focused on Birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Birds and his lawyers argue that none of the plaintiffs was injured by being 
steered away from AZT. Indeed, they say, the passage of time has proven Birds 
right about AZT, as recent studies have concluded that it is less effective and 
more toxic than at first believed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henke insists Birds is misreading the studies. He said they do not 
question the overall effectiveness of AZT, but only whether it is as effective 
when used late in the disease as in the early stages of AIDS.

MUSLIMS CELEBRATE FESTIVAL WITH PRAYER, FOOD; GATHERING: ABOUT 7,000 WORSHIPERS 
GATHER IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY FOR EID AL-ADHA, THE DAY AFTER THEIR MOST IMPORTANT 
WORLDWIDE RELIGIOUS EVENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Dressed in traditional Islamic clothing, about 7,000 Southland Muslims 
Saturday gathered to celebrate the Festival of the Sacrifice, the day after 
their most important worldwide religious event, with prayer and food. 
</P>
<P>
 For one family, the Karahlis from Northridge, the outing to Mile Square 
Regional Park was a chance for them to worship for the first time with members 
of the Orange County Muslim community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the largest gathering I've attended since I made the pilgrimage to 
Mecca about six years ago," said Osama Karahli, 45, who was enjoying a plate of 
cholas and shama kabab , seasoned garbanzo beans and kosher beef. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, Arwa, was dressed in a bright red "Gama," "Salva," and "Dupata." 
The outfit consisted of a long, draping, beaded linen shirt with matching baggy 
pants and a scarf. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's celebration of the holiday, also known as Eid al-Adha, began with 
early morning prayer and a sermon by Muzammil H. Siddiqi, the director of the 
Islamic Society of Orange County. Siddiqi recounted the story of Abraham, or 
Ibrahim, who offered his son as a sacrifice to God. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of this celebration is for us to renew our dedication to 
God by remembering what Abraham was willing to do for him," Siddiqi said. In 
the Koran and in the Bible, Abraham's son was spared and a ram was sacrificed 
in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration commemorated the day after Hajj, in which up to 1 million 
Muslims make a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, for weeklong prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This celebration is going on with Muslims throughout the world," said Saeed 
Khan, a member of the local Islamic society. "For three days starting today, 
families will worship together and eat traditional food." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year in Orange County, the celebration has grown," Siddiqi said. "We 
want the Eid to be considered an American religious event."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
UMBERG WON'T GAMBLE WITH TAINTED MONEY, RETURNS CONTRIBUTION 
</P>

Compiled by Times political writer Gebe Martinez, with contributions from staff

<P>
 Cashing out: Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove, the Democratic candidate 
for attorney general, recently did what no self-respecting politician likes to 
do -- give back campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg returned a $40,000 contribution from a Palm Springs casino owned by the 
Morongo Indian tribe after he learned that the operation's outside management 
team was served with federal indictments for allegedly operating illegal slot 
machines and skimming off the tribe's profits, said George Urch, Umberg's 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 No tribe members were indicted by federal officials, and the Morongo Indians 
are considering making another donation to Umberg from a tribal bank account 
not connected to the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg has received about $85,000 for his attorney general campaign from 
Native Americans in California unhappy with incumbent Republican Dan Lungren's 
attempts to regulate gambling on tribal lands, which are under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Standing by their man: Some Orange County Republican legislators have been 
among the spectators cramming into a Superior Court hearing room in Sacramento 
to watch the trial of Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) on bribery and 
political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblymen Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), whose district includes a large swath 
of South County, and Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) have been regulars, and state 
Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange) was spotted in the audience one recent day. 
</P>
<P>
 For the local legislators, it's been a chance to provide some moral support to 
Hill, whose district included a part of Orange County until reapportionment 
shifted the boundary lines at the beginning of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Lewis have been legislative colleagues of Hill's for more than a 
decade. Morrow, who has spent nearly every day at the trial, has known the 
embattled senator since both were freshmen in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as close to a brother as I can have," Morrow said. "He's family and he 
needs support. I think anyone else would do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Run again? Heck no!: Incumbency hasn't been rewarding for Mission Viejo 
politicians in the six years since the city incorporated. And now, two of the 
three incumbent council members eligible for the November city election say 
they won't seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Sharon Cody and Robert D. Breton say they will not be running 
again, leaving Mayor Susan Withrow as the only incumbent campaigning for 
reelection.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight incumbents who could have sought reelection in the last two races 
and the one coming up, six opted out. Another incumbent, former Councilman 
Norman P. Murray, was defeated at the ballot box in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives? Cody and Breton cited the demands placed by the job on their 
family lives. But they probably would have faced heavy criticism from potential 
campaign rivals and Councilman William S. Craycraft for allegedly overspending 
city funds on projects such as the city animal control shelter and the soccer 
training center used by the USA World Cup team.

 Gaddi-gate: Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez is finding out he may 
never live down the "purple pin" caper. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez caused a brouhaha at the recent funeral of former President Richard 
Nixon when his colleagues discovered Vasquez had secured invitations to the 
funeral for 94 of his closest friends and workers, and he also had been given a 
purple lapel pin that gave him entry to a private reception with the Nixon 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy was not forgotten last week at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace. Following a speech by former Vice President Dan Quayle, library 
director John H. Taylor quickly introduced a couple of elected officials in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "As always, because he's wearing his purple pin, our 3rd District supervisor, 
Gaddi Vasquez!" Taylor announced.

Brewer and Thomas G. Reinecke in the 70th Assembly District Republican primary, 
the GOP's local ethics committee decided it didn't have jurisdiction over most 
of the charges. The complaints alleged that the candidates had misrepresented 
themselves in their campaign mailers, but the committee only reviews statements 
made by one candidate against another. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee did consider one minor complaint by Brewer about a Reinecke 
brochure that claims: "All (of the GOP candidates) tried, but only Tom Reinecke 
won the endorsement of the California Republican Assembly." Brewer said she 
didn't seek the conservative group's backing. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethics committee ruled both of them were right: Brewer did not follow 
through in asking for the endorsement, but Reinecke "may have reasonably 
believed" Brewer was seeking the endorsement because she attended two 
candidates forums sponsored by the group. UPCOMING EVENTS

WHAT BEING A SCOUT IS ALL ABOUT; ANNUAL EVENT DRAWS 30,000 FOR A FULL DAY OF 
FUN AND EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Mile Square Regional Park became a land of adventure Saturday as droves of 
young boys in khaki and blue turned out to scuba dive, rappel from a tower and 
brave a rickety rope bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of the Scout-O-Rama, an annual outing sponsored by the Orange 
County Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Organizers estimated that 30,000 
Scouts, friends and relatives participated Saturday in what was described as 
the largest-ever turnout for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scout-O-Rama's always fun, it's always educational and it's always 
interesting," said Steve Woodyard of Cypress, the father of two Scouts: Nick, 
15, and Christopher, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities drew youngsters from across the county: Boy Scout troops and 
Cub Scout packs set up booths showing off such diverse skills as solar cooking, 
knot-tying, flagpole-building and rubber-band gun shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Troop 670, which the Woodyards belong to, had built a 
Ferris-wheel-like contraption that rapidly spun two youngsters at a time toward 
the ground and back up again. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign at the entrance warned: "Here lie the remains of the last Scout who 
didn't hold on tight." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' father said he thinks Scouting helps build future leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for the young Cub Scouts, especially, to come out here, because 
they can see what they can get from Scouting if they stick with it," Woodyard 
said. "They learn to do things for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 As the line for the Ferris wheel grew ever longer, dozens of kids raced to a 
row of fire engines. Firefighters from one truck had set up foam-spraying 
equipment and billows of silky, white bubbles spilled all over the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bubbles," the children shrieked, rolling in the foam and trying to throw 
handfuls of it on parents, who tried to keep their distance from the soggy 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The scuba diving instruction booth, new to this year's Scout-O-Rama, was 
another hot attraction. Youths watched a 12-minute video about scuba diving, 
then changed into swim trunks and hopped into a 2,000-gallon, three-foot tall 
pool of water.  
</P>
<P>
 Scout Tris Huffnagle of Troop 28 was eager to slip on a face mask and a yellow 
oxygen tank and take his first stab at scuba diving. But the experience was 
bracing for the 12-year-old. "The water's too cold," he said afterward, 
hurrying to find a towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the field in "Cub Scout Land," Janet Browne of Newport Beach sat in the 
shade of the Pack 330 booth, helping kids make colorful key chains with bottle 
openers attached. She said she is still just as thrilled about the Boy Scouts 
as when her family first got involved eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is marvelous," Browne said. "I just think it's a worthwhile family 
experience, individual experience and community experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "They get to meet kids from other communities when they come here," agreed 
Vikki Holmes, a Scout-O-Rama spokeswoman. "It gives them something positive to 
work toward instead of all the negative things out there."

BLAZE AT CONDO COMPLEX CAUSES $310,000 IN DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A four-alarm fire tore through four condominiums Saturday morning, leaving 
four families homeless and causing more than $300,000 in damage but no 
injuries, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze displaced at least a dozen people out of their homes and the Red 
Cross was working Saturday to find them temporary housing, said Capt. Dan Young 
of the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of an eight-unit building reported smelling smoke shortly after 11 
a.m. in the Casa Fina condominium complex off Antonio Parkway, Young said. The 
fire originated in a first-floor unit of the complex, on Santa Agatha, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze apparently started inside an electrical wall socket after a faulty 
can opener shorted out, Young said. It spread inside the wall until it reached 
the second floor. No one was home in the condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters estimate the blaze had been burning for at least three hours 
before they received the call, Young said. It took 70 firefighters with 20 
vehicles more than an hour to control the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The condominiums "had very unusual construction with lots of little 
cubbyholes," Young explained. Two one-bedroom condominiums and two two-bedroom 
units were damaged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural damage was estimated at $250,000 and the losses in contents 
amounted to about $60,000, he said.

80-MILE, HIGH-SPEED CHASE GETS DRIVER HOME, NOT FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A Costa Mesa man led police officers on an 85-m.p.h. chase through Orange and 
Los Angeles counties and was arrested early Saturday when he stopped in front 
of his own home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Bortel Davis, 29, was held on suspicion of felony evading arrest and was 
being held Saturday at the Huntington Beach Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He basically drove in one giant circle and came back to his house," said 
Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Mike Willett. 
</P>
<P>
 Six police cars and a helicopter closely trailed Davis for more than 80 miles, 
authorities said. There were no traffic accidents or injuries in the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:20 a.m., two officers in a patrol car saw Davis walking near Newland 
Street and Heil Avenue and wanted to talk to him because the area is known for 
chronic drug problems, Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officers got out of their car to question Davis, Willett said, "he just 
ran to his van, locked the doors and sped up Newland Avenue with his lights 
off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chase, Davis led police to the northbound San Diego Freeway, which 
he entered at Beach Boulevard, and drove into Los Angeles County on the 
northbound San Gabriel River Freeway, Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorist then switched to the eastbound Pomona Freeway. Next, he headed 
south on the Orange Freeway, east on the Riverside Freeway, then south on the 
southbound Costa Mesa Freeway before getting back on the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis got off the freeway at Harbor Boulevard, and drove to his home on 
Bermuda Drive in Costa Mesa, where other Huntington police officers were 
waiting for him just after 1:15 a.m., Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got out the van, Costa Mesa police officers "tackled him as he ran 
toward his house," Willett said.

SANTA ANA MAN KILLED DURING SEARCH FOR PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Santa Ana man was shot and killed while searching for a party 
Saturday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar Zazueta and a friend were invited to an after-hours party in an 
apartment complex at 2111 W. 17th St., Santa Ana police Officer Joseph Williams 
said. The pair was driving around the building about 3 a.m. attempting to 
locate the party when a lone gunman confronted them, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short conversation, the gunman shot Zazueta in the head and fled on 
foot, Williams said. It was not known why Zazueta was shot or whether any 
weapons were recovered, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no information on Zazueta's unidentified passenger and no 
description of the gunman.

WOMAN, 3 CHILDREN ESCAPE UNHARMED FROM HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman and her three children managed to escape unharmed from an early 
morning fire that began after the woman lit a cigarette near a propane camp 
heater she had been trying to fix in her bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The propane heater either was inadvertently left on or was leaking when Cindy 
Buettner lit a cigarette in the home, Westminster Fire Capt. Craig Campbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire started at about 6:15 a.m., Buettner woke her 7-year-old twin 
daughters and 4-year-old daughter, and the family ran out of the house. 
Firefighters arrived at the house at 6:22 a.m. and put the fire out in 15 
minutes, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural damage to the house, mostly to the bedroom, was estimated at 
$50,000, while damage to items inside was approximately $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Buettner had been working on the heater for a camping trip. The Orange County 
Red Cross provided food, clothing and shelter for the family.

IMMIGRANTS WARNED OF GANGS' DRAW FOR YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Language barriers, the struggle to earn a paycheck -- as if life in a foreign 
country was not daunting enough, immigrant parents also face the prospect of 
their children being snatched away by the lure of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spanish, they are called pandillas, but it is here in the United States 
where youth gangs flourish, with local monikers such as Val Verde 13 and 
Newhall 13. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 Latino parents met Saturday at Castaic Elementary School to learn 
about the pull gangs can have on their children in a Spanish-language seminar 
sponsored by the Los Angeles County Office of Education's Migrant Education 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are starting to ask, 'What happens when we lose control of our 
children? When they become aggressive and don't obey?' " said Eva Guzman, a 
Canyon Country mother of two and an organizer of a Santa Clarita Valley support 
group called United Mothers. ". . . Especially those who come from Mexico, who 
don't know the language of their children and don't know what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Although gangs in the Santa Clarita Valley are a much smaller problem than in 
other Southern California communities, law enforcement officials told parents 
there is still plenty to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of rival gangs in Val Verde and in Newhall is creating a generation 
of youngsters pitted against each other, say local Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The troublesomeness of gangs goes up and down here," Santa Clarita 
Councilwoman Jan Heidt told the parents at the seminar. "A lot of the Hispanic 
parents don't know what the kids are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for violence and drug use by young people who join gangs is what 
brought truck driver Jorge Martinez, who moved his family from Mexico to the 
United States six years ago. His four daughters range in age from 3 months to 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are girls and I didn't know that girls could be in gangs until I heard 
today," said Martinez, who is from Guadalajara. "I worry about them. I work 
long hours at my job and I might have to find other work so I can spend more 
time with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other Santa Clarita Valley residents, Martinez had hoped his family 
would be far removed from gang trouble common in urban neighborhoods of Los 
Angeles. But after the seminar, he said resignedly: "Even here there can be 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were alerted to the styles of dress worn by local gangs, were advised 
to keep a close eye on their children's friends and were urged to become more 
involved in their school work and activities. 
</P>
<P>
 William S. Hart High School Principal Lawrence Strauss said students can 
cement their gang affiliations as early as elementary school, especially if 
they are mirroring the behavior of older siblings or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three boys were fighting at the Santa Clarita Family Development Center and 
when a teacher broke it up, they told her they were part of a gang they called 
Los Primos," Strauss said. "The boys were 4 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep a closer watch, Guzman told parents to visit their children's school 
and volunteer their time even if they do not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 She told parents they are most responsible for laying down rules for the 
children to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 When her daughter, who is now 19, was flirting with joining a gang and began 
wearing only black gang garb, Guzman said she finally tossed out the clothes 
and refused to buy any more for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I won't have you dress like that,' " said Guzman. "Go to school 
naked, but I won't buy you any clothes like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Such discipline can work only when it is backed by demonstrations of love and 
caring, Guzman said. Her daughter finally passed that stage and is now entering 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to be a parent," Guzman said. "But you must never be afraid 
to come to your child's school to help. . . . Women who think they must only 
stay at home to work and wash need to come to school. Leave the wash for a 
day."

TRAFFIC COPS MAKING STOPS ON THE INFO HIGHWAY; COMPUTERS: 'FLAMERS' THREATENED 
TO SINK PART OF SANTA MONICA'S INNOVATIVE NETWORK, SO SOME E-MAIL MESSAGE AREAS 
ARE NOW BEING MONITORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica invited its residents to ride the information superhighway into 
City Hall. The resulting electronic traffic jam has officials scratching their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started five years ago when the city set up the pioneering Public 
Electronic Network, known as PEN, which allowed electronic communication 
between residents and their government. 
</P>
<P>
 From a home computer or 20 public terminals, residents could scan city staff 
reports, apply for business licenses or review electronic town hall postings. 
The system was so user-friendly that homeless residents tapped onto a public 
terminal and outlined their most pressing needs, leading to the establishment 
of a program that provides them with lockers, showers and a place to wash their 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that some overzealous users, known as "flamers," have 
monopolized debate on its most popular feature, conferences, a community 
bulletin board that invites users to vent on a range of topics such as 
homelessness, crime and development. Through vitriolic language and personal 
attacks on other users and city officials, the hard-core users have driven away 
many moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 Flamers' messages can be rambling, incoherent missives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, nobody is suggesting that the city pull the switch. Some 
"flaming" subsided after the city instituted a moderator who edits messages on 
city government topics for length and can block users who send them too 
frequently on the same subject.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great success, but it sure ain't what the founders intended," 
said Joe Schmitz, an assistant professor at the USC School of Business and an 
early consultant on the project. "These systems are creatures of the people who 
use them and PEN represents the rowdy, participatory, enfranchised nature of 
the Santa Monica community." 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities are following Santa Monica's lead. Diamond Bar recently 
implemented a system modeled after it and Glendale will go on-line by mid-June. 
West Hollywood is also considering such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the first two or three years of PEN's start-up, the system peaked at 
about 7,000 log-ons a month. Log-ons are recorded each time someone taps into 
the system using a password provided by the city. In the initial months, up to 
1,000 people a month plied the system. 
</P>
<P>
 But activity has dropped off since then, with many users disenchanted by the 
vitriol. City officials say the system averages 5,000 log-ons a month, with 
about 500 users. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many experts agree that the system has made local government more 
inclusive. Formerly passive residents from all classes and backgrounds have 
found it easy to participate in local government, and it has helped others keep 
better track of activities at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hill, a Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District board member, keeps 
abreast of city reports, public notices and the events calendar on his home 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's created a whole culture in the community that didn't exist before. You 
can contact people that you wouldn't ordinarily talk to," Hill said. "It's also 
made people more government literate. You can get facts and participate in the 
discussion in an informed way -- and that's empowering." 
</P>
<P>
 At Olympic High School, an alternative school, students use PEN to exchange 
electronic messages with city officials and with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Jack Casey says the system improves student's computer literacy skills 
while providing a motivation to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get most students to use a dictionary," Casey said. "But when 
they post a message electronically, it's out in public and then they look the 
word up." 
</P>
<P>
 When the city attorney received an electronic complaint about a misleading 
Radio Shack battery advertisement, a local retailer was forced to honor a 
customer commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 The system has helped streamline some sectors of government as people deal 
with City Hall from home: There have been shorter lines for applications at 
City Hall, fewer cars in the parking lot, and users say it seems city officials 
provide more thoughtful answers to E-mail queries than to letters. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the unruly juggernaut has expanded, so too have the project's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some think they can get on the system and say anything, any time, as often as 
they want -- that it's like a soapbox in Pershing Square or Hyde Park," said 
Ken Phillips, the originator of the program and former director of the city's 
Information Systems Department. "One or two people can log on, and by abusing 
free speech, can literally run the system into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips says his staff might have "missed the boat" in imposing control over 
the new arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is some control now. 
</P>
<P>
 By February, 1993, the city threatened to shut down some of PEN's conferencing 
bulletin board features. But the community uproar was so great that city staff 
members agreed to a compromise: Conference topic sections such as education, 
ideas and science were left free of control, but moderators were added to keep 
order on the electronic debate over more incendiary subjects, including 
homelessness, rent control, development and Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Messages on these topics go directly to the moderators, who scan for length 
and frequency limits before posting them. If a user repeatedly sends messages 
on the same item or refuses to trim it, the moderator simply returns the 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the compromise say the new rules are an imposition on free 
speech rights, a curb on Santa Monica's unique form of electronic expression. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keith Kurtz, director of the information systems department, says messages 
are only edited for length -- about a 400-word limit. And people who have 
logged-on repeatedly on the same topic are asked to curb their input to two 
messages per item per day. "There's no real content censorship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the city's efforts have spawned an uneasy peace. City officials and 
residents who had been turned off by the wild commentary have been more 
encouraged to partake in the moderated forums. And some "flamers" have moved on 
to other areas of discourse, such as as youth, vegetarian restaurants, space, 
religion, recipes and science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Roslyn Wythe, a moderator, said she recently had to curb a group of students 
who were sending messages threatening to beat each other up. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules, Kurtz said, are as far as a local government can go in 
constraining a public forum such as PEN. Analysts say private on-line services 
have more latitude in booting "flamers" and restricting message use and 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 With Santa Monica's system, Schmitz said, "the conflict between free speech 
and social responsibility is amplified. There's a paradox in that more 
participants are wanted, but if you give all these folks air time, you might 
not like what you see or hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Other legal conundrums have arisen. Experts wonder whether government should 
be providing free electronic mail and if so, what rights the government should 
have to those messages. Should city residents, moreover, have access to private 
communications on the public network through the Freedom of Information Act? 
</P>
<P>
 "No one seems to know," Phillips said.

 "Even though its more work for everyone, it's still worth it," she said. 
"Better to have more people involved -- that's what democracy is all about."

PORT POLICE OFFICERS PATROL ON LAND, SEA AND AIR; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE 
LITTLE-KNOWN, 55-MEMBER FORCE HELPS TO SAFEGUARD LIVES AND PROPERTY IN THE 
SPRAWLING HARBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a city swarming with law enforcement agencies, the Port Police may be the 
least-known cops who ever walked, drove, pedaled, flew or swam a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody has heard of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. Most people are probably aware of airport, transit 
and school police, not to mention local police departments from Burbank to El 
Segundo.  
</P>
<P>
 Except for those who live or work at the Port of Los Angeles, it's probably 
fair to say that most Angelenos have never heard of the Port Police. In fact, 
while South Bay residents may be aware that the Port of Los Angeles is one of 
the busiest commercial shipping ports in the world, people in Van Nuys or 
Pasadena or Beverly Hills tend to think that the port is some kind of marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's a teeming center of industrialism interspersed with pockets of 
recreational activity, 28 miles of waterfront where oil tank farms, lumber 
yards and auto storage facilities sit cheek by jowl with marinas and beaches 
and restaurants with harbor views. It's a place where freighters tie up near 
luxury cruise ships.  
</P>
<P>
 Every year more than $60 billion worth of goods pass through the port, bound 
to and from almost every country in the world. Every day about 50,000 people 
pour into the port area to work. For hundreds of others, the "live-aboards" in 
the more than 4,000 marina slips, the port is their permanent home. For others, 
the transients who sneak into container yards and set up housekeeping in empty 
shipping boxes, the port is a temporary home. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrolling and protecting all that are the Port Police, 55 sworn officers who 
patrol on land, in the air, on the water and even under the water. But you'll 
never read a book or see a movie in which the hero draws his gun and shouts, 
"Freeze! LAPP!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the best-kept secret in law enforcement," says Lt. Ronald Boyd, Port 
Police operations commander. 
</P>
<P>
 When he's working his special assignment beat, Port Police Officer Robert 
Myers doesn't come face to face with criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 He comes face to face with fish. 
</P>
<P>
 About twice a month, Myers and others on the Port Police dive team put on 
scuba gear and descend into the oily, silty, bacteria-rich black water of the 
Port of Los Angeles to search ships. Armed only with flashlights, and working 
in water where the visibility may be measured in inches, they creep slowly 
along the bottoms of boats, looking for stashes of drugs concealed in rudders 
or stabilizer tubes or sea chests, the large grated openings that serve as 
water intakes for engine cooling systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they find what they're looking for. A couple of years ago, for 
example, dive team members found 55 kilos of cocaine sealed in welded metal 
boxes hidden below the waterline on a freighter from South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "When everything around you is black and all you can hear is the sound of your 
breathing, it gets a little claustrophobic," says Myers, 36, an officer for the 
last dozen years, first with the Burbank Airport Police and for five years with 
the Port Police.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not exactly clean diving, either, particularly after a downpour sends 
every conceivable kind of bacteria and assorted other crud flowing through the 
storm drains and into the harbor. If the bacteria level is too high, the divers 
won't dive unless it's an emergency. They all carry mouthwash and 
anti-bacterial eardrops to reduce the risk of infection from a dive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-member dive team was formed in 1989. All its members are volunteers who 
work patrol or other duties but are called in when divers are needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Dive team members do ship searches -- in conjunction with the U.S. Customs 
Service -- rescues, underwater searches for contraband or evidence (such as 
weapons), even retrieval of Harbor Department equipment from the ocean bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until a few years ago, at least twice a year we'd get people and cars going 
into the water," says Lt. Martin Renteria, Port Police investigations and 
administration commander, who heads the dive team. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating under the Los Angeles Harbor Department, with an annual budget of 
about $6 million, the officers also protect the port and enforce environmental 
laws.  
</P>
<P>
 Burglaries, robberies, truck hijackings, domestic arguments in the marinas, 
car thefts, assaults, and traffic violations by boats and vehicles all part of 
the job. Port Police officers also perform foot and bike patrols in the Ports 
O' Call Village, a waterfront restaurant and retail complex; the World Cruise 
Center, the embarking point for cruise ships, and at the Cabrillo Beach 
recreation area. Port Police officers make about 175 arrests each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety and environmental duties are more unusual. Last year, Port Police 
officers conducted nearly 30,000 safety inspections in container terminals, oil 
tank farms and ships berthing at the port. They also check the channels and 
other harbor areas for illegal dumping or discharge of hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the people they serve, the port cops are doing a bang-up job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're great," says Damaris Rausch, manager of the California Yacht Marina 
in the eastern portion of the port. "Any time we've called they've gotten out 
here immediately. They always seem friendly, and they're very helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kleist, a spokesman for Evergreen shipping lines, one of the port's 
largest companies, agrees. "They're totally professional, extremely 
cooperative, well-motivated, well-directed."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite recurrent rumors that the Port Police would be absorbed by the Los 
Angeles Police Department, Boyd says it's not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "That rumor has been downgraded to even less than a rumor," he says. "This is 
our swimming pool, and we're going to continue to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most police officers, they feel underpaid: a non-supervisory officer 
makes about $2,800 to $3,200 a month. The salary is a sore point with most of 
them, as are the limited retirement and disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But most port officers say they wouldn't want to work anywhere else. They 
especially like the diversity of the job. "I like the flexibility," says 
Officer Daniel Aleman, a 13-year veteran. "For example, I'm a helicopter 
observer, I'm on the bike team, and I'm a senior patrol boat officer. This job 
allows us to wear a lot of different hats." 
</P>
<P>
 Aleman is an observer on the chopper, which is owned and operated by the city 
General Services Department. Aleman's mission is to check the water for signs 
of environmental contamination.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely not like being a forest ranger," says Port Police Officer 
Robert Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a five-year veteran who earlier worked as an airport police officer, 
is on routine patrol today, which means that he'll cruise through everything 
from container yards to junk yards toslag heaps to the marinas -- some upscale 
and some not -- that line the waterfront.  
</P>
<P>
 "People down here are pretty friendly," Reynolds says. Port Police Detective 
Ken Huerta remembers well the strangest thing that he's ever seen stolen by 
cargo thieves. It was an entire truckload of rubber adult toys. 
</P>
<P>
 It just goes to show you, Huerta says, that cargo thieves will steal anything. 
Cargo containers, also known as "cans," are the 20- to 40-foot metal boxes that 
can be transferred from a ship to a truck or rail car.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not uncommon for thieves to sneak into a freight yard somewhere in the 
vast industrial sections of the Los Angeles area, hot-wire a parked 
semi-tractor trailer and simply drive through a gate or crash a fence.  
</P>
<P>
 The thieves can be murderous. Last year, hijackers shot and killed a truck 
driver near Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, the drivers are in on it. A "broker" will approach a driver 
who's making $5 an hour, non-union, and offer him $5,000 to give up a truck and 
then report it stolen. Often, Huerta says, the broker gets the truck and pays 
the driver only $500 or so, if he pays him at all. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a huge business, probably the biggest criminal enterprise in Los Angeles, 
next to drug dealing. Container burglaries, in which the can is broken into in 
a yard and some of its contents taken, are a different category of crime. 
Huerta figures that every day in the Los Angeles area, about $1 million worth 
of goods are stolen or hijacked by cargo thieves.

WITH ITS NEW MYSTERY LODGE ATTRACTION ABOUT TO OPEN, KNOTT'S BERRY FARM PINS 
STRATEGY ON OUTSMARTING BIGGER RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half a century ago, the Knott family stapled brief messages to menus in the 
Chicken Dinner Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrons please note," they read. "Rumors we have sold out are being 
persistently circulated. We have NOT, nor is the place for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar rumors, coupled with quick and adamant denials, still surface 
periodically. But where the buzz was once fueled by the runaway success of 
Knott's Berry Farm, the recent whispers have centered on a merger or sale to a 
big corporation after three years of weak attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 As the old Ghost Town enters its 54th summer, Knott's struggles to compete as 
the lone family-run theme park in Southern California surrounded by four larger 
and much better funded theme parks owned by entertainment or consumer products 
conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate-owned attractions, including Disneyland nearby, spend tens of 
millions each year for new rides and advertising campaigns. By contrast, 
Knott's new attractions of late have been relatively meager, it has reduced its 
executive ranks and downsized plans to spread the Knott's name worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Readying a comeback, Knott's is set to officially unveil a special-effects 
show called Mystery Lodge on Saturday. It is the park's most ambitious 
undertaking since the recession hit California in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it, Knott's hopes to regain ground in the theme park wars by 
outsmarting, if not outspending, its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find ourselves in a business that is incredibly dominated by media and 
communications giants. It leaves us as one of the last independent amusement 
parks in a major market -- and probably at a competitive disadvantage," said 
Darrel Anderson, one of the founders' grandsons and a former board chairman. 
"But we have carved out a niche (for) family, wholesome entertainment that is 
still in demand." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery Lodge is the kind of attraction Knott's executives hope will land 
their prime target audience: young parents and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the barn-size, wood-covered building bedecked with totem poles, guests 
will hear an actor portraying a mystical Canadian Indian who spins stories as 
images waft from the smoke of a simulated campfire and fly around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, a storytelling attraction is hardly conventional in an industry 
dominated by white-knuckle roller coasters and gut-wrenching ride simulators. 
But that's OK by Knott's President Terry E. Van Gorder, who explained that he 
wanted something that would set Knott's apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a celebration of the human spirit, of the magic and mystery of life," 
said Van Gorder, who became enthralled when he saw a forerunner of this 
attraction at the Expo '86 world's fair in Vancouver, Canada. "It dwells on the 
family, the need for bonding of one generation to the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being different, Mystery Lodge is significantly less expensive than 
most theme park attractions. It cost $10 million, compared to the estimated $60 
million that Universal Studios spent last year on its "Back to the Future" 
simulation ride and the like amount that Disneyland is reportedly paying out to 
create an "Indiana Jones Adventure" ride opening next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to be outgunned 5 to 1. Now it is more like 10 or 15 to 1," Van 
Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery Lodge may be a relative bargain, but it is a strategic risk. No one 
knows whether children will bug their parents to take them to hear an Indian 
storyteller. Mystery Lodge adds another Native American-themed attraction to 
the park where the last, an "Indian Trails" crafts village of two summers ago, 
did not spur much additional attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 It also breaks a basic rule of theming an amusement park: Put an attraction 
into a familiar or popular setting. In a park that built its reputation on the 
Old American West, Mystery Lodge will ask that visitors imagine themselves 
sitting around a tribal campfire in Alert Bay, British Columbia -- north of 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gorder dismisses those concerns. The story, he said, is universal. As for 
Knott's Western image, he said, "The culture of the West should be a strong 
part of the Knott's experience, but not the whole part. They don't make that 
many cowboy movies anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Knott's can't afford many duds. The recession has been so hard on 
the park that Van Gorder refers to it as "the depression." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Park institution has fallen in popularity along with other Southland 
parks when compared to the nation's other theme parks. Knott's ranked ninth 
last year, with 3.7 million in attendance, according to an annual listing by 
the trade magazine Amusement Business in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's was listed behind MCA's Universal Studios-Hollywood and 
Anheuser-Busch's Sea World of California in San Diego. It was ahead of Time 
Warner's Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia. And, as usual, all trailed Walt 
Disney Co.'s Disneyland in Anaheim, which was second in the nation last year 
with 11.4 million visitors -- just behind its sister park, Walt Disney World in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 For Knott's, "it is harder for them each year," said Dennis Speigel, a 
theme-park consultant in Cincinnati. "The bigger companies can market smarter. 
They can buy advertising cheaper. And out there in California, advertising has 
to be your biggest cost outside of labor." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been talk of a merger with or buyout by Walt Disney Co., Marriott 
Corp. or more recently, Paramount Communications. But the family will hear none 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will never happen," said Virginia Knott Bender, a daughter of founders 
Walter and Cordelia Knott. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy has taken its toll on all local parks, but Knott's has largely 
stayed profitable because, in keeping with its founders' frugal ways, it is 
virtually debt-free. The $200-million operation has been helped, too, by steady 
growth in the family's packaged foods division and products like premium ice 
creams and Nutrasweet-sweetened boysenberry preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the theme park is the core business, and it sets the pace of the 
company. "We've had earthquakes, floods, a poor economy, companies moving out 
of the state, riots, murders -- so many things," said Bender, 80, who works 
around her gift shop at the park. All of them, she said, have affected 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the visitor count is down, Van Gorder said he has been holding off 
from launching major new projects, or replacing outdated rides. 
</P>
<P>
 To change that, the Knotts are proceeding with a new five-year plan that will 
add, among other things, a third roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is still plenty to build on. Knott's is one of the region's most 
beautifully landscaped amusement parks; founder Walter Knott planted many of 
the trees himself. It has the best-quality food of any park in the nation, 
according to one poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most of all, it has a certain earnestness, a lack of pretension, that 
sets it apart from the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a place where you can still see a miniature Ferris wheel made of 
toothpicks, feel the heartbeat of a desperado who was supposedly buried alive 
in Boot Hill, or sample a funnel cake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such simple pleasures reflect the humble roots of the Knott family. The Berry 
Farm grew from a roadside stand where Walter Knott and his bride scratched out 
a living on 20 acres. To supplement their berry sales, Cordelia started serving 
chicken dinners on her wedding china in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was so successful that Walter started hauling in desert 
shanties to create a Ghost Town in 1940. A history buff, Knott wanted to keep 
guests occupied while they waited for a table. 
</P>
<P>
 The park kept growing, and by 1968 the Knotts finally put a fence around it 
and started charging admission. 
</P>
<P>
 While remaining sentimental, Knott's has adopted innovative marketing methods 
to attract crowds to the 150-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
 A monthlong Halloween Haunt, in which workers dress up as ghouls and the rides 
are re-themed to be scary, sells out every year. Other parks have tried to 
emulate it without similar success. Knott's is also a leader in ethnic 
marketing -- from a gospel choir day to Fiesta Filipino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our niche is counter, in a way, to the other theme parks," Van Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's distinctive path is largely the work of Van Gorder, a Yale-educated 
veteran theme park executive who is probably best known around the farm for 
having the foresight to create a dinosaur attraction before the first T-Rex 
smashed through "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 His vision came in a visit to the fossil-laden Museum of Natural History in 
Los Angeles in the early 1980s where he saw people snatching up dinosaur books 
in the gift shop. The result was Knott's Kingdom of the Dinosaurs ride, which 
cost a mere $2.6 million to develop but brought in droves of new visitors to 
the park in the summer of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gorder also landed the "Peanuts" comic strip clan as the icons of Knott's 
Berry Farm, where previously the only signature characters were gunfighters and 
sourdoughs. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been disappointments too. Knott's started a three-unit Mrs. 
Knott's restaurant chain, which so far has been a limited success. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Knott's was geared up to build and operate theme parks 
around the globe. There were a few bites in the Far East, and one in 
Indianapolis, but none materialized. The strategy fell by the wayside as the 
recession deepened -- and more than a dozen top executives have since departed 
in the consequent downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, however, one benefit of the expansion effort -- Knott's Camp Snoopy 
inside the Mall of America near Minneapolis. Knott's reaps royalties and 
management fees from the Minnesota operation, while the profits go to the mall 
developers who paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, the Knott family has never lost sight of what they 
affectionately call "the farm." It's been a quarter century since the last 
agricultural crop was planted there -- rhubarb as a side dish for the chicken 
dinners -- but family members believe they can find a way through the heady 
competition and provide for future Knotts generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still home," Anderson said in an interview in his Lido Island home. 
"There is tremendous opportunity there." Amusement Parks 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with declining attendance, Knott's Berry Farm is striving to maintain 
its foothold among the top 10 amusement parks in the nation. 1993 attendance 
figures in millions: 03,42,12,11 % change Park Attendance from 1992 Walt Disney

JAMES FLANIGAN: PENNIES FROM HEAVEN HAVE INNOVATORS LOOKING UP

<TEXT>
<P>
 All in one quick motion, the nurse placed the instrument just inside the 
sleeping patient's ear, then withdrew it and read the temperature. Sensors in 
the thermometer had taken two seconds to measure the infrared radiation emitted 
from the patient's ear canal and convert it to an accurate reading of the 
body's temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it earthly reward. The infrared sensor, a considerable advance from 
earlier thermometers, is now in widespread use because the space program years 
ago developed an Infrared Astronomy Satellite telescope to determine the 
temperatures of planets and stars. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Pasadena research center responsible for 
unmanned space exploration, passed on key technology for the thermometer to 
Diatek Corp. of San Diego, a small private company that participates in JPL's 
technology affiliates program. 
</P>
<P>
 Diatek, a 22-year-old company that also makes conventional thermometers, found 
a ready market for the $400 infrared model in the treatment of children, as 
well as critical care and geriatric patients. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good example of the government's gold mine of technology yielding 
commercial opportunity -- and it's not an isolated example, either. There are 
53 companies in JPL's technology affiliates program. In return for a small 
investment, they get a chance to work with advanced science and scientists to 
develop new products and processes. Other government labs have similar 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Private industry, too, is trying to boost innovation: Xerox Corp. set up Xerox 
Technology Ventures four years ago to develop bright ideas that were being 
smothered inside the $16-billion-in-sales company. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on is sometimes called technology transfer or defense conversion, 
usually referring to big projects that never quite work -- aircraft factories 
trying to make trains or buses, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a smaller scale, technology transfer is working, thanks to a blossoming 
of entrepreneurial attitudes in both industry and government. Exciting things 
are happening. 
</P>
<P>
 At JPL, a complex refrigeration system developed for ballistic missile sensors 
is being adapted by Aerojet, the Downey rocket propulsion company, to 
air-condition Los Angeles' forthcoming Green Line trains. The environmentally 
sound process will convert heat from the train's braking system. 
</P>
<P>
 JPL, which pioneered the science of re-creating computerized pictures from 
outer space, is also working with two Los Angeles start-up companies, American 
Digital Imaging and Principia Optics, on a digital movie camera and projection 
system that could revolutionize filmmaking and exhibition. Stanford University 
and the Sarnoff Institute have joined the effort. Laser technology for the 
projection system comes from the Lebedev Institute, a major laboratory of the 
former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology has always been there, but a new approach has sprung it loose.  
</P>
<P>
 "We used to be passive, put the information out there in scholarly papers and 
hope someone would use it," says James Rooney, a physicist who manages JPL's 
affiliates program. "Nobody did. So we have an outreach program. We ask 
companies about their problems and see if we have technical capabilities to 
address those needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Xerox Technology Ventures was also born of frustration, following publication 
in 1989 of "Fumbling the Future," a book relating how Xerox Corp. had let basic 
technology of both the personal computer and the laser printer slip out of its 
research lab and benefit other companies, notably Apple Computer and 
Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
 As Robert Adams, Xerox Ventures president tells it, David Kearns, then Xerox 
Corp. chairman, and current Chairman Paul Allaire, were determined not to lose 
out again. So they gave him $30 million to set up a venture capital subsidiary. 
Employees with good ideas who were getting turned down for funding within Xerox 
were encouraged to go to Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 One who did was Dennis Stemmle, a Xerox inventor with 60 patents and an idea 
for a portable copier that could be converted to a fax or printer. Stemmle was 
able to develop the copier at Xerox Ventures with the help of $3.5 million from 
Adams, who also raised $3 million from other U.S. venture capital firms and 
$3.5 million from Taiwan business people. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is Quadmark Ltd., a Rochester, N.Y., company that began selling the 
portable copier in April. Quadmark predicts sales of 250,000 copiers in the 
first 12 months and ultimately a market of 1 million copiers a year, worth 
roughly $200 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's only one of Xerox Ventures' start-ups. Adams, now 62, has invested 
the $30 million and has nine companies, in businesses ranging from computer 
software to document binding, with sales of more than $100 million and a total 
value approaching $250 million. Values will become clearer in the next few 
years as the companies go public. 
</P>
<P>
 The essential element, more important than technology, was risk. "I made them 
sign statements acknowledging they had no job to return to at Xerox," says 
Adams. "In each company, I told them if this effort sinks, you sink with it. 
They yelled at each other, but they worked together and made the companies 
fly." 
</P>
<P>
 People are the key at JPL as well. "Nobody in federal laboratories knows 
markets," says Rooney. So JPL is reaching out to entrepreneurs. James Foster, 
chairman of American Digital Imaging, put up $500,000 of his own and raised $3 
million for the camera's development from Stanford and the Sarnoff Institute. 
Michael Tiberi, president of Principia Optics, raised $350,000 from relatives 
and private investors and has secured $200,000 in backing from Sony. 
</P>
<P>
 To work with JPL, companies invest $25,000 to $50,000 in the affiliates 
program, then pay expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But do such investments and payments constitute an adequate return on, say, 
the $1.2-billion cost of the infrared astronomy telescope? No, and they are not 
meant to. We finance a space program to explore space. The affiliates program 
is a way to get a further dividend for the taxpayer by giving a helping hand to 
U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest dividend, however, is not in the speed of the infrared 
thermometer or the ingenuity of digital cameras. It is in this new pattern of 
decentralized, innovative product development. It is a pattern that spurs drive 
and ingenuity and plays to real strengths of American business.

JENNY CRAIG TAKES A POUNDING; LIFESTYLE: A 43% DROP IN NEW CUSTOMERS FOR THE 
WEIGHT-LOSS CHAIN SIGNALS A SHIFTING ATTITUDE TOWARD DIETING. 
</P>

<P>
 The surest way to measure losses at Jenny Craig Inc.'s chain of diet centers 
is not with a scale but a calculator. The diet craze has cooled, and with it 
the fortunes of a company that grew fat selling Americans on thinness. 
Beginning in 1985, founders Sid and Jenny Craig built the company into a 
weight-loss empire with more than 650 centers nationwide. Sales grew tenfold, 
to $467 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Jenny Craig is itself on a diet. The Del Mar, Calif.-based company is 
closing more than 30 centers to stem losses that came to $8.7 million for the 
first three months of this year. The company reports that the number of new 
clients signing up for the program during that time was down 43%. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's upper management has been in turmoil. Jenny Craig has lost two 
presidents, a chief financial officer and a marketing vice president since 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further sign of problems, the Craigs' children are getting out of the 
business. According to company documents filed last week, the four offspring 
and their spouses are selling unprofitable franchises in California, Florida 
and Texas back to the company.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the losses are related to his decision to sell the 13 franchises he 
owns with Jenny Craig's daughter, Denise Altholz, son-in-law Walter Altholz 
said, "What do you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Craig, it increasingly appears, is a company out of step with changed 
consumer attitudes toward fat -- and unsure what to do about it. Industry 
analysts say consumers in the 1990s are more concerned about nutrition and 
health than their appearance, the focus of the Jenny Craig program. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationwide recession and the economy's slow recovery are worsening the 
company's problems. Dieters trying to reduce expenses are avoiding the program, 
which carries weekly costs of $7 for counseling sessions and between $50 and 
$75 for Jenny's Cuisine, the prepackaged food accounting for 90% of the 
company's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Chairman Sid Craig said the company's future lies in 
shifting its emphasis from weight loss to "lifestyle management" -- a concept 
that stresses health as well as looks. Sid Craig didn't offer any specifics, 
and he and Jenny Craig, the firm's vice chairwoman, would not be interviewed 
for this story. ("They're not in the mood," said Ron Iori, a spokesman for the 
company.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview, the company's new president and chief executive, C. 
Joseph LaBonte, talked about the possibility of "leveraging the Jenny Craig 
name," but did not say how he might do so. LaBonte allowed that Jenny Craig 
Inc. might seek a tie-in with a health insurer, a notion executives at the 
company have bandied about for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Craig's problems are not unique. Rival Nutri/System, which also sells 
prepackaged foods, has recently emerged from bankruptcy with fewer centers and 
under new ownership. Weight Watchers International, a unit of Heinz Inc., said 
business is beginning to pick up after falling 20% during the last three months 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, companies running commercial weight-loss centers are expected to show 
a 10% revenue drop this year, according to Marketdata Enterprises, a research 
firm following the weight-loss industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans still care about their weight. After all, "In the Kitchen With 
Rosie," a book written by the chef who helped talk show host Oprah Winfrey lose 
weight, is a bestseller. But experts say consumers care more about maintaining 
a healthy weight than achieving svelteness. 
</P>
<P>
 In various surveys, Americans in the '90s say they are eating more and 
exercising less than they did in the 1980s. The percentage of overweight people 
on diets is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Among dieters, low-fat foods widely available in supermarket cases are gaining 
in popularity over prepackaged meals sold through structured programs such as 
Jenny Craig, according to a 1993 survey by the Calorie Council, an industry 
group. New government food labeling rules will make it easier for grocery 
shoppers to choose low-fat, low-calorie meals on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Craig's rivals have already taken steps to adjust to new consumer 
attitudes, though it is too soon to know whether the programs are working. 
Nutri/System, for example, has teamed up with health care giant Johnson & 
Johnson to offer "wellness" programs that deal with overall health. It also 
sells a line of skin creams. 
</P>
<P>
 Weight Watchers is billing itself as "the health care plan that works," and 
talks about the health risks of obesity. Besides selling magazines, cookbooks 
and Weight Watchers brand food, the company is testing a telephone service for 
do-it-yourself dieters who want menus and tips but don't want to attend weekly 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of Jenny Craig's latest marketing drive is a 30-minute 
infomercial that has been airing in Los Angeles and other big cities. Actor 
Dick Van Patten, a friend of the Craigs, lobs friendly questions at Jenny Craig 
and is appropriately stunned when six dieters describe how they lost weight 
eating Jenny's Cuisine. One woman tells how happy her husband is with her new 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 In the infomercial, Jenny Craig does make several references to lifestyle 
themes. "It's not a diet," she says at one point. "It's about changing 
behaviors in lifestyle." At another point, she lists diseases associated with 
obesity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jenny Craig Inc. continues in the main to market its standard program, 
which involves weekly individual weight counseling sessions and purchases of 
Jenny's Cuisine. The company advises clients to exercise, but it has no formal 
exercise program. Like its chief competitors, it performs no medical 
evaluations. About 90% of its clients are women. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients are encouraged to eat Jenny's Cuisine at every meal. The costs can be 
staggering. Clients on the plan for four months can pay as much as $1,312 for 
the program. That works out to $82 a pound for people losing a pound a week, 
the average weight loss the company says clients can expect. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of its history, the company has been on a growth binge. The Craigs 
met in 1970 when Sid hired Jenny to manage a chain of fitness clubs. They 
married in 1979, sold the fitness clubs to a subsidiary of Nutri/System and 
moved to Australia, where they started Jenny Craig Inc. They opened their first 
U.S. center in 1985 and went public in 1991. The company has 650 centers in the 
United States and nearly 800 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as a year ago, Jenny Craig announced plans to accelerate its 
expansion, opening 100 new centers in 1993 and 1994. In aging baby boomers, it 
saw a growing demand for weight-loss services. Those plans are now on hold amid 
signs that the market may have reached the saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, the company has acquired at least 87 centers from 
franchisees -- 72 of them from the Craigs' children -- a sign that some 
independent operators are having difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 In documents made public last week, the company disclosed that it is buying 
back 31 franchises from four money-losing companies owned by the children. 
Taken together, the four companies lost $1.2 million in 1993, though 19 of the 
individual centers made money. 
</P>
<P>
 The children received no cash for the franchises, according to the documents. 
Instead, the company is assuming the franchises' liabilities and canceling debt 
owed it. According to the sale agreements, Jenny Craig Inc. is canceling a 
total debt of $1.64 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview, Scott Craig said he and his sister, Susan Craig McKenna, 
are selling their 10 Florida franchises because there's no room left to grow in 
his Tampa, Fla., franchise territory and he wants to try a new business outside 
the weight-loss field. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was making a million dollars, of course I'd keep it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Altholz said from his office in Houston that he also plans to start a 
business unrelated to weight loss and that his wife wants to spend more time 
with their two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Craig's daughter and son-in-law, Michelle and Duayne Weinger, are 
selling eight Northern California franchises. In 1992, the Weingers sold 41 
Northern California franchises to the company, receiving about $9 million for 
them, $6 million in the form of a canceled debt due the company and $2.7 
million in assumed liabilities. They couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Sitrick, a spokesman for Jenny Craig Inc., said the company is buying 
back the children's franchises to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, 
since the company is providing unspecified "enhancements" to its franchisees. 
The children have owned some of the franchises since at least 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview five days before the buybacks became public, LaBonte, 
asked if the company had recently repurchased any franchises, said, "We don't 
have a plan to buy back franchises." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's rapid expansion is one point of contention in a 1992 shareholder 
lawsuit still pending in U.S. District Court in San Diego. The suit claims that 
at the time of its October, 1991, public offering, the company knew the market 
for diet clinics had become saturated but went ahead with expansion plans to 
boost revenue and create the illusion that Jenny Craig was a prosperous 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 In public documents, the company has denied the allegations. Neither side in 
the dispute responded to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The company faces other difficulties. Without admitting guilt, the company 
disclosed last week that it has agreed to pay $10 million and distribute to 
former clients discount coupons for Jenny's Cuisine to settle a class action 
lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court claiming the diet lead to gall bladder 
disease. The company's insurance carrier is covering only $6 million of the 
settlement.  
</P>
<P>
 An administrative complaint from the Federal Trade Commission alleging false 
advertising is pending against the company. The FTC contends that Jenny Craig 
ads misled consumers into believing it is easy to keep the weight off. In 
public documents, the company contends that it warns consumers that individual 
results may vary. 
</P>
<P>
 Weight Watchers is fighting a similar FTC action. Nutri/System has settled 
with the agency, agreeing to modify its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC allegations raise consumer doubts about the success of the program and 
others like it, according to analysts. Consumer Reports fueled those doubts 
last June, when it surveyed participants of leading weight-loss programs and 
declared it found no evidence that the programs worked in the long run. The 
magazine said that former Jenny Craig clients surveyed said they had regained 
half the weight in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its problems, Jenny Craig Inc. isn't on the ropes. Though its 
difficulties have dwindled its cash to $14.5 million in March from $26.1 
million nine months ago, it remains debt free. The company has continued paying 
its regular dividend, which totaled $16.3 million last year. More than half 
went to an entity controlled by the Craigs. The couple control 60% of Jenny 
Craig stock, and each earned a salary of $500,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is apparently attractive to Bally Manufacturing Corp. Chief 
Executive Arthur Goldberg, who purchased 1.3% of Jenny Craig shares last month. 
The purchase briefly fueled speculation that Bally's, the nation's largest 
fitness chain operator, might buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
 But LaBonte said there have been no discussions of any transaction or 
partnership with Bally's and that Goldberg made the purchase as an investment. 
There are no indications the Craigs intend to sell, although Seidler Cos. 
analyst Ron Rotter said an alliance between Bally and Jenny Craig would make 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the company's problems have had an impact is in the executive suite. 
Last December, Ronald E. Gerevas quit as president with a year left on his 
$375,000-a-year contract, saying he was frustrated that Sid Craig wouldn't give 
him a free hand to make changes. Gerevas said that when he joined the company 
in 1991, he had assumed the Craigs would spend more time on leisure activities, 
including raising their prize-winning thoroughbred racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sid decided, with all the toys he had to play with, to come back to the 
company," said Gerevas, who is now vice chairman of the U.S. board of 
SpencerStuartInternational Search Consultants, based in Los Angeles. He said he 
nonetheless has high regard for the Craigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sid Craig replaced Gerevas with his former rival, ex-Nutri/System President 
Albert DiMarco. DiMarco left abruptly in March for what the company has 
described as personal reasons. He is running a chain of Italian restaurants in 
New Jersey. He did not respond to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte, a Palos Verdes Estates investor, is no stranger to entrepreneurial 
bosses. He resigned as chief operating officer of 20th Century Fox in 1982, 
shortly after its then-owner, billionaire Marvin Davis, sold the resorts and 
bottling company LaBonte ran. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, LaBonte joined Reebok as president and chief operating officer, No. 2 
to co-founder Paul Fireman. Charged with disciplining the shoe company's 
freewheeling management style, LaBonte quit three years later amid complaints 
that his organization charts had taken the fun out of Reebok. The management 
structure LaBonte imposed on Reebok has been dismantled, and two companies 
acquired on his watch have been sold as money-losers. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte said his contract with Jenny Craig Inc. gives him specific duties and 
he is satisfied. "It is a partnership here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Sid Craig said he chose LaBonte as president and chief 
executive in part because of his corporate experience, especially at Reebok, 
where, as at Jenny Craig Inc., most customers are women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe felt Jenny Craig has the opportunity to transition its core business from 
weight loss to lifestyle management," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte said he envisions a "focused lifelong program" that moves successful 
dieters into a maintenance program. The program isn't yet in place, though the 
company does sell what it calls lifestyle audiotapes as part of a $219 
weight-loss package that also includes weight-maintenance counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte interprets polls indicating that more Americans are overweight as a 
sign that potential demand for weight-loss programs is increasing. A 1993 Louis 
Harris & Associates poll found that 66% of Americans are overweight, up from 
61% in 1991. The same poll also showed that 33% of Americans exercise 
strenuously, a four-point drop from 1991 and a six-point drop in the percentage 
of Americans avoiding fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 America is getting heavier. Said Seidler Cos. analyst Rotter: "All Jenny Craig 
needs to get humming is a change in the thinking among people about losing 
weight." Feast and Famine 
</P>
<P>
 The performance of Del Mar, Calif.-based Jenny Craig Inc. has sagged amid a 
dip in Americans' enthusiasm for dieting.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JOSE DE LA TORRE: MEXICO IS UNLIKELY TO RETREAT FROM 
A DECADE OF RAPID PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSE DE LA TORRE, JOSE DE LA TORRE is a professor of international business 
strategy in UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management and director of the 
university's Center for International Business Education and Research.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent events in Mexico -- the revolt in Chiapas, executive kidnapings and the 
assassination of the leading presidential candidate -- have understandably 
spooked international investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In April alone, more than $3 billion in short-term capital flowed out of 
Mexican securities and the stock market took a 5.2% plunge. Doubts are being 
expressed as to whether Ernesto Zedillo, who took up the ruling party's banner 
to run in the August presidential elections, is up to leading the nation. There 
is a great deal of confusion surrounding the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio in March -- and a lack of confidence as to whether justice will 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 In financial circles, there is also fear that the government may be forced to 
reinflate the economy in anticipation of the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cassandras are wrong. The transformation taking place in Mexico in the 
last decade is monumental -- and largely irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-1980s Mexico was characterized by trade barriers that shielded domestic 
business from foreign competition. The state subsidized products from tortillas 
to public transport, at huge costs. More than 7% of all the credit created in 
the banking system during the late 1970s went to finance deficits in public 
enterprises, which numbered more than 1,200 by 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 While the economic growth rate was high -- real growth in gross domestic 
product averaged 6.5% between 1965 and 1980 -- inflation averaged 11.8% 
annually. The built-in inefficiencies of protected industries worsened income 
inequities and produced massive trade deficits. Foreign debt went from 9% to 
50% of GDP between 1970 and 1982, mainly to pay for consumption and poor 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 After the crash of 1982, Mexico began a long and painful process of 
transformation. From a level of nearly 15% of its GDP in 1986, Mexico's fiscal 
deficit was erased entirely by last year. Tax rates were simplified, the tax 
base was broadened and a start at weeding out corruption was made. The rich 
lost their tortilla subsidies. Average tariffs were reduced from 34% to 4% and 
other trade restrictions were nearly eliminated. As a result, the inflation 
rate dropped to 8% in 1993 from 160% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, foreign corporations rushed into Mexico as regulations were 
liberalized, and the modernization of financial markets attracted individual 
and institutional investors to a booming Bolsa index. Fully 65% of these funds 
were channeled into productive enterprises. The number of public enterprises 
was reduced to 206 by 1993. The North American Free Trade Agreement served to 
consolidate these gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is in the social arena that many of the more dramatic changes have 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The "lost decade" of the 1980s left more than 17 million people -- nearly a 
fifth of Mexico's population -- subsisting below the poverty line. President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari's "solidarity" program, in reaction, earmarked more 
than $2.5 billion for infrastructure investments, and social spending has 
increased from 32% to 50% of the budget during his term.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, more than 150,000 local committees have been formed to plan and 
execute projects that have brought clean water, electricity and sewers to 
millions of people. In addition, 1.8 million deeds were issued to farmers for 
their property. While that obviously was not enough -- judged by the Chiapas 
uprising -- one can only ask what would have occurred in the absence of such 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, the Salinas administration has two major responsibilities. One 
is to guarantee the integrity of the electoral process. A recent request for 
"technical assistance" from the United Nations and an invitation for foreign 
observers as witnesses -- both unthinkable just a few months ago -- indicate 
the seriousness with which the government takes this duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' second, more difficult task: to ensure that justice is done in the 
pursuit of Colosio's assassins. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough challenges will remain for the next administration as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The social pact signed in 1987 among government, labor and industry kept 
inflation low by controlling prices, wages and the exchange rate. Mexico's next 
president will face a sluggish economy that has yet to bear fruit for the 
majority of people. Real wages, for example, are still at 82% of their 1980 
level; they must rise soon. Social spending in the provinces must increase, 
perhaps backed by more than $3 billion in banking and telecommunications shares 
still held by the government -- and, if that is not enough, by privatizing the 
electrical power and oil monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
 The stability of the peso was central to the pacto de solidaridad, but now it 
has become a drag on the economy. The strong peso has damaged export industries 
and shifted investment toward non-trading sectors. A rapid slide in the peso's 
value could be Salinas' going-away present to his successor, in the manner 
typical of outgoing Mexican administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the consequences of a process of change that aims to accomplish in 
10 years what has taken 50 or more elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, opportunities for foreign -- particularly U.S. -- investors and 
exporters are bullish. Already, many foreign firms have begun to redefine their 
North American operations to include Mexico, a shift nowhere more evident than 
in the automotive industry. 
</P>
<P>
 When General Motors Corp. moved production of its Cavalier models from Mexico 
to Lansing, Mich., it also announced a $1-billion plan to build a plant in 
Mexico that would turn out more than 250,000 light trucks a year. Ford Motor 
Co. is increasing investments in various plants in Mexico, yet it estimates 
that U.S. exports of finished automobiles will rise to more than 25,000 this 
year from fewer than 2,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mexico's real business transformation is just beginning. Wal-Mart and 
Pepsico will dramatically alter patterns of competition and bring economies of 
scale to retailing and distribution. A TRW affiliate's introduction of reliable 
credit rating systems will help reduce the cost of mortgages and consumer 
credit by unleashing a market of 85 million eager consumers. Participants in 
the telecommunications industry will share in a $3-billion modernization 
program over the next five to seven years. Manufacturers will find a large work 
force willing to learn new skills. 
</P>
<P>
 An old Spanish saying holds that fishermen profit in turbulent waters. Perhaps 
the real risk to U.S. business would come from not casting a net.

 Imagine you're a real estate broker with a maddeningly picky customer. Your 
client wants a one-story building with 100,000 square feet of open space, 
parking for 150 cars, two loading docks, double-height ceilings and 
high-voltage power connections. And, oh yes, it must be close to a freeway.

 Standard practice had been to flip pages in a loose-leaf binder, where 
properties were listed first by square footage. That might produce 100 sites, 
which would then have to be sorted through for the remaining criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based American Industrial Real Estate Assn. set out some time 
ago to find a better way. The result is a simple computer database and search 
program that includes all property listings of member brokers, who tap into 
this wealth of information by computer and modem. 
</P>
<P>
 If markets once consisted of paper and brokers waving hands, these days they 
are more often the purview of silicon chips and disk drives. To get to them, 
companies and governments are increasingly making important information 
available on line -- not only text, but pictures too -- speeding these details 
in electronic form over phone lines 24 hours a day.  
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 53,000 public dial-up bulletin boards operating in 
North America today, according to Boardwatch magazine, a quirky journal of the 
trade. Once the province of low-rent nerds and budding electronic pornography 
vendors, computerized bulletin boards -- BBS for short -- are now 
well-established as a mainstream business tool. 
</P>
<P>
 They excel at making lots of information manageable and accessible from 
anywhere. Realtors, travel agents, conference planners, convention bureaus, 
flower growers, investors, manufacturers, advertising agencies, graphic 
artists, movie studios, newsletter services and government departments are 
practicing electronic commerce on bulletin boards or, more broadly, on-line 
communication services. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be cheap and easy.  
</P>
<P>
 "We call it the $100 technology," says Troy Getty, a partner in 
Riverside-based Integrated Solutions Inc., which installs and services bulletin 
board systems and communication services. Knowledgeable do-it-yourselfers can 
do the job for even less. A fairly powerful BBS can be put together for less 
than $5,000, and a rudimentary one can be mounted on a secondhand PC for 
slightly less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For business, one big draw is convenience. The commercial real estate BBS, "is 
an incredible timesaver," says James Gillespie, president of the American 
Industrial Real Estate Assn. and associate vice president at Los Angeles-based 
Daum Commercial Real Estate Services. Information is kept more current. And 
under the old system, Gillespie says, "after half an hour with the book you 
felt like it was 5 o'clock in the afternoon, even if it was 10 in the morning." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie says he can weed out many unsuitable properties within five minutes 
by specifying up to several dozen criteria in an on-line computer search. 
</P>
<P>
 To access the system, a broker uses a personal computer to dial the service's 
computer, where the information is loaded. The service's computer searches the 
database for all properties matching the criteria specified and displays the 
requested information. (A redesign will soon offer pictures with text.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many other kinds of businesses are also turning to electronic bulletin boards. 
Advertising agencies are logging on to the Picture Exchange, which links stock 
houses (and their thousands of photographs) with people who use them, 
advertising agencies and graphic artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. initiated the system and acts as a middleman. "Searching for 
images is a frustrating business," says Mike Harrigan, director of markets 
development at Kodak's headquarters in Rochester, N.Y. In the decades-old 
traditional process, ad agencies would call a handful of photo stock houses, 
describe their needs and wait for the researchers to send samples by overnight 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The process could cost $400 or more per search, with sometimes agonizing 
delays. Furthermore, responsibility for the search shifted out of the hands of 
the designer to a stock house researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Kodak says a common search of the almost 20 stock houses on line 
would cost $52. With the new system, "you really get to play around," says 
Laurel Katz, a production artist at J. Walter Thompson, a New York ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask for a photograph of a computer chip taken indoors at Christmas, with red 
and green dominating the image, and the computer will display thumbnail samples 
from its 100,000-picture database. It also accepts orders for overnight 
delivery and keeps track of the search time for each account. Users can even 
download a version of a picture by wire. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Kodak will begin testing a similar service to bring data on potential 
filming locations to movie studios. The idea is to let location scouts search 
for, say, antebellum mansions without calling all over the South to find one. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, New York-based American Lawyer magazine launched what is now 
Lexis Counsel Connect, an on-line service for lawyers offering electronic mail, 
discussion forums and a place to share research. The service also offers a 
gateway to the Lexis legal database.  
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey entrepreneur Maben Smith, once frustrated in his search for a 
business to buy, created Business Opportunities Online Inc., a series of 
databases designed to match buyers and sellers of businesses, as well as 
investors with capital-hungry entrepreneurs and franchise seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services may be useful, but it's still not easy to learn of them. Take 
the case of TravelFile, a Montana-based BBS that links travel suppliers and 
buyers with information on international travel, including ski reports, 
calendars of events, even a World Cup soccer timetable, as well as information 
about cruises, accommodations, tours and special discounts. Users can make 
bookings and send for information with a few keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The service is free to travel agents through the Eaasy Sabre reservation 
system. Yet many agents don't even know it exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Mitchell, a travel agent at Coronado Travel Bureau in Coronado, Calif., 
is a convert. "We have access to many more bed-and-breakfast places. We can 
make printouts for our clients. We just love it," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who pay to be listed on TravelFile notice changes in the business they 
do. "We received more than a million inquiries when we were Destination of the 
Month," says Monica Guinn, leader of the domestic tourism promotion division at 
the Las Vegas Convention Bureau. "You feel you get a lot of mileage for your 
money."  
</P>
<P>
 Ben Tyson, partner in a family-owned Radio Shack in Half Moon Bay, Calif., 
learned about an electronic government procurement system known as GATEC from a 
customer who worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, coordinator of 
the pilot project. Tyson dials up GATEC and submits up to 30 bids daily to 
supply electronic components, computers and electronic equipment to the Defense 
Department. "It's opened new markets for us," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of glamour and fashion, Ford Models Inc. will soon introduce a 
bulletin board that will, in the words of president Joey Hunter, create "an 
instant audition." Clients will dial in by computer to see a model moving and 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford has teamed with Bob Olejar, president of Instant Exposure in New York, 
and Durand Communications of Santa Barbara in a test of the system, which it 
hopes will attract casting and advertising agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even governments, sometimes stodgy and averse to public access, have jumped on 
the call-in computer service bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Many government resources are available on the Internet, a global network of 
networks, but there is much available even for those lacking Internet access. 
The Small Business Administration started its first board 18 months ago and add 
a 900 number. The service lets users download or order SBA publications, files 
and lists of elected federal representatives. The 900 number also serves as a 
gateway to other government bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities at FedWorld, a BBS owned and operated by the National Technical 
Information Service, have taken the trend toward digital even further. Starting 
this year, contractors who need wage information for bidding purposes can buy 
the data electronically for a fraction of the printed price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Drug Administration's Import Detention List, which allows 
suppliers to step in to fill market gaps created by federal agents seizing 
products at the border, will be delivered within 48 hours instead of three 
weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our on-line services are going like crazy," says Robert Bunge, business 
manager at FedWorld. TECH TIPS (Setting Up Your Own BBS) 
</P>
<P>
 You can create your own BBS with off-the-shelf software from companies such as 
ESoft, Galacticom and Mustang. Companies such as Integrated Solutions in 
Riverside and Durand Communications in Santa Barbara will sell you a turnkey 
project. For those who prefer to leave the work to others, they and companies 
such as Business BBS in Los Angeles will maintain the system, send out bills 
and update data.

KNOTT FAMILY HAS GROWN, AND DIVERSIFIED, ALONG WITH THE THEME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a kid, Darrel Anderson and his cousins were the envy of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, how many Orange County kids get to grow up on a farm? And not just 
any farm. Perhaps the most famous of them all -- at least in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to play in Ghost Town," said Anderson, 49, a Lido Island resident and 
father of three. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, though, Anderson and his eight cousins have inherited the 
responsibility that comes with the fun of Knott's Berry Farm. They are taking 
an increasingly large part in operating the $200-million business. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of this third generation are members of the company's board of directors, 
which Anderson describes as a fairly informal body that usually numbers about 
11. The other five board members include the second generation -- the son and 
three daughters of founders Walter and Cordelia Knott, who are their parents -- 
and a non-family member, Knott's President Terry E. Van Gorder. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Knott's Berry Farm operation has grown into a nationally recognized 
theme park, with acclaimed food products and restaurants, the family has grown 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The family legacy of Walter and Cordelia now includes 24 great-grandchildren 
and a smattering of great- great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The second generation has stayed close by and active in the business of 
running the 150-acre Buena Park investment, and is mostly retired now. They 
include son Russell and his sisters, Marion Knott Montapert, Toni Knott 
Oliphant and Virginia Knott Bender. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender is probably the most visible of the bunch at Knott's these days, 
spending at least three days a week in the gift shop there that bears her name. 
It has been a lifelong venture, starting in 1939 when she first started selling 
craft items from a table at the entrance to her mom's Chicken Dinner 
Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender, a redhead who was a classmate of the late Richard Nixon at Whittier 
College, said she wouldn't think of retiring. "I'd be bored to death," she 
said. And, she added, she would miss meeting people. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would be surprised. So many people shake my hand and say, 'My dad brought 
me here when I was 6 and now I am coming here with my own kids,' " Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
 The running of Knott's Berry Farm has not been as steady an occupation for the 
third generation, since there are many more professional managers now. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, for instance, has been involved with "the farm" since he was young 
and helped launch the Knott's Camp Snoopy operation in Minnesota and the Mrs. 
Knott's restaurant chain in Southern California. But he has active business 
interests of his own, including the founding of the four-unit Renaissance Cafe 
coffeehouse chain he operates with his son Andy, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, son of Marion Knott Montapert, has also served in the rotating 
position as chairman of Knott's Berry Farm. Currently, that distinction goes to 
cousin Mike Reafsnyder. 
</P>
<P>
 As happens with big families, the members have gradually started to move away 
from the family homestead. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell's son, Ken Knott, for instance, moved to Oregon, where he owns a 
ranch. A couple of the third-generation Knotts have moved to San Diego. 
Anderson said it's more and more difficult to get everyone together except for 
special occasions, like weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 This growing distance has made it harder to plan how the company will be 
managed in the future. Who will rise from the fourth generation to take an 
active role in the running of Knott's Berry Farm? 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond my generation, there is no distinct plan," Anderson said.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: RULES BLUR RISKS OF FEDERAL DEPOSIT 
INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George J. figured his money in Mechanics National Bank was safe and federally 
insured. But when the Paramount-based bank failed last month, he lost about 
$30,000 -- nearly one-tenth of his life savings. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to George, who asked that his real name not be used, serves as a 
reminder and a warning to all those who are fleeing the stock and bond markets 
for the apparent safety of banks and thrifts: Federal deposit insurance rules 
are complex. If you have more than $100,000 in a single bank or thrift, as 
George did, you need to be careful that you follow the rules exactly -- even if 
the money is in trust or retirement accounts and you've been assured that it's 
fully insured. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FDIC rules, you can keep more than $100,000 in a single bank and still 
get full FDIC insurance. Indeed, a family of four could have as much as $2.2 
million in a single bank with every dollar federally insured, says FDIC senior 
counsel Claude Rollin. But there are specific rules governing how accounts must 
be set up to obtain the additional insurance coverage. One mistake and the FDIC 
insurance is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, if one or more of the members of this hypothetical family were to 
die, the FDIC insurance coverage changes dramatically. If, for example, both 
parents died suddenly, the insured portion of this family's deposits would 
immediately drop from $2.2 million to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to heed the rules can be costly. In the last two years, about 62,000 
depositors have lost more than $1.5 billion in 162 bank failures, according to 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Depositors now lose money in 81% of bank 
failures, FDIC officials add. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, deposit insurance regulations were changed in 1991 in a way that 
makes losses on uninsured accounts more likely, says Allan Whitney, an FDIC 
spokesman. The technical change essentially bars regulators from extending 
protection to uninsured deposits, as they had sometimes done in the past. In 
1991, depositors lost money in less than 17% of bank failures, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently about $6 billion, or 23.5%, of the $2.5 trillion deposited in the 
nation's banks and thrifts is not protected by FDIC insurance, FDIC officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 While a portion of that money is intentionally left in uninsured accounts, a 
substantial portion is left unprotected because consumers and bankers find it 
increasingly difficult to understand the rules governing federal deposit 
insurance, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly at risk are retirees who maintain their life savings in 
"separately titled" bank accounts, FDIC officials say. Often, these retirees 
set up "living trusts" that are supposed to provide tax and estate planning 
benefits, as well as extend greater deposit insurance protection to the funds 
within the trust. What few know, however, is that the wording of most living 
trust documents makes them ineligible for this added FDIC coverage, says FDIC 
senior counsel Rollin. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because living trusts generally stipulate circumstances that would bar 
the beneficiaries of the trust from getting their money. For instance, the 
trust document may say that the children cannot receive their interest in the 
trust until they complete college. But, any contingency other than age -- i.e., 
the child cannot receive funds until he or she has reached the age of 18 or 21 
-- makes the trust ineligible for the separate FDIC coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A living trust is the most dangerous account you can have in a bank. And 
you'll never hear that from your banker," says another FDIC official, who asked 
not to be named. "This is the dirtiest little secret in banking today." 
</P>
<P>
 Other types of trusts are also problematic, as George can attest. 
</P>
<P>
 He set up a simple revocable trust at Mechanics, naming his niece as the 
beneficiary for the $100,000 account. Bank officials assured him that because 
the money was in trust for his closest living relative, it was separately 
insured. But in fact, revocable trust accounts are separately insured only when 
they benefit your child, grandchild or spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trust beneficiary is your mother, niece, cousin, brother, sister, 
friend or business associate, it does not qualify for separate FDIC coverage. 
The upshot: If you have other accounts in the bank, the amounts in those other 
accounts are added to the amount in trust. You risk losing the portion of the 
combined amount that adds up to more than $100,000. That's how George lost 
about 10% of his life savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, the error that tripped up George, who is 93 years old, is common. 
Last year, the four federal agencies that regulate banks and thrifts co-signed 
an "advisory on FDIC insurance coverage" that acknowledged an increasing 
problem with bank and thrift employees providing erroneous information about 
deposit insurance to bank customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo specifically mentioned a depositor who lost money in a revocable 
trust. After the loss, this victimized depositor surveyed 32 financial 
institutions, asking branch officers the same question: Would a trust account 
that names his mother as a beneficiary be separately insured from his own 
deposits at the bank? In every case, he was given the same inaccurate advice: 
"Yes, the account is separately insured." 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals who have questions about FDIC insurance can request a booklet 
titled "Your Insured Deposit" from the FDIC's Office of Consumer Affairs, 550 
17th St., Washington, D.C. 20429.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: SORTING OUT GOVERNMENT SECURITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. What are the correct names of the various government securities that are 
periodically sold to the public? Is there some publicly available calendar the 
government has for its securities auctions? Now that rates are rising, it makes 
sense to start paying attention to these sales. -- E.N.A . 
</P>
<P>
 A. The proper names of government securities are often confusing and confused. 
Treasury bills come in three basic varieties: three-month, six-month and 
12-month. Treasury notes are available with four different maturities: two, 
three, five and 10 years. Currently, new Treasury bonds are issued only for 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual auction dates are not published far in advance, but the Treasury 
follows some general guidelines, which we're including here. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, three- and six-month Treasury bills are auctioned every Monday. 
One-year bills are sold every four weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Two- and five-year notes are auctioned once a month. Three- and 10-year notes 
are usually auctioned in the first week of February, May, August and November.  
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond is sold in February and August. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, check the recorded messages at the Federal Reserve Bank 
branch: (213) 688-0069 or (213) 624-7398. Loss of a Pretaxed Sum Not Deductible 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Several years ago, I invested my IRA in first trust deeds with a mortgage 
broker who has since filed for bankruptcy. I fear my investment is completely 
lost. May I write off these losses, and then, if any of my funds are recovered 
in the future, may I report those as income at the time? -- E.D.P .  
</P>
<P>
 A. Losses on tax-deferred investments such as IRAs are not deductible. 
Remember, you have not paid taxes on the funds in your IRA. Why should you be 
allowed a tax deduction if you lose them? You and Uncle Sam are even at this 
point. You haven't paid him taxes yet on that money, and he's not going to give 
you a tax break for losing it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you invested after-tax money in your IRA -- that is, if the funds 
in your account had been taxed before you deposited them in the IRA -- then you 
are entitled to a deduction for your loss. But the deduction is allowed only 
for the amount that was taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 If your IRA had accumulated interest or dividends that were as yet untaxed, 
you may not claim an investment loss deduction for these funds.  
</P>
<P>
 One further note: If you are entitled to a deduction, be absolutely sure your 
investment is worthless before you claim it. As we have discussed before, you 
must be "reasonably certain" your investment is "wholly worthless" before you 
are entitled to the deduction. On Spousal Benefits: Choosing Which 'Ex' 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My first marriage lasted 21 years. My second lasted 10. Which ex-husband's 
Social Security benefits may I apply for? I understand that I am technically 
eligible to apply for either one's benefits, since both marriages lasted at 
least 10 years, but I know that my first ex-husband's Social Security account 
is larger. 
</P>
<P>
 How do I find out how much money I would be entitled to draw under his account 
when I reach retirement age, and how do I get his Social Security number? -- 
S.B . 
</P>
<P>
 A. You are allowed to draw Social Security benefits under the account of 
either ex-spouse. No doubt you will choose the account of the "ex" whose 
earnings were the highest and who is entitled to the highest benefits. If you 
were still married to husband No. 2, however, you would not be able to claim 
the benefits of husband No. 1 even if his account were more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 (There is one exception: If you remarried after age 60 and your former spouse 
has died, you are entitled to claim benefits on the deceased former spouse even 
if you are currently married.) 
</P>
<P>
 You can obtain the Social Security number of a former spouse by contacting 
your local Social Security office and giving them all the identifying 
information you have -- his birth date, last known address, employers, mother's 
maiden name and birthplace are some of the important facts you should collect. 
</P>
<P>
 Be prepared to prove that you are an ex-spouse who is entitled to draw 
benefits. At the very least, you will need to produce marriage and divorce 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 A Social Security worker will help you get the information and benefits to 
which you are entitled. By the way, the payment rate for ex-spouses is 50% of 
the primary wage earner's benefit, minus a certain percentage if you draw 
Social Security before you turn 65. How to Keep Tabs on Your Social Security 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can you tell me again how to check whether the Social Security 
Administration has an accurate accounting of my employment and earnings 
history? Isn't there some form I can get to verify my earnings? Although I am 
still working and decades away from retirement, I want to be sure I am being 
accurately credited with all the Social Security taxes I am paying. -- J.S . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Taxpayers who have not yet retired should periodically check with Social 
Security to reassure themselves that their employment and tax records are being 
correctly forwarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security representatives recommend that every employee request a 
"personal earnings and benefits estimate statement" every three years. 
</P>
<P>
 These statements are available from Social Security at no charge by calling 
(800) 772-1213. Ask for Form SSA-7004 or the personal earnings and benefits 
estimate statement. 
</P>
<P>
 You will receive a work sheet that you must complete and return in order to 
obtain an estimate of your potential retirement benefits.

JIM MURRAY: WILLS HELPED KEEP DODGERS A STEP AHEAD

<P>
 Ernie Banks never got in a World Series. Neither did Rod Carew. 
</P>
<P>
 But they got in baseball's Hall of Fame on the first bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Maury Wills got in lots of World Series. But he never got in the Hall of Fame. 
In 20 bounces. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, that is one of the great injustices of the grand old game. It has 
always rankled.  
</P>
<P>
 I always considered Maurice Morning Wills as the original L.A. Dodger. In many 
ways, the man who made the franchise.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers finished next to last in 1958, the year the club moved to Los 
Angeles. The very next season, they won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal difference between the team that finished seventh in the 
National League and the one that won it all was Maury Wills. Everyone else on 
the roster save one -- Wally Moon, traded from the St. Louis Cardinals -- had 
been on the team when it came over from Brooklyn.  
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to overstate Wills' importance to the Dodgers and thus to 
baseball itself. He was the difference between seventh and first.  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has always been obtuse when it comes to appreciating Maury Wills. 
Consider, for example, he spent nine years in the minor leagues before the game 
in its wisdom brought him up where he belonged, to the major league level. He 
is Exhibit A in the game show called, "What Is So Smart About Baseball?" 
Leaving Wills in double-A is like keeping Pavarotti singing used-car jingles, 
having Olivier play a butler.  
</P>
<P>
 Wills didn't come into the big leagues with drums rolling, bands blaring, 
carpet unfurling. They sent him a bus ticket and the name of a motel to check 
into and put him on 24-hour recall. He was a 27-year-old rookie, and they 
brought him to L.A. to back up Don Zimmer at shortstop. Period. They merely 
wanted him to turn the occasional double play, but Wills ran the team right 
into the pennant and the championship -- not so much with stolen bases as with 
his aggressive, take-the-extra-base daring.  
</P>
<P>
 Wills had to wait for the steal sign in those days. His speed, while 
impressive, was not blazing. And it took the Dodger manager, Walter Alston, 
some time to realize that Wills stole as many bases with his brains as he did 
with his feet. Wills well remembers the afternoon of an exhibition in Spokane 
when the skipper came to him thoughtfully and said, "You're my leadoff man." He 
paused a minute and then added: "By the way, you don't have to wait for the 
steal sign anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills responded by swiping 50 bases to lead the league in 1960.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, nothing prepared baseball for Wills' statistics in 1962, when he became 
the first major league ballplayer to steal more than 100 bases. His total of 
104 not only broke Ty Cobb's record of 96, he broke the National League record 
-- set by Bob Bescher of Cincinnati -- by 23 bases. That record had stood for 
51 years, Cobb's for 47.  
</P>
<P>
 To get an idea of how imposing a feat Wills' steals were, you have only to 
know that in 1938 Stan Hack led the National League in steals with 16. And as 
late as 1950, Dom DiMaggio led the slow-freight American League with 15. Wills 
stole that many in two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 He not only stole bases with his brains, he hit the same way. Every at-bat was 
such a cat-and-mouse game that Maury's nickname on the club was "Mouse."  
</P>
<P>
 No one ever did so much with so little. Wills had no power. He hit 20 home 
runs in his career, but only a handful of them went out in the air. He hit the 
most ground-ball homers of anyone in the game, and his "home runs" usually came 
when he beat the tag at home plate.  
</P>
<P>
 Outfields played him so shallow that he probably hit the only triple against 
Willie Mays. Wills could never stand there and admire his home runs. He was too 
busy rounding second. 
</P>
<P>
 He revolutionized the game. Not until 1980 would anyone in the American League 
-- Rickey Henderson -- steal 100 bases. And in the National League, only Lou 
Brock and Vince Coleman were to hit the century mark.  
</P>
<P>
 Base stealers today have one incalculable advantage: They are often speeding 
along on artificial surfaces as built for speed as Olympic lanes. In Wills' 
heyday, only the Houston Astrodome had a sprinter-friendly synthetic surface. 
He ran on the same surfaces as lions did. In fact, in San Francisco, they used 
to water the surface until it resembled the Okefenokee Swamp.  
</P>
<P>
 Wills had the greatest slide since Cobb. It didn't matter on the rare 
occasions when the throw beat him because Wills could slide away from or under 
the tag.  
</P>
<P>
 He got picked off base by that old adversary of the athlete -- drugs and booze 
-- at the end of his career. It was hard to believe because Wills had always 
been this purposeful, committed individual throughout his career -- you never 
saw him dawdle over anything. He went through life as if he were stealing 
second. But cocaine proved to have this balk move to the bag that Maury had 
difficulty figuring out.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, getting picked off didn't mean Wills was out. He got picked off first 
in a World Series once -- and beat the throw to second.  
</P>
<P>
 He did that this time, too. Slid under the tag. Wills is safe now. As usual.  
</P>
<P>
 I caught up with the old thief by ship-to-shore phone the other day as he was 
en route to Alaska on a cruise ship where he is a lecturer.  
</P>
<P>
 "My sobriety is working fine and has for years," he said proudly. "I blame 
myself for not thinking of it sooner. Every day is a treasure. I don't have any 
money, but I'm a rich man. You find material things in life are far less 
important than the spiritual. The gold in your life is not a metal."  
</P>
<P>
 Wills is one of a cast of stars who will be honored at the third annual Sports 
Legends West dinner at the Regent Beverly Wilshire on June 7. Proceeds go to 
the Paralysis Project of America, an organization dedicated to the more than 
half-million Americans brought low by spinal cord injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame did something the rest of baseball couldn't do -- it let 
Wills die on third base. Kept him from scoring.  
</P>
<P>
 But the veterans committee has a chance to override this oversight. They 
finally put Phil Rizzuto in this year -- 30 years late, but where he belongs.  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball kept Wills out of the league he belonged in for nine years, kept him 
off of the honor roll he belonged on for 16. They should simply vote their 
conscience. Give him a small lead and hold the door open for 3.3 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 Wills will go in standing up. He won't even have to slide.

LUKAS TURNS OVER A PAGE IN PREAKNESS; HORSE RACING: A YEAR AFTER THE RACE COSTS 
THE LIFE OF UNION CITY, WAYNE'S TABASCO CAT, WHO RAN DOWN SON JEFF, WINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The horse that almost killed his son in December lifted trainer Wayne Lukas 
from his lowest on-track moment to his highest Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat, who kicked like a bronco when Lukas tried to saddle him, saved 
his biggest kick of all for the stretch run of the 119th Preakness, defeating 
Kentucky Derby winner Go For Gin in the final eighth of a mile for a 
three-quarter-length victory before a Pimlico crowd of 86,343. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas, the trainer's 36-year-old son and chief assistant, was run over by 
Tabasco Cat outside his father's Santa Anita barn on Dec. 15 and suffered a 
severe head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wayne Lukas' Preakness horse last year, Union City, broke down during the 
race and had to be destroyed, resulting in severe criticism that Lukas said 
Saturday "could have been detrimental to my career." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lukases have never penalized the high-strung Tabasco Cat for that day he 
ran away. "We never hung any yoke around his neck," Wayne Lukas said after 
winning his third Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good-feeling horse, but he's not mean. When he runs, he likes to play 
to the crowd, but he's not nervous and has never been (sweaty). Jeff's going to 
join me on a part-time basis soon, and he'll be around more later in the year. 
He never really got to know this horse. He was just getting to know him when he 
was injured. I hope this horse has a big fall, and that Jeff will be around to 
be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 After speaking to his son twice about race strategy earlier in the day, Lukas 
tried to call him after the Preakness and was told by the maid that the family 
-- Jeff, wife Linda and their two young children -- had gone to a carnival 
after watching the race on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached Saturday night, Linda Lukas said: "Jeff was real excited when the 
horse reached the wire. He jumped up and hugged everybody and high-fived us. 
We're back from the carnival and Jeff's resting now. He was very happy for his 
dad and the owners. We've rented a house for the Del Mar meet (which starts in 
late July), so he's almost ready to get back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Pat Day's third Preakness winner came with a ground-saving ride from 
the No. 1 post position that culminated with Tabasco Cat passing Go For Gin 
from the outside in the stretch. In the winner's circle, Day said: "Jeff, I 
hope this quickens your rehabilitation and recovery. Get well soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat's victory means that the Triple Crown series will have to wait at 
least another year before a 3-year-old has a chance to sweep the races. 
Affirmed, in 1978, was the last Triple Crown winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin, helped by a sloppy track, beat the sixth-place Tabasco Cat by nine 
lengths in the roughly run Derby. By contrast, the $688,800 Preakness was run 
over a fast track and without incident, except for an awkward break by Numerous 
that took him out of contention early. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tabasco Cat has a big, flat foot, and I told Pat (Day) before the Derby that 
he would run over glass," Lukas said. "But I was wrong. He didn't handle the 
sloppy going at all." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Saturday's 10-horse field had reached the top of the stretch, the 
outcome was reduced to two horses. Go For Gin, favored at 5-2, finished six 
lengths ahead of Concern, and the rest of the order of finish was Kandaly, 
Numerous, Blumin Affair, Looming, Silver Goblin, Powis Castle and Polar 
Expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat, a son of Storm Cat and Barbicue Sauce who paid $9.20 to win as 
the third betting choice, ran 1 3/16 miles over a dull track in 1:56 2/5. That 
was well off the Preakness record of 1:53 2/5, set by Tank's Prospect -- Lukas' 
second winner of the race, in 1985. Lukas' first Preakness winner, Codex in 
1980, was the first of 16 horses he has started in the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat, earning $447,720 for his owners and breeders, William T. Young 
and David P. Reynolds, won for the sixth time in 10 starts and ended a long 
major-race slump for Lukas, whose last Grade I victory came when Twilight 
Agenda won the Meadowlands Cup in October of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Chris McCarron could find no excuses for Go For Gin. "He ran hard," 
McCarron said. "He didn't have quite the abrupt turn of foot at the 
three-sixteenths pole that he had in the Derby. I'm not sure why, but he didn't 
have that big burst. There isn't much to discuss about the last eighth of a 
mile. . . . We just got outrun from the eighth pole to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nick Zito, who trains Go For Gin: "My horse ran every step in the Derby. 
Tabasco Cat didn't have to do that, so maybe he had more energy today." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Tabasco Cat and Go For Gin are expected to run in the Triple Crown 
windup, the Belmont Stakes, in New York on June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Polar Expedition broke first, with Go For Gin, Silver Goblin and 
Tabasco Cat immediately behind him. The fractions were slow, and at the 
five-eighths pole, while Go For Gin was moving to the lead, Tabasco Cat was 
moving between Silver Goblin and Polar Expedition into second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat drew even with Go For Gin about an eighth of a mile from the wire. 
McCarron was working hard to keep his mount going, whipping first left-handed 
and then switching to the right. Day was whipping Tabasco Cat, too, but needed 
only four whacks from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a picture-perfect trip," Day said. "I had Go For Gin right where I 
wanted him when I turned for home. I had gotten there easily and had not asked 
my horse for any run at all. I felt like I had him any time I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on how the record books will show a death at the track one year and 
a victory the next, Wayne Lukas said: "It's like I told Jeff, this isn't a 
week-to-week game. It's not a broken sesamoid-to-broken sesamoid game. It's not 
one bowed tendon to another. It's not getting the expensive yearlings and 
finding that they can't run. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've almost got to look at this game in 10-year increments. After that, you 
can look back and see where you've had maybe five good years and three bad 
years. You handle the game any other way, and it'll drive you to the nuthouse."

 Tabasco Cat, allowed to settle in behind the leaders after breaking alertly, 
saved ground to the end of the backstretch, split horses while moving midway of 
the far turn, caught Go For Gin near the final furlong and proved best under 
left handed urging. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin, away in good order, went up after Polar Expedition around the 
first turn, gained a clear advantage midway of the far turn and continued on 
gamely in a long drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern, outrun for more than six furlongs, raced seven wide into the stretch 
and passed tiring horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly, without early foot, raced five wide into the stretch while making up 
some ground but failed to sustain his bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous ducked out after the start, reached a striking position outside 
horses entering the backstretch, angled inside after moving through between 
horses approaching the stretch but weakened during the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumin Affair, unhurried into the backstretch while racing five wide, 
continued wide while advancing into the far turn, then was finished leaving the 
furlong grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Looming failed to be a serious factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Goblin hit the side of the gate at the break, quickly reached 
contention, made a mild run three wide on the far turn, then had nothing left. 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Expedition raced slightly out from the rail while showing speed for six 
furlongs and stopped badly.

WORLD CUP '94: 26 DAYS AND COUNTING; DUTCH TREAT; AFTER UP-AND-DOWN YEARS, RUUD 
GULLIT IS UP FOR THE CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sun-splashed and star-studded, the training center for the Sampdoria football 
club is nestled in the green hills high above Genoa and the blue, blue Ligurian 
Sea of the Italian Riviera. The dirt trail to the training center can be found 
by following the dust of cars driven by ardent fans who soon will be watching 
the team practice. 
</P>
<P>
 This beautiful setting has, until recently, been the turf of one of soccer's 
most volatile and brilliant players, Ruud Gullit of the Netherlands. In Genoa, 
Gullit began his third incarnation as a soccer player, having moved from 
superstar to has-been and back to superstar, all with a stubborn style and 
rigorous adherence to a personal code. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviled by some coaches as headstrong but loved by fans for his tenacity, 
Gullit, 31, is now, again, a player who can win games for teams. But the road 
back has been circuitous. A star in the Dutch league, Gullit was lured to the 
lucrative but tempestuous Italian league, where he spent six years on one of 
the most powerful soccer teams in the world, AC Milan. In his first season, the 
club won the Italian championship and Gullit was named the best player in 
Europe. That was his first life. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, 1988, Gullit injured his right knee in preseason training and 
missed most of the season. Pushing his rehab to the limit, he returned to the 
lineup near the end of the season's European Cup semifinals. He scored two 
goals and Milan won, but he reinjured his knee and had to miss the next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the injuries -- it wasn't only the right knee; he has had four 
operations on his left -- Gullit was one of the sport's superstars and a 
regular on the Dutch national team. Until last year, when he moved on to his 
second life. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit's career is lined with difficult and unpopular decisions. In his time 
with Milan he changed from star to highly paid bench sitter, falling victim to 
Milan's policy of stockpiling talented foreigners -- the team had six in 
Gullit's last season -- even though only three could play. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit publicly asked to be transferred, and Milan's flamboyant owner, Silvio 
Berlusconi, obliged, sending Gullit from the caldron of soccer fanaticism to 
the relative calm of Sampdoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Berlusconi, now the Prime Minister of Italy, acknowledged that selling 
Gullit was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a man of his status to admit he made a mistake, that makes him, as a 
person, richer," Gullit said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Berlusconi was willing to do more than say he had made a mistake. He was 
willing to rectify it. Next season in the Italian league, Gullit will be back 
with AC Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving Milan for Sampdoria was difficult, and Gullit's situation was closely 
monitored by the soccer-loving Italian public. And during that unsettled 
period, Gullit was also having a public battle with Dick Advocaat, the coach of 
the Dutch national team. For a long time, until early this year, it appeared 
that Gullit would not be a part of the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of what I've achieved," he said recently. "Last year (at Milan) my 
status as a football player was not good. Everyone said, 'He has knees of 
glass. He has no career. He can't play two matches in one week. He can't do 
this, he can't do that. He's finished.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't do anything -- they wouldn't let me play. That was the politics of 
Milan. I said, 'OK, now I take everything into my hands.' I said, 'Thank you 
very much, now I am going away.' Same with the Dutch team." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit's problems with Advocaat can be traced to World Cup qualifying and a 
match against England. In that game at Wembley, Advocaat chose to play Gullit 
on the right side. Accustomed to operating from the middle of the field, Gullit 
kept drifting to his more natural position and the Dutch coach took him out of 
the game, which ended in a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit publicly questioned Advocaat's tactics and his overall philosophy for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 That Advocaat would bench one of the world's best players was a surprise 
surpassed only by Gullit's subsequent announcement that he would not play for 
the Dutch team as long as Advocaat was the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bold but, at the time, well-calculated promise. The terms of 
Advocaat's contract called for him to coach the Dutch team only through 
qualifying. If the team qualified, player-favorite Johan Cruyff was to coach 
the team in the World Cup finals. Gullit liked and respected Cruyff and planned 
to rejoin the team at the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocaat did his part, but Cruyff and the Dutch federation could not come to 
terms on a contract. Soon, Advocaat was back as coach and Gullit was left to 
deal with the fallout of his own words. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer world watched and waited to see how or if the impasse would be 
broken. The matter became even more pressing when Gullit enjoyed a successful 
season at Sampdoria and Dutch fans clamored for his inclusion on the World Cup 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were allowed to save face. Advocaat traveled to Italy and met with 
Gullit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't enemies because we could understand each other very well," Gullit 
said. "We only had different opinions about things. (Like) my position. In my 
opinion, the Dutch team didn't play well because of tactical reasons. He 
understands why I was not happy." 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds like something short of full resolution, Gullit said only that 
he will rejoin the Dutch team when it assembles Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will see what happens," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, when Gullit was European player of the year, he dedicated his award 
to new South African President Nelson Mandela. He said he was moved that 
Mandela's fight for human rights in South Africa had brought him imprisonment 
that, at the time, matched Gullit's life span. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not imagine how that must feel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Gullit's gesture reached Mandela in prison. After Mandela's release in 
1990, Gullit said: "This is the happiest day of my life -- and I am not on the 
soccer field." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit's off-field passions have always been more intense than those of many 
of his contemporaries. He was raised in Amsterdam by a white mother and black 
father, whose strict lessons taught Gullit self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a youngster, I was a black guy and I played with all the white guys," 
Gullit said. "I knew that people noticed me. It is the same as (if) the team of 
Nigeria had a white guy. I said to myself, 'I must do my best. I have to work 
harder because everyone will notice me.' So, I worked harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father came from Suriname (a former Dutch territory in South America). 
During the day he worked to pay for his studies -- he wanted to be a teacher. 
He became a teacher, but he said, 'I have to be better.' So, he worked hard. It 
was an attitude for him to work harder. Later on, it becomes a habit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes a habit and you are used to doing it in everything you do. You 
work hard for it. Nothing comes by itself. You don't win the lottery and win $2 
million. No, you have to work hard for it. Of course, sometimes you have bad 
moments. But to admire and enjoy the good moments, you have to have the bad 
ones so that you can see the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit's parents insisted that their son never resort to self-pity. When young 
Ruud announced he wanted to join a soccer club in Haarlem, outside Amsterdam, 
George and Ria Gullit gave him enough money for bus fare and a bicycle. While 
other children left practice in car pools, Gullit rode his bike home, often in 
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit's father, who had played on the national team of Suriname, attended 
Ruud's games but always left early. At night, father and son would discuss 
Ruud's play, especially his work ethic and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both my parents worked, but the nice thing I now understand is that they gave 
me a lot of responsibility," Gullit said. "Because they had to work every day, 
I went to school by myself. Sometimes, when my father or mother came home late, 
I had to cook for myself. If I wanted to go out, I had to iron my own shirt. 
That gave me a lot of responsibility. I'm very, very glad they gave me that 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit walks the line between confidence and arrogance well. He is engaging 
and bright in conversation and would prefer to discuss music or politics to 
soccer. But he understands and accepts his responsibilities. He is not an 
adherent of the I'm-not-a-role-model philosophy of some pro athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope in my life to give something to life," he said. "People go to a match 
and want for one moment to forget their misery, or during the week, their boss 
shouting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I also hope to reach a lot of young people. Maybe you can use your popularity 
to talk about other things that aren't only about scoring goals, but just about 
life itself. It's very hard in the moment. There is a lot of intolerance. It's 
because of the economy. If the economy doesn't go well, people always point 
their fingers to those who are less fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 A father of four, Gullit has always spent time with causes that seek to 
improve the children's lives. He said he doesn't know if his efforts to reach 
children or speak out against racism have had impact, but that will not prevent 
him from continuing. As long as he has a voice, the message will be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a lot of letters, but you don't know (about impact)," he said. "You 
can't measure it. I think that people who have a certain popularity can reach 
people with a certain statement. You are not obliged to do it, but if you feel 
like it, why not? 
</P>
<P>
 "People always (interpret) everything like they want: 'He says it because he's 
black. He says it for his popularity.' It's always something. But I, as a 
person, don't care what they say. If I say something, they already know that I 
have said something, and I have accomplished what I want. They know exactly 
what I said -- that's already important. Then they can (take) any meaning they 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 Take him or leave him -- soccer has done both to Ruud Gullit -- but don't 
ignore him, don't patronize him and don't fail to treat him with the courtesy 
he extends to you. Now, in his third life, Gullit doesn't have any time to 
waste. World Cup Player at a Glance

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; RUTHERFORD TAKES HIS LAST LAP IN FOYT'S OLD 
CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Johnny Rutherford, a three-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, made a tearful 
retirement from racing Saturday morning after driving A.J. Foyt's car around 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway in a farewell lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an urge to slip it in third or fourth gear and get it up to 225 
(m.p.h.) and get in the qualifying line," Rutherford said. "It is still hard to 
believe that I'm not out there trying to get in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 14 car was the same one in which Foyt drove last year before 
announcing his retirement during qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford had not raced in the 500 since 1988. In 1989 and 1990, he qualified 
but was bumped from the field. His last Indy car race was in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He also won his only national championship in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford, 56, won the 500 in 1974 from the 25th starting position and in 
1976 from the pole and again from the pole in 1980. He drove in 24 500s, fourth 
behind Foyt, 35; Mario Andretti, who will be in his 29th this year; and Al 
Unser, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 17 months, Indy car racing lost all three of its four-time 
winners: Rick Mears, who retired in December 1992; Foyt, who quit here one year 
ago, and Unser -- plus three-time winner Rutherford. 
</P>

 With Nigel Mansell home in Clearwater, Fla., until Thursday, the Newman-Haas 
team asked rookie Bryan Herta to give Mansell's Lola-Ford Cosworth a five-lap 
shakedown. The Los Angeles driver took it easy, not running above 189 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident led to speculation that Herta might be the team's replacement 
next year for the retiring Mario Andretti.

 The success of the Indiana Pacers in advancing to the NBA Eastern Conference 
playoffs is causing repercussions in Indianapolis. The third game of the 
playoffs -- against either the Chicago Bulls or New York Knicks -- will start 
Saturday at about the time and place that the Festival 500 parade is scheduled 
to end. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also mean a busy week for Bill York, press room steward for the 500 
and Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 York's worst scenario would be for the 500 to be postponed a day, meaning on 
Monday the race would start at 11 a.m. and the Pacers' game at 2:30 p.m. SHAV

KICK-STARTING THEIR CAREERS; FOR OLAJUWON, EWING AND OTHERS, ATHLETICS BEGAN 
WITH SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon, one of the world's premier basketball centers, was relaxing 
in a hotel room shortly before the NBA playoffs began last month when a call 
interrupted his meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to talk about the World Cup and soccer," the caller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is wonderful, it's exciting," came the enthusiastic reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will surprise a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 We is Nigeria, Olajuwon's homeland, and like most of the nearly 100 million 
inhabitants, the Houston Rocket star is excited about his country's prospects 
during the World Cup finals, which will begin June 17 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, 32, might have had more pressing concerns on the eve of the NBA 
playoffs, but he simply could not keep from talking about the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the 6-foot-11 Olajuwon is one of several stars who got his 
first athletic experience in soccer. The NFL is full of soccer-style kickers, 
and perhaps none are more prominent than the Zendejas family of Southern 
California. Tony and his brother Martin were joined on the football field by 
cousins Max, Luis and Joaquin. 
</P>
<P>
 But athletes from other disciplines have benefited from their soccer 
backgrounds as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, for one, began playing organized soccer at the Muslim Teachers 
College in Lagos when he was 14. He started as a fullback, but when he grew 
into a 6-foot-9 frame was converted to goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always tried to shoot at ground level," he recalled. "They didn't think 
I could bend." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon said he learned to stretch to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tested so many times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not realize it at the time, but already he was developing skills that 
would make him a dominant NBA player. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my fakes in basketball are from soccer," he said. "It's body movement, 
footwork. That was my foundation to be agile for my height." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon has suffered through Nigeria's spotty World Cup play. This will be 
the country's first appearance in the Cup finals, although Nigeria won the 
African championship in 1980, finished second three times after that and won 
again in April. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most bitter defeats was inflicted by Tunisia at Lagos in 1977, when 
a tie would have guaranteed Nigeria a berth in the 1978 World Cup. Olajuwon 
witnessed the 1-0 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big disappointment," he said. "Everyone was in a state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
 If he has any regrets, it is that he cannot discuss the game with many 
basketball players. Olajuwon said Brian Williams of the Denver Nuggets is the 
only NBA player who talks soccer with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Rockets reach the NBA finals against the New York Knicks, Olajuwon 
might broach the subject with his New York counterpart, Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Ewing moved from Kingston, Jamaica, to Cambridge, Mass., when he was 13, 
he was a soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be the next Pele," he once told director Spike Lee in an 
Interview magazine profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing played forward. But because he was tall for his age, Lee asked if they 
had tried to turn him into a goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to be the goalie," Ewing said. "I wanted to be the forward. I 
wanted to use my athletic ability. I wanted to run and jump -- man, you know, 
do all that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ewing left his soccer dreams in the Caribbean, where he had been 
unfamiliar with basketball. Shortly after moving to New England, he wandered 
onto a playground and was asked to join a basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said I didn't know how to play," Ewing recounted. "They said it didn't make 
a difference, they just needed an extra body." 
</P>
<P>
 For Randy Smith, who played guard for the old Buffalo Braves, playing soccer 
and basketball came naturally. He excelled in both as a child on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, the decision was easy. Soccer in North America was in its 
embryo stage, and although the NBA was struggling, it was a far safer career 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, an All-American in soccer and basketball at Buffalo State, rejected an 
offer from a Toronto soccer team and joined the NBA. It was a wise choice. He 
scored 16,262 points in a successful 12-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 But he struggled with the idea of giving up soccer altogether. He joined the 
Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League in 1974 during a contract 
dispute with the Braves. But shortly before the first exhibition soccer game, 
Buffalo offered him a lucrative contract, stipulating that he quit playing 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret that I didn't hold out a little longer," Smith said. "I regret I 
wasn't part of (professional) soccer in some capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports car driver Juan Manuel Fangio II, who lives in Miami, laughed recently 
when asked if he had been much of a soccer player while growing up in 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little too rough," Fangio recalled. "I was really going hard, into 
fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 So, his compatriots made him a defender. The ones with finesse and a future 
played forward. Still, Fangio embodies the passion of Argentines for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you can't explain to Americans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His calling, though, was the path taken first by his uncle, Formula One star 
Juan Manuel Fangio. Racing, Juan II said, took up so much time he never 
developed in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Fernandez of Mexico, who is driving as a rookie at Indianapolis for the 
Galles team of La Jolla, had a similar upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 In his case, though, the genes might have been pulling both ways. One of his 
uncles, Angel Fernandez, was one of Mexico's prominent soccer commentators. 
Other uncles were race drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian was good enough to play for a club, Mundet, for two years but was torn 
by his love for racing. He finally gave up organized soccer to race full time. 
But he still plays Sunday afternoon games with his father's auto shop employees 
when he's at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez continues to follow the Mexican national team and is friends with 
some of the players. He is hoping to support their effort this summer but is 
pulled between his work and his love of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to keep my concentration high because of my racing," he said, adding 
he might not attend any games. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not seem to be a problem for Olajuwon, who has never won an NBA 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to (the World Cup)," he said. "Nigeria never got out of 
the African championships. . . . It's overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'll watch as much as I can."

RETURN TO GRAND SLAM GLORY; ROD LAVER WAS THE LAST MAN TO SWEEP FOUR MAJOR 
TITLES AND THINKS IT CAN BE DONE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dark clouds threatened more rain as Australians Rod Laver and Tony Roche 
played for the U.S. Open championship on a grass court left soggy by morning 
showers. The start of the match had been delayed 95 minutes while a helicopter 
helped dry the court. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Sept. 8, 1969. Laver, 31, was seven years older than Roche and had lost 
five of seven matches to him that year. Eight months earlier, Roche had pushed 
him in the semifinals of the Australian Open before Laver won, 7-5, 22-20, 
9-11, 1-6, 6-3, in 4 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Laver won the Australian title before also winning the French Open and 
Wimbledon, moving him three-quarters of the way to a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roche was determined to leave him short of his goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cheered for Rocket to make the Grand Slam in '62 when I was a teen-ager," 
Roche said at the time. "But I want to stop him this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Roche opened a 5-4 lead in the first set at Forest Hills, N.Y., but Laver 
altered the course of the match simply by changing shoes. Switching from tennis 
shoes to spikes to improve his footing on the rain-slickened grass court, Laver 
completed his Grand Slam with a 7-9, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In 25 years since, no man has duplicated the feat, which Laver first 
accomplished in '62, matching the effort of Don Budge in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 But many, Laver included, believe that Pete Sampras, 23, could join Laver, 
Budge, Maureen Connolly, Margaret Court and Steffi Graf as the sport's only 
Grand Slam winners if he can convert his mastery on faster courts to the slower 
clay of the French Open, which starts Monday in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, who has already won major titles on hardcourts at the U.S. Open and 
Australian Open and on grass at Wimbledon, won the Italian Open this month, 
easily the most impressive of his two clay-court titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "With his game -- he's got a beautiful game, a tremendous serve; he can stay 
back or go into the net -- it's just a matter of whether he peaks at the right 
time," said Laver, now 55 and living with Mary, his wife of 27 years, in Rancho 
Mirage. "That's the all-important part of Pete's game -- to come in strong and 
fresh and stay determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the case, he's got every chance to win. The clay is probably his 
toughest test. There are some great players out there who prefer the European 
clay. It's just a matter of playing your right game." 
</P>
<P>
 Laver was at the top of his game in 1969, the first full year of the open era, 
and had plenty of incentive to show the world how well he could play. The major 
events were opened to professionals in 1968, so Laver was eligible to play in 
them for the first time since his 1962 Grand Slam, accomplished as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 His hope was to sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Australia with that in mind," said the left-handed redhead from 
Rockhampton. 
</P>
<P>
 Laver, in the pre-tiebreaker era, kept his dream alive by outlasting Roche in 
the two-hour second set of their semifinal match, which was played in 
105-degree heat at Brisbane. Laver tried to beat the heat by draping cool, wet 
cabbage leaves inside his floppy sun hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, I grew up in that area and I knew what it was like," Laver said. 
"You sort of have a mental feeling of what it's going to take. After the match, 
you certainly are tired and beat, but it's sort of a great feeling to come 
through a tough one like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Without a questionable call, he might have fallen short. Laver, having lost in 
the third and fourth sets after serving for the match at 8-7 in the third, led 
in the fifth, 4-3, with each player having held serve. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth game, free-lance writer Paul Fein later reported, "Roche missed 
a volley, normally his forte, to fall behind, 15-30. That set up a huge 
pressure point and what would be one of the most famous -- or rather infamous 
-- line calls in tennis history. Roche spun his wickedly swerving southpaw 
serve into Laver's body. Laver sliced his return crosscourt and seemingly just 
outside the singles sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the official signaled safe, the usually mild-mannered Roche became 
furious. He turned around and queried him, 'Did you actually make that call? 
Did you really see the ball? Do you think I stood out here for more than 4 1/2 
hours to get a call like that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Laver broke the crestfallen Roche, served out the match and didn't have nearly 
as much trouble in the final, winning in straight sets over Andres Gimeno of 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Although clay was far from his favorite surface, Laver also won rather easily 
at the French Open after surviving a two-set deficit in the second round 
against countryman Dick Crealy. Another Australian, Ken Roswall, fell in 
straight sets in the final. "I probably played my best tennis in the final," 
Laver said. "And with that win, I felt a lot more secure (about winning the 
Grand Slam). The next two (major tournaments) were on grass, and that was my 
favorite surface." 
</P>
<P>
 At Wimbledon, in a four-set final, Laver defeated countryman John Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, it was on to the rain-soaked U.S. Open, where Laver survived a 
five-set match against Dennis Ralston in the round of 16 -- and the mushy 
courts -- en route to earning the first prize of $16,000, increasing his take 
for the year to a then-record $106,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final, delayed by a day because of rain, Roche never changed out of his 
tennis shoes, despite the conditions. "His feeling was that he might get cramps 
because you tend not to slide as much, although I was still sliding in spikes," 
Laver said. "But I found myself getting a little more confident as the match 
went on because you could always get to the ball (in spikes). The balls were 
very heavy and wouldn't bounce very high, so you had to get there quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years later, Laver's feat seems all the more remarkable because no 
man has been able to match it. "You have to be very fortunate to play your best 
tennis, bring yourself up to the peak four times during the year," said Laver, 
who didn't win another Grand Slam event after 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the male players who have followed Laver have won all four major 
titles in their careers, much less a year. Bjorn Borg didn't win the U.S. Open 
or the Australian Open, Newcombe and Jimmy Connors couldn't win the French 
Open, John McEnroe never won the Australian Open or the French Open. Ivan Lendl 
has not won Wimbledon, and Boris Becker has not won the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new technology, with the bigger-headed rackets, allows the players to all 
play a lot better a lot quicker, so the competition becomes much more 
difficult," Laver said. "And the depth of competition is probably the reason 
for no one coming through to win the Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back when I was playing, there were probably 20 or 30 (players) that you felt 
you'd better be very careful against. Today, there are probably 150. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought somebody like Boris Becker, when he won Wimbledon at such a young 
age, would be a force to win them all. In some ways, you would have thought 
that one of the players would have put a whole year together and won all the 
majors." 
</P>
<P>
 Laver said he hopes Sampras can do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it's a long way off," Laver said, "but if he can pull it off, 
hopefully, I'll be there first to shake his hand."

MIKE DOWNEY: FOR KRAMERS, A GOOD ENDING TO BAD EPISODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The doctor told Marshawn Kramer that her first baby would be a large one, 
maybe as heavy as 12 pounds. So, two weeks prematurely, her child was delivered 
by Caesarean section. Erik Kramer was right there by his wife's side. Their son 
checked in on June 24, 1993, four days after Father's Day, at slightly under 10 
pounds, safe and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Griffen Kramer became colicky, unusually so. Back and forth 
trudged his parents to the pediatricians. A puffiness had developed near the 
baby's navel. The doctor suspected it might be a cyst. Erik Kramer was 
reluctant to leave home. He was due to report to training camp with the Detroit 
Lions, for whom he then played quarterback. Back home in Agoura Hills, though, 
all he knew was that his baby was "screaming bloody murder." And his wife was 
getting practically no sleep. And the infection Griffen had on his stomach was 
growing worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik was fearful. Far more so than he had ever been on a football field. He 
says now: "I thought people have babies, they grow up, no problem. Then they 
live happily ever after. What did I know?" 
</P>
<P>
 A staph infection was attacking his infant's internal organs, right through 
his bellybutton. The doctors put Griffen on antibiotics. While they anticipated 
no radical surgery, they did remove some dead tissue. But the child developed 
one complication after another, until over a period of at least five weeks, 
Erik recalls, "It was day to day for our baby at best." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffen was on a respirator. The doctor kept using the expression that the 
baby was in a holding pattern, which Marshawn and Erik couldn't be positive 
meant good news or bad. At the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, meantime, 
the other parents who came into contact with the Kramers in neo-natal care 
reminded them of how delicate and uncertain childbirth can be. Everyone in the 
hospital was having an ordeal of his or her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "They handle only the extreme cases," Erik says. "It's the saddest thing in 
the world. They don't expect a lot of those kids in there to go home." Griffen 
Kramer did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And eventually life went on for the Kramers. Erik had a long season with the 
Lions -- in the lineup one week, out the next. When the last whistle blew, he 
and his wife, still exhausted from six months of sleepless nights, took off for 
a much-needed vacation. While they were gone, they turned on a TV set. A report 
on the news was coming from Canoga Park, the town where Erik grew up. It seemed 
there had been an earthquake. A taste of what Mother Nature can do, to use 
Erik's own words.  
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, 29, has never known a year of such upheaval. He was a free agent, 
unsure where he would play football next. And nature was a mother that had 
thrown more than one curve at his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our world was turned upside down," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, however, Kramer counted his blessings. He got a call from the 
Chicago Bears, who wanted to make him their starting quarterback. He eagerly 
agreed. He and his wife took an apartment there and found a home in Lake Bluff, 
near the Bears' training camp, that caught their eye. And Griffen? Well, 
Griffen was in another holding pattern, this time a good holding pattern. He 
was 10 months old and getting so huge, his 6-foot-1 daddy kept wondering how 
come a quarterback's kid was growing into a defensive tackle. Papa Bear, Mama 
Bear and Baby Bear were fine. 
</P>
<P>
 And an idea occurred to the Kramers. For the last two years, the quarterback 
had been sponsoring the Erik Kramer Celebrity Pro-Am golf tournament back in 
California. The proceeds for this tournament had gone to the football program 
at L.A. Valley College in Van Nuys, where the coach was Jim Fenwick, who had 
been Kramer's first coach in college, back when he was running a program at 
Pierce JC. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenwick was appreciative. Still is. He says: "You get a lot of kids who come 
through your life, and you don't always know how they're going to turn out. 
Sometimes you have certain perceptions of people that never pan out. But with 
Erik, you always felt if he just ever had an opportunity to prove himself, he 
could make it big. And as a human being, they just don't come any better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer came out of Burbank Burroughs High not big enough, not fast enough, not 
even a full-time quarterback. He split time at free safety. By the time he 
completed his second season at Pierce, the big-time scouts were not exactly 
pounding on his door, but one coach from North Carolina State saw something he 
liked. Next thing he knew, N.C. State had the Atlantic Coast Conference's 
player of the year. No pro team drafted Kramer. He kept trying. The New Orleans 
Saints signed him, then released him. The Atlanta Falcons brought him in during 
an NFL players' strike, then let him go. Kramer made his way to Canada, spent 
10 months with the Calgary Stampeders, then got released again. If there was 
going to be a happily-ever-after in his football future, he was getting more 
and more anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 1991 football season, though, through dedication and a chain 
reaction of circumstance, Kramer was the starting quarterback for Detroit in 
the NFC championship game. He came within one step of a Super Bowl. He was so 
much in demand, the Dallas Cowboys tendered him an offer sheet. And the Lions 
gladly matched it.  
</P>
<P>
 And now he's a Bear. With a fat new contract. With his eye on a home that is 
convenient to work. Erik says: "I'd rather live in a cardboard box five miles 
away than in a palace 35 miles away." 
</P>
<P>
 Two thousand miles away, he still has his house, still has his golf 
tournament. The pro-am will be played Monday at Woodland Hills Country Club, 
with football colleagues from Steve Beuerlein to Chris Chandler to Rodney Peete 
among those expected to attend. Erik sent word to athletes and celebrities that 
he would appreciate autographed memorabilia for an auction, designed to raise 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote: "But that doesn't mean I will go easy on you when you play the 
Bears!" 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event is different in one respect. The proceeds will be divided 
between the Valley football program and the Children's Hospital. Donations can 
be made through the Los Angeles Valley Spirit Club, care of Jim Fenwick, 5800 
Fulton, Van Nuys, CA. 91401. Kramer seeks to help the hospital continue with 
its world-class pediatric care, saying: "I think they have an incredible task 
in front of them. My wife and I can testify as to the kind of work they do, and 
it just kills you to think of how it involves all these poor, helpless kids."  
</P>
<P>
 Griffen Kramer, at least -- Baby Bear -- is doing fine. "Now I finally know 
what Father's Day is all about," Erik Kramer says.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; PHILLIES, RODGERS SHOW TOP TO BOTTOM IS A SHORT TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lee Thomas doesn't have to be reminded. The general manager of the 
Philadelphia Phillies knows humility. He knows how quickly the game and its 
landscape can change. 
</P>
<P>
 The glory and satisfaction he experienced only a few months ago when his 
rebuilt team went from last to first in the National League has become a faded 
memory as the Phillies threaten to fall to last again. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has already used the disabled list 10 times for eight players. Danny 
Jackson is the only member of the season-opening rotation not to have missed a 
start. Shortstop Kevin Stocker, first baseman John Kruk and pitchers Curt 
Schilling and Ben Rivera are on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Thomas doesn't need the reminders, but they come in different ways every 
day, and he was among many dealt a shocker Tuesday when longtime friend and 
former teammate from the early years of the Angels, Buck Rodgers, was fired as 
Angel manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not out there. I don't know everything that's going on, but I was as 
shocked as anyone," Thomas said. "Buck is a hell of a manager. He knows how to 
handle players and knows how to handle the game. . . . I was totally 
surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas rebounded from his shock to be among the first to call Rodgers and let 
him know he could have a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that when he gets bored to call me. I've got some things he could 
do for me out there," Thomas said. "I don't mean managing. I've got my manager 
(in Jim Fregosi, another longtime friend and former teammate). But he could 
scout the American League for us, things like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't be out of work long, if that's what he wants to do. I just hope this 
doesn't leave a bad taste with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter? Rodgers maintained at his Wednesday news conference that he isn't, 
saying he still enjoys managing and would consider returning to it, but not 
this year. He added that he never attempted to become both the field and 
general manager of the Angels, thereby usurping Bill Bavasi's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for his firing remain murky, which is unfortunate. Rodgers and the 
public deserve better. 
</P>
<P>
 This much seems clear: A personality conflict between Rodgers and club 
President Richard Brown compounded a festering dissatisfaction on the part of 
Brown and Bavasi regarding Rodgers' disparaging comments about his pitching 
staff. They had warned him to cease making such statements, according to 
sources, who also said there was an in-house perception that Rodgers had become 
more biting and caustic since the bus accident in 1992 that almost claimed his 
life. And there was a significant desire on the part of Bavasi, they added, to 
put his own man in the job. 
</P>
<P>
 That is Marcel Lachemann, with whom he had worked as farm director when 
Lachemann was the Angel pitching coach, first at the minor league level. Bavasi 
said Rodgers would still be managing if Lachemann had chosen to remain as the 
Florida Marlins' pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough for a general manager to come in and not have his guy as the 
manager," said Fregosi, reluctant to discuss the Angel situation despite his 
familiarity with it. "The only thing I'll say is that I talked to Buck a lot, 
and he always told me that he thought Billy was doing a great job. I was really 
surprised by the firing." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Judi Rodgers, Buck's wife, owner Gene Autry called to say he knew 
nothing about the decision, a plea he has copped with other fired managers and 
released or traded players. Whether he did or didn't know, a 34-year pattern of 
instability suggests that there has been a leadership vacuum, indeed. LACHEMANN 
DIVIDEND? 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Lachemann as manager could pave the way for Jim Abbott's return 
to the Angels as a free agent at the end of the season, although the New York 
Yankees' left-hander said: "I'm not even thinking about that. I want to get to 
the playoffs with the Yankees. I've had as good a time in the last month (as 
the Yankees won 10 consecutive games at one point) as I've ever had in the 
major leagues. The speculation is just that, and it's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but Abbott, like former Angel teammates Chuck Finley and Mark 
Langston, is definitely a Lachemann admirer. FIRESTORM? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the firing of Rodgers lead to other dismissals? Larry Himes, general 
manager of the struggling Chicago Cubs, reflected on the question and said he 
has no intention of removing Tom Trebelhorn, his man on the bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how things work. One goes and it's a domino effect, but never ever did 
I consider a change," Himes said. "He's gone through the adjustment phase that 
all managers go through and he's long term." This is a bold statement for a 
general manager who has only one year left on his contract and could be in 
trouble himself. PADRES' SALE 
</P>
<P>
 It has been learned that Malcolm I. Glazer, president of First Allied Corp. of 
Boynton Beach, Fla., is the man with whom owner Tom Werner has been negotiating 
the possible sale of the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer, 66, owns TV stations, real estate and stocks. He was recently an 
unsuccessful bidder for an NFL expansion franchise, promoting the unique idea 
of having a team rotate its home games among several cities. Sources said a 
Padre sale would be approved only if the team remains in San Diego and that no 
deal has been completed between Werner and Glazer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres' 1994 pace projects to 120 losses, 10 more than in their first year 
of 1969, a damning indictment of Werner's ownership. Tony Gwynn accused some 
players of giving up the other day, and Manager Jim Riggleman had a team 
meeting in which he reportedly said: "Who's going to believe in you if you 
don't believe in yourselves? You guys are mad about people saying how awful you 
are, but they're right. You are awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Riggleman clearly senses the end is near. He is expected to be replaced by Tim 
Flannery or Bruce Bochy. SUGAR CONE 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City Royal pitcher David Cone faces the Angels today with a 7-1 record 
and a 2.83 earned-run average. Opponents are batting .207 against him. He has 
given up only 44 hits and 19 walks in 60 1/3 innings, striking out 44. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a different pitcher from the heat-throwing right-hander who struck out 
200 or more batters in four of his seasons with the New York Mets, twice 
leading the National League. He is different, too, from the pitcher who went 
11-14 last year upon returning to the hometown Royals, his original team, after 
signing a three-year, $18-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the difference is support. The Royals averaged an American 
League-low three runs in his 1993 starts. They are now averaging more than 5.5 
runs when he pitches. An even larger difference is his approach. 
</P>
<P>
 New pitching coach Bruce Kison, a former Angel, has persuaded Cone to be more 
economical and efficient and to allow the Royals' very good defense to work for 
him by simply getting outs instead of strikeouts. "The Mets never designed a 
defense to protect the pitcher," Cone said. "I felt the need to be a strikeout 
pitcher. . . . I've reversed that now. I'll take the nine-inning, 90-pitch, 
no-strikeout game over the 19-strikeout game I had a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Cone is pitching more innings with better results by delivering fewer pitches. 
He is no longer among the strikeout leaders, but he has lost no velocity. He 
had 10 strikeouts in a four-hit 4-0 victory over the Seattle Mariners on 
Tuesday, stretching his scoreless streak to 19 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt better," he said. "It's a mind-set. I've picked up my pace in 
a total sense. You'll see me sprint to the mound between innings. I throw three 
warm-up pitches before the other team is off the field. Everyone picks up on it 
-- my team, the other team, the umpires. An atmosphere of aggressiveness is so 
important to a pitcher, and I've never felt more aggressive. Of course, that's 
easier to say when you're getting a lot of runs."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * MAIN MAN: Fred McGriff batted .313 in April and said he wasn't swinging 
well. Believe him. From May 6 through Saturday, he has hit .321 and is leading 
Atlanta in home runs, runs and runs batted in. The Braves are a remarkable 
77-30 since his midseason acquisition last year. Manager Bobby Cox said: "It's 
just like everything else with our club right now. Everyone expects our 
pitchers to throw a shutout, and everyone expects Freddy to hit the ball out of 
the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 * COLLAPSE: Edwin Nunez was the fourth veteran pitcher to be released by the 
Oakland Athletics in what has become a nightmare season, joining Goose Gossage, 
Dave Righetti and Kelly Downs. Although burdened by a recent divorce and the 
fatal shooting of a stepbrother, Nunez said: "If I owned the team I would have 
released me, too. I wonder why they didn't do it sooner. I'm tired of 
embarrassing myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Is Bob Welch next? The 37-year old right-hander is 0-5 with a 9.00 earned-run 
average. He has failed to go three innings in three of his last six starts, 
failed to finish the first inning at Texas on Monday night and has been demoted 
to the bullpen, pitching three innings on Friday night in a game that was 12-2 
when he entered. "I'm not going out there thinking I can win," Welch said of 
his eroded confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOT JULIO: White Sox designated hitter Julio Franco, who drove in five runs 
against the Angels on Tuesday night, left Anaheim with 46 for the season, 
projecting to 201. He could be the only White Sox hitter other than Dick Allen, 
who had 113 in 1972, to lead the American League in RBIs. Franco has never 
driven in more than 92 in a season, but he said this is the best lineup he has 
been in and the best hitting coach (Walt Hrniak) he has worked with. A key, of 
course, is having Frank Thomas batting ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said in spring training that they're going to try to walk Frank, and I've 
got to come through in those situations so they stop and I've been lucky enough 
to do it," Franco said. MVP Thomas still leads the league in walks -- 42 
through 38 games -- and is second in on-base percentage, but Franco's impact 
has been such that Thomas also leads in the key category of runs. 
</P>
<P>
 * REVIVAL: The Minnesota Twins have risen from the ashes, winning seven games 
in a row and 11 of 12 to challenge in the AL Central. Improved pitching, 
particularly from Pat Mahomes and Kevin Tapani, the return of Shane Mack and 
the clutch hitting of Kirby Puckett and Dave Winfield have been significant. 
Puckett, who drove in seven runs in Friday's 21-2 rout of the Boston Red Sox, 
is batting over .400 with runners in scoring position, Winfield more than .300 
-- up from .220 last year when he was distracted by pursuit of his 3,000th hit. 
"That was an ordeal, not only for Dave, but everybody," Manager Tom Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a race to think about now, the Twins have apparently taken closer Rick 
Aguilera off the trading block. "We've played a month and we're two games out 
of first," General Manager Andy MacPhail said the other day. "We've got no 
interest now in making a deal that will help someone in the present and help us 
in the future."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WORRELL APPEARS READY TO RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the bullpen goes, so go the Dodgers, and it looks as though relief might be 
on its way. Todd Worrell threw 29 pitches in a simulated game Saturday and said 
he felt good afterward. If he recovers well today, he will probably be 
activated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room on the roster, left-handed reliever Omar Daal is expected to be 
sent back to triple-A Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell's return will lessen the load on set-up man Jim Gott and Darren 
Dreifort, who took over for Worrell as the closer. Gott has appeared in 22 of 
the team's 43 games, among the highest number of appearances in the league. He 
and Dreifort have each pitched 23 innings. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Delino DeShields doesn't exactly have good memories about Cincinnati, where he 
was quarantined at the start of last season with chickenpox.  
</P>
<P>
 "I caught them the last day of spring training and broke out when we were 
playing here," DeShields said. "I was at the Hilton for three nights and they 
wouldn't let me fly home (to Montreal) because of the chickenpox. So we drove 
to Detroit to try and cross the border (into Canada), and they wouldn't let me 
into the country. So we had to go to Plattsburg, N.Y., and there we got a 
doctor who said it was OK to travel. It took me six days to get home to 
Montreal." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Former Dodger Lenny Harris, now with the Cincinnati Reds, was teasing Brett 
Butler while he was taking batting practice about reaching 2,000 hits last 
week. "It must be the hair," Harris said, referring to Butler's longer hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, an infielder who played for the Dodgers from 1989-93, was not offered 
a contract after last season. He said that Manager Tom Lasorda called him and 
asked him if he was interested in returning, but Harris said no, that he felt 
it best to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has been the Reds' most frequently used pinch-hitter with five hits in 
19 at-bats. He has nine hits in his last 16 at-bats overall. MARYANN HUDSON

 Right-hander Armando Reynoso, the mainstay of the Colorado Rockies' staff,

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; HERE IS PROOF THAT NEARLY ANYONE CAN COACH CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 READY FOR A CHALLENGE? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach wanted. Proven winner who can overcome distractions such as unsigned 
stars. If you look like Pat Riley, are more stable than Larry Brown and can 
pull a sword out of a rock like King Arthur, my boss will make you rich. 
Contact E. Baylor, L.A. Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding up the usual suspects: 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Clippers announced that they had asked permission to talk to 
Pat Riley and John Lucas, but they are spoken for. Let's see who is available 
this time around. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute! How about me? 
</P>
<P>
 OK, the Clippers want someone a tad more handsome and famous, not to mention 
someone who has actually coached, but that's standard for them. After leaking 
several big names who will turn them down, they will get around to those 
willing to work for them. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I realize I know nothing about coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 I will hire an assistant for the X-and-O stuff. It's been done before. Keep 
the players in line? No problem. The first time someone gives me that 
where'd-they-drag-you-in- from look, I'll tell him, "I may not be here next 
year, but I can have you on waivers by this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 I can handle the media. 
</P>
<P>
 All I have to say, no matter what happens, is: "Under the enlightened 
leadership of Donald T. Sterling and with the support of the world's greatest 
fans, I expect a brighter tomorrow in our new arena, wherever it may be." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone might ask: "Didn't you used to cut Sterling up in the newspaper?" 
</P>
<P>
 If they do, I'll answer: "That's in the past and besides, it's negative. I'm 
looking to the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Players have been saying that to me my entire career. I simply want to be able 
to say it one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the best part: All I have to do is win 25 games, get fired and accept 
my payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 I can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Weiss got three years' pay -- $1.8 million. Riley might not make that much 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the record: The last five Clipper coaches vanished within two seasons. 
Weiss went 82 games. Larry Brown, the most successful coach in Clipper history, 
made the playoffs twice and lasted 117. It was 127 for Mike Shuler, 126 for Don 
Casey, 120 for Gene Shue. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is customary to say something complimentary about the departing 
coach, I'd like to say Weiss was, indeed, a nice guy. As a coach, however, he 
was lame, even taking into account the front office had torn his team to shreds 
before he ever picked up a piece of chalk. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what kind of a lazy, sloppy, disinterested number his players ran on 
him, Weiss never got upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Brown got upset about everything, and that didn't work, either. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to say Weiss deserved better, but he's on the beach with $600,000 in 
the bank and another $1.2 million coming. I would say he has been taken care 
of. No stock, bond or 401K could have done for him what Sterling did. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to say the front office has gotten its act together, but when Weiss 
left, the Clippers were at a bargaining impasse with their star, Dominique 
Wilkins, and were upset at his agent, Steve Kauffman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Weiss arrived, they were at an impasse with Danny Manning and were upset 
at his agent, Ron Grinker. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether there's a star player, agent or coach alive Sterling 
can get along with. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald, it's me! 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I know it won't work out. That puts me ahead of all those other chumps who 
have come in here with their multiyear contracts and their big plans. 
</P>
<P>
 When Elgin Baylor calls me in after my season for The Talk, I will simply say 
thanks for the opportunity and give him the number of my Swiss bank account. I 
will tell everyone Sterling is a prince and mean it. IT'S GETTING BIZARRE OUT 
THERE 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the Age of Moi that produced this flood of unchecked ego. 
</P>
<P>
 One has only to watch a day's worth of TV talk shows to figure out one is 
entitled to visit his complaints and neuroses on the wider society. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA has no monopoly on this -- didn't the owner of the two-time defending 
Super Bowl champions recently force his coach out? -- but, thank heaven, it has 
its share. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Item: Bull star Scottie Pippen takes a powder. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Phil Jackson blows the whistle on him, then turns around a day later and 
stonewalls the press, assuring reporters he understands their mission -- "to 
make us look human and naked and vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, our job is simpler than that: to report what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, we owe you a correspondent's fee for unmasking Pippen when all 
your players were covering for him so adroitly and you had only to announce he 
had a sprained ankle or another migraine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Item: The Bulls' Scott Williams skips a shootaround before Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the Pippen incident, still in the middle of a taut series 
against the New York Knicks, Williams decided his problems, which he had been 
hiding all season, took precedence over the team and, yes, took a powder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson claimed Williams overslept. However, the team bus left at 9:30, or 30 
minutes after Williams told the hotel operator to hold his phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, told by Jackson that he might not play a lot, reacted before the 
game. "I'm out of here," Williams said. "This has nothing to do with today." 
</P>
<P>
 Get it? He thinks he is the victim, as did Pippen and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Item: Jazz owner Larry Miller publicly screams at Coach Jerry Sloan to 
bench star Karl Malone, then tries to punch a Denver Nugget fan. 
</P>
<P>
 There must be more to Miller than the image he presents at games, where he 
acts as if the money he made selling cars has made him some sort of star. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was, in fact, a hotshot softball pitcher, although it's hard to tell 
from the 5-foot-10, 250-pound human-bowling-ball figure he cuts today. He has a 
history of baiting players -- he jumped into Laker Elden Campbell's face this 
season -- but outdid himself in Game 5 of the Nugget series. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone had missed seven of eights shot by halftime when Miller strode to the 
Jazz bench and yelled at Sloan, according to Burke Jolley, who was sitting 
courtside: "Get Karl the . . . out of there!" 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledged Sloan: "I think (Miller) was upset with Karl about his play." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Malone: "Nothing surprises me in this business. When things are going 
good, they pat you on the back. When things are bad, they kick you in the 
butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to his seat, Miller found a Denver fan had sneaked into it. Spurning 
the usual ways of regaining it -- asking him to leave or calling an usher -- 
Miller started yelling, found himself in an argument, cocked his arm to throw a 
punch but was grabbed in the nick of time by his son, saving Dad a bunch of 
money and time in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping Miller trades Malone to Chicago for Pippen and Williams and 
everyone gets exactly what he deserves. WHOLE LOT OF SHAKIN' GOIN' ON 
</P>
<P>
 If you couldn't keep up with all the comings, goings and wooings, here is the 
updated list. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakers -- Fired Randy Pfund, hired Magic Johnson, saw Johnson resign, hired 
Del Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Clippers -- Fired Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland Trail Blazers -- Owner Paul Allen, the Microsoft maven, forced out 
general manager Geoff Petrie, fired coach Rick Adelman. They take the fall for 
a team that made two mistakes: (1) neglecting to win a title while it was young 
and (2) getting old. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio Spurs -- Forced out team president Bob Coleman and GM Bob Bass. 
The new chairman of the board, Robert McDermott, is a retired Air Force general 
and would prefer to put Dennis Rodman on permanent KP, but can't and had to 
take it out on someone. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Heat -- The Kevin Loughery watch continues. He will be back only if the 
team can't find someone it likes. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State Warriors -- Don Nelson denied he had received any overtures or 
had a conflict with team President Dan Finnane. But Nelson is in the final year 
of his contract, so speculation will continue until the Warriors lock him up. 
So far, they haven't begun working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Celtics -- New owner Paul Gaston, who took over for his father, Don, 
and leads the Celtics into their last year in the old Garden and their first 
one in the new one, is expected to increase ticket prices but doesn't have a 
clue what else to do. Coach Chris Ford asked for a contract extension and was 
turned down. Old Celtic hands want Red Auerbach to sort out the mess, but Red 
is a figurehead only. Besides, they can't find him in the cloud of cigar smoke 
in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Bullets -- Wes Unseld resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 76ers -- GM Jimmy Lynam resigned to replace Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey Nets -- Chuck Daly reportedly can have Lynam's job or become GM of 
the new Toronto franchise, but is expected to finish out the last year of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Rockets -- Still looking for a GM. Owner Les Alexander is said to be 
looking for someone who will work for $20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento Kings -- Still looking for someone to replace Jerry Reynolds, 
longest-serving interim GM in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Hornets -- Still trying to prop up Coach Allan Bristow. Owner George 
Shinn's latest brainstorm was to hire Jack Ramsay as assistant 
coach/broadcaster. Ramsay turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Mavericks -- Still trying to turn back the clock. Fired personnel 
director Rick Sund and coach Quinn Buckner, rehired Dick Motta, their original 
coach. Motta is expected to keep the job for two seasons while preparing 
assistant coach Brad Davis to take over, as Cotton Fitzsimmons once groomed 
Paul Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Fitzsimmons kept the job for five years, not two. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as owner Donald Carter straightens everything out, he is expected to 
sell the team, and not a moment too soon. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 First shot of a long war: Owners and players scheduled a two-day bargaining 
session in Portland, adjourned in two hours. The owners asked to close the 
loopholes in the salary cap. The players claimed they were trying to put in a 
more restrictive NFL-type hard cap. . . . The order means nothing until today's 
NBA draft lottery determines who chooses where, but here's a rough list of the 
top 20 college players: (1) Glenn Robinson; (2) Grant Hill; (3) Jason Kidd; (4) 
Donyell Marshall; (5) Juwan Howard; (6) Eric Montross; (7) Eddie Jones; (8) 
Lamond Murray; (9) Yinka Dare; (10) Brian Grant; (11) Sharone Wright; (12) 
Jalen Rose; (13) Cliff Rozier; (14) Monty Williams; (15) Khalid Reaves; (16) 
Wesley Person; (17) Aaron McKie; (18) Dontonio Wingfield; (19) Eric Mobley; 
(20) Ed Piatkowski. . . . SuperSonic assistant Tim Grgurich, credited with 
saving Gary Payton's career and keeping Payton and Coach George Karl from 
killing each other, turned down San Diego State. "Fortunately Greg is coming 
back," a relieved SuperSonic official told the Tacoma News-Tribune. "We don't 
know what would have happened between Gary and George." . . . Commissioner 
David Stern, still trying to stop the fighting: "If you leave the bench, you 
will not return to it. You will go right to the locker room and you might not 
return next game." . . . Comment: Anyone who saw Atlanta's Adam Keefe plaster 
Indiana's Byron Scott against the basket support with a non-flagrant foul in 
Thursday's Game 6 knows it won't be enough. They have to take intentional fouls 
out of it, too. . . . Nice call department: Hue Hollins' Game 5 ticky-tacky 
whistle on Pippen after the ball had left Hubert Davis' hand was a gift from 
heaven for the Knicks, who would have lost the game and faced elimination in 
Chicago otherwise. NBA referees prefer to let the players settle the games, 
which is preferable to leaning the other way and letting the officials decide.

NBA PLAYOFFS / EASTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS; ONLY CARD LEFT FOR KNICKS TO PLAY 
IS HOME-COURT EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having failed to shut down, wear down or psych out the Chicago Bulls, New York 
Knick Coach Pat Riley is down to his final ploy: 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting them with his home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 With Michael Jordan gone, Scottie Pippen mutinying and Scott Williams 
complaining, the Bulls are still tied, 3-3, with the Knicks going into today's 
deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing the Bulls haven't done yet is win a game in Madison Square 
Garden, although the Knicks needed help from referee Hue Hollins who called a 
ticky-tacky foul on Pippen and awarded Hubert Davis the free throws that won 
Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knick team that took the floor in Charleston, S.C., at 12:01 a.m. the 
night before camp opened for other teams -- Riley said they intended to be the 
first on the floor and the last off it -- is one bad day from the off-season 
for one reason: 
</P>
<P>
 It can't score. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think the Knicks can put on a clinic when they are on defense, check 
their offense. 
</P>
<P>
 They have scored 100 points once in this series -- in their Game 4 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, they haven't even hit 90. In Games 4, 5 and 6, they went 83-87-79. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 6, they went 17 minutes with only three players -- Patrick Ewing, John 
Starks and Derek Harper -- scoring a point. Before the fourth Knick got on the 
board, the Bulls were ahead, 38-19.

LAKERS, CLIPPERS HAVE TO PLAY A GAME OF CHANCE; PRO BASKETBALL: IT'S THE DRAFT 
LOTTERY, AND THE ODDS ARE LONG AGAINST THEIR GETTING A TOP PICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NBA meets MIT today when pro basketball's personnel types put away their 
scouting reports and take out calculators in hopes of doing the impossible, 
understanding the annual lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 The algebraic equation that passes for determining the order of the first 11 
selections in the June 29 draft is part game show, part Las Vegas in trying to 
beat the odds and is complicated beyond reasonable explanation. In a nutshell, 
three teams will be chosen via a Ping-Pong ball lottery for the first three 
choices, then the remaining eight will be put in inverse order of their 1993-94 
records. That protects the Dallas Mavericks, the league's worst team, from 
drafting worse than fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual process will be done behind closed doors, where each team will be 
represented, and then all those people will be sequestered until the process is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage a bit later, Commissioner David Stern, who will have no knowledge of 
the results, will open the envelopes containing the team logos and show them to 
a second set of representatives and the live television audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookies at this sort of thing, the Lakers have turned to their walking 
good-luck charm, Bill Sharman. He was the general manager on a three-way 
conference call with the league when the Chicago Bulls called the wrong side of 
the coin in 1979, thereby giving the Lakers first choice and the rights to 
Michigan State's Magic Johnson. A few years later, fresh off a championship but 
in a lofty drafting position because of a trade with Cleveland, Sharman made 
the right call in a flip with the San Diego Clippers, resulting in James 
Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as team consultant, he will have the backstage role while Frank Mariani, 
a longtime friend of owner Jerry Buss and CEO of California Sports Marketing, 
an arm of the Laker parent company, will take the visible role. General Manager 
Jerry West, who decided against the trip because "frankly, I don't feel very 
good about us being here," sent Sharman off with simple marching orders: Don't 
come back if you don't win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't hold a whole lot of optimism at this time with the way it is set up," 
West said, returning to a serious note. "But we have a chance, and that's the 
only thing we can hope for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers will be represented again by General Manager Elgin Baylor, with 
Cary Collins, manager of communications, backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's uncomfortable because, to tell you the truth, I don't want to be there," 
Baylor said. "We'd rather be in the playoffs than the lottery. . . . (But) I'm 
always optimistic, so since I am going back there, I believe I'll get the 
first, second or third pick. I believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers have a 4.4% chance of getting the top prize, the right to take 
Purdue's Glenn Robinson, a 5.09% shot at No. 2 and a 6.02% possibility for No. 
3, the two spots that figure to belong to Grant Hill of Duke and Jason Kidd of 
California. The Lakers are at 0.8%, 0.96% and 1.18%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one team is thrilled to be part of the lottery, the Seattle SuperSonics. 
They got in by trade and will inherit the lower of the finishes today by 
Philadelphia and Charlotte, which -- odds say -- will be the Hornets. 
Laker-Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The San Antonio Spurs have been given permission to talk with Mitch Kupchak, 
the Lakers' assistant general manager, about succeeding Bob Bass as personnel 
director. . . . The Clippers will have their own first-round draft choice and, 
while yet to give official notification, have all but decided to take Atlanta's 
first-round pick this year instead of in 1995. That would be No. 25. The option 
came in the Danny Manning-Dominique Wilkins trade.

RULES OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Researched by EMILIO GARCIA-RUIZ / Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OFFSIDE 
</P>
<P>
 1) An attacking player is in an offside position when he is in the opposing 
team's side of the field and is closer to the goal line than all defenders 
other than the goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 2) An attacking player can be in an offside position as long as the referee 
rules that he is not receiving a pass, seeking to gain an advantage or 
interfering with play. 
</P>
<P>
 3) In the majority of cases, a judgment on whether a player is violating the 
rule is made at the moment the ball is passed to him by a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 4) After the ball is played to him, a player is allowed to receive a pass in 
an offside position. 
</P>
<P>
 5) The penalty for offside is an indirect free kick. THEATRICS 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most difficult calls for a referee occurs on tackles. Players will 
often feign being tripped and take acrobatic dives when the ball is legally 
taken from them. This is especially true in the penalty area, where attackers 
try to win a penalty kick call. Such theatrics are considered ungentlemanly 
conduct, but are rarely penalized by a yellow card. THE OFFSIDE TRAP 
</P>
<P>
 Defending teams will often employ an offside trap in which they move up the 
field in unison (A) to leave the attackers in an offside position (B). However, 
if the attack fails, an attacker will often have a breakaway. RULE CHANGES 
</P>
<P>
 1) Defending teams will no longer be allowed to pass the ball back to the 
goalie so he can play the ball with his hands. A goalie receiving a back pass 
will have to play the ball with his feet or the opposing team receives an 
indirect free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 2) In an attempt to speed up the game, players who feign injury in the 1994 
World Cup will receive a yellow card. Injured players will be immediately 
stretchered off the field to the sideline. DIRECT AND INDIRECT FREE KICK 
</P>
<P>
 Direct free kick: A free kick from which a goal may be scored. It is awarded 
for a serious rule violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Indirect free kick: A free kick from which a goal may not be directly scored. 
PENALTY KICK 
</P>
<P>
 A penalty kick is awarded for all direct-kick infractions that occur within 
the penalty area. The penalty kick is taken from the penalty mark, 12 yards 
from the goal line. All players other than the shooter and the goalie must be 
out of the area, 10 yards from the penalty mark at the time of the kick. The 
shooter cannot play the ball a second time until it is touched by another 
player. Goalie must stand on his goal line until the ball is kicked. GLOSSARY 
</P>
<P>
 * Advantage -- A discretionary decision by the referee in which he decides not 
to stop play after a foul because the team whose player was fouled is mounting 
an attack and would be hurt by a stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cards -- A referee's official warning to a player who has committed a 
serious offense results in a yellow card. A subsequent similar infraction 
results in a red card and immediate ejection. The player may not be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 * Injury time -- Time allowed at the end of a half to compensate for time lost 
because of an injury or other stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Obstruction -- A violation in which a player intentionally places his body 
between an opponent and the ball to gain an advantage. It results in an 
indirect free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 * Send-off -- The ejection of a player with a red card. 
</P>
<P>
 * Substitution -- Only two substitutions of field players allowed by each team 
per game. The goalkeeper can also be replaced by another goalkeeper. PLAYING 
THE BALL 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer's most basic rule is that only the two goalies are allowed to 
intentionally play the ball with their hands on the field of play. A referee 
may rule that although a ball hit a player's hand or arm, the contact was 
accidental and his team did not gain an advantage as a result. Also, playing 
the ball intentionally with the hands, to prevent a goal for instance, will 
receive a yellow card for ungentlemanly conduct. Players are allowed to use any 
other part of their bodies to play the ball, resulting in chest traps, headers 
etc. The penalty for a hands ball is a direct free kick.

COLISEUM CONCERN: RAIDERS TO PLAY IN OAKLAND?; PRO FOOTBALL: OFFICIALS EXPECT 
AL DAVIS TO MAKE A DECISION WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum sources said Saturday they are seriously 
concerned that the Raiders may be about to announce an agreement to play their 
home games in the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources, who spoke to The Times on agreement that their names not be used, 
said they do not believe reports circulating this weekend that such an 
agreement will be announced Monday, but they said they have been told a 
decision could be made within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Raiders nor Oakland city officials returned calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum sources, saying the team is now very late in sending out 
season-ticket applications, noted that Raider officials have repeatedly said 
they are dissatisfied with assurances they have received that the 
earthquake-damaged stadium will be ready for football by the first scheduled 
regular-season game, against the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 While Coliseum officials remain convinced that a large portion of the seats 
will be available by that time, they have not been able to tell the team 
precisely how many, or how much repair work will remain to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "So there is a possibility they will go to Oakland," one Coliseum source said. 
"They are seriously weighing the opportunity of what we understand would 
essentially be a rent-free deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Raider owner Al Davis "may be making a serious mistake" if he thinks that he 
could take the Raiders to Oakland for just one year and then return to Los 
Angeles, the source added. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued: "If they go, and the earthquake is the excuse, the reaction here 
is going to be fierce. If he goes, it will probably turn out to be for good." 
</P>
<P>
 Two Coliseum commissioners willing to speak on the record, Sheldon Sloan and 
Steven Silverman, said they were unaware of Raider plans. But both are 
convinced the stadium will be ready on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no excuse for Davis to blame the earthquake for having to move to 
Oakland," Sloan said, adding that "only some unforeseen force such as a strike 
or another earthquake" could keep the stadium closed in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman pointed out that the Coliseum's other main tenant, USC, "has no such 
qualms as the Raiders. They've sent out season-ticket forms and are preparing 
to play football." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Coliseum source reported that Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris told a Los 
Angeles friend two weeks ago that despite his own reservations, other city 
officials were pressing a deal by which the Raiders would go back to the East 
Bay city, at least temporally. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris reportedly expressed fear in the conversation that Davis would no 
sooner return than he would be making demands that Oakland spend millions to 
improve the stadium there. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has long maintained that he was made many promises of improvement at the 
L.A. Coliseum that were never fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials, who have been talking with the Raiders, have said they 
still hope eventually to improve the stadium and specifically to build the 
luxury boxes that Davis has always wanted. But now, during the earthquake 
repairs, is not a propitious time, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal and state governments are willing to give us the funds to put the 
stadium back the way it was, with some additional seismic reinforcement, but 
naturally they won't build boxes," one source said.

FISCHER, PRATER FINISH AT HEAD OF CLASS; SOUTHERN SECTION TRACK AND FIELD: HE 
WINS HIGH JUMP AT 7-2 1/4, WHILE SHE TAKES 300 HURDLES IN A TIME OF 43.88. 
</P>

<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High wound up competing before fewer than 300 
people as darkness was approaching and Cathy Prater of Agoura ran in front of 
8,210 sun-bathed spectators, but both got what they came for at the Southern 
Section track and field championships Saturday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, the national outdoor leader in the high jump this season at 7 feet 4 
inches, cleared a meet record of 7-2 1/4 to win the Division I title before 
missing three times at 7-4 3/4, which would have broken the state record of 7-4 
1/2 set by Maurice Crumby of San Francisco Balboa in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater ran a personal best of 43.88 seconds to win the Division I title in the 
girls' 300 low hurdles and crack the 44-second barrier for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go no less than 7-2," Fischer said. "I would have been very 
disappointed if I had gone less than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, a senior, cleared 6-4, 6-8, 7-0, and 7-2 on his first attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a solid try at 7-4 3/4 on his first attempt -- he knocked it off with 
his left calf -- but his other attempts were not as close as a long day of 
competition caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, I felt heavy," Fischer said. "So I'm happy with the 
height. It's not easy jumping high after being out here that long." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Lloyd of Rialto Eisenhower, who has cleared 7-2 this year, placed 
second at 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer began the meet with a second-place finish in the long jump by leaping 
22-7 1/4, which trailed Lloyd's mark of 23-1 1/2, before proceeding to the high 
jump area at around 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the large size (36 jumpers) of the field, however, he didn't finish 
jumping until 8:05 -- long after most of the crowd had departed.  
</P>
<P>
 Led by Fischer, Camarillo tied with Hart for sixth place in the boys' Division 
I team standings with 24 points. Muir won its second consecutive title with 65 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater's sole goal entering the meet was to win, but she figured that if she 
accomplished that, she would run under 44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't (run a personal best) since the Arcadia Invitational last year so 
this was so overdue it isn't funny," Prater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater, a senior, trailed Felicia Pulley of Long Beach Wilson by three meters 
as she entered the homestretch, but she drew even with her at the seventh of 
eight hurdles before recording a time that moved her to seventh on the all-time 
regional list. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Mortensen of Thousand Oaks, Ramsey Jay of Ventura, Jason Medearis and 
Brett Strahan of Hart, Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill, Antonio Arce of Palmdale 
and Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands turned in some of the other notable 
performances by Valley-area athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen won the 1,600 (5 minutes 4.91 seconds) and 3,200 (11:05.91) in the 
girls' Division I meet. The Lancer sophomore has posted better times in both 
events, but the relative ease with which she won shows she's capable of running 
much faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay turned in a pair of personal bests and region-leading marks in winning the 
Division II 400 (48.05) and finishing third in the 200 (21.63). 
</P>
<P>
 His time in the 200 was impressive because it came into a wind of 2.74 
meters-per-second. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan held off Kevin Marsden of Thousand Oaks in the final straightaway to 
win the Division I boys' 1,600, 4:17.32 to 4:17.67, while Medearis finished 
second in the 300 intermediate hurdles in a personal best of 37.31 and placed 
third in the 110 highs in 14.30. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase was beaten by noted high jumpers Lloyd (23-1 1/2) and Fischer (22-7 1/4) 
in the long jump, but rebounded with a leap of 48-5 1/2 -- his best outdoor 
jump of the season -- to win the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce was a surprise winner in the Division I 3,200 when he ran a personal best 
of 9:13.30 to turn back fellow juniors Aldaberto Sanchez (9:16.13) of 
Capistrano Valley and Eleazar Hernandez (9:16.20) of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez forced the early pace, leading the field through the first 1,600 in 
4:28.6, but he began to slow shortly thereafter and Arce surged into the lead 
with 500 meters left and gradually pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, the state leader in the girls' shotput at 49-2, won the Division I 
title in that event with a throw of 46-6 1/2, and placed second in the discus 
at 130-9.

ON THE BEACH / MIKE REILLEY: LYNCH AND PROFESSIONAL TOUR RETURN TO HUNTINGTON 
BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After winning the 1991 Op Pro surfing championships in Huntington Beach, 
Australia's Barton Lynch referred to the host city as "a dump" and promptly 
left town. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Assn. of Surfing Professionals' world tour went with him. 
</P>
<P>
 With the surfing industry strapped because of financial problems, the ASP 
pulled up stakes three years ago and left Huntington Beach, vowing not to 
return until the Southern California city got its act together. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it has . . . and the tour is coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch and other top pro surfers are expected to compete in the $125,000 U.S. 
Open of Surfing, scheduled for Aug. 2-7 at the pier. It will be the first 
world-tour event on the U.S. mainland since the '91 Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the greatest thing to happen to the sport in the last five 
years," said ASP Executive Director Graham Cassidy, who was at Huntington State 
Beach last week for the Bud Pro Surf tour stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Open is the rebirth of surfing in North America. For a while, we had 
nada , and now, the pendulum is on an upswing." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Open also could save the Op (July 27-31), which has struggled because 
of financial problems, dwindling crowds and competitor base the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Op is scheduled a week before the U.S. Open, most of the top 
surfers come to town a week early to get used to wave conditions. In fact, 40 
of the world's top 44 surfers have already committed to the Op, a four-star 
world-tour qualifying event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Op had been the showpiece of the world tour in California since the 
mid-1980s. But in 1992, the Irvine-based surfwear company sought legal 
protection from creditors and failed to come up with the $120,000 purse 
required for a world tour event. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Op experimented with a team format for a year before joining the 
world qualifying series last year. Meanwhile, crowds that once numbered nearly 
35,000 to 40,000 dwindled to 10,000-15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Op officials made a major mistake with that team format," Cassidy said. "They 
should have had the team competition as well as the individual heats, like they 
did last year. Instead, they wound up trying to explain a new format when the 
people really wanted to see man-on-man heats." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy blamed a struggling economy, in particular the surfing industry, for 
the absence of a major contest in California the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the world tour recently landed a major umbrella sponsor -- Coca-Cola -- 
and the U.S. Open has a number of non-surfing company sponsors, including 
1-800-COLLECT phone service and Prime Ticket, which will televise the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is perfect," he said, "with the new 'Endless Summer II' movie 
coming out, the TV coverage, the world longboard surfing championships coming 
to Malibu and the attention the Bud Pro Surfing tour is getting." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said the world tour has a three-year contract with the U.S. Open, 
adding that the tour could expand to new venues, possibly in Orange County, in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a make or break year by any means," he said. "It's only the first 
year of a three-year phase. Our goal is to get this started, then make it a 
little bigger, and then move outward." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy didn't rule out expanding the world tour to another event on the U.S. 
mainland, possibly at Sebastian Inlet, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the world tour had three California stops -- Huntington Beach, 
Oceanside and Santa Cruz -- but the dwindling economy eliminated all three by 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would prefer to have one contest on the East Coast and one on the West 
Coast," Cassidy said. "The East Coast is the biggest surf market in the world, 
so it's reasonable to say our tour would want to showcase surfing there." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy also wouldn't rule out another world-tour event being scheduled in 
California in the future. He added that the possible success or failure of the 
U.S. Open won't have any impact on another tour site developing on the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have two contests in California in the future," he said, "I don't think 
it would be in a place like Oceanside. If you're going to put a spot here, it 
has to be Santa Cruz or Lower Trestles. We're trying to schedule more 
world-tour events at the quality surf breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add surfing: World tour officials are considering a format in which the top 
three finishers at the Op would automatically advance to the U.S. Open. A 
fourth qualifying spot would be determined in a one-on-one heat between former 
Op champion Mark Occhilupo of Australia and three-time Op champion Tommy Curren 
of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Op and U.S. Open officials also plan to charge admission for bleacher and pier 
seating for the final days of each contest. Seating on the beach is still free, 
but there will be a $5 per day charge for the last two days of the Op. There 
also will be a charge for seating on each of the final three days of the U.S. 
Open, with a price yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add surfing: While pro beach volleyball officials squabble over what 
organization will control the sport's Olympic future, surfing officials 
continue to quietly lobby for their sport for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
 While beach volleyball has landed a spot in the 1996 Summer Olympics in 
Atlanta, surfing has been slow in gaining attention from Olympic officials. The 
reason? Numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers have been trying to get their sport recognized as an exhibition sport 
for 1996, but the Olympic committee has since dropped the exhibition status. 
</P>
<P>
 "That killed 50% of our chances right there," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said surfing is recognized in 42 countries, 15 shy of the number 
needed to be recognized as a medal sport. But there's still hope for the year 
2000, Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best we can do now is become an accredited, associate sport," he said.

WHAT PRICE HISTORY?; REDEVELOPMENT: LANDLORDS AND TENANTS OF MIRACLE MILE SOUTH 
RENEW AN EIGHT-YEAR DISPUTE OVER THE PRESERVATION OF BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to Miracle Mile buildings, what some see as historic others deem 
dilapidated. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in essence, is the issue fueling an eight-year dispute between landlords 
and tenants over a proposal by city planners to turn the Miracle Mile South 
neighborhood into a "historic preservation overlay zone," or HPOZ. Such a 
designation would force owners and developers to seek consent from a special 
city-sanctioned association before altering or demolishing area buildings, some 
of which date to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants concerned about rapid redevelopment during the mid-1980s real estate 
boom unsuccessfully rallied for such a historic preservation zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a pro-preservation group is gearing up for another fight June 9 at a city 
planning department hearing. The proposal will then go before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point in the near future, we're going to have nothing left of our 
beautiful neighborhood, just some stucco buildings with big balloon signs that 
say, 'Apartments for Rent,' " said Denise Robb, founder of the Miracle Mile 
Action Committee, a residents' group that supports the proposed zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents argue that such a designation, which would cover Miracle Mile South 
bounded by Detroit Street on the east, Hauser Boulevard on the west, 3rd Street 
on the north and Wilshire Boulevard on the south, would protect buildings and 
neighborhood character while preserving owners' rights to make needed changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some landlords, however, say that the zone would lower property values, add a 
useless layer of bureaucracy and preserve buildings of questionable historic 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason for a building from 1929 to be a historical monument," said 
Horst Beil, a landlord and member of the Miracle Mile Apartment & Commercial 
Owners Assn. "I was born in Germany, and my town goes back thousands of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeff Fader, a landlord who owns 13 buildings in the area: "An HPOZ is 
just another layer of someone telling me what I can and can't do, what color I 
can paint my building," 
</P>
<P>
 Stefanos Polyzoides, a Los Angeles architect and USC professor, said that 
preservation efforts are necessary to ensure well-planned communities. "The 
more this city becomes like Swiss cheese, with open lots everywhere, the more 
uninviting it becomes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone, which would be the eighth HPOZ in the city, would include a number 
of Depression-era buildings designed by notable West Coast architects such as 
Max Maltzman and Milton Black, said Nancy Fernandez of the city Cultural 
Heritage Commission. Each zone has an association commission that reviews 
construction plans. Appeals are heard by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion for a Miracle Mile South historic zone died in the City Council in 
1987. Around that time, a spate of redevelopment ultimately led to the 
demolition of about 50 apartment buildings in the area over several years. (A 
zone covering Miracle Mile North, which is north of 3rd Street, south of 
Beverly Boulevard, west of La Brea Avenue and east of Gardner Street, was 
passed in 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 Robb and others said the issue has apparently been revived because of 
residents' dissatisfaction with 1992 "downzoning" rules, which sought to 
control runaway redevelopment by lowering the number of units built per lot. 
Residents fear that the new regulations are too weak to curb further 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Council President John Ferraro, who proposed the Miracle Mile South zone in 
1987, is now taking a wait-and-see approach. "We have not taken a position," 
said Ferraro deputy Renee Weitzer. "We wanted to go to the hearing and learn 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the zone might be a moot point anyway. According to Fader, 
redevelopment has mostly dried up since the recession hit several years ago. 
Even so, apartment dwellers such as Robb, who has lived at the same Miracle 
Mile address for six years, aren't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary to think about what will happen if (developers) come back," she 
said.

 In the 28th State Senate District, which includes Venice, Marina del Rey, 
Playa del Rey and Westchester, candidates are fighting it out in the beach 
cities, where they are hoping that a strong environmental stand resonates with 
voters. 
</P>

 The environment "is a potent issue in the beach cities," Republican consultant 
Allan Hoffenblum said. "(Residents) want to clean up the bay. They don't want 
to see offshore oil drilling." 
</P>

 A fourth candidate, Jo Ann Rodda, has not emphasized environmental issues. But 
she notes that as a real estate broker in Manhattan Beach, she is familiar with 
the concerns of beach city residents.

 Political analysts say that Dills, 84, can expect to maintain a stronghold in 
the district's inland areas, including Compton, Carson and Wilmington. He has 
represented those areas at some point in his legislative and judicial career, 
which dates to 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 But by his own account, he is not known to as many as two-thirds of the voters 
in the 28th District, where he chose to seek reelection after his Gardena-area 
district was carved up in the 1992 reapportionment. Many of Dills' billboards, 
with the slogan "Too Old to Quit" and a picture of him playing the saxophone, 
were placed in the beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fewer people know who I am than normal," said the gravel-voiced senator. 
"That's a disadvantage that I have to take care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills has tried to use his longevity as an asset. He helped create Cal State 
Long Beach and the State Teachers Retirement System. During World War II, he 
refused to support the creation of Japanese internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people have any judgment, they will know that just because you are old, it 
should not be a negative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills points out that he has been praised by other senators for getting 
approval from the Government Organization Committee, which he chairs, for a ban 
on new oil drilling in state waters. And in a campaign brochure he cites 
legislation he is writing to save redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, someone my age has to defend something their age," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his effort to take a more friendly approach to environmental issues, 
Dills is on the League of Conservation Voters' hit list of incumbents to 
defeat. The political action group cites his campaign contributors as "a 
veritable who's who of polluters." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, however, defends his record on environmental issues and his current 
campaign approach. "I vote the district," he said. "When you run for office, 
you determine what is the will and the wish of the constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano, 58, has harshly attacked Dills' environmental record, including his 
acceptance this year of $2,500 in contributions from oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have much conviction in what he is doing," said Nakano, a former 
school administrator. "His actions are entirely political." 
</P>
<P>
 If he is elected, Nakano would be the first Asian American in the Senate since 
the 1970s. He is expected to get strong support in Torrance and among Asian 
American groups, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano said he has formed a business advisory group -- which includes the 
president of the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce -- to come up with 
ways to improve the state's business environment. 
</P>
<P>
 He says no contradiction exists between being business-friendly and 
pro-environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the environment is bad, businesses will not want to move in. People won't 
want to live here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also calling for further reform of the workers' compensation system and 
more tax incentives for companies to stay in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nakano, like Dills, has little name recognition in the beach cities, which 
have 37% of the Democrats in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidley, 32, a member of the Los Angeles County Environmental Crimes Sentencing 
Task Force, says that he will fight for funding of the Santa Monica Bay 
Restoration Project, a bay cleanup plan. He also advocates a ban on handguns 
and a 50% tax on ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are ready for (the ban) here, in the state and in the nation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodda, 53, is running on a platform of legal reform after a bitter divorce 
four years ago. Her campaign calls for removing divorce from the courts and 
putting it in the hands of a government agency with no fees. She also proposes 
that the California State Bar be replaced by a consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very difficult time keeping up," Rodda said of balancing her legal 
hassles, the campaign and business responsibilities. "But is there any doubt 
that I can get the job (as state senator) done? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the primary will face Republican lawyer David Barrett Cohen, who 
is unopposed in his party's race. The district is heavily Democratic, but 
Republicans see a chance to win. Their choice to win the Democratic primary? 
Dills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The age issue will be very, very strong," Hoffenblum said. "He will be the 
easiest to defeat."

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Classical guitarist Liona Boyd has performed in Carnegie Hall and for heads of 
state, including Ronald Reagan, Fidel Castro and Margaret Thatcher. But the 
41-year-old Beverly Hills resident's happiest experiences have been during 
benefits for people who could not afford to pay for the strings on her guitar, 
much less buy a concert ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, who joined Jimi Hendrix, Chet Atkins and Albert King in Guitar Player 
Magazine's Gallery of the Greats last year, has made 18 recordings, including a 
pop recording released last December. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has also found time to give charity performances abroad -- in India, 
Chile and Cuba, for instance -- and at home. She performed last year at 
Pepperdine University to raise money for fire victims and will play Tuesday in 
Pasadena to help fund the reconstruction of Shakespeare's Globe Theater in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, who has recorded solo and jointly with musical luminaries such as Eric 
Clapton and Yo-Yo Ma, receives a different kind of payment for her charity 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 For her two public appearances in Cuba last month, in Havana and Matanzas, she 
received travel expenses and a painting, she said. She also gave a free class 
to classical guitar students. 
</P>
<P>
 In a benefit performance several years ago in Calcutta, for Mother Teresa's 
hospice, her reward was the "beautiful, smiling faces and appreciation" of many 
who lay near death. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are really special kinds of concerts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, who is writing a book about her experiences as an international 
classical guitarist and composer, said that, for her, "classical music has 
become a kind of musical ambassador that speaks to people on an emotional and 
spiritual level." 
</P>
<P>
 One engagement took her by canoe to the Cree Indian town of Moose Factory in 
Ontario, Canada. "The bugs were unbelievable," the former Toronto resident 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 residents jammed the local church for what was, for many, their 
first experience with classical music, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said a planned private performance for Castro last month fell through at 
the last minute. But one of her more amusing experiences, she said, occurred 
when she played for him in 1982. Boyd is allergic to cigar smoke but said 
nothing when Castro lit up one of his country's national symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was puffing away and my eyes were watering," she said. He must have 
thought Boyd had a cold, she said, because he urged her to take a lot of 
Vitamin C and royal bee jelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she wishes Cuba and the United States could develop closer ties, Boyd 
said she tries to stay out of the politics of the countries she visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to play for the people," she said. "My coming won't change any 
political regime." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Boyd is preparing for Tuesday's fund-raiser in Pasadena. She will 
join a cast of celebrities that includes Lynn Redgrave, Elliott Gould, Charlton 
Heston and Patrick Stewart (a.k.a. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard of "Star Trek, The 
Next Generation"), to remember the late Sam Wanamaker, an American expatriate 
whose lifelong dream was to resurrect Shakespeare's Globe Theater on the south 
bank of the Thames in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, where Shakespeare had been resident playwright, burned down in 
1613, was rebuilt and then was torn down in 1644, two years after the Puritans 
under Oliver Cromwell closed all playhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanamaker founded the Shakespeare Globe Trust in 1971 to raise the more than 
$30 million needed to rebuild the theater, but he died at his London home last 
December before seeing the work finished. The 1,500-seat theater is scheduled 
to open on Wanamaker's birthday, June 14, in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit, hosted by Redgrave and Stewart, will be held in the 275-seat 
Ambassador Recital Hall at 8 p.m. Tuesday in Pasadena. Tickets are $50.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; AIR MUSEUM LETS YOUTHS TAKE CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine-hundred Westside schoolchildren this week flew a helicopter, built 
gliders and saw a pterodactyl -- all before lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's Museum of Flying invited the grade-school students to the grand 
opening of an 8,000-square-foot interactive learning area in which hands-on 
exhibits make fantasy become reality. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 The new attraction is designed to offer instruction in the principles of 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pupils from the Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District took the controls 
in a helicopter exhibit, made balsa-wood gliders, and observed planes taking 
off and landing at the Santa Monica Airport, which is next to the museum at 
2772 Donald Douglas Loop off Ocean Park Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want kids to understand the concepts behind flight without having to go 
through a lot of training in technical terms," said Pamela Hall, the museum's 
director of children's education. "Big words will just make them tune out, but 
actually taking the controls is something they can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, which receives donations and foundation support, paid for the 
children's bus trip to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling above the new area is dominated by mounted, life-size models of 
airplanes and a giant replica of a pterodactyl with a 36-foot wingspan. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Brady, a 9-year-old at John Muir Elementary School in Santa Monica, 
liked the real-life cockpit display the best. "It feels like you're flying in a 
real one," he said. SCOTT COLLINS

COMMUNITY NEWS: MARINA DEL REY; LIBRARY IS ON COUNTY BUDGET-CUTTERS' LIST AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Marina del Rey library, which was almost closed last year, is on the 
critical list again. County library officials say the branch, among others, 
will be shut down unless the system can find $10 million to balance its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with severe cuts in funding under the proposed $14.2-billion county 
budget, the system may close 51 of its 87 libraries, mostly smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "One could assume the Marina Library is one of those libraries," County 
Librarian Sandra Reuben said. 
</P>
<P>
 Libraries in West Hollywood and Culver City appear to be safe for now, and 
officials may tap a private endowment to keep the Malibu branch open. 
</P>
<P>
 A grass-roots group is scrambling to find the money to save the 53,000-volume 
Marina del Rey branch, which boasts a notable collection of recreational 
boating materials such as videos and maps. In addition to Marina del Rey, a 
community of about 10,000 people, the branch draws heavily from Venice, Playa 
del Rey and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd feel very much disenfranchised if we were to lose our library," said 
Greg Wenger, president of Save Our Library, a group of about 50 
library-backers. "We feel it's a very important thing that makes a community 
what it is. It's like taking a church away." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has raised about $8,000 to date, but $100,000 is needed to operate 
the library for a year on its two-day-per-week schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for the corporate entities to come on board," Wenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials last year listed the Marina del Rey branch among 10 
facilities it would most likely close, but a last-minute influx of money from 
the County Board of Supervisors and other sources enabled it to stay open two 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertain if more bailout money is coming, library officials have launched a 
fund-raising campaign of their own -- "County Libraries Are Worth It" -- which 
targets the system's 1.5 million cardholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If each donates $10, we could make it," Reuben said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county library system ran into trouble last year when Gov. Pete Wilson 
shifted local property tax revenue to schools, a maneuver aimed at balancing 
the state budget. The switch cost the library system half of its $60-million 
budget. JEFF KRAMER

COMMUNITY NEWS: WILSHIRE CENTER; 'STREETSCAPE' BEGINS TO TAKE ROOT WITH TREE 
PLANTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 10 crape myrtle trees planted May 14 along 7th Street and Irolo Avenue as 
part of a Wilshire Center revitalization project aren't expected to blossom for 
another two years, but the effort to rally the community around the 
beautification idea already is showing results. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees, and another 2,500 to be planted this year, are one element of the 
Wilshire Center Streetscape Project, a $4.5-million plan to spruce up the area 
with new benches, bus stops, lights and signs, a median strip down the street 
and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all starts with the trees," said Gary Russell, the project manager. "The 
simple act of planting a tree shows that with a little effort you can make a 
change in your environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilshire Center businesses and office buildings have been hit hard by the 
recession and by the obstructions of Metro Rail construction. The Wilshire 
Chamber of Commerce conceived "streetscape" as a way to spur a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, organizers have commitments for about half of the project's projected 
budget from federal, state, city and private sources. In addition, the chamber 
and others are lobbying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide 
$16.2 million for programs to mitigate the negative effects of subway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA approved a $27.7-million mitigation program for the Hollywood area. 
Wilshire Center businesses say they deserve similar assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Subway construction is "making it tougher for us to be competitive," Russell 
said. He added that although business people have taken the lead in the 
streetscape program, residents will play a more important role as time goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment managers, too, are vital to the project, said Frank Tysen, a member 
of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles and the chairman of the chamber's 
apartment committee. "To organize neighborhoods, you have to go block-by-block, 
and you need a group of managers who will do graffiti abatement, get rid of 
couches left on the sidewalk and coordinate anti-crime walks," Tysen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of work but a lot of fun too," said Abel Ramos as he took a break 
after digging a three-foot hole for one of the trees. JAKE DOHERTY

 * HAITIAN BOYCOTT -- Approved a resolution prohibiting the city from doing 
business with any company that operates in Haiti, or provides services or goods 
other than food and medical supplies to the country. The city shall also begin 
divesting its holdings in those companies and will not resume investments until 
either the exiled government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide is restored or new 
elections, recognized by international observers, are held in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 * DRUG WAR MAP -- Authorized a motion that increases by $20,000 a contract 
with Strategic Mapping Inc. for installation of an electronic mapping system 
operated by the Police Department. The system is to consist of a computerized 
map that locates and identifies suspected narcotics activities and drug agency 
investigations by law enforcement agencies throughout Los Angeles, Orange, 
Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino and Kern counties. The aim of the map is to 
increase coordination and communication among the various agencies. The 
additional money brings the total contract to $78,000. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * TRAFFIC FLOW -- Approved exempting the Department of Transportation from the 
city's hiring freeze so it can fill 28 positions to help implement the 
Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control program. The program is designed to 
manage traffic flow and reduce vehicle congestion through computer control of 
traffic signals. One of the areas targeted for new signals is known as the 
Smart Corridor, which is bounded by the Santa Monica city limits on the west, 
Olympic Boulevard on the north, Jefferson Boulevard on the south and the 
freeway interchange in East Los Angeles on the east. Passed 13-0. Voting yes: 
John Ferraro, Marvin Braude, Zev Yaroslavsky, Ruth Galanter, Nate Holden and

FOR SENIORS; MEMORIES OF D-DAY AND FORGOTTEN HEROES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything Barney Oldfield ever learned, he learned from the movies. He even 
made it into "Ripley's Believe It or Not" by seeing all the movies that came 
out between late 1936 and the end of 1937. For a kid from a small town in 
Nebraska, the Saturday night movie was the biggest thing in life. 
</P>
<P>
 Until June 6, 1944 -- D-day, the Allied invasion of Normandy, the biggest 
military operation yet and the turning point of the war in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldfield didn't see any action on the front lines but he might as well have. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Barney Oldfield U.S.A.F. (Ret.), 85, of Westwood, had the unique job as 
the liaison between the military and the war correspondents. A public relations 
man with the most important campaign in history. 
</P>
<P>
 His job was twofold: Before the invasion he had to satiate reporters hungry 
for tidbits on the rumored invasion and, when it was on, he had to figure out 
how to move 100 million words out of Normandy -- without modern luxuries such 
as fax machines and satellite telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the many problems was the question (of) which reporter had the right 
to the Normandy dateline," Oldfield recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was settled when a journalist named Robert Reuben took two carrier 
pigeons with leg capsules, one in each hand holding the wings down, and 
parachuted with the 101st Airborne onto Carentan at 3:30 a.m. on June 6. Reuben 
(of the Reuters news agency) had decided to gamble on carrier pigeons as part 
of his personal communications equipment. At impact he let the pigeons go. A 
call was directed to me and the voice on the other end said, 'We got some 
pigeons here with leg capsules, can we open them?' Well, when they did they saw 
the words 'Landed Normandy Reuben Reuters (sic)' written on cigarette rolling 
papers," Oldfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem solved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oldfield remembers the names and spellings of every correspondent he ever met 
and every town he visited. He still has that way of talking, which a generation 
of the great journalists share. It is a kind of knowing that seems to say, "I 
was a part of history that could only be told through the power of words and 
pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 So listen as Oldfield tells and tells. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty-eight correspondents were selected to be on the first wave for the 
invasion of Normandy," he said, recalling a grim task in the days before the 
invasion. "In May, 1944, I was told to secure some apartments in an obscure 
section of London. The correspondents were instructed to come to this address 
alone. I was there in one of the apartments -- no furniture -- with a 
typewriter and asked them their telephone numbers so that they can be told when 
to go and I also told them the items they could take with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them they had to understand if they leaked information they could die. 
They weren't above the fray; they were part of it. Then I had to ask them to 
sit down at the typewriter and write their own obituaries. Ernie Pyle of 
Scripps-Howard had a premonition that he would be killed and when he wrote his 
obit I remember he said, '. . . and when this happens' -- not 'if' -- 'please 
tell my syndicate manager and have him tell my wife, not the military.' He died 
in the Pacific and I never had to handle that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the invasion there was speculation that it was imminent. Many news 
stories talked about how "sorrow will come to a million homes." Oldfield did 
the advance work for a visit from President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill, British Gen. Bernard Montgomery and U.S. Gen. Omar Bradley 
to the troops waiting in England for the order to invade. Oldfield remembers 
how Eisenhower told the soldiers they would be given the best chance to get on 
shore and not to be dismayed by the rumors. There were smaller moments at this 
visit too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 101st Airborne had a display of weapons. Churchill asked Eisenhower how 
many yards the 81 mm mortar would reach and Eisenhower said 3,000. One of the 
soldiers piped up and said '3,250.' Eisenhower turned to him and said, 'Son, 
you're not going to make a liar out of me in front of the prime minister for a 
lousy 250 yards.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Oldfield goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Churchill had a cold. There were 9,000 troops standing at attention in front 
of him. He told them to break ranks and he got up on the hood of a Jeep. He 
took off his bowler hat and out of his mouth came the words I will never 
forget: 'I stand before you with no unrealized ambitions except to see Adolf 
Hitler wiped off the face of the earth.' The troops went crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once the invasion was on, Oldfield used his ingenuity to ensure words and 
pictures made it out. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the film back from the many photographers who risked their lives on the 
beaches, Oldfield had courier boats and special canvas bags with red stripes on 
them. The order was if you saw the bag, throw it on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 He also distributed condoms to press and Army Signal Corps photographers, but 
not for what you might think. 
</P>
<P>
 "History will always owe a debt to these contraceptives, at least, the ones 
used according to our directions. Each cameraman was advised to drop his 
completed film pack into one of these rubber receptacles and close it tight 
with a knot. This would provide the negatives with a raincoat of sorts to ward 
off seepage or splashing salt water." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 50 years after D-day, Oldfield is launching yet another campaign. He 
wants to publicize the Nebraska Scholarship Fund, endowed in honor of four men 
from Nebraska who died on Omaha Beach in the first hours of the invasion: 
Privates 1st Class Marcellino Shata, Paul Scott Rodstrom and Lester J. Horn and 
Corp. Herbert Leonard, technician 4th grade. They were four of the 2,132 Allied 
troops who died on the first day of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Oldfield: "It ain't about great patriotic giants. It's about the little 
guys who stay in a position that they know is untenable. They're the ones who 
win the war."

POLICE PHOTO POLICIES FOCUS OF CONTROVERSY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: PRACTICE VIOLATES 
CIVIL RIGHTS, CRITICS SAY. O.C. OFFICERS DEFEND IT AS ANTI-GANG TOOL.

<P>
 Last winter, Ygnacio Gutierrez returned to his hometown haunt on the south 
side of Huntington Beach, where gang wear is de rigueur and high fashion is 
baggy, hem-dragging, Ben Davis pants. 
</P>
<P>
 So it didn't surprise Gutierrez when police screeched to the curb of his old 
neighborhood armed with Polaroids, poised to snap Latino gang members sporting 
basic khaki. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the lens focused on Gutierrez, 26, who stood among them in a 
bright-colored Izod alligator shirt and slim blue jeans, protesting vehemently 
that he had done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 His unsmiling photograph appeared destined for an album of local gang members 
until a police officer glimpsed someone vaguely familiar: Ygnacio Gutierrez, 
gang intervention counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said he retrieved his photograph. But few others share the same 
fortune in Orange County, where local police departments continue to rely on 
the controversial Polaroid sweeps to identify members of a growing gang 
population estimated at more than 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tactic so encompassing that critics complain the photographs have 
captured images of gang members accused of drive-by shootings along with 
college students lingering on the beach for a moonlight barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice has endured in Orange County despite a November court ruling 
labeling a photo stop in the city of Orange as "too significant an intrusion on 
individual liberties to be justified by the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce D. Praet, a former Orange police officer and an attorney for the 
city of Orange, responds that the "opinion was so overblown . . . there's 
nothing in that case that impacts the policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The current law enforcement view is summed up by a memo from Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi's office that circulated among local police chiefs. Even 
when a person is not a crime suspect, the memo argues, police "may photograph 
individuals so long as the individuals do nothing to prevent the taking of the 
photograph." 
</P>
<P>
 Many local police departments defend the photography as a vital investigative 
tool to quash gang activity and crush crime. 
</P>
<P>
 That grand vision alarms civil libertarians and members of some community 
groups who contend the policy appears directed largely at Asian and Latino 
teens in violation of constitutional protections from unreasonable searches and 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission will examine the issue as part 
of a broader investigation into allegations by community groups of 
institutional discrimination against minority groups in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit 
Thursday seeking to halt the photo stops and to destroy the cache of photos 
collected by the Garden Grove Police Department, which is one of many Orange 
County police departments relying on photo sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement has cast too wide of a net," said Robin Toma, a staff 
attorney for the ACLU. "It's so wide that it picks up a lot of innocent young 
people who happen to like to dress in a hip way. Whenever we get into a period 
of rising hysteria about an issue, there's a tendency to give police very 
little scrutiny, to let them do whatever they want at any cost." 
</P>
<P>
 So far the net has snared young men like Daniel Do, 22, a first-year Loyola 
law student of Vietnamese descent, who said photo-taking by police was so 
frequent among his Vietnamese friends that they joked about it. Do has no 
criminal record and has never been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 It caught Albert Bui, 22, a Vietnamese-born English major at UC Irvine, who 
said he felt fear instead of mirth when his photo was taken two summers ago. 
The coals of a barbecue fire were just starting to burn red when Bui said 
Laguna Beach police asked him and seven other Asian college students for 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said there had been some sort of a fight between Asians and another 
group of people," recalled Bui. "One by one they took each of us aside and 
asked if we were part of a gang. I said 'no' and they said OK. Then they just 
started taking pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, it was strange," he added. "We didn't ask if it was legal. We were 
scared, but we were all relieved they weren't taking us in." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, the Anaheim gang prevention counselor, said he was visiting 
relatives in January when his confrontation with police began. 
</P>
<P>
 As he paused to greet some teen-age acquaintances, a bottle rocket exploded 
about 200 feet away, Gutierrez said. Then the police cars rushed to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them were gang members, but I was there and they weren't involved 
with the bottle rocket," Gutierrez said. "It was clear it wasn't them because 
it happened so far away from where we were standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the police started taking photos. They had lined up 10 to 15 of them 
against a wall and then an officer who didn't know me ordered me against the 
wall. I said, 'You're not going to take my picture.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then Gutierrez changed his mind, convinced, he said, by the officer's 
effective counter-argument: "Get against the wall before I kick your ass."' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Last autumn, Police Chief Stanley L. Knee of Garden Grove and his assistants 
gathered in a spare conference room for a delicate conversation that summed up 
the debate over photo sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniformed officers sat on one side of a long table, facing a row of Asian 
community activists and the Vietnamese parents of a Tustin High School honors 
student whose Polaroid snapshot is stored in secret police files. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoi Ngoc Pham and his wife, Van, listened politely as the police chief and 
his officers explained that over the years the photographs had provided 
important clues that helped them solve robberies, home invasions and a shooting 
outside a local church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean if we solve one homicide, solve one robbery and there's 10 other 
photos that do not lead to the solving of a crime, does that make it 
ineffective?" one officer asked, according to transcripts of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the response did not move Pham and his wife, Vietnamese immigrants who 
settled in Orange County in 1975 and whose only daughter, Quyen, was born here 
16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't understand why police took photos of Quyen and two of her young 
friends one evening last July as they waited for a ride outside a Garden Grove 
mini-mall. How could a snapshot of Quyen -- a 10th-grade student with an A-plus 
average, and a fondness for hip, baggy clothes -- solve a crime? They insisted 
she wasn't a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "How come you take her picture?" Van Pham demanded to know. "My daughter is 
very good student. They still took her picture and talk very rude and very bad 
to her. . . . I really want to have her picture. You should just take photos of 
ones that you suspect, not these innocent kids. You're wasting money. You're 
wasting time." 
</P>
<P>
 Knee reassured the family that if there had been a mistake, they could meet 
with him privately to discuss the incident. He offered them his phone number, 
his secretary's name, a time to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing that we really want to do is take photographs of innocent 
people," Knee said. "That doesn't serve any purpose. Any photograph that we 
take is meant to identify crime or reduce crime. If we make mistakes we have a 
system for you to respond to." 
</P>
<P>
 With those lingering words, the meeting broke up and the officers and the Pham 
family bid each other goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 They never met again. Quyen's photo remains in a police file. And today the 
Phams communicate with the Garden Grove Police Department via legal briefs in 
the federal lawsuit filed by the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The clash of individual rights versus community safety is not an issue unique 
to Orange County police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of San Jose wrestled with it after pressure from Vietnamese community 
groups to stop the collection of photographs for an Asian mug book. Amid 
protests from Asian groups, the city of Philadelphia last fall virtually ended 
the practice of snapping photographs of suspected Asian gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights lawyers and top police officials there worked out a compromise 
that allows photographs to be taken only with the express permission of the 
police commissioner. According to the Philadelphia guidelines, photos must be 
destroyed if the person involved is cleared of suspicion in a crime. And then 
that person must be notified in writing that the photo was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't round up people like some kind of cattle call," said Michael 
A. Nutter, a Philadelphia city councilman who spearheaded a successful campaign 
to create a civilian review board to monitor police abuses. "To people who say 
the police are fighting gangs, I say: How enthusiastic would you be if it was 
one of your kids or your wife or your husband who was rounded up when they had 
not done anything wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, police have the authority to take surveillance photographs 
of people in public places, such as demonstrators at protests or Mafia members 
at funeral wakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But when police detain someone, they must have more than a whim or a rumor 
that a person is involved in a crime, civil rights lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
 In many Orange County police departments, officers are expected to make a 
rapid set of decisions before clicking the shutter. 
</P>
<P>
 "First you have to have reason to stop," said Garden Grove Police Capt. Scott 
Jordan. "Then you ask, will the individual voluntarily consent to a photo? Will 
it serve some legitimate purpose? I guess the point is, we stop a lot of people 
and photograph a few. We don't photograph everyone we stop. We do it only if we 
need that photo to enhance some investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Police use another mental checklist to determine whether a person is a gang 
member. The list includes an admission of gang membership, residence in an area 
populated by gangs and dress that includes gang clothes or tattoos. Police also 
rely on tips from informants to identify someone as a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 But those standards raise additional civil rights issues. Who determines the 
changing fashion of gang wear? What happens if an ex-gang member is stuck with 
his former gang's tattoo? 
</P>
<P>
 John Robertson, police chief in the city of Orange, said he advises young 
people to avoid wearing gang fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't dress like a gang member," he said. "It may invite trouble for you. If 
I had my way, everybody would wear the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Robertson's department which drew the rebuke in December from the 4th 
District Court of Appeal, which criticized a photo stop that involved a young 
Latino man, Mynor Arnold Rodriguez. The photo was later used to identify him as 
the gunman in the shooting death of a Corona man. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's murder conviction could have been threatened because of the 
unconstitutional stop, but the court found that he had also been identified 
through other means. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guarantees of the Fourth Amendment do not allow stopping and demanding 
identification from an individual without any specific basis for believing he 
is involved in criminal activity," the three-judge appeals panel wrote. "Mere 
membership in a street gang is not a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision has caused local police to take more care documenting why a 
person was stopped and photographed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even with those safeguards, some law enforcement experts question whether 
the photo sweeps are really worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find ourselves doing things we never thought we would do 15 years ago," 
said James Rowell, a criminal justice professor at Ferris State University and 
a retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. "The problems are so great and 
the solutions are so few that we are stretching for ideas to be able to control 
the gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it has a negative impact on police community relations," he added. 
"Police departments have historically not done a good job of dealing with 
minority communities." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a placid Anaheim neighborhood just footsteps from Disneyland, minister 
Carlos Quinonez senses the tension between the police officers who preside over 
the streets and the residents of this mostly Mexican American Jeffrey-Lynne 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinonez, formerly affiliated with Set Free Christian Fellowship and now a 
Bible-toting street preacher for Anaheim gang members, has lately been mixing 
his impromptu sermons with rousing pep talks in Spanish about civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 God inspired the sermons, he said, but his own recent observations prompted 
the legal crusade. Too many times, he said, he has stumbled across scenes of 
young Latino men who are being photographed even though it appeared to him they 
had done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this month, Quinonez began to notice that the photo sweeps were 
increasing in frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time he would gather a circle of boys around him, the complaints would 
spill like sour milk. Many laughed at the number of times their photos had been 
taken. But nobody ever complained to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen-year-old Jose Rodriguez, who was photographed earlier this year, 
complained about a white officer he said told him to go back to Mexico. Jorge 
Olivarria, 23, raged that his photograph was taken after a car stop that ended 
with a ticket for a non-functioning brake light. Humberto Alatorre, 19, 
wondered why police would need so many photographs of his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police Sgt. Mike Zigmund said officers are taking more photos in their 
quest to crush gang activity. Many officers have even purchased their own 
Polaroid cameras, which perhaps explains why more photographing is taking 
place, said Zigmund, who praised the photos as an effective crime-fighting 
tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with prejudice and they're trying to make it seem like 
we're prejudiced," Zigmund said. "When you're in the Jeffrey-Lynne 
neighborhood, who are you contacting? Latino gang members -- that's who rules 
those streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Zigmund added, "What's the big deal about taking your picture if 
you're not doing anything wrong?" One night, Quinonez felt compelled to preach 
a legal message as he watched several patrol cars descend on a group of teens 
returning from a wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't appear to be drunk or doing anything wrong," Quinonez said. "They 
were identified as gang members and so they were questioning them. They made 
them sit down on the (ground). So I kept telling them not to submit to the 
photos." 
</P>
<P>
 In Spanish, Quinonez assured them they had nothing to hide. If you haven't 
done anything wrong, he said he told them, it's against the law for them to 
take your pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The preacher was convinced that one teen was ready to balk until he looked 
again at the police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 " Que hacemos? " the boy asked in a deflated voice. What can we do?

FIRE CLOSES SEAL BEACH PIER AGAIN; LANDMARK: 150 PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED ON OCEAN 
END TEMPORARILY WHILE THE MIDSECTION BURNS. SOME JUST KEEP FISHING. ELECTRICAL 
WIRES APPARENTLY STRIKE FOR SECOND TIME IN TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Flames burst from the midsection of the landmark city pier Saturday, stranding 
nearly 150 people -- some of whom calmly resumed fishing and sipping coffee -- 
while firefighters hosed down smoldering planks and sawed off pillow-sized 
chunks of blackened wood. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reported injuries and the fire was quelled within an hour, 
according to authorities. Investigators ruled out arson and said the fire 
apparently was sparked by electrical wires, the same type of blaze that shut 
down the pier a little more than two years ago, on May 15, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Whipped by winds, Saturday's fire erupted shortly after 3 p.m. as nearby 
anglers were trolling the sea for halibut and mackerel. Some witnesses reported 
hearing a loud blast before spotting plumes of black smoke and flames licking 
up from the underside of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 While a small crowd remained trapped at the end of the pier by Ruby's Diner, 
firefighters in yellow slickers battled the flames on the pier. Rescue boats, 
bobbing in choppy waves, shot cascades of water along the underside. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the flames were doused, firefighters kept the crowd waiting at the end of 
the pier while they hosed down the midsection and sawed and chopped several 
dozen wood chunks to determine whether the fire was out for good. Later, sheets 
of plywood were placed over the holes and small groups of trapped pier visitors 
gingerly crossed over the charred section and returned to the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Martens, 37, of Norwalk wheeled over the damaged area with a shopping 
cart of fish supplies and a catch of mackerel that his friend, Victor Correa, 
24, snared while waiting to be rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just getting ready to leave when we heard the blast," Martens said. 
"I thought it was a plane at first because it was so loud. I looked back at my 
pole and then I started to smell smoke. Then I started to see shooting flames." 
</P>
<P>
 The breezy winds spread the smoke quickly in full view of hundreds of 
spectators at a volleyball tournament about 100 yards from the pier. 
Authorities closed the pier and a stretch of the beach, where floating wood and 
debris was headed. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach reopened hours later, but it was unclear Saturday how long the pier 
would remain closed because investigators were still checking the fire-scarred 
section, which extended more than 50 feet along the pier and amounted to more 
than $350,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular pier has weathered a series of disasters over the years and this 
is the third time in a decade that it has been closed. The 1992 fire started in 
the same general area and was sparked by electrical wires in a lifeguard tower 
that has since been relocated. A few months later the Big Bear earthquake 
cracked the pier's support pilings. In 1983, a fierce winter storm damaged the 
midsection. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people on the pier reacted calmly when the fire erupted Saturday, 
following the orders of a helicopter pilot who commanded them to head toward 
Ruby's, the 1950s-style diner at the end of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody looked like they behaved themselves, almost like it was a 
rehearsal," said Long Beach Fire Lt. Bill Forrester. 
</P>
<P>
 Some diners were actually more irritated that they couldn't get fresh coffee 
in the midst of the crisis, said Eileen Szpilac, 25, a waitress at Ruby's Diner 
who was trapped with customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody panicked," she said. "They just kept eating." 
</P>
<P>
 While the hoses gushed along the pier, some stranded visitors entertained 
themselves by listening to the radio or simply fishing. Bright-colored sail 
boarders skimmed along nearby on the glittering water. In the distance, they 
could see the flapping banners and tents of a small beach carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was really calm," said Ben Wagner, 51, of Costa Mesa, who was on the 
pier with his son fishing for halibut. "Really everyone just kind of sat 
around. I had the radio on because I had a horse running in the fourth race." 
</P>
<P>
 When one little girl started to get hysterical, Jean O'Dell, 45, of Torrance 
tried to comfort her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her, 'We'll get off.' I thought maybe we'd have to be rescued by boat, 
but there were no free boat rides today. You might as well have a sense of 
humor. We were never really in much danger," O'Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years when the pier has been battered by storm, quake and fire, local 
residents have responded with "Save Our Pier" fund-raising campaigns. The 
1,865-foot structure is the longest pier in Orange County and was built in 
1906. Sunset magazine declared it one of its favorite West Coast piers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, as Martens pushed his squeaky shopping cart full of fishing tackle 
away from the pier, he seemed unfazed by the latest disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be back," he vowed. "Just as soon as they reopen."

 It was midafternoon on April 21 when the shaken employees of First Pension 
Corp. gathered around company Chairman William E. Cooper, standing nervously in 
his coat and tie in the middle of the company's Irvine headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Shellshocked from answering nonstop phone calls from angry investors demanding 
their pension money, the employees, some with eyes red from crying, waited in 
their top-floor offices of their two-story building to hear Cooper's 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees were especially alarmed that day by the sight of several cars across 
the street quickly being loaded with computers, boxes and other documents from 
their parent company, First Diversified Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 With his voice choking at times from emotion and tears welling in his eyes, 
Cooper told the 20 employees, almost all women, that although it hurt him, and 
it was the hardest thing he'd ever done in his 30 years in the mortgage 
business, he was filing to place the company into bankruptcy. Then he handed 
out paychecks, all of which later bounced, and left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I think about what he said that day, and it's laughable," said one 
former employee. "We just had no idea what was going on. I wish I could've 
smashed him in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension, with an estimated 8,000 clients and accounts valued at $350 
million, declared bankruptcy April 22, the day after Cooper met with employees 
and one day after Colorado state authorities seized Summit Trust Services, a 
Denver-based firm established by Cooper to manage clients' money. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 13, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that the three 
company principals, prominent Orange County businessman Cooper and his two 
long-term associates, Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen, ran a scheme that 
used money from later investors to pay dividends to earlier ones. The myriad of 
companies run by the threesome allegedly enticed investors to put money in 
mortgages that did not exist with promises of annual dividends of up to 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the First Pension offices -- in a small office park near John Wayne 
Airport -- were dark, with the doors locked, the parking lot empty and the 
grass needing mowing. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC documents and interviews with numerous former employees reveal that many 
workers at First Pension and sister company Vestcorp Securities Inc., were 
unaware they may have been participating in what could be one of Orange 
County's most elaborate pyramid schemes, with possibly as much as $124 million 
of investors' money lost to fraud or theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never even dreamed that these mortgage pools did not have underlying 
assets," said Ana Maritza Golan, former operations manager at First Pension. 
"Not at any point. Even the brokers at Vestcorp didn't know -- one of them had 
$250,000 of his own money in the pools. We were all taken." 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension acted as a pension fund administrator, serving people who wanted 
to make choices about where to invest their individual retirement accounts, 
Keogh accounts or other retirement savings. Many of its customers were 
persuaded to put at least some of their money into the real estate pools by 
brokers at Vestcorp, which marketed the partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several former First Pension employees said they became concerned 
about the company when Jensen, its president, abruptly resigned on April 5 
citing job stress, they did not suspect the company itself was in trouble. Even 
during the final week of operations, employees said they were "still trying to 
do their jobs," administering pension plans and pitching the latest limited 
partnership investments to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Thursday, April 21, employees began to believe that something was 
terribly wrong. The switchboard was ablaze with calls; several investors were 
threatening to come down to the office and physically take their money back. 
Some investors had already heard about the Summit seizure, while others were 
upset at learning that pension fund checks they had mailed to First Pension had 
been cashed, but the monies never credited to their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the employees were sitting at their desks saying, 'I just can't take 
another call, "' remembers one employee. Managers decided to lock the doors 
about noon, shut down the switchboard and send everyone to lunch. Then they 
called Cooper, who usually worked across the street at parent company First 
Diversified. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were looking to each other for support. The rumor mill was rampant, 
with people saying, 'Oh, this investor told me this,' or 'I heard this,' " a 
former employee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbi Settle, a pension consultant in First Pension's San Diego office, said 
it wasn't until that Thursday that she knew something was seriously wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumor was embezzlement of funds and we heard it was a substantial 
amount," said Settle, who said she is owed about $10,000 in back salary and 
commissions. "My heart just stopped when someone told me. I couldn't do any 
work after that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the SEC's allegations, probably the most asked question 
by observers, investors and even employees is: "How could this have happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the best position to know -- principals Cooper, Lindley and Jensen -- 
aren't talking. None have spoken publicly. In response to SEC questioning, 
Lindley and Jensen refused to answer all queries, repeatedly invoking the Fifth 
Amendment. Cooper refused to appear at all. Lawyers for the three principals 
say they are all intent on cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 One ex-employee who is talking is Kurt Linn. At 26, after graduating from 
college and working various jobs, he started as a broker with Vestcorp in 
Orange, where the company was originally based. But 14 months later in 1990, he 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just began not to feel comfortable with things," said Linn, now a 
stockbroker with a regional investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was young at the time and it was his first brokerage job, Linn 
said he had a gut feeling something was amiss at First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite of Cooper's because of his success at selling the various 
investments marketed by Vestcorp, Linn was asked to lunch with the chairman at 
a ritzy restaurant. A wealthy investor had told Linn he wanted to put up to $1 
million in the real estate pools -- but wanted to see the trust deeds and visit 
the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Linn had gone to the courthouse to check on the deeds, but could not find any 
recorded, as they should have been under state law, the SEC said. When he asked 
Cooper at the lunch, the chairman told him that the registration costs, about 
$10 per deed, were prohibitive but assured him that the mortgages did really 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed to me he was too secretive about how the investments worked," 
said Linn, who decided to quit just days after the lunch. "I didn't know for 
sure the trust deeds didn't exist, but not being sure, I didn't feel 
comfortable allowing clients to invest. So I took a job with Merrill Lynch and 
I informed my clients of my reasoning." But his boss at the time was not so 
savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodger Rusch, former president of Vestcorp, told the SEC on May 10 that he 
knew as far back as 1989 that the trust deeds were not registered. That year, 
prompted by increasing concerns about the partnerships, he went to a local 
Orange County title company and asked what it would cost to run a title search 
on real estate partnerships being marketed by Vestcorp. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called me back an hour later and said we won't charge you anything 
because there's none," Rusch said in SEC testimony. "There isn't a single thing 
recorded in these partnership names. My heart went to my throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper tried to reassure Rusch in 1989, telling him the same story he told 
Linn about the costly court fees. Though Cooper was a man who claimed he had 
made about 14,500 loans valued at more than $390 million, he told Rusch it was 
economical not to register the deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Cooper . . . would, you know, stonewall, he would intimidate, he would do 
all the things" to keep things private, said Rusch, who quit in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, former employees of parent company First Diversified and its 
subsidiaries First Pension and Vestcorp said these were companies where "you 
never dared question anything or you'd be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Although employees at the three affiliated companies met for employer-catered 
Halloween and Christmas parties and played volleyball together at summer 
picnics, former employees say their corporate family was a dysfunctional one. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees at First Pension, while remembering Jensen as a "mentor and 
friend," called Lindley and Cooper "pompous and cold." Cooper, who was rarely 
in the office, was known as a controlling man with whom employees couldn't get 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper tried to control the mail coming into and out of the First Pension 
office during late March and April, the same time when tax deadlines meant 
pension contributions would be at their peak, the SEC said. During that time an 
unknown period of clients' checks disappeared, many of which were deposited in 
other bank accounts opened by Cooper and Lindley, according to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 In SEC testimony, employee Tracy Reiter said she told Cooper that distribution 
checks prepared to be sent out around April 2, many of which were used to pay 
clients' living expenses, were not being delivered. Cooper blamed it on "our 
damn postal service," Reiter told the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony gathered by the SEC reveals that Cooper's companies were a financial 
"maze" and show that computer transactions transferring money from various 
accounts were mysteriously deleted and that parent company First Diversified 
was sending packages to Rarotonga, Cook Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more unbelievable was the annual meeting purportedly held by the board of 
directors of Summit Trust, a company created by Cooper to manage client funds. 
When the board gathered Feb. 10, the minutes show, they met at 27068 S. La Paz 
Ave., Suite 426 in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 That happens to be the address of a Mailboxes Etc. location; and No. 426 is 
the registered postal box for the company. The minutes show only Cooper and 
partner Lindley attended the meeting.

KEY CIVIL RIGHTS POST LEFT EMPTY AS SEARCH FALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an ironic collision of symbolism and substance, the White House has left 
unfilled a key civil rights job for over a year while searching for a nominee 
that sends the right signal of racial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay in naming a chairman for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
has confounded and divided civil rights activists, and raised questions about 
whether the White House has violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the fair 
employment laws by effectively limiting its search to Latino candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, the White House has floated the names of three prospective 
Latino nominees. But each has been shot down by civil rights groups who felt 
they lacked sufficient experience in fair-employment law. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil rights community and the Administration itself are now split around 
a pointed question: Is the symbolism of naming a Latino to the job more 
important than the impact of leaving leaderless the agency charged with 
enforcing laws prohibiting hiring discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age 
or physical disability? 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the absence of a permanent chairman, a post traditionally held by 
a minority, has left the agency foundering as it struggles to dig out from a 
massive backlog of more than 80,000 pending discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino advocacy groups are still pushing for a Latino appointment, though 
others in the civil rights community say the Administration can no longer 
afford to place such a premium on the nominee's ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is: Get someone in there, whether a he or she, whether Hispanic or 
African American or Asian American, no matter what their background is," said 
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who chairs a Senate subcommittee that oversees the 
EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration in this case has been unduly absorbed with some kind of a 
balancing process in affirmative action and that seems to have hampered their 
acting rapidly," said William Taylor, vice-chairman of the Citizens' Commission 
on Civil Rights, a liberal advocacy group. "It is a misapprehension of the 
general goal of diversity to pinpoint particular positions for particular 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush's appointee as EEOC chairman, Evan J. Kemp Jr., 
resigned in April, 1993. Since then, the commission has been under an acting 
chairman: Tony E. Gallegos, a Latino Democrat first appointed to the EEOC by 
President Ronald Reagan in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also hasn't chosen anyone to fill the commission's general counsel 
position, which has been vacant since last June, and only recently announced 
his intention to nominate candidates for two other vacant positions on the 
five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the appointment process was delayed while Clinton sought to 
assemble a diverse slate of candidates. One of the two nominees to the 
commission is disabled, the other is Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gallegos can only serve on the commission for a 60-day grace period 
after his term expires at the beginning of July, if none of Clinton's nominees 
receives Senate confirmation by Aug. 29, the commission will lack a quorum to 
conduct business. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegos said that even with only three commissioners the agency is running at 
full steam. "Cases are moving through," he said. "Nothing is delayed." But 
civil rights groups said the commission has been drifting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just a leaderless group over there," said Pat Wright, director of 
government affairs at the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 For conservatives all this stands as a parable on the perils of rigid 
insistence on racial diversity in hiring decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question of sacrificing civil rights enforcement on the altar of 
(appointment) quotas, and it seems to me that's what is happening," said Linda 
Chavez, executive director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights under Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, White House officials say they have considered candidates of all 
races for chairman, and note that they have interviewed some white candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have looked at a very broad spectrum of people for this position," said 
Veronica Biggins, who was named White House personnel director last January. 
"Our preference is that it would be an Hispanic, but in the same breath it is 
most important to have the right person in this position." 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, several White House sources acknowledge that the Administration 
has sought a Latino, virtually to the exclusion of candidates of any other 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 One official involved in the process said finding a Latino chairman became 
imperative after African Americans were named to the two other high-profile 
civil rights jobs: Deval Patrick as assistant attorney general for civil rights 
and Mary Frances Berry as chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 A second White House official concurred. "There was a general consensus on 
behalf of everyone who was involved . . . that if the civil rights division and 
some of the other significant positions (went to blacks), there had to be 
balance and it made sense to be an Hispanic chair" at EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Administration has, in fact, effectively narrowed the search to 
Latinos, it would technically violate the equal employment laws the commission 
enforces, several civil rights experts said. Under Title VII of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act, which applies to the federal government, employers cannot designate 
specific positions for members of specific races. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law generally is you can consider race as a factor, but you cannot 
reserve a position by race," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, a disappointed candidate for the EEOC job probably 
could not turn to the courts because the Supreme Court has held that the 
President cannot be sued on matters relating to his official duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the potential nominees the Administration has publicly floated have 
been Latino: Nelson Diaz, a Philadelphia judge who was later appointed general 
counsel at the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Ida Castro, a New 
York labor lawyer now at the Labor Department; and Gilbert F. Vasquez, a San 
Antonio lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But in each instance problems developed that convinced the White House to back 
off. The deciding factor each time appeared to be a lack of support from the 
major civil rights groups, a response that has created tensions between Latino 
advocacy organizations and civil rights groups with their roots primarily in 
the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino groups largely shared the skepticism concerning Diaz and Vasquez, but 
they were annoyed at the reaction to Castro, an energetic attorney who spent 
weeks visiting civil rights groups to muster support only to find her prospects 
scuttled at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been this tacit understanding (between black and Latino groups) 
that 'let's not step on each other's toes here, let's divvy up the jobs,' " 
said one civil rights attorney familiar with the discussions. "There was a 
feeling among the Hispanic community that this (appointment) was their call 
alone . . . and the other civil rights groups had undermined Castro by damning 
her with faint praise to the White House -- and that was reneging on the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 With some civil rights advocates now quietly suggesting the time has come for 
the White House to broaden the search to other ethnic groups, Latino advocates 
are reacting angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the symbolic concerns, Latinos want one of their own named to the job 
because they feel the agency historically has not focused on their concerns, 
said Charles Kamasaki, a vice president at the National Council of La Raza, a 
Latino advocacy group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 To select a non-Latino for the job now would mean the White House and other 
civil rights groups have effectively concluded that no Latino is qualified, 
Kamasaki said. "What they will have done is accept what employers have said 
about affirmative action for the past 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials say that conclusion is simplistic because the job was 
turned down by several prominent Latinos, including Raul Yzaguirre of La Raza 
in Washington and Antonia Hernandez of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Education Fund in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the White House appears eager to put the controversy to rest. 
But it will have to hurry to avoid a dubious achievement. Clinton is less than 
a month shy of the record set by Reagan when he left the agency without a 
permanent chairman for 14 1/2 months before Clarence Thomas, now a Supreme 
Court justice, was confirmed for the job in May, 1982.

BOTH SIDES OF MEXICO DRUG WARS ADORE STOLEN 4X4S; LAW: A SONG CELEBRATES 
SMUGGLERS' 'SUBURBAN OF DEATH.' SAN DIEGO OFFICIALS DEMAND ACTION TO CURB 
THEFTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In Mexico's swashbuckling drug wars, the Chevrolet Suburban rules: It is a 
getaway vehicle, a status symbol, a war wagon whose mystique blends menace and 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Suburbans, Jeep Cherokees and other U.S.-made, four-wheel-drive vehicles are 
prized by gangsters and cops, symbiotic warriors who also share a penchant for 
cowboy boots, sunglasses and AK-47 assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicles that symbolize rugged upscale comfort for Southern Californians 
have been immortalized in Mexican popular song -- the street poetry of a 
violent underworld in which drug lords replace the revolutionaries of 
traditional ballads. In "The Suburban of Death," the Monterrey-based Pioneers 
of the North croon about the exploits of two marauding traffickers in a 
Suburban stocked with machine guns and high-tech gadgetry. 
</P>
<P>
 " The Suburban of Death  
</P>
<P>
 Is what they call it everywhere  
</P>
<P>
 And Customs and soldiers can't stop it  
</P>
<P>
 When the federales see it, they better beware " 
</P>
<P>
 Four-wheel-drive vehicles have played a recurring role in a spate of 
spectacular drug-related incidents in Tijuana. And the new bloodshed has 
revived an old scandal involving the use of stolen U.S. automobiles by Mexican 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican federal police unintentionally set off a public relations bomb this 
month during their surprise arrest of Baja's deputy attorney general on 
corruption charges. Televised images showed dozens of raffish-looking federal 
officers with heavy weapons girding for combat after a brief confrontation with 
state police, then departing with the prisoner in a traffic-stopping convoy of 
Jeeps and Suburbans -- some with California license plates. 
</P>
<P>
 When record checks revealed that up to 30 unmarked police vehicles appeared to 
have been stolen north of the border, outraged San Diego County supervisors 
demanded action by the U.S. and Mexican governments. An internal investigation 
ordered by Mexico's attorney general resulted in charges against one officer 
for possession of a stolen Jeep Cherokee. Eighteen other officers have been 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexican officials were caught red-handed with the goods," said Brian Bilbray, 
a county supervisor. "We have to take care of this problem. I think all of us 
who wanted to encourage free trade across the border didn't mean this kind of 
free trade." 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of the 34,000 vehicles stolen in San Diego County last year ended up 
going south, according to U.S. law enforcement officials. Some Mexican police 
allegedly keep confiscated cars for themselves, do business with organized auto 
theft rings and even send paid enforcers, known as aspirinas , north to steal 
vehicles, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for sport utility vehicles in Mexico and Central America helps 
explain a low 20% recovery rate, compared to an overall recovery rate of about 
82% for stolen autos, according to San Diego County's Regional Auto Theft Task 
Force. U.S. authorities locate about 2,400 stolen U.S. cars in Baja each year 
with the help of Mexican authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Daniel Ryan, an FBI agent who heads the multi-agency task force, 
told a meeting of county supervisors: "Up to 30 vehicles have been seen in and 
around different (police) agencies in Mexico with either license plates that 
don't belong on them or actually stolen California license plates. . . . This 
has been an ongoing problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The brazen practice endures despite crackdowns and stern words by authorities 
in both nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, the director of Mexico's now-defunct Federal Security Directorate was 
indicted in San Diego on charges of running a theft operation that specialized 
in luxury cars. In 1991, two top commanders of the Baja California transit 
police were charged in Mexicali with buying five four-wheel-drive models from 
their alleged business partners -- professional trans-border thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 And in March, at a busy Tijuana intersection, two Suburbans carrying an elite 
team of federal agents stopped a red Suburban driven by state judicial police 
officers. The passengers allegedly included a drug lord and his bodyguards; 
they opened fire, initiating a fierce, close-quarters gunfight that left five 
men dead and ignited a political conflict between state and federal 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tijuana shootout also proved quite a shock for the Rogers family of Poway, 
a resolutely middle-class community northeast of San Diego. During a news 
broadcast about the incident, the family saw their red 1989 Suburban, which had 
been stolen two weeks earlier from a restaurant parking lot and still bore 
California plates. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle had been transformed into the "Suburban of Death." The grainy 
footage showed rivulets of blood, frenzied paramedics, sprawled bodies in the 
street beneath the open doors. Machine-gun volleys had shattered windows and 
shredded metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Korinne Rogers said the experience was "kind of eerie." And it left her 
feeling besieged. 
</P>
<P>
 "One block in my neighborhood had five different four-wheel-drives stolen in 
one night," said Rogers, a mother of four whose family owns a pizza parlor. 
"Personally, I'm getting real tired of this. Something has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. families, the image of sport utility vehicles is hip, not lethal. 
Suburbans, Cherokees and Ford Explorers have surged in popularity among that 
most ubiquitous of trendsetting demographic groups -- affluent young 
professionals. The vehicles represent a stylish reincarnation of the family 
station wagon of yore, according to auto industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, drug runners on both sides of the border, Mexican police and 
smugglers of illegal immigrants prefer the four-wheel-drive conveyances for 
similar reasons: powerful engines, an elevated view of the road and ample 
passenger and cargo space. Reckless smugglers crammed a dozen illegal 
immigrants into a stolen Suburban that crashed in Temecula in 1992 while 
fleeing from the Border Patrol, killing six people. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the sturdy machines withstand the rough urban topography of Tijuana 
(where potholes can resemble small canyons) and the rural dirt roads of Mexico 
and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their popularity, Suburbans sometimes give way to Jeep Cherokees as 
the vehicle of choice. The assassins who gunned down Tijuana's police chief in 
a highway ambush in April were driving a Cherokee and a Ford Bronco. In San 
Diego, Jeep thefts have more than doubled last year's average of about 34 a 
month, jumping to 88 in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Exasperated law enforcement experts attribute the rise in Jeep thefts, which 
has been concentrated along the Interstate 5 corridor, at least partly to the 
arrival in Tijuana of special Mexican federal police units investigating drug 
traffickers and the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio. Some officers are suspected of taking advantage of their proximity to 
San Diego to place orders for Cherokees with professional thieves, according to 
police sources on both sides of the border.

YOU SAY TOMATO, BIOTECH FIRM SAYS BONANZA

 Virginia Waters bought some to take back to Massachusetts. Bill Johnson got 
some to mail to his mom in Florida. And Connie Presley was taking some home to 
use in sandwiches for the kids' lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 At the State Market grocery store in Davis on Saturday, America's newest and 
most controversial tomatoes were selling faster than you can say marinara sauce 
as buyers came from all over to be among the first to taste and buy genetically 
engineered fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 An old-fashioned produce cart was installed at the neighborhood market and 
people gathered round to sample bites and offer critiques of the MacGregor 
tomatoes. Handing out the free samples were employees of Calgene, this 
university town's biotechnology company, which developed the tomatoes and 
Wednesday got approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers, aware of history in the making, brought along their cameras and 
photographed the plump red tomatoes and the beaming owners of the grocery store 
-- one of only two places in America you could obtain the tomatoes Saturday. 
(The other was the Carrot Top market in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, Ill.) 
</P>
<P>
 "These are wonderful," said Waters, in town visiting relatives. "They are not 
at all like the tasteless, horrible, hard things we get in Massachusetts." 
</P>
<P>
 If Calgene is right about the tomatoes, grown from its gene-spliced Flavr Savr 
seeds, Waters and Johnson needn't worry whether they will still taste good 
after being shipped across country. Calgene isolated the gene that initiates 
the tomato's rotting process, cloned the gene and reinserted it in reverse to 
neutralize or slow down the rotting process. 
</P>
<P>
 The tomatoes can be kept on the vine longer, developing the sweetness that 
most commercially grown tomatoes lack because they are picked green and ripened 
artificially. It took the company more than $25 million to develop the tomato, 
and five years to get FDA approval to market it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the State Market on Saturday, they were going for $1.99 a pound. Regular 
vine-ripened tomatoes cost $1.19. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the shoppers at the store, near UC Davis, where agriculture and 
genetics are a way of life, spoke knowledgeably about the tomatoes and the 
science used to create them. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-year-old Ellen Presley, riding in her mom's grocery cart, just kept 
saying, "They're perfect! They're perfect!" 
</P>
<P>
 But there were a few skeptics who declined an invitation to taste. One was a 
professed longtime tomato hater. Another was Eve Holloway, a 47-year-old Davis 
resident, who admitted being "a little afraid" of eating one. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway said she was concerned that future genetically engineered foods would 
not get the intense governmental scrutiny that the tomato did, and that other 
products wouldn't have to be labeled as products of genetic engineering. 
(Calgene is voluntarily labeling its tomatoes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, her apprehension wasn't strong enough to keep her 14-year-old son, Ian, 
from sampling the tomatoes, not once, but twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Gee, owner of the State Market, said he knew his customers would be 
receptive to the new tomatoes. Calgene officials said they wanted to introduce 
the tomato in just such a place as Gee's market, where family members have been 
running the store and calling customers by their first names for more than 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee also got some new customers, as word spread that the tomato was making its 
debut. One UC faculty member bicycled over from the Davis Farmer's Market, 
where he had been offered a taste of the MacGregor by a woman who bought a box 
of them to offer to the shoppers there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are as good as the ones from home," said Luis Perez, a transplant from 
Spain who was making his usual Saturday rounds of the organic produce stalls at 
the farmer's market when he tasted the new tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 The tomatoes also reminded Yukiko Clark of home. A native of Japan, she has 
lived in the United States since 1960, and in all that time, she said, she 
hasn't tasted a tomato as good as the Calgene variety, with the possible 
exception of a few grown in a friend's back yard. "When I was a child," she 
said, "we ate tomatoes as fruit, not just in salads. I think this is great. I 
can eat it like fruit again." 
</P>
<P>
 Calgene officials cheered when the first customer purchased a few pounds 
shortly after 9 a.m. One hundred sixty boxes of tomatoes were shipped in from 
the Southern California fields where they were grown; Gee expected them to be 
gone by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgene hopes to have the tomatoes in Southern California markets "as soon as 
they can be picked."

FEINSTEIN CRANKS UP APPARATUS FOR FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING and DWIGHT MORRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent two-week swing through 13 California cities, Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
gladly set aside an hour or two of her hectic schedule for anyone who could 
round up $20,000 in political contributions among friends and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The former San Francisco mayor attended seven fund-raisers within 48 hours 
during her visit to Los Angeles last month. She mingled with lawyers at the Mt. 
Washington home of Warner Bros. attorney Dan Garcia, addressed a large group of 
Hollywood women at the Regency Club, sipped wine with wealthy supporters at the 
home of Beverly Hills Mayor Vicki Reynolds, chatted about health care reform 
with concerned physicians in Brentwood and schmoozed with women attorneys at 
the Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven events' total take: $250,000, or enough to buy about four minutes of 
prime-time ads in the Los Angeles TV market. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though statewide polls rate her as California's most popular politician 
and she will cruise to victory in the upcoming June 7 Democratic primary, 
Feinstein figures she needs to raise $30,000 a day between now and November to 
thwart a potential challenge from Republican multimillionaire Michael 
Huffington. A first-term Santa Barbara congressman, Huffington has vowed to 
spend whatever it takes -- as much as $15 million or more of his own money -- 
to unseat Feinstein if he wins the GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most pundits regard Huffington as the underdog in his quest for the 
Senate, Feinstein is taking no chances. A prodigious fund-raiser, she has raked 
in $32 million in political contributions since running for governor in 1990 -- 
more than any other member of Congress. Feinstein and her campaign staff spend 
huge amounts of time soliciting contributions, devising innovative ways to 
recruit new donors and lining up heavyweight rainmakers like President Clinton, 
who appeared Friday night at a West Los Angeles fund-raiser on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Between her full-time Senate duties, Feinstein seizes nearly every free moment 
to pad her campaign treasury. This means occasionally standing on the sidewalk 
outside her Capitol Hill office talking on a cellular phone to potential donors 
or taking most Friday afternoons off to dial for dollars from her Washington 
townhouse. Monthly trips to California are dominated by fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's approach is paying dividends. Through the end of March, her 
campaign took in $4.1 million -- about $1 million ahead of her pace two years 
ago when she raised $8.1 million to defeat incumbent John Seymour. This time, 
she has a goal of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that I have to be aggressive in fund raising," Feinstein said 
matter-of-factly. "The goal is to go toe-to-toe and to be competitive and to 
raise whatever I have to raise to win the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she says she regrets having to spend so much time raising money, the 
60-year-old Feinstein shrugs off the demands of her sixth major political 
campaign since becoming mayor of San Francisco in 1979. "My frame of mind 
surprises me that it is as good as it is," she said. "I'm fairly relaxed. I 
don't seem to have the anxiety levels that I've had in the past. I don't know 
whether it is age or having done it so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Her biggest obstacle, Feinstein said, is complacency. In a year when 
California Democrats are focused on wresting the governor's seat from 
Republican Pete Wilson, Feinstein is finding it a challenge to persuade party 
loyalists that a popular senator who is expected to win reelection needs their 
financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
 At every opportunity, Feinstein emphasizes the threat posed by Huffington's 
wealth. She stresses in fund-raising appeals that she is running against a rich 
man who could easily outspend her by more than a 2-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent statewide Field Poll will undoubtedly be used to sound a wake-up call 
among Feinstein supporters. The poll, conducted May 11-16, showed that a 
commanding 26-point lead (56-30) held by Feinstein in April has dwindled to 
seven points (48-41) after a $4-million television advertising blitz by 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now people realize this is going to be a tough race," said Kam Kuwata, 
Feinstein's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment executive Dawn Steel said Huffington's wealth motivated her to 
organize last month's Regency Club breakfast that netted about $50,000 for 
Feinstein's campaign. "We can't let this guy buy his way into the Senate. If he 
wins, it sends a message that is really scary," Steel said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help reach the $10-million goal, Feinstein has tapped the wallets of 
big-business and special-interest lobbyists in Washington. Her campaign has 
received $856,371 in political action committee funds, or 21% of total 
contributions through the end of March. This is a significant increase from 
Feinstein's 1992 Senate race, when only 12% of her contributions came from 
PACs. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein expressed little concern in a series of interviews that her campaign 
has grown more dependent on special-interest money and less dependent on 
individual donors than when she initially ran for the Senate as an outsider and 
so-called agent of change. She said she is not beholden to any special interest 
because her campaign has raised money from a wide range of groups and about 
40,000 individuals so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole political life, I've always been an independent person," Feinstein 
said. "Anybody who thinks because they contribute a thousand dollars or $5,000 
that it is going to earn a vote, they are absolutely wrong. I take great pride 
in this. I was that kind of mayor. And I'm that kind of senator." 
</P>
<P>
 Should Feinstein face Huffington in the November election, she can expect a 
barrage of television commercials attacking her for accepting millions of 
dollars in special-interest donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington charges that Feinstein, as one of the wealthiest members of 
Congress, can easily afford to refuse special-interest money from unions, 
health organizations, defense firms, the entertainment industry, lawyers, 
farmers and other groups that seek her help on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't have to take the money," said Huffington, who does not accept PAC 
donations. "I'm saying to her: 'If you truly want to be independent and truly 
want to represent the people of the state who cannot afford high-priced 
lobbyists and lawyers, you can spend your own money.' . . . To me, it is a 
major difference between her and me, and I will point that out constantly in 
this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein called Huffington's criticism unfair, saying that her family's 
wealth is mostly tied up in her husband's merchant-banking business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the ability to go out there and fund this campaign myself," said 
Feinstein, who poured $3 million of her own money into her failed bid for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after she was sworn into the Senate in November, 1992, 
Feinstein began to assemble a formidable fund-raising organization in 
Washington. Because she filled the remainder of Wilson's term, Feinstein had 
only two years -- not the traditional six -- to gear up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein flew to Florida a few weeks after she arrived in Washington for the 
first of many weekend fund-raisers in major cities across the country. She also 
opened a Washington fund-raising office to solicit funds from corporate trade 
groups and special interests that ply the congressional lobbying circuit. The 
office was run by Priscilla Burton, Feinstein's chief fund-raiser -- who is 
paid $10,000 a month -- before she moved to campaign headquarters in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of her colleagues in the Senate, Feinstein hosted a series of 
receptions to gather PAC donations at prominent Washington spots. Last year, 
for example, Northrop Corp. paid $1,068 to host a fund-raiser for Feinstein at 
the Washington Court Hotel. Northrop is one of 23 defense firms that have given 
Feinstein, a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, a total of 
$66,067 in political action committee funds to date. This amount is far more 
than the $25,350 Feinstein received from defense PACs during the entire 1992 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein also has reached out to California agribusiness, an industry that 
strongly backed her Republican opponent in 1992. In January, 1993, about 80 
farmers attended a reception at the Mapes Ranch in Modesto that raised about 
$75,000 for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized we needed a voice in the United States Senate," said John Peace, 
director of political education for the California Farm Bureau. "We have been 
extremely happy with Dianne Feinstein's performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has been a champion of agricultural interests in the Senate. She 
altered her sweeping California desert protection bill to eliminate 
restrictions on cattle grazing, fought for the continuation of unpopular 
government subsidies for wool and mohair ranchers, and swiftly relayed farmers' 
concerns regarding Medfly infestation to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, Peace 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers have reciprocated. So far, agricultural PACs have donated $93,043 to 
Feinstein. This makes up 11% of her PAC receipts, a steep increase compared to 
1992, when farmers provided only 2% of Feinstein's PAC money. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's reliance on political action committees follows a consistent 
pattern for newly elected members of Congress once they get to Washington, 
according to advocates of campaign reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is an outsider no longer and the way she raises money reflects that," 
said Ellen Miller, director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. 
"We see it all the time. The longer they stay in Congress, the more their 
campaign coffers are filled by the economic interests that have business before 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 But campaign finance experts say it should come as no surprise that 
Feinstein's fund-raising profile changed once she entered the Senate. They note 
that, whenever a sitting senator is challenged by a wealthy opponent with 
access to unlimited funds, the incumbent has little choice but to build a 
sufficient war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're an incumbent and you are sitting there with $6 (million) or $8 
million and your opponent has twice that much, you start getting scared," said 
Herbert E. Alexander, director of USC's Citizens' Research Foundation. "So I 
don't fault her at all for doing what she can to raise money." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Feinstein seems oblivious to criticism that she is becoming too 
reliant on special-interest money. In an interview, she said she was unaware 
that her campaign had raised $856,371 from PACs, suggesting the figure was less 
than half that amount. Nor does Feinstein intend to limit the amount of PAC 
money she receives, despite supporting campaign finance reform legislation that 
would ban PAC giving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been part of the Washington scene for that long (so) that's not 
really part of my fund-raising base," Feinstein said. "I am taking PAC money to 
the extent to which I can get (it). . . . There's some we won't take." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she refuses to accept PAC money from three special interests -- 
makers of tobacco products, oil companies and a third group she could not 
immediately recall. Campaign manager Kuwata identified the three groups as 
tobacco interests, pro-gun lobbyists, and savings and loan associations -- all 
groups that are unlikely to give to Feinstein in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Feinstein's campaign refunded contributions to cigarette 
makers Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of Feinstein's contributions come from individuals who mail 
in checks and supporters who meet the senator at receptions. Whenever Feinstein 
travels to California, she attempts to squeeze in as many events as possible 
for groups that can muster at least $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Her task is made more difficult by federal limits on contributions. 
Individuals may only donate $1,000 per candidate for primary and general 
elections, and PACs are limited to $5,000 apiece. No such limits apply to races 
for state office in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California gubernatorial race was easy to raise money for compared to 
this," Feinstein said. "This is hard." 
</P>
<P>
 With a Democrat in the White House, however, Feinstein is getting her share of 
assistance. In November, the President appeared at a San Francisco fund-raiser 
for Feinstein that yielded $700,000. Clinton was expected to raise another 
$700,000 for Feinstein at Friday's $1,000-per-head event at the West Los 
Angeles home of Ron Burkle, Feinstein's campaign finance chairman, who owns the 
Food 4 Less grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Feinstein has invested at least $1.3 million in campaign funds to raise 
money, records show. This compares to only $123,248 in total fund-raising 
expenses for Huffington, who has written personal checks to his campaign 
totaling $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Huffington has raised only $153,153 in individual contributions of 
$200 or more, records show. Huffington's enormous wealth, combined with his 
willingness to finance his own campaign, affords him the luxury of not having 
to worry about fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather meet the people and get out the word I care about them and the 
future of our state," Huffington said.

HAYDEN: ZEN AND THE ART OF RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR; ELECTIONS: HIS CAMPAIGN IS AS 
MUCH A JOURNEY OF SELF-REALIZATION AS IT IS ABOUT POLITICAL DESTINY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is serious stuff, this business of running for governor. So why is Tom 
Hayden -- the activist with the angry edge, the man who thwarted the 
Establishment during the Vietnam War, the non-glamour half of Jane and Tom, the 
man whose sober warnings of California crises have been uttered regularly for 
years -- why is he having fun? 
</P>
<P>
 On the patio of a Santa Monica cafe, where the next table's raucous rendition 
of "Happy Birthday" has just ruined part of Hayden's interview with a local 
television station, the candidate launches into a serious discussion of his 
place in the political landscape. Suddenly, he veers off. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this guy in San Francisco. We were asking him what he knew about 
Hayden," the state senator says. "He said: 'He was married to that woman who 
channels -- what's her name? -- Shirley MacLaine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Fonda's ex-husband let loose a well-timed grin. "Wwweeellll, it's a 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the final weeks of the gubernatorial primary campaign, a time when 
humor has abandoned most candidates. It is a time when the answers to every 
question come out rote, memorized from briefing books or memos, when the sheer 
physical drain of a long campaign starts to wear out even the most hardy of 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 And into this increasingly tense race for governor has come the loquacious 
Hayden, the state's least likely purveyor of the politics of joy, having a darn 
good time slashing away at big-time politics even as he seeks to become the 
state's big-time politician. His message is simple: The political system 
stinks, so let's reform it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he has little chance of winning, say the seers and pundits, mindful of 
the huge advantages held by Democratic front-runner Kathleen Brown and a second 
major candidate, John Garamendi. But that would be measuring Hayden's campaign 
by conventional standards and that, in the words of President Richard Nixon, 
whom Hayden battled in the streets, would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden wants to win, no doubt about that. In his ever-so-equivocal style, he 
offers his reasoning: "I'm as frail and flawed as anybody else, but I've seen 
the people who have been governor and I think I can do that job." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is about more than winning. This is about Hayden fulfilling his 
destiny -- spiritual and political. It is about Hayden becoming more than the 
four words he says capture his image among California voters: '60s radical, 
Jane Fonda. He is driving this vehicle of self-realization, and everyone else 
is invited along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is a California original, right down to the fact that he was born elsewhere 
and has remade himself a few times over: From the war protester to the 
legislator, from the man who questioned the state Senate's necktie rule to the 
guy in the nice midnight blue linen suit and tie that matches, wending his way 
from interview to interview on a recent campaign day. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Hayden's rogue charm is that he plays all the parts at the same time 
with chameleon-like ease. Put former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., who 
shares Hayden's outsider, save the planet views, into a room with the state's 
political aristocracy and he can look physically ill. Hayden, by contrast, is 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 He has even come to look like one of them -- at 54, his hair is graying 
distinctively around the temples. But he will never sound like them, not with 
the things that keep coming out of his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 What other candidate, when asked why he is running for governor, says that the 
Jan. 17 earthquake jolted him into questioning his "time on earth"? 
</P>
<P>
 What other candidate, asked his political profile, says earnestly: "I'm 
Jeffersonian in terms of democracy, I'm Thoreau in terms of environment, and 
Crazy Horse in terms of social movements"? 
</P>
<P>
 What other candidate circulates as the mailer for his $94-or-less fund-raiser 
a picture of himself being beaten to the ground during a 1961 voter 
registration drive in Mississippi -- complete with the line: "You can't keep a 
good man down"? 
</P>
<P>
 And he has a talent for making it all sound, well, reasonable.  
</P>
<P>
 Ask him if he is still the rebel liberal, an appellation bestowed upon him by 
this newspaper, and Hayden will heartily agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope so. What other honorable path is there?" he says, as if mystified by 
the question. "We live in a city with 105 square miles of poverty. . . . We 
have the most poisoned air in the United States. We've lost 300,000 to 400,000 
jobs in the past three to four years just in this district. If you don't rebel 
against this fate, God help you. What's the alternative?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hayden has heard all the criticisms -- that by running for governor he 
is ego-tripping or, worse in the eyes of Democrats, possibly harming his 
party's candidates. He doesn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really running against anybody," he said. "I'm running against the 
established order of things and I think Kathleen and John kind of reflect 
established thinking. . . . You're trying to win but it's not like you're 
trying to annihilate the other person." 
</P>
<P>
 His anti-Establishment attitude started early. "I was told it was adolescent 
rebellion 40 years ago," he says wryly. "I've finally come to the conclusion 
that sure, some of it's hormonal, but that doesn't explain the lifelong nature 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He is comfortable enough in the Establishment, however, to have been part of 
it for years. In 1982, he won election to the Assembly; 10 years later he moved 
up to the Senate in a hugely expensive and nasty race funded largely by his 
Fonda divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 This campaign, however, is hardly the juggernaut. It has, by the count of 
campaign manager Duane Peterson, a staff of nine people. The campaign on which 
Peterson worked four years ago -- Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's bid for 
governor -- had nine people just on its fund-raising staff, and that for a 
campaign which nearly ran out of money before the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps when the candidate doubles as research director, speech writer and 
chief strategist," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California headquarters are in an office in back of Hayden's 
Santa Monica home, the only one on its fashionable block where the front lawn 
has been torn up in favor of a rebellious thatch of wildflowers and a discreet 
compost bin. Hayden is his campaign's biggest donor -- he expects to spend 
hundreds of thousands of dollars before it is over and, in keeping with his 
reform strategy, will accept contributions of $94 or less to pay back his 
personal loans. It leaves the operation "lean and mean," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 That much can be gleaned from Hayden's occasional obsessions about things that 
a more conventional candidate would never have to consider -- for example, how 
to get the campaign a few cars so volunteers do not have to take the bus on 
their voter forays.

 Careening down the Santa Monica Freeway from one appearance to the next, he 
moaned via cellular phone to Peterson in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need help from our criminal supporters," he says. "Go to the chop shop and 
get a car, for God's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 Honest, he was kidding.

 Hayden's good humor, relative to the other candidates, should not be mistaken 
for a laissez-faire attitude about the governorship. About this, he is deadly 
serious. And although his chances of winning are slight, he has been given high 
marks by observers for his emphasis on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely, unless pressed, will Hayden take off on a tirade about his opponents. 
He saves his powder for the system. Much of his time is spent attacking the 
gravy train that links the state's lobbyists and its politicians. His campaign 
video, which is being run on cable stations statewide, underscored that with 
the presence of former legislator Alan Robbins, who served prison time for 
taking bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The modern campaign has become a kind of sport in which you have a cell phone 
on your ear and you're asking for large sums of money from special interest 
groups to give to people who produce television images of you and you can rest 
content that many more people will see those television spots than will ever 
hear an interview, a discussion or read the Los Angeles Times," Hayden says. 
"So it's become more about merchandising and less about anything that's 
meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
 His solution is a $250 limit on campaign contributions, removing tax breaks 
for lobbyists and enforcing sanctions for political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was first among the candidates to release a budget proposal, although 
his was spare on some important details. In general, he favors closing $3 
billion in tax loopholes, trimming the state's bureaucracy by $1 billion and 
refusing to fund the recently approved "three strikes" legislation, which he 
considers fiscally reckless. He has vowed to cut student fees at the state's 
universities and colleges, spend more money on seismic safety and create an 
electric car industry in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, he says, could be attacked by creating police and teacher corps made up 
of thousands of college students. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving through Hollywood, where graffiti mark gangland territories, Hayden 
says he considers the state's fixation with crime a "real problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world is in spasms that we're not immune from," he says. "Religious 
disputes, racial grievances, poverty, drugs. It's apocalyptic out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Any politician is ambitious. In Hayden's campaign meanderings, there is also 
something else -- a sense that he is captive to a need for personal momentum, a 
demand to move from one psychic place to another. Ask him and he will agree. 
The campaign is only one manifestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm also restless about trying to get to the bottom of things and be 
spiritually grounded and make and get a better understanding of what is going 
on," he says. "It's one thing to say the system doesn't work and all the 
formulas for full employment and health care are brain-dead or tired or old 
ideas. But to really try to understand crime, drugs, despair, unemployment and 
put it into context -- I'm a seeker." 
</P>
<P>
 Spirituality and the pacifism that it suggests seem far from the Hayden of 
old. Indeed, the old rage seems to have tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've begun to learn that while rage and hate are natural impulses, they are 
not sustaining," he said. "I don't think I would have survived this long in 
movements or politics if I was fueled by the same level of anger that I was 
fueled by in the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, Hayden's campaign manager and longtime aide, says the candidate is 
more centered than in the past, in part because of his marriage in August to 
actress Barbara Williams and his more prominent role in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "And running statewide is exciting," Peterson said. "California is a fantastic 
place and having an excuse and/or being forced to travel to the broad reaches 
is fun." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hayden, the campaign for governor is not only an opportunity to seek deep 
answers but also a chance to remake his image, which seems to have stalled a 
generation ago. It has been, after all, 26 years since the height of his 
student radical days; he and Fonda split five years ago. Still, he is well 
aware that most Californians think of him in those distant terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, I was feeling sort of upset that one's life could come down 
to such labels," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he takes heart from the symbolism in his favorite book, Hermann Hesse's 
"Siddhartha." 
</P>
<P>
 Any other candidate might shy away from such symbolic comparisons. Hayden 
openly makes them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the role of somebody who wants enlightenment and wants meaning but 
understands they can't have it without it happening for everyone at the same 
time," he says, speaking about Siddhartha and himself. "The quest for your own 
discovery of meaning is tied in with the need for everybody to have meaning."

ON THE BOSNIA FRONT, LINES BECOME BLURRED; BALKANS: VICTIMS, AGGRESSORS OFTEN 
TRADE ROLES AND 'HAVEN' BORDERS ARE UNCLEAR. U.N. TROOPS CAN ONLY WATCH.

<P>
 When shooting starts each night at sunset on the lush, wooded hills across 
from 2nd Lt. Jens Karegren's hilltop tank unit, there is little the Nordic 
soldiers can do but settle in and watch the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the bullets, mortars and tank rounds of the Bosnian government or 
Serbian troops are targeted at the U.N. forces, the peacekeepers posted on a 
promontory along the aid route to nearby Tuzla are forbidden to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuzla and its surroundings are a U.N.-designated "safe haven," and Serbian 
artillery fire against the civilian communities here could be construed as 
grounds for calling in NATO air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this third year of Bosnian bloodshed, lines between victims and 
perpetrators have blurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Government forces, battle-hardened and determined to recover the homes and 
land lost to the Serbian rebel onslaught, have gone on the offensive at this 
front-line flash point. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles north, at another tense observation point manned by the U.N. 
Nordic Battalion in the village of Jajici, it is the Serbs who routinely shell 
the surrounding Muslim villages. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting has flared for the past week along much of the northern and 
eastern edges of what is known as the Tuzla pocket, the largest expanse of 
Bosnian territory still in government hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outbreaks are mostly unsuccessful skirmishes by punch-drunk fighters 
who take a few yards of territory one day only to lose it the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Their danger, say officers of the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
is that they undermine an already stalled peace process by allowing both sides 
to continue seeking a military solution to the conflict -- even though nearly 
everyone agrees there isn't one. 
</P>
<P>
 The clashes and political bickering between the Sarajevo government and 
Serbian rebels are also delaying the start of a humanitarian airlift to this 
area, where refugees have swollen the population to nearly 1 million. The 
on-again, off-again air deliveries are meant to augment unreliable road 
shipments of food for the impoverished homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 With no credible promise of a just resolution in Western-mediated peace talks, 
the battles wear on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like during World War I, when everyone was too exhausted to do anything 
but stay in the trenches and shoot back and forth," said 2nd Lt. Johann 
Heimdahl, commander of the 13-member unit at Jajici, known as Tango-2. "You can 
see that the soldiers are tired, that they are being forced to keep fighting. 
Only the armies have food, so if the men refused to fight, their families would 
starve." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimdahl's assessment is echoed by the straggling forces visible on the roads 
throughout government-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all want there to be peace so we can go home again. But for many there 
will be no homes to go back to," said Mensur Karic, a 26-year-old hollow-eyed 
fighter from Tuzla, trekking back from the trenches after a wearying Saturday 
in unseasonable heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The government forces have resisted Western-mediated peace moves out of fear 
that a cease-fire now would freeze the lopsided status quo that has 70% of 
Bosnian territory in Serbian hands. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Serbs are reluctant to seek peace if it means giving up large swaths 
of land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem we have here is the lack of will for peace on both 
sides," said Lt. Col. Lars Eliasson, the Nordic Battalion's Swedish chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a U.N. plan to compel the weary combatants to negotiate, a 
sophisticated radar system is being installed at Tuzla's airport that will be 
able to pinpoint which side has opened fire on the other along the length of 
the most active front line in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-made equipment, run by Jordanian troops, is due to come into 
operation by June 1, Eliasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is worried, however, that the radar project could backfire if the U.N. 
mission fails to delineate exactly what territory it considers a protected area 
and establish a clear practice of hitting back at anyone who endangers it. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. "safe haven" of Gorazde suffered a pounding by Serbian forces last 
month after U.N. commanders ignored an initial peppering by rebel artillery, 
and both military and civilian officials dithered over what areas of the mostly 
Muslim enclave they were bound to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests for NATO air strikes to repel Serbian attackers in the Tuzla pocket 
and in Gorazde have also been met with inconsistent replies by U.N. officials 
in Sarajevo and at mission headquarters in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion within the U.N. mission has apparently led both sides in the 
conflict to believe that they can launch offensives in designated safe areas 
with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to have safe areas, they have to be just that," Eliasson 
warned. "If it is only a word, it will soon mean nothing."

BATTLES RAGE IN RWANDA AS TALKS STALL; AFRICA: REBELS REJECT U.N. PLAN TO 
REOPEN AIRPORT IN KIGALI AND LAUNCH FIERCE OFFENSIVE ON GOVERNMENT POSITIONS. 
PEACEKEEPERS CAN DO LITTLE BUT TAKE COVER.

 Heavy fighting raged around the airport in Rwanda's capital Saturday, keeping 
Kigali's last link to the outside world closed and raising doubts about the 
United Nations' ability to establish a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. official in Kigali reached by phone from Nairobi said it was unclear 
whether the intensified fighting was the start of the rebels' long-promised 
offensive to capture the capital. The rebels have said they plan to take the 
city before the United Nations dispatches about 5,500 more peacekeeping troops 
to Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 About 450 U.N. troops, mostly Africans under the command of Canadian Brig. 
Gen. Romeo Dallaire, are in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 With both sides in the ethnic battle apparently unwilling to halt their fire, 
the U.N. role has been reduced to a passive one spent in foxholes around the 
severely damaged airport facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. official in Kigali, Abdul Kabia, said that if the attacks on the 
airport continue, the troops may redeploy. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have been trying to broker an agreement whereby both sides 
would withdraw all weapons at least 1 1/4 miles from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday, U.N. spokesman Maj. Jean-Guy Plante said the rebels rejected the 
plan. "The rebels said it is too late," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No U.N. relief flights have been able to land at Kigali for three days because 
of the fighting, leaving the city seriously short of food and medicine. The Red 
Cross suspended its relief convoy after one of its physicians was wounded in an 
ambush Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day Saturday, rebel mortars and rockets struck government 
positions around the airport. Six U.N. vehicles were destroyed, but there were 
no reported U.N. casualties. Other shells slammed into the city's center, and 
small-arms fire was heard in villages on the capital's perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kanombe army camp just east of the airport is defended by three battalions 
of government troops, from the Hutu tribe. But the hills overlooking the camp 
in the airport are controlled by the mostly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels claim to control about half of the country and apparently have cut 
the roads leading to Kigali. The government troops, supplied primarily by 
Zaire, are said to be running low on fuel and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ugandan-supplied rebels have appeared to be in a position to launch a 
major offensive on Kigali for about 10 days, diplomats in Nairobi said, but 
their inability to dislodge the Kanombe defenders has delayed any decisive 
battle in the 4-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Since fighting intensified last month, at least 200,000 people have been 
killed; some estimates put the toll at up to 500,000. At least 2 million 
Rwandans have fled the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite numerous failed cease-fires, special U.N. envoy Iqbal Riza is 
scheduled to arrive in Kigali on Monday to discuss with both sides an expanded 
U.N. role and the deployment of 5,500 African troops, approved last week by the 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil war has simmered in Rwanda since 1990. The latest round of ferocious 
fighting and appalling massacre began April 6, when Rwanda's president, Juvenal 
Habyarimana, died in a plane crash at Kigali upon returning from a negotiating 
session with the rebels in Tanzania. His plane apparently was hit by a rocket. 
The president of Burundi, Cyprian Ntayamira, also died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel forces are mostly Tutsis, the tall, lithe minority that held the 
short, stocky Hutu majority in a form of serfdom for 400 years until a 
revolution in 1959. Almost 90% of Rwanda's people are Hutu. 
</P>
<P>
 Since independence from Belgium in 1962, the Hutus have run the government, 
and fighting between the two groups has flared periodically. Fifteen months 
ago, Tutsi rebels launched an offensive that brought them to within 16 miles of 
Kigali. France flew in 400 troops to protect its nationals and, in the process, 
may have saved Kigali from falling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsi rebels and the Hutu government reached an accord in Arusha, 
Tanzania, last August to end the war and lay the foundation for a broad-based 
transitional government and multi-party democratic elections. The two sides 
were struggling toward that goal when Habyarimana, a Hutu, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims of the recent killings have been Tutsi civilians, not 
military personnel. Thousands died as Hutu mobs attacked Tutsi villages with 
machetes and knives. Hundreds of thousands of Tutsis -- and some Hutus 
sympathetic to Habyarimana's attempts to establish ethnic parliaments -- have 
flooded into makeshift refugee camps in neighboring Burundi, Tanzania and 
Uganda.

<P>
 Between 1965 and 1971, five healthy babies were born here to a poor woman who 
seemed to want them desperately and who mourned each of their deaths with a 
convulsive grief that quavered the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 At one funeral, Waneta Hoyt fainted after the lowering of the tiny, pitiful 
coffin and at another, her body collapsed with the great force of her sobbing. 
She had to be helped away from the freshly turned soil at the graveside. 
</P>
<P>
 These family tragedies, one after another, puzzled friends and relatives as 
well as the doctors. The deaths were always sudden, the causes inexplicable. 
The final two babies spent most of their short lives in a Syracuse hospital, 
their every breath monitored by machines. On occasion, they suffered slightly 
abnormal pauses in respiration. Then, like matchsticks lit against an 
unforgiving wind, they each died within a day after being sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 As a medical case history, this haunting clockwork of mortality seemed a 
significant tale to share. One of the hospital's attending physicians, Dr. 
Alfred Steinschneider, wrote it up for the noted journal Pediatrics. He went on 
to become a national expert on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 That 1972 article was seen as pioneering work. Pediatricians often cited it as 
evidence that the unexplained phenomenon of SIDS may well run in families. 
Those abnormal pauses in breathing could be foretellers of a sudden death. If 
so, SIDS was possibly preventable with the use of monitoring devices at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Those conclusions aside, there was also a second, starkly contrary view of 
Steinschneider's report. Some doctors thought it naive. SIDS cases were too 
often indistinguishable from smothering. To them, the repeating catastrophes of 
this woebegone family read like the relentless clues in a murder mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an arcane, scholarly conflict, easing into obscurity over the years. 
But time on occasion has a remarkable way of turning backflips, the present 
reaching into the past. That is what has happened here. A chance remark to a 
young prosecutor made him look up the old article and he also began to wonder: 
Were there awful secrets afloat in a grieving mother's tears? 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, 23 years after the death of her fifth baby, Waneta Hoyt was 
interrogated by police for the first time. Questioning went on for almost two 
hours before something gave way. The mother then began to confess the details 
of five suffocations, by pillows, with a towel, against the soft flesh of her 
shoulder: "I could not stand the crying," she told police. "It was the thing 
that caused me to kill them all, because I didn't know what to do for them." 
</P>
<P>
 And, for a while, that appeared to be that. Waneta Hoyt -- 47, housewife, 
churchgoer, the mother of an adopted boy now in high school -- was arrested. It 
added yet another to a peculiar string of cases, women accused of murdering 
their babies, the deaths often first thought to be SIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, through her two court-appointed attorneys, Hoyt has recanted. They 
say their frail, emotionally scarred client would have admitted to anything 
that day merely to end the long cross-fire of painful questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, that is what her many friends here in Upstate New York choose to 
believe. Memories are vivid of Waneta making her visits to the graves, laying 
crocuses near the headstones, pining to give birth to yet another child. 
</P>
<P>
 Life may be complicated, they acknowledge, and the human mind is capable of 
who knows what. But, really now, could that woman love her babies so much and 
then kill them? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waneta Hoyt was born in nearby Richford, N.Y., the same birthplace as John D. 
Rockefeller, himself a pauper who left the town as a boy and went on to become 
the wealthiest man in the world. He would return from time to time and hand out 
shiny dimes in front of the general store from his chauffeured car. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rockefeller's time, a century ago, this was a poor, if picturesque, part of 
America. These days, good jobs are still scarce in the northern reaches of 
Appalachia. Tim Hoyt, Waneta's husband for the last 30 years, has had trouble 
finding construction work and is a Pinkerton guard at Cornell University, 30 
miles away through the dairy farms and hilly stands of hemlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Newark Valley, population 1,190, the Hoyts live in a weather-beaten 
house along a two-lane highway. Many people not only leave their front doors 
unlocked, some can't even recall if they have a key. At the United Methodist 
Church up the road, Waneta is known for her generous nature, the craftsmanship 
of her crocheted afghans and a long, mind-boggling run of heartache. 
</P>
<P>
 Her own health is a continuing ordeal. Waneta has a heart murmur and is bent 
over from arthritis. High-blood pressure and diabetes have weakened her 
eyesight. Breathing is a labor. Her bones are brittle from osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Family troubles add to the strain. One of Waneta's brothers is disabled from a 
hip degeneration. Another has cancer. One sister suffers from a brain tumor. 
Another, immobile from the waist down, is married to Tim's brother, who has 
multiple sclerosis. In 1989, Waneta's mother died in an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a well person in the family," said Art Hilliard, a friend of the 
Hoyts since their childhoods. "It has just been one trauma after another." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, nothing has been harder to endure than the loss of the babies. Erik 
died at 3 months, Julie at only 7 weeks, James at 28 months (thought to have 
choked after eating breakfast). Those were impossible times for the Hoyts. 
"They'd be leaning on each other, crying, trying to be strong for each other," 
recalled Hilliard's wife, Natalie. 
</P>
<P>
 Around town, the common sentiments were ones of sympathy, not suspicion. An 
autopsy was performed on only one of the three children; it was inconclusive. 
The Hoyts simply seemed to be an impossibly star-crossed couple. 
</P>
<P>
 They lamented as much themselves. Something haywire must be deep-set within 
their babies, they told friends. The Hilliards and the Hoyts would play canasta 
late into the night, trying to keep their minds from morbid thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 When Molly was born, and then again with Noah, the Hoyts sought help from the 
best doctors around, at Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse, nearly two hours 
away. Dr. Steinschneider was there. He already had an emerging interest in the 
phenomenon that most people called "crib death" and doctors recently had named 
the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 As a medical term, SIDS is certainly an unusual one. Rather than a cause of 
death, it is actually the absence of any detectable cause after an autopsy and 
investigation: a catchall for the unexplained. Each year, about 7,000 deaths in 
the United States are categorized as SIDS. Devastated parents find the term 
something to cling to, better than the maddening "cause unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinschneider's paper, and similar work by others, gave doctors something to 
latch onto as well. Maybe some babies in jeopardy could be identified -- and 
the fatal attack prevented. "It was a happier scenario," Steinschneider 
recently recalled. "I think that's why it had such a major impact." 
</P>
<P>
 But the facts in the article, merely striking to some, were incredible to 
others. The journal printed a letter from a doctor who raised the matter of 
child abuse. The babies should have been put in foster care rather than sent 
home, the writer said: "Perhaps the outcome would have been different?" 
</P>
<P>
 In his reply, Steinschneider agreed that child abuse must always be considered 
in SIDS cases. But, in this instance, both he and the nurses had found the 
babies' parents to be warm and supportive people. He had this to add about the 
couple he identified only as Mr. and Mrs. H.: 
</P>
<P>
 "Both parents often would be found sitting by the crib and had to be urged to 
make physical contact with the baby. It was my impression that they feared 
becoming too attached emotionally . . . because they anticipated a tragic 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. H. expressed, on a number of occasions, considerable guilt over the 
death of her children, and, because of the inability of physicians to define 
the cause of death, felt there must be something she did or failed to do that 
was responsible. Following the death of the fifth infant, Mrs. H. did seek and 
receive outpatient psychiatric care." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One skeptic of the 1972 article was Dr. Linda Norton of Dallas, a forensic 
pathologist prone to complaining about the medical Establishment. In lectures, 
she sometimes singled out the Steinschneider report for particular scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton does a lot of consulting. In 1986, she found herself in Syracuse, 
working on a case where a father had murdered his three young children. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistant district attorney was William Fitzpatrick, an aggressive, steely 
prosecutor from Brooklyn. He thought the crime extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell, Norton told him, you may have the same kind of trouble "right in your 
own back yard, and that case is famous. You can look it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The remark ate at Fitzpatrick. He got the article. Doctors comfort the bereft 
and may be inclined to overlook the possibility of foul play. But a prosecutor 
is paid to be suspicious. To Fitzpatrick, this read like homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked myself: How could this be, the killing of five children, obvious to 
anyone, going undetected?" he said. He opened a preliminary file. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the happenstances of career, he left the job for private practice 
only to return in 1992 after winning election as district attorney. This time, 
he ordered an investigation. There were these clues to go on: the initials of 
the babies, the name of the hospital, the general time frame of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "One child had been autopsied, so there had to be some kind of report on 
file," Fitzpatrick said. "The name Noah Hoyt popped out. It fit perfectly. He 
was 2 1/2 months old. His diagnosis was SIDS. So now I had a name and an 
autopsy number. I subpoenaed the medical records from Upstate Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several hundred sheets of paper came in, chronicling the life history of this 
young lad, Noah Hoyt. It was really so sad. For some reason, I developed an 
emotional attachment to Noah, you know, reading a record of virtually every day 
in his life. He was going to end up like the other four babies. You wanted to 
just reach back in through the hands of time and protect him." 
</P>
<P>
 Noah had suffered those breathing problems, sometimes bad enough to turn blue. 
There was a curious pattern to the attacks, the prosecutor noted: "They all 
happened while the child was in the exclusive control of the mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Two medical examiners were brought in to confer. They also went through the 
records, including autopsies of the fourth and fifth children. Based on the 
circumstantial evidence, both agreed with Fitzpatrick: They thought the mother 
was a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 The last address in the file was in Tioga County. The Hoyts were not hard to 
find. The local prosecutor was notified, and the state police began their own 
investigation -- criminal checks, employment records, birth certificates, 
marriage license, credit profile, toll calls. The Hoyts were as clean as could 
be, and there was only one more thing to do: bring the woman in for a talk. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Three state troopers sat in the interrogation room with Waneta. Several 
observers, including Fitzpatrick, were able to watch and listen through a 
two-way mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman seemed unruffled as they dredged up her tragedies. Then, near the 
two-hour mark, the questioning took a sharper turn, with the police bluffing 
that they knew the whole truth, that she had killed them all. Suddenly, Waneta 
stiffened. And then this is what she said of her five babies, according to 
court records: 
</P>
<P>
 Erik (died Jan. 26, 1965, at 3 months, 10 days): "He was crying at the time 
and I wanted him to stop. I held a pillow -- it might have been a sofa throw 
pillow -- over his face while I was sitting on the couch. I don't remember if 
he struggled or not, but he did bleed from the mouth and nose." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie (died Sept. 5, 1968, 1 month, 17 days): "I held her nose and mouth into 
my shoulder until she stopped struggling." 
</P>
<P>
 James (died Sept. 26, 1968, 2 years, 4 months): "I was in the bathroom getting 
dressed and he wanted to come in. He came in . . . and I made him go out. He 
started crying, 'Mommy, mommy.' I wanted him to stop crying for me so I used a 
bath towel to smother him." 
</P>
<P>
 Molly (died June 5, 1970, 2 months, 18 days): "She was just home from the 
hospital overnight and was crying in her crib. I used a pillow that was in the 
crib to smother her. After she was dead, I called Mom Hoyt (Tim's mother) and 
Dr. Steinschneider." 
</P>
<P>
 Noah (died July 28, 1971, 2 months, 19 days): "I held a baby pillow over his 
face until he was dead. I then called for Mom Hoyt and Dr. Steinschneider. I 
remember it was a hot day in July." 
</P>
<P>
 According to some of the witnesses, at this point Waneta began to worry what 
people were going to think of her. She asked to see her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim was brought in, and Waneta told him of her great unburdening. He chose not 
to believe her. Words were put in your mouth, he suggested. She insisted 
otherwise. He told her he still loved her, and the confessing began again. 
</P>
<P>
 She had seen counselors and a psychiatrist, she said in her signed confession. 
"I feel that if I had got help from them, it would have prevented me from 
killing the rest of my children. I feel that I am a good person, but I know 
that I did wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved my children. I love my (adopted) son, Jay, and my husband. I feel the 
burden I have carried by keeping the secret of killing my children has been a 
tremendous punishment. I most definitely feel remorse and regret for my 
actions. I cannot go back and undo the wrong that I have done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waneta's court-appointed attorneys say they received 541 calls from the media 
in just the first days after her arrest for second-degree murder. TV shows 
tried to fax her a contract: Would the alleged baby-killer agree to tell all on 
camera? 
</P>
<P>
 Since her confession, neither of the Hoyts has spoken publicly. Waneta is free 
on bond and a trial is not likely to occur for months. Her lawyers intend to 
attack the confession, arguing that it was taken under duress. They also hope 
to show that SIDS has in fact slain more than one baby in the same family. 
</P>
<P>
 There is evidence to support this in the medical literature, but the odds of 
five in one home are astronomical, many experts say. In most families, the risk 
of even a second SIDS death is "less than 1%," wrote Dr. Susan Beal in a 1992 
article in the journal Clinics in Perinatology. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome commonly strikes babies 2 to 4 months old. No 
single pattern or pathological marker has been found for it. Clearly, the vast 
majority of mysterious infant deaths do not involve murder. Epidemiologist 
Philip McClain of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
reviewed the studies and says that estimates show child abuse plays a role in 
only 1.4% to 4.7% of SIDS cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Those percentages, small as they are, make the questioning of bereft parents a 
difficult if necessary business. Horrendous crimes have been uncovered. The 
best known occurred not far from here, in Schenectady, N.Y. Friends and 
physicians alike consoled Marybeth Tinning as, one by one, her nine children 
died of mysterious causes. She was convicted of murder in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Lumbrera's first five children died between 1976 and 1984; so did a 2 
1/2-month-old cousin left in her care. People who knew her in a string of West 
Texas towns felt sorry for Lumbrera. She would rush the children to the 
hospital, but it was always too late to save them. Only when her sixth child 
died in Garden City, Kan., was a murder suspected and then proved in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists speculate on motives in such cases. One theory has it that a 
woman who kills her child will repeat the crime to punish herself, confirming 
that she is an unfit mother. Another theory is the bizarre disorder known as 
Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, named for the 18th-Century German baron who told 
fantastic tales. Typically, the parent -- usually the mother -- will make up a 
child's illness or actually cause harm in order to get attention. Some doctors 
say the mothers are "sympathy junkies." 
</P>
<P>
 Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy has been mentioned repeatedly in the Hoyt case, 
but that may be only a fondness for exotic labeling. Dr. Michael Baden, 
director of the forensic sciences unit of the New York State Police, has worked 
on the case. He views it more matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it seems like straight homicide," he contended. "She killed the 
kids because she was tired of their crying. Waneta and her husband are very 
close. He was away at work a lot, and maybe she couldn't handle the stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "With her adopted baby, her husband had been laid off and he was at home to 
help out. With the other kids, when she couldn't handle things, she only could 
figure out one way to keep them quiet. She killed them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alfred Steinschneider has the affable presence of a country doctor. His 
sentences mingle medical jargon with the easy humor of his native Brooklyn. He 
remains a believer in this controversial notion: that some SIDS cases are 
predictable -- and preventable with the use of monitoring equipment at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, some people have questioned his judgment in the Hoyt case. One 
is prosecutor Fitzpatrick. "How could a doctor not realize that Molly and Noah 
were in harm's way? I know it was 2 1/2 decades ago. But was he overly consumed 
with expounding on his theory or was he concerned with his patient?" 
</P>
<P>
 That is a hurtful accusation for Steinschneider, who has devoted much of his 
life to the study of SIDS. He is a founder and president of the American SIDS 
Institute in Atlanta. His ability to defend himself is limited by 
confidentiality requirements that he feels duty-bound to honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's missing from all this cheap talk, this impugning of motives, this show 
biz , is that it doesn't save a single baby," he said. "What they ought to be 
saying is: 'Let's examine the deaths of babies and make better identification 
of the causes of deaths to help sort things out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hoyt case, he relied on the opinions of the medical examiners. "If 
people think there were inadequate autopsies done, then check the autopsies, 
big shots," he said. "If they think these kids were murdered, then show me, 
because what they are saying now is at variance with what the people who 
investigated the case said then. If there's criticism I'll accept from the 
pathologists, it's that I accepted the opinion of other pathologists." 
</P>
<P>
 To him, the current focus on his 1972 article misses the point. "In college, I 
learned the word heuristic, and that's what is important here. Was the paper 
heuristic: Did it lead to learning? The important thing is not the paper 
itself; it's that the paper led to a significant amount of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused for a moment. His eyes lit with a thought. "Without the paper," he 
said, "would people even know this case existed?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Waneta spends a lot of her time caring for her sister, the one 
dying of a brain tumor. She has begun to attend church again after missing some 
Sundays. Her friends call on her and try to cheer her up. 
</P>
<P>
 Those friends are appalled by what they hear on the news. This woman described 
as a baby-killer -- this abomination -- is not the Waneta they know. Accepting 
the allegations is as crazy and unthinkable to them as summer coming after 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 What is behind this feeding frenzy for vengeance, they ask. "They arrested 
Waneta and then put her on suicide watch so they could keep her safe and kill 
her later," said her minister, the Rev. Lisa Jean Hoefner. "Nothing is going to 
bring those kids back now. In the meantime, we destroy Jay and Tim and Waneta. 
What sense is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Newark Valley seems to have been invaded by big-city experts and their 
big-city ideas. What strikes people as particularly odd are notions such as 
Munchausen by Proxy. "If you want to be psychological, let's ask if this is 
Fitzpatrick's way of getting back at his mother," the minister said. "Or ask 
what office he's running for. Is this his way of getting attention?" 
</P>
<P>
 Their neighbor Waneta holds a blank check on their loyalty. How could it be 
otherwise? Natalie Hilliard, in defending her friend, was struck by another 
memory. She recalled how she had helped a pregnant Waneta set up a room for the 
little ones about to be born. 
</P>
<P>
 And how, time and again, they had tearfully packed the baby things away.

SEISMIC SAFETY PUTS BERNSON ON FIRM FOOTING ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since the Northridge quake, Hal Bernson has had every right to say, "I 
told you so." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he has been the most avid proponent of seismic safety on the Los 
Angeles City Council for more than a decade, spearheading a slew of 
safety-minded ordinances, including a widely copied law requiring the 
retrofitting of thousands of unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernson has not slowed down to gloat. He has been too busy leading a city 
panel on earthquake recovery, representing the city on the state's Seismic 
Safety Commission to promote new safety laws, not to mention patching up his 
own quake-damaged home and field office. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the quake has turned the spotlight on this San Fernando 
Valley councilman who has won the respect of seismic experts statewide and the 
nickname "Mr. Earthquake" at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 A former business owner with 15 years on the council, Bernson has surprised 
some of his council colleagues by doggedly battling business interests and a 
reluctant city bureaucracy to enact often costly safety laws, such as a 
requirement that smoke detectors be installed in hotels, apartments and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is also known by critics and supporters alike as a man with a volatile 
temper, a tenacious politician with little tolerance for bureaucratic delays 
and council members who question his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hal's got a short fuse," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who counts himself 
as a Bernson supporter. "I think he'd be better off if he were a little more 
patient with the staff and the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Bernson gave Councilman Marvin Braude a severe tongue-lashing at a 
council meeting after Braude spoke up against a Bernson proposal to allow a 
private firm to haul away quake debris by rail. "Shame on you! Shame on you!" 
Bernson said, leaving Braude at a loss for words. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocky, with dark, thinning hair and a serious gaze, Bernson concedes that he 
sometimes lets his frustration get the better of him. But he makes no apologies 
for doggedly pursuing the policies he thinks will make the city safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all get frustrated sometimes if we feel that people are not listening to 
us . . . about something that is very important to us," he said in an interview 
at his Northridge office. "But I don't think I've been abusive. . . . I'm a 
goal-oriented person." 
</P>
<P>
 With quake safety his strongest suit, it was ironic that Bernson's northwest 
Valley district suffered the most in the temblor. Quake damage forced Bernson 
to abandon his Granada Hills home for five days. At his Northridge office, 
photos and mementos that were thrown off the walls are still stacked along the 
floorboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Romanian and Polish immigrants, Harold M. Bernson, 63, spent 30 
years selling suits and custom T-shirts in the Valley before he ran for his 
first council term in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson reluctantly entered politics, he said, when he was challenged by 
friends and associates to seek a seat left vacant by retiring Councilman Robert 
Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 His conservative, pro-business profile fit his mostly middle-class suburban 
district well, and he won his first two reelection bids with comfortable 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
 But he ran into trouble during his 1991 reelection bid when he was forced into 
a close runoff with school board member Julie Korenstein, who harshly 
criticized Bernson for backing the sprawling Porter Ranch commercial-industrial 
project above Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 But he shrugs off suggestions that his political hold on the district has been 
weakened, attributing the close race to a slew of misinformation by his 
opponents and a general anti-incumbency feeling pervading the state. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear whether he can transform his post-quake notoriety into votes in 
1995 when he seeks reelection, probably for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the years, Bernson has toyed with the idea of running for higher 
office but never followed through. 
</P>
<P>
 (The political watchdog organization California Common Cause criticized 
Bernson for opening the campaign fund in 1989 for lieutenant governor, 
suggesting that the fund was designed to circumvent the city's campaign 
contribution limits -- a charge Bernson has rejected.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson no longer seriously considers running for higher office. "I'm not 
hoping to go anywhere else," Bernson said. "This is my home. This is where I 
live, where my family lives and my friends, and I just want it to be a better 
place in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on his tenure, Bernson recalls beginning his crusade almost by 
accident. During his first year on the council, he was assigned to chair the 
Building and Safety Committee, a post without prestige usually handed off to 
freshman lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that he came upon some seismic safety measures proposed after the 
1971 Sylmar quake but never enacted. One proposed ordinance required seismic 
strengthening of all buildings constructed of unreinforced masonry. 
</P>
<P>
 He took an interest in seismic safety and decided to back the proposal, 
warding off angry building owners and others. Some apartment owners bused in 
elderly tenants to testify at council hearings that their rents would go up, 
possibly leaving them homeless if such a law passed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law did pass, in 1981. A few years later, he helped organize the 
city's first international earthquake conference, attended by 28 countries. He 
also developed a quake safety booklet for children and help create the 
"Quakey-Shakey Van," a vehicle that helps teach children about quake safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council adopted Bernson's recommendation that the city require 
the inspection of 400 steel-frame buildings in the Valley and Westside for 
quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson speaks proudly of his accomplishments in the field of seismic safety. 
And although he takes pride in other accomplishments -- principally his work in 
planning -- he doesn't mind if he is remembered as Mr. Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's probably one of the most personally gratifying things I've 
done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Iwan, chairman of the state Seismic Safety Commission, said Los Angeles 
has been at the forefront of drafting seismic safety laws. And he gives much of 
the credit to Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco is not nearly as far along as Los Angeles because they don't 
have a Hal Bernson up there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilwoman Joy Picus, who worked alongside Bernson for several years, 
said that, until now, he hasn't received enough credit for his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a lot of persistence to get (the retrofitting law) through," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismic safety is not an alluring issue. But then again, Bernson is not an 
alluring politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether speaking about seismic safety or police protection, he is not 
charismatic or flowery. Bernson speaks plainly, making his point quickly. He 
usually ends his testimony in council hearings with a brisk "Let's get on with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 He can be brash and defiant. This was evident last month when the city's 
Ethics Commission released an audit of Bernson's campaign fund spending, 
questioning more than $158,000 spent on foreign travel, expensive dinners and 
other expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the audit, Bernson blasted Benjamin Bycel, the director of the 
Ethics Commission, calling him "biased and one-sided" and describing the audit 
as part of Bycel's longtime campaign against him. Bycel declined to comment on 
Bernson's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's temper is often cited as his biggest weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who also sits on the quake recovery panel, said he 
has been frustrated by Bernson's tendency to barge into the middle of other 
people's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It concerns me when a council member doesn't give me a chance to speak," he 
said. "A couple of times I've had to let Bernson know that I didn't appreciate 
being cut off." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bernson can also be courteous. Alarcon, a freshman councilman, recalled 
a day before he took office when Bernson took him on a drive and offered him 
tips on how to get by in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But another council member said Bernson's demeanor dissuades many from working 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But his supporters say Bernson's gruff demeanor is part of his gritty resolve 
-- the same resolve that succeeded in getting the city to adopt laws that may 
have saved lives on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Hal believes in something, he is a bull in a china shop," Yaroslavsky 
said, with a hint of admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's surly demeanor surfaced during his recent effort to get the City 
Council to adopt a requirement that all building owners install gas valves that 
automatically shut off during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 When Councilman Nate Holden suggested that the valves may shut off the gas to 
a home when a large truck drives past, Bernson responded: "I think a truck must 
have run over your head." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson lost the vote. But despite the defeat, Bernson said his struggle to 
push seismic safety laws has been rewarding. He recalls recently meeting with a 
building owner who had fought against Bernson's ordinance to reinforce masonry 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bernson, the man said, "You know, I really fought you hard on 
that, and I want to thank you because if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have a 
building today." Profile of Hal Bernson

FIRE STRANDS 150 PEOPLE ON SEAL BEACH PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flames burst from the midsection of the city pier Saturday, stranding a small 
crowd of fishermen, strollers and diners until firefighters were able to douse 
the fire and hose down smoldering planks. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reported injuries and the fire, which erupted shortly after 3 
p.m., was quelled within an hour, according to authorities. Investigators ruled 
out arson and said the fire appeared to be sparked by electrical wires, the 
same type of blaze that shut down the pier two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses reported hearing a loud blast before seeing plumes of black 
smoke and flames licking up from beneath the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the flames were doused, firefighters kept the crowd of about 150 people 
waiting at the end of the pier while they hosed down the midsection and sawed 
and chopped several dozen wood chunks to determine whether the fire was out. 
Later, sheets of plywood were placed over the holes and small groups of pier 
visitors gingerly crossed over the charred section and returned to the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Martens, 37, of Norwalk wheeled over the damaged section with a 
shopping cart of fish supplies and a catch of mackerel that his friend, Victor 
Correa, 24, snared while waiting for their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just getting ready to leave when we heard the blast," Martens said. 
"I thought it was a plane at first because it was so loud. I looked back at my 
pole and then I started to smell smoke. Then I started to see shooting flames." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Saturday how long the pier would remain closed because 
investigators were still checking for fire damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular pier has weathered a series of disasters over the years and this 
is the third time in a decade that it has been closed. On May 15, 1992, an 
electrical fire in a lifeguard tower damaged the general area of Saturday's 
blaze. The tower was relocated. In 1983, a fierce winter storm all but 
destroyed the municipal pier. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fire erupted Saturday, most of the pier's visitors reacted calmly, 
following the orders of a helicopter pilot who commanded them to head toward 
the 1950s style diner at the end of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody looked like they behaved themselves, almost like it was a 
rehearsal," Long Beach Fire Lt. Bill Forrester said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some diners actually were more irritated that they could not get more coffee 
in the midst of the crisis, said waitress Eileen Szpilac, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody panicked," she said. "They just kept eating."

 Holly Ramona, who alleges she was molested for 11 years by her father, says 
she once again feels shattered and betrayed -- this time by a jury's decision 
to side with him against the therapists she believes helped her overcome her 
nightmarish childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was not the target of the May 13 malpractice verdict that awarded 
her father, Gary Ramona, $500,000 in damages, Holly Ramona sees the decision as 
a personal affront that will also seriously undermine her attempt to recover 
damages from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really hurt by the verdict," Ramona said Friday evening in an interview 
at her Irvine apartment. "The jury, whether they meant to or not, gave him 
ammunition to attempt to destroy me more." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona filed a civil lawsuit against her father in 1990 alleging that he 
molested her throughout her childhood. She said her memories of abuse only 
began to surface earlier that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father responded in 1991 by suing the therapists who treated her. The Napa 
Valley Superior Court jury concluded that Holly Ramona's therapists 
"negligently reinforced" false memories of abuse and ordered them and a 
hospital to pay damages to Gary Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona said the verdict told her "there are an awful lot of people out 
there who don't understand abuse, especially incest. I think people are afraid 
to look at reality. I don't think it makes sense to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old Pepperdine University graduate student said she still has no 
doubts that her father repeatedly molested her from ages 5 to 16 -- abuse she 
says gave rise to terrifying memories that first began to emerge as flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 She sought treatment from Marche Isabella, a family therapist, and later Dr. 
Richard Rose, who at the time was chairman of psychiatry at Western Medical 
Center Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona said she has always feared her father and knew that when she 
tried to take him to court "all hell would break loose and he would go after 
me. But I didn't know how." 
</P>
<P>
 She believes the jury seemed less concerned about her suffering than the 
losses her father sustained from her accusation -- his loss of a $400,000 job 
as a winery executive, his divorce from his wife and his estrangement from 
Holly and two other daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 And she feels betrayed by the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought that all you had to do was just walk into court and just 
tell the truth and things would work out OK," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although jury foreman Thomas Dudum stressed after the verdict that jurors were 
still uncertain whether Holly was molested, Gary Ramona said he believed he had 
been vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 It may no longer be practical, Holly Ramona believes, to go to trial with her 
civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ramona and his attorney could not be reached for comment on Holly 
Ramona's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona said she resents the implication that she could be made to 
believe she was raped if that had not occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone should be held responsible for their memories, it should be me," 
she said. "They were good therapists and they helped me and this is what they 
get for it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona works as an intake worker in an Orange County psychiatric hospital that 
she declined to identify. Three nights a week, she attends Pepperdine 
University classes at an office building in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the trauma, Ramona says she is grateful that the painful memories 
resurfaced because they helped her to explain the "strange relationship" she 
had with her father and to gain control over eating binges and depression that 
had made her consider suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 She expects to obtain a master's degree in psychology from Pepperdine in July 
and wants to work as a child therapist. "I know what it feels like to grow up 
in a family that is dysfunctional," she said, "and I want to help." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the beneficial side effects of the court battle, Ramona said, is that 
it has drawn her closer to her mother and sisters, who have stood by her. She 
said she also has received support from friends at school and work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona said she is "trying to make sense out of all this." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe my role in this is just to speak out. My main goal now is to help other 
victims of child abuse. I want to get the message out it can happen in those 
'perfect' families where everything appears fine."

DESPITE SOME WOES, MANY SEE EL RIO AS THEIR OASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Traffic on the Ventura Freeway whips past Louie Rocha's El Rio house at a 
frantic pace, creating a constant roar that pierces the thick cinder-block 
walls. Yet he tunes out the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 To Rocha, his home in this tiny community just outside Oxnard is still the 
peaceful haven he built for his family 49 years ago. He insists that the water 
from neighborhood wells is still pure, despite occasional warnings to the 
contrary from health inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the El Rio streets are still safe, although shootings are not uncommon 
and members of one of the county's most active gangs stalk the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, violence erupted once again when three people were shot and 
injured, one critically, during a fight at a baptismal party. 
</P>
<P>
 Although signs of decay have besieged the area, it is still seen by Rocha and 
many others as an everyman's utopia -- a place where a plot of ground can be 
turned into a dream built of clapboard and stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got out of the service, I just wanted a piece of land to call my own," 
said Rocha, 71, who bought half an acre on Cortez Street for $4,700 in 1945. 
"My wife and I raised seven kids here. They all turned out good. I attribute 
that to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 El Rio has a population of 6,419 -- about 64% Latino and 31% white -- on fewer 
than 10 square blocks wedged between Vineyard and Rose avenues, north of 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Once considered a country haven, the community is almost entirely surrounded 
by commercial development. Half of El Rio lies in the shadow of the Ventura 
Freeway while the eastern portion borders Oxnard's new auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some of the telltale signs of urbanization are nonexistent here. 
There is no sewer system; residents use septic tanks as they have for decades. 
There are no fancy restaurants and grocery stores, only modest markets and 
hamburger and taco stands along a small commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no sidewalks or street lights -- it is luxury that many people 
cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of El Rio residents are listed as below working class. According 
to the 1990 census, the median income per household was $35,991 -- nearly 
$10,000 below the county's median. Also, 12.4% of El Rio's population lives 
below the poverty level, almost double the county's average. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the problems in this little community, parents who have spent 
their lives here hope their children and grandchildren will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the homes may be weather-beaten and cracked, they are passed from one 
generation to the next. The 1990 census found extraordinary stability in El 
Rio, with 61% of the population living in the same house in 1985, far higher 
than the county's overall rate of 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my turn now to raise my children here," said Rebecca Dominguez, whose 
grandfather moved to El Rio in 1910. "I hope to have my grandchildren here. We 
have a closeness in this community I don't believe exists in city life. We all 
have something to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 The community was founded in the late 1800s by Simon Cohn, a merchant who set 
up a general store where the northbound off-ramp of the Ventura Freeway is now 
located. Originally, the community was called New Jerusalem, but it was later 
renamed El Rio because of its proximity to the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 Once dominated by fields of lima beans and sugar beets, the area eventually 
gave way to development. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, there was a push for independence that, even today, dominates 
the area's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be left alone," said Rocha, El Rio's unofficial mayor. "We don't 
have street sweepers and all that other stuff, and we don't want them. If we 
want the streets clean, the old ladies and the old men get out with their 
push-brooms and clean our streets. 
</P>
<P>
 While other unincorporated areas of the county turned to nearby cities to 
supply their water and educate their children, El Rio went out on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 It has its own water companies, six of them, in fact. And it has its own 
school district, which operates four elementary schools and a junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever there are rumors that Oxnard might annex the tiny community, 
residents pepper county officials with petitions to fight the move, saying the 
city would only raise their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People figure that it has been working fine with the way it is, so why not 
just stick with it," said Ernest J. Almanza, 58, who has served on El Rio's 
school board for nearly 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other quirky things about El Rio. Within its core, there are 
more than a dozen churches, although some are now vacant because of a lack of 
worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the street corners, residents set up makeshift fruit stands: four avocados 
for $1, two persimmons for 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Dominguez could afford to move elsewhere with her three children, ages 
10, 13 and 15. At 38, she has a good job as a paralegal in Ventura. Yet she 
prefers to remain in El Rio, living just blocks from the house where she grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is so tightknit," Dominguez said. "Even if you are not related, 
you feel like you are related. The old ones pass on, and the second or third 
generation comes in. No one misses a step. It just goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger McDonald, pastor of the First Baptist Church of El Rio, moved to the 
area five years ago, impressed by the community's spirit. These days, however, 
McDonald says he is bothered by El Rio's tendency to fight progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "People resist becoming a part of Oxnard, and I see that as being a bad thing 
for us," McDonald said. "It makes us look like a poor community. I don't like 
the fact that we are considered 'Little El Rio' over here. I would much rather 
be considered North Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 Another troubling aspect of life in El Rio, residents say, are the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, El Rio's gang members gather at a boarded-up house on Balboa Street. 
Their activities have become so notorious that residents have nicknamed the 
avenue Trouble Street. Weekend shootings and stabbings are common. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman said she avoids going out after dark because she is afraid. "I'm 
scared," said the woman, a resident of Balboa Street. "After the sun goes down, 
I don't go out for any reason. They just come here to do trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Thomas, 82, has lived in El Rio for more than 20 years. Now she wishes 
she could move and leave behind the noise and the ruffians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many problems here," she said. "The neighborhood is not what it 
used to be. . . . I made a mistake not to get away." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, who represents the area, says he is 
trying to help clean up the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department recently stepped up its night-time patrol of the 
area. Flynn also said he has plans under way to set up a substation on Cortez 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Flynn has started an effort to raise money to build a gym and 
activity center for area youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet gangs are only one of El Rio's woes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the worst of the drought, nitrate levels in the community's water 
supply exceeded normal limits, prompting state health inspectors to force 
residents to drink bottled water until the water became safe again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell Preston, manager of the county's water resources department, said he 
believes it is just a matter of time before nitrate levels become so high that 
El Rio must permanently shut down its wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha becomes angry when he hears outsiders talk about El Rio's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go again," he said. "Our water is so good, I can drink it day and 
night, and it's perfect. You go to Oxnard, and the water is lousy. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the gangs, we used to have problems here. But we quieted those kids up 
long, long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful to live in El Rio. . . . It's so peaceful here."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; GARAMENDI IS ENDORSED BY MAXINE WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi won the endorsement Saturday 
of Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles, one of the state's most influential black 
political leaders, who praised Garamendi for having "a real vision" for 
rebuilding the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not, and will not, take us for granted," said Waters, who represents 
some of the areas hit most severely by the 1992 riots. "I believe John 
Garamendi will be a true friend of our community and I wholeheartedly endorse 
him for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters appeared with Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, at the 98th 
Street Community Assn. neighborhood street festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've given this a lot of thought and my endorsement of John Garamendi may 
surprise a few people," said Waters, whose 35th Congressional District includes 
portions of south Los Angeles, Inglewood, Hawthorne and Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, said it was an important 
endorsement at a critical point in the campaign: Garamendi is trailing state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown in the polls with little more than two weeks remaining 
before the June 7 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters joins state Sen. Diane Watson of Los Angeles and County Supervisor 
Gloria Molina in supporting Garamendi over his rivals, Brown and Sen. Tom 
Hayden of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, a former assemblywoman who served with Garamendi while he was a state 
senator, called Garamendi a "principled, issue-oriented man." 
</P>
<P>
 "He supports the social and business issues that are important to me and my 
constituents. John Garamendi came to our community leadership to ask us what we 
thought needed to be done. He sought out our opinions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, saying he was honored to have Waters' endorsement, said that as 
governor he would continue his work to end insurance redlining and other forms 
of discrimination against minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has her share of endorsements from black and Latino leaders, including a 
number of legislators. But in Waters, Watson and Molina, Garamendi has the 
backing of three key leaders with the ability to motivate their own 
constituents to vote for him.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; BERMAN-WAXMAN GROUP'S LOW PROFILE PUZZLES OBSERVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheila James Kuehl, a Westside Democrat running for the state Assembly, 
recently made a pilgrimage to the Beverly Hills offices of BAD Campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, a women's rights attorney who played Zelda Gilroy on the old "Dobie 
Gillis" television show, was seeking support from the two political consultants 
for whom BAD is named -- Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino. For good reason. 
BAD is the operational arm of the Westside political organization headed by 
Berman's brother, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), and Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like . . . presenting yourself for consideration," said Kuehl, who 
left the meeting empty-handed. "It's a good thing I had watched all the 
'Godfather' films." 
</P>
<P>
 The 'Godfather' analogy is apt: For more than two decades, the key to winning 
Westside legislative seats has been support from the Berman-Waxman group. 
</P>
<P>
 After a thumping in 1992, that may be changing. The Berman-Waxman forces, once 
quick to king-make, have failed to endorse anyone so far in two key Westside 
Assembly races. And the hands-off approach has confounded many political 
operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Westside) is the heart of the Berman-Waxman machine," said Democratic 
political consultant Rick Taylor. "Where are they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although the group is expected to eventually make its choices for Assembly 
known through pre-election slate mailers sent out by BAD, that falls far short 
of the massive fund raising and campaign help that made Berman-Waxman 
candidates virtually unbeatable in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the group's low-profile stance is that this year's contests 
have attracted a dizzying crush of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing ejection from the Assembly in two years under the legislative term 
limits law, a trio of Democrats who collectively represent most of the Westside 
are running for other offices -- Terry B. Friedman of the 41st District is 
seeking a judgeship, Burt Margolin of the 42nd District is running for state 
insurance commissioner, and Gwen Moore of the 47th District is a candidate for 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two Democrats and five Republicans filed for the soon-to-be-vacant 
seats. Yet the Berman-Waxman machine has picked a candidate in only one of 
three races -- Ed Johnson, in the 47th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the organization, which grew out of a college friendship between 
Waxman and Berman, is still regrouping after its disastrous 1992 election 
season. That year, three of its high-profile candidates lost -- Mel Levine and 
Gray Davis in runs for the U.S. Senate, and state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal in 
his bid to win another term in a district created by reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the group's leaders "left the radar screen of politics in 
California," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. "Now they have to 
decide whether to reinvent themselves. . . . They have to be very careful (and) 
pick their spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Berman says the low profile is mainly because of term limits. "We're 
not that much operating as a group in some ways," he said. "There's a bunch of 
good people (running) and no compelling reason to endorse anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But the droves of Democratic Assembly candidates, none of whom have the name 
recognition of the departing incumbents, are not taking no for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 As Michael Berman and D'Agostino prepare their slate mailer for the June 7 
primary, Assembly candidates are lobbying hard for a paid spot on the cards, 
which are intended mainly to help Margolin, Moore and, in the state 
controller's race, Don Perata. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word on the street was they weren't doing the slate at all," said 
consultant Joe Cerrell. "They got so many calls, they probably said, 'Oh, hell, 
let's do the damn thing.' It's a humongous profit (maker) for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl's meeting with BAD involved "some good intellectual give and take," she 
said. "They wanted to talk about the issues and where the country was going. I 
liked them." 
</P>
<P>
 Did they like her? No one at BAD returned calls seeking comment last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl's Democratic opponents in the 41st District, which extends from Santa 
Monica to the west San Fernando Valley, are attorneys Roger Jon Diamond, Bill 
Rothbard and Ed Tabash, and businessmen Pat McGuire and John Shallman. 
Republicans will choose between two unknowns: banker Peter Eason and law 
student Michael T. Meehan. 
</P>
<P>
 The low profile of the Berman-Waxman group is apparent in the case of 
candidate Rothbard, a close friend of Friedman's. 
</P>
<P>
 When Friedman decided to give up his seat, he told supporters privately that 
Rothbard was his heir apparent. But in doing so, he broke the rules of the 
Berman-Waxman clan by not getting their approval beforehand. Friedman's faux 
pas, campaign watchers say, has kept the Berman -- Waxman group from endorsing 
Rothbard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neighboring 42nd District, which includes Beverly Hills, West Hollywood 
and the canyon areas, the Democratic field is more crowded, with seven 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Berman-Waxman group tried behind the scenes to encourage any two of the 
three candidates with ties to the organization to step aside. But all three -- 
Los Angeles Unified School District board member Mark Slavkin, Los Angeles 
Community College District board member Wally Knox and West Hollywood 
Councilman Paul Koretz -- stayed in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say they expect either Koretz or Knox to get a spot on the slate card. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47th District is the only one in which the Berman-Waxman team followed 
past practice by picking a candidate allied with the organization or one of its 
members. Their guy is Johnson, a longtime deputy of Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has stiff opposition in the heavily Democratic district, which 
includes Culver City, Crenshaw, Ladera Heights and Cheviot Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Willard W. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) is backing his son, attorney 
Kevin Murray. And so are friends of the elder Murray, including Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys).

VERDICT HEATS UP MEMORY DEBATE; PSYCHOLOGY: EXPERTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE 
SAY IT WILL LEAD TO MORE RESTRICTIONS ON THERAPISTS WHO WORK WITH PATIENTS' 
SUPPRESSED RECOLLECTIONS, AS WELL AS MORE LAWSUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Napa jury's verdict against two therapists and a hospital in the recent 
"recovered memory" case has intensified a debate over whether such memories 
ought to be considered accurate reflections of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, in which two therapists were found to have acted improperly in 
reinforcing the belief of a client that her father sexually abused her, is 
expected to have long-term legal and clinical ramifications for therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time a non-client -- in this case former winery executive 
Gary Ramona, the father of alleged victim Holly Ramona, now 23 -- ever won a 
recovered memory case. Ramona won a $500,000 award. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are predicting that the verdict will open the floodgates for similar 
suits as family members who believe they have been wrongly accused fight back 
through the courts. Others say the case will force legislatures -- and perhaps 
therapists -- to define and limit the scope of practice by mental health 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the eventual repercussions, lawyers and others say the case has 
already had a profound impact on a profession deeply divided over the validity 
of recovered memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the verdict, lawyers were issuing warnings to therapists: Explain 
the risks and controversial nature of recovered memory. Take good notes. Avoid 
leading questions. Use hypnosis or hypnotic drugs with extreme caution. Consult 
regularly with other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting that the Napa verdict "will chill therapists' work," Sacramento 
attorney Ronald Kaldor, who represents physicians, hospitals and health 
maintenance organizations, said the case will force therapists "to be much more 
careful about what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will open up a lot of new lawsuits," Kaldor said. "While it isn't new law 
in the sense that other judges will be bound by it, clearly a new path has been 
cleared through the forest. Other lawyers will follow and widen that path." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Riemersma, executive director of the 23,000-member California Assn. of 
Marriage and Family Therapists, said therapists will feel pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some will probably feel they are being placed in the role of being an 
investigator to determine whether what the patient presents is fact or fantasy. 
(But) that isn't their role," she said. "On the other hand, it will cause 
therapists to be much more cautious about the potential of implanting memories 
in the minds of patients, which I think could be one of the positive results of 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to say how many cases of repressed memory there are in the 
United States. With the development of the "recovery movement" -- which 
includes memory recovery therapy, 12-step programs and self-help books -- more 
and more people have been coming forward, revealing long repressed memories of 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt Caudill, a Costa Mesa attorney who defends mental health professionals 
in malpractice cases, said legal cases involving repressed memory were almost 
nonexistent two years ago. But over the last 18 months he has been averaging 
one new case a month. 
</P>
<P>
 He said most involve clients who once believed in the truth of their recovered 
memories, then changed their mind in the face of the intense pain it caused 
them and their families and sued their therapists for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists say repressed memory comes up most often in cases where there has 
been severe emotional or physical trauma. In the case of sexual abuse by family 
members, victims are said to be so traumatized that they erase the abuse from 
their conscious memory. But whether that is even possible will get a strong 
argument from many psychotherapists who believe such a willful act of memory 
erasure is impossible, particularly when the sexual abuse occurs over a period 
of years. Critics note that this kind of memory suppression has never been 
documented in a scientific study. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychotherapists use a variety of methods to uncover emerging memories, often 
beginning with a single image that is haunting a client, or a snippet of some 
long-ago event. Memory therapy involves numerous one-on-one sessions, and in 
some cases hypnosis or drugs. Holly Ramona's therapists used the drug sodium 
amytal to help test the validity of her memories. Therapists say these sessions 
can last for months, if not years, and are painful to the analyst and patient 
as both relive childhood traumas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mental health professionals say that although they question the 
procedures used by Ramona's therapists, they strongly believe that many people 
bury childhood traumas so deeply that they do blot them out from their 
conscious memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica therapist Ellen Ledley, who defends the practice of memory 
recovery, said good therapists are very careful about the way they draw out 
long-repressed memories from clients who have suffered from sexual and other 
kinds of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she said, the verdict will have a chilling effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way around feeling somewhat anxious," Ledley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists see the verdict as another sign of a growing backlash against the 
burgeoning recovery movement. Most often the critics zero in on what they say 
is the growing trend to explain away eating disorders, alcoholism and a variety 
of other complex conditions by simply attributing them to "abuse" as children 
and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therapists will figure out a way to cope," said psychologist Laura Brown of 
Seattle, an advocate of recovered memory therapy. "My concern is the effect 
this will have on (abuse victims). The message they are getting is that if they 
talk about what has happened to them that they will really put people at risk, 
that people will get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that if therapists are alarmed and begin to practice more 
cautiously, then it's about time. The critics, including some therapists, fault 
therapists for placing too much stock in recovered memories, which they say can 
be as much fantasy as fact. 
</P>
<P>
 The results often have dramatic and serious outcomes for the patients and 
their families. In some cases, allegations stemming from recovered memories 
have led to the filing of criminal charges and prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics within the profession do not mince their words. Dorothy Cantor, a 
New Jersey psychologist who is running for the presidency of the American 
Psychological Assn., said she hopes the verdict shows that the public "needs to 
be careful who they go to." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are thousands and thousands of Gary Ramonas out there," said memory 
expert Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist and professor at the University of 
Washington who appeared as an expert witness for Ramona. The author of an 
upcoming book on what she calls the myth of memory repression, Loftus believes 
that therapists who uncritically embrace recovered memories as facts are not 
only wrong but are engaging in "dangerous" practices that can produce "horrible 
consequences" by leading to false accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists say the verdict will pressure them into a role of determining the 
truth of a client's recollection of events, something they say they will 
resist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therapists really aren't trained to get at the truth of a client's memories," 
said Costa Mesa attorney Caudill. "They are trained to see the world as the 
patient sees it and work within that framework without regard to whether it's 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 But therein lies one of the problems because the patient's view of events in 
recent years has led to criminal charges being filed against parents or civil 
lawsuits filed by children against family members for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 R. Christopher Barden, a psychologist and lawyer from Minneapolis, said the 
decision will force lawmakers and members of the mental health profession to 
act to set up legal parameters and ethical guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they cite as evidence is rumor, it's innuendo, it's hearsay, it's 
clinical chitchat, but it's not research," Barden said. 
</P>
<P>
 But rape crisis counselors and therapists say people like Barden are ignoring 
the large numbers of women who approach them on their own, with no histories of 
counseling, and tell them of flashbacks and disturbing memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Leah Aldridge, of the Los Angeles Rape Hotline, said: "It is not uncommon for 
an adult woman to call us in crisis because she is experiencing flashbacks of 
some kind of sexual abuse and she doesn't know what is going on. These memories 
often come without any intervention by a therapist, shaken loose by something 
that has happened, like the death of an uncle (followed by) a great sense of 
relief."

PROSECUTORS SEEK INDICTMENT OF ITALY'S EX-PREMIER ANDREOTTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors have asked a judge to indict former Prime Minister Giulio 
Andreotti, Italy's leading postwar politician, for ties to the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreotti has been under investigation for more than a year in Sicily for 
allegedly associating with Mafia bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports Saturday said that prosecutors took the formal step of asking a 
judge to hand down an indictment. When the step was taken was not clear. News 
reports quoted prosecutors as saying the decision to go forward was made in 
April. There was no indication of when there would be a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted last June to lift Andreotti's parliamentary immunity from 
investigation and prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreotti, 75, was premier seven times and a leading figure of the Christian 
Democrats. The party dominated Italian politics for decades after World War II 
until a long-running kickback probe brought it down. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial would be the most sensational in Italy's postwar period because 
Andreotti was for decades the country's most internationally recognized 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the case against the politician rests on the word of six former Mafia 
members who are cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Mafia members have accused Andreotti of being the point man for 
organized crime in Rome's halls of political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreotti said the mob witnesses were the subject of "rather able 
manipulation."

U.N. PUSHES DRUG INTERDICTION IN FORMER SOVIET CENTRAL ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN MacWILLIAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations' top drug control official watched 14 metric tons of 
captured hashish go up in smoke here Saturday and rewarded this Central Asian 
nation with more money to fight narcotics bound for the streets of North 
America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The hash, with an estimated street value of $650 million, was seized by the 
authorities as it entered Uzbekistan last year from neighboring Afghanistan. 
Thirteen tons came from one shipment destined for Belgium and Canada in trucks 
with cargo listed as nuts and raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the trucks, the drug was packaged in solid black slabs weighing a 
kilogram each, wrapped in plastic and labeled as French salad dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardboard boxes full of the captured hashish were mechanically shoveled into a 
blazing furnace Saturday at an aluminum plant on the outskirts of Tashkent, the 
Uzbek capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio Giacomelli, executive director of the U.N. Drug Control Program, 
watched with satisfaction. He is touring Central Asian republics of the former 
Soviet Union on a mission to improve drug interdiction measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short space of two years, we have noticed tremendous progress in the 
competence and disposition of the Uzbek authorities to deal with this growing 
problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Giacomelli signed an agreement to give Uzbekistan $500,000 over the next two 
years to help officials train narcotics officers, set up testing laboratories 
and prepare anti-drug legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Central Asian republics -- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan and Kazakhstan -- occupy a vast region bordering Afghanistan, Iran 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
 The Afghan civil war and the collapse of border controls when the Soviet Union 
fell apart in 1991 has opened up the area as a route for smugglers from 
Afghanistan, one of the world's largest producers of hashish, opium and heroin. 
Seizures as large as the 13-ton hashish shipment show the potential size of 
traffic through the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the hashish burned here Saturday, Uzbek authorities say they have 
seized two tons of marijuana, heroin, opium and synthetic drugs since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Giacomelli estimates that no more than 10% of the drug traffic through 
Central Asia is intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Frahi, head of the U.N. drug agency's Europe and Middle East 
operation, said crime is getting more organized in the former Soviet Union, and 
Central Asia has the potential to produce its own narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Another danger is that drug abuse in Central Asia could grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must keep an eye on what is happening in nearby Pakistan and other such 
countries," Giacomelli said. "Wherever there is heavy traffic, very soon there 
will be heavy abuse."

SOVIET DISSIDENT SAKHAROV'S WIDOW INAUGURATES LIBRARY; RUSSIA: YELENA BONNER 
OPENS ARCHIVES IN BUILDING WHERE WRITER LIVED. YELTSIN, SECRET POLICE DONATE 
FILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a belated assist from the former KGB, the widow of Soviet dissident 
Andrei D. Sakharov inaugurated a library Saturday with thousands of pages of 
writings by him, letters to him and secret police files on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The archive, neatly arranged in cardboard boxes on tall metal shelves in the 
apartment building where Sakharov lived, is the first collection of such 
material in one place for public examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about the influence of his ideas," his widow, Yelena Bonner, said 
after welcoming reporters and guests to the three-room apartment, remodeled and 
air-conditioned with a $51,500 grant from the U.S. Congress. "But have we read 
Sakharov?" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at a government forum marking the 73rd anniversary of Sakharov's birth, 
the head of Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service made a surprise 
contribution to the project, handing Bonner two thick blue folders containing 
62 KGB "reports on you and your husband." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am afraid you will feel pain when you read all this," said Gen. Sergei V. 
Stepashin, whose spy agency succeeded the KGB. "But the truth must be known. It 
is your right to use these notes the way you like." 
</P>
<P>
 "What is happening now would have seemed like a Christmas fairy tale a few 
years ago," Bonner replied, musing on the changes wrought by the Soviet Union's 
1991 collapse. She joked that her car would not have been stolen if the police 
had kept up the surveillance. "I am deprived of your attention," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The KGB reports date from 1968, the year of Sakharov's seminal essay, 
"Thoughts of Progress, Peaceful Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom," to Dec. 
8, 1989, six days before his death. The last was written by Vladimir A. 
Kryuchkov, then head of the KGB, to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
complained that Sakharov's "ambitions" and "anti-Soviet activities" were 
undermining the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin sent his chief of staff to the anniversary 
forum to hand Bonner a smaller folder of documents on Sakharov from the 
presidential archives and to read a message extolling the late nuclear 
physicist as a "great son of Russia who almost alone rose up against the arms 
race and championed human rights" in a totalitarian state. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakharov's outspokenness earned him the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize and Soviet 
punishment by internal exile in the city of Gorky from 1980 to 1986. 
Rehabilitated under Gorbachev, he won election to the Soviet Parliament in 1989 
as the conscience of the democratic movement. 
</P>
<P>
 On four occasions, KGB agents in Gorky purloined parts of his diaries -- 
hundreds of pages in all -- before Bonner spirited out a reconstructed version 
for publication in the West. The handwritten diaries are now held at Brandeis 
University in Massachusetts and are being copied for the library here. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in an auditorium of the former Soviet Central Committee headquarters, 
under a larger-than-life photograph of the famous dissident, Stepashin said all 
the seized memoirs had been burned on Kryuchkov's orders in 1990 as "revenge 
against the dead." 
</P>
<P>
 He announced that Sakharov's KGB dossier had contained 520 volumes in all -- 
"a Guinness record. . . . No other person in the former U.S.S.R. had such a 
file." 
</P>
<P>
 The burned memoirs and the 62 reports turned over Saturday are believed to be 
a tiny fraction of Sakharov's KGB file. In a brief interview after the forum, 
Bonner said that the government is still holding "a lot of documents" on her 
late husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's low-key ceremonies, attended by a few dozen human rights activists, 
reflected the disarray of their cause in a country where violent crime and 
economic hardship threaten to undermine democratic gains. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carl Gershman, president of the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, 
which channeled the aid money to the new library, said Sakharov's works on 
democracy and arms control "will keep the spirit of this great man alive" and 
"serve as a beacon for Russian democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The library also includes "tens of thousands" of letters from ordinary 
Russians "containing moral support as well as curses," Bonner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner also announced plans to establish an international human rights museum 
in Moscow in 1996. The museum will be named for Sakharov. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia will soon get another major library after another superstar dissident 
and Nobel laureate, Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, returns to Russia this week 
after 20 years in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old author will bring his personal collection of memoirs from more 
than 700 Russians describing their lives during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution 
and two World Wars, and he will make them available to scholars researching 
those periods.

ISRAEL TIES ABDUCTION TO FINDING AIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel said Saturday that it hopes its capture of a pro-Iranian guerrilla 
leader in a raid on his home in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon will provide 
a clue to the whereabouts of an Israeli airman seized in Lebanon nearly eight 
years ago after his plane was shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter-borne Israeli commandos swooped into the Bekaa Valley before dawn 
Saturday and abducted Mustafa Dirani from his house in Qasr Naba, a village 
near the provincial capital of Zahlah, 10 miles from the Syrian border. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirani, 46, was head of the security apparatus of the Syrian-backed Shiite 
Amal militia in 1986 when his men captured Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down 
during a bombing mission near the southern port city of Sidon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he hopes that Dirani 
will provide fresh information on the whereabouts of Arad -- the only one of 
six missing Israelis believed to be still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the raid is also likely to harm recent steps toward peace with Syria, the 
main power in Lebanon. The operation came only days after Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher completed a shuttle trip trying to get Israel and Syria back 
to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, vowed to step up its war against 
Israel in response to Dirani's abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The enemy has resorted to the option of expanding the scope of 
confrontation," the head of Hezbollah's executive committee, Hussein Khalil, 
said in an interview. "This will put it (Israel) in a huge predicament in the 
future because the resistance in return will respond . . . in a way that adopts 
expanding the scope of fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said the operation proved that Israel is intent on securing the release 
of Arad. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all we will hear who he (Dirani) gave Ron to, because it is clear he 
held Ron for a long period. Our problem is how to reach an address. Where is 
he? In whose hands is he? This is one of the road signs that lead to this 
address," Peres told Israeli army radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres defended the kidnaping, saying Israel was left with no other option 
after having attempted to win Arad's release through diplomatic channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israeli army should be praised for a very precise operation," he said. 
"It removed a very dangerous man from a place from which he initiated many 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The operation was ordered by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and approved 
in a special Cabinet session Thursday, army radio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-Iranian sources in Lebanon said Dirani handed Arad over to the Syrians 
after he fell out with Amal chief Nabih Berri in 1988. Israel says he is held 
by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group or Iran, but Tehran has denied this. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arad's whereabouts remain a mystery, Israel has said it has 
convincing information that he is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirani, also known as Abu Ali, is leader of the pro-Iranian Believers 
Resistance guerrilla group. In 1988, he broke away from the moderate Amal and 
formed the Believers Resistance in close coordination with the fundamentalist 
Hezbollah.

ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS PATROL JOINTLY IN GAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli and Palestinian security forces began joint patrols in the Gaza Strip 
on Saturday, a day after Islamic militants killed two Israeli soldiers and 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading figure in Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labor Party warned that if 
the Palestine Liberation Organization fails to stop attacks on Israelis from 
the autonomous zones in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, it could 
endanger negotiations on self-rule in the rest of the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most important foundations of the Gaza-Jericho model is joint 
Israeli-Palestinian security work," said Ephraim Sneh, a Labor legislator and 
reserve general. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is aimed, among other things, at preventing such attacks," Sneh told 
Israeli television. "It has to be clear that if this model doesn't work, there 
won't be any point in continuing the negotiations in the next stages." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Israel-PLO autonomy accord, the joint patrols are to secure three 
roads in the strip. Each patrol is made up of an Israeli and a Palestinian 
jeep, both identified by orange flags. In the Jericho zone, joint patrols began 
a week earlier, immediately after the hand-over of authority there. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli troops and Palestinian police also set up new checkpoints on Gaza's 
main north-south thoroughfare, and motorists were asked to show identification 
and open their trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli troops checked cars with yellow Israeli plates, and Palestinian police 
checked white-plated Gaza cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The heightened security came after two Israeli soldiers were shot and killed 
Friday at the Israeli-controlled Erez checkpoint between Gaza and Israel. The 
gunmen drove up in a car, killed two approaching soldiers and fled into the 
autonomous zone. Neither Israeli troops nor Palestinian police pursued them. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the fundamentalist Islamic group Hamas and the extremist Islamic Jihad 
group claimed responsibility for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the killings, some Israeli leaders demanded that peace talks be 
curtailed, and Rabin barred Gaza residents from entering Israel until May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO's ability to keep Muslim opponents of the autonomy accord in check and 
stop them from attacking Israeli targets is seen as a key test of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials have said they need more time to organize the Palestinian police 
force before they can effectively block such attacks.

U.S. FIRM TO AID CZECH REACTORS, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westinghouse intends to use its own technology to complete Soviet-designed 
nuclear reactors in the Czech Republic, the New York Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration recently approved $317 million in loan guarantees 
to finance the work, which will represent the first attempt to graft U.S. 
technology onto a Soviet-built reactor, the newspaper reported in today's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone favors the plan, however, with some critics expressing concern 
that the United States could wind up paying for a nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials say the technology would increase safety at the 
plant where the reactors are located, near the Czech town of Temelin, and that 
it represents a step toward improving safety at other Soviet-designed reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 The reactors in Temelin are the most advanced Soviet design. They are not the 
type that exploded at Chernobyl in 1986.

NORTH KOREA AGREES TO MEET TOP U.N. NUCLEAR INSPECTORS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korean officials agreed Saturday to meet senior U.N. nuclear inspectors 
and discuss plans for monitoring spent reactor fuel that could be used to 
develop nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released at its Vienna headquarters, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency said North Korea had sent a telex expressing "readiness to 
receive an agency consultation team." 
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA statement said a team of "senior safeguards officials" is expected to 
arrive Tuesday in North Korea for the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no guarantee that the north will meet the agency's demands to 
take samples from the spent fuel. The IAEA, an arm of the United Nations, 
insists on the inspections to determine whether any fuel has been diverted to 
produce plutonium, a key ingredient for atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 IAEA officials had said Thursday that they planned to notify the U.N. Security 
Council that North Korea was in "serious violation" of a nuclear safeguards 
agreement, raising the possibility of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions that the north is making nuclear arms deepened recently when it 
began removing spent fuel from an experimental reactor without inspectors 
present. North Korea contends its nuclear program is strictly non-military. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry said Friday in Washington that the north 
had allowed U.N. inspectors to verify that no such diversion had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry stressed that inspectors must now be permitted to conduct a technical 
analysis of the fuel rods removed from the reactor. Otherwise, it cannot be 
determined for certain that fuel was not diverted in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA also wants North Korea to commit itself to allowing the inspectors to 
monitor the rest of the fuel removal process, which apparently began last 
weekend and is expected to last two more months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, North Korea defended its decision to begin replacement of the 
fuel rods and brushed off criticism of the move from the United States and the 
IAEA. 
</P>
<P>
 The official Rodong Shinmun newspaper, in a dispatch monitored in Tokyo, said 
the refueling is "an inevitable consequence of the breakup of the DPRK (North 
Korea)-U.S. talks by the United States and nobody can decry it in view of 
technical safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang also took a swipe at the IAEA, saying it declined to send inspectors 
to the initial refueling because of North Korea's refusal to allow them to keep 
some of the replaced fuel rods.

YEMENI PRESIDENT VOWS TO RETAIN SOUTH'S STRONGHOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of the fourth anniversary of a now-shattered merger between North 
and South Yemen, President Ali Abdullah Saleh vowed Saturday to prevent the 
southern stronghold of Aden from seceding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now tightening the ring around Aden," he declared, echoing claims that 
the north has repeatedly made since the war erupted more than two weeks ago. So 
far, they have proved to be exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, foreign reporters covering the battle for the key mountain base 
of Al Anad, 35 miles northwest of Aden, said southern forces were retreating 
there after several days of fierce combat. From the base, soldiers can control 
the main north-south highway. 
</P>
<P>
 As they pulled back in a well-organized retreat, southern troops pounded 
Saleh's brigades with artillery and air strikes, said Ron Bagnulo, a cameraman 
for Worldwide Television News, who left Al Anad on Saturday. He said northern 
troops had moved into Al Anad, where troops were "looting everything they can 
get their hands on -- gasoline, mattresses, blankets." 
</P>
<P>
 If the southern forces are pushed out of the mountains, the way will be open 
for Saleh's troops to break into the coastal plain where the southern 
stronghold of Aden lies. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the port city, the south reportedly has amassed armor and artillery 
along with about 30,000 regulars and reservists in the city. It is also said to 
be building fortifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Saleh, an army general who ruled the former North Yemen from 1978 until the 
May 22, 1990, merger, said the south broke a unilateral cease-fire that his 
government had declared would begin at midnight Friday. A reporter confirmed 
that the south had ignored the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 From its outpost in Hadramawt province, 200 miles northeast of Aden, the 
southern leadership declared Friday that the south was seceding. On Saturday, 
Aden Radio began broadcasting the signature tune and the call sign that it used 
before the 1990 union. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger had become increasingly strained since Vice President Ali Salim 
Bidh left the capital last August in a political rift with Saleh. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidh and his men have favored exploiting the south's newly discovered oil 
wealth, which is expected to be greater than the north's. Saleh's tight control 
of oil revenue was a key factor in his feud with Bidh. 
</P>
<P>
 "After three weeks of pressure from a distance, the No. 1 objective has become 
the occupation of Aden, whatever it costs," Saleh told Italy's state-run RAI 
radio network in an interview Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Saleh's remarks, his foreign minister, Mohammed Salim Basindwah, later 
assured diplomats the north has "no intention of seizing Aden by force" but 
will encircle it. 
</P>
<P>
 A complete embargo would be difficult, however, because southern naval forces 
control the Arabian Sea coastline and could keep sea lanes open.

EMBARGO OF HAITI BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A crippling worldwide trade embargo went into effect at midnight Saturday to 
punish Haiti's military rulers for not reinstating their ousted elected leader, 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations gave the go-ahead for the ban to begin, and business owners 
shipped out their last wares. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sanctions place a trade ban on all but food, humanitarian supplies and 
medicine. The ban stiffens a fuel and arms embargo that went into effect in 
October after military rulers reneged on an agreement to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, meanwhile, signed an executive order to carry out the U.S. 
role in the embargo.

JFK GRAVE SITE SEALED OFF TO PREPARE FOR ONASSIS BURIAL; SERVICES: FAMILY'S 
WISH FOR PRIVACY IS HEEDED WITH MILITARY EFFICIENCY. ARLINGTON NATIONAL 
CEMETERY BARS PUBLIC ACCESS AS RESTING PLACE IS READIED. 
</P>

 For all these years, she pursued an utterly private life. But Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis chose to be laid to rest at one of America's most hallowed 
tourist attractions: the hauntingly serene Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, in a private ceremony, the former First Lady will be buried 
alongside her first husband, President John F. Kennedy, among the 612 acres of 
green knolls that overlook the capital and serve as the final resting place for 
more than 225,000 U.S. servicemen and women and their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems appropriate and somehow right that she and Jack will be together 
again," Jeanette Freeman of Lumberton, N.C., said during a visit to the 
cemetery Saturday. "That's just where she should be." 
</P>
<P>
 On a crystalline spring morning, Americans by the thousands streamed into the 
cemetery, intent on stopping by the grave site. However, they found access 
closed off, allowing unseen workers to ready the ground where Cape Cod stones 
frame an eternal flame at Kennedy's resting place. 
</P>
<P>
 Military police blocked access to all paths leading to the grave, which sits 
on a hillside overlooking the Lincoln Memorial just across the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
 News photographers were barred from taking pictures Saturday, even from a 
distance. At one point, three photographers were threatened with arrest if they 
did not leave. Even tourists were told not to point cameras in the direction of 
the grave site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're preparing the grave site, and the family wanted that to be done in 
private," said Adrien Creecy, a spokeswoman for the cemetery. The entire 
cemetery will be closed for the burial. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cemetery's teeming visitors center, many paused to contemplate a giant, 
wall-mounted photograph taken during the 1963 graveside services for Kennedy. 
In the foreground was his 34-year-old widow, her stoic countenance behind a 
black veil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a high school freshman then. But it's still very sentimental for me," 
Freeman said, her eyes riveted on the photograph. "Life forced her to be so 
much more public than she wanted to be. But she did it so well." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was such a nice person," added an elderly woman who sat on a wooden bench 
nearby. "It's so sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie personified womanhood," said the woman, who is from St. Louis but did 
not wish to give her name. "All the young girls wanted to take after her -- in 
their dress and in their manners. But after he (Kennedy) died, the kids fell 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who is scheduled to speak at the burial service, also paid 
tribute to Mrs. Onassis in his weekly Saturday radio address. 
</P>
<P>
 "She inspired all of us with her grace and courage. She loved art and culture 
-- all the things that express the better angels of our nature. She and 
President Kennedy made people believe that change for the better is possible, 
that public service is a noble calling, and that we ought to be about the 
business of building our country up, not tearing it down or pulling it apart," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a time of considerably more cynicism and pessimism, when harsh 
rhetoric of division and distraction and outright destruction sometimes 
dominates discussion of public issues. But it is well today to remember the 
examples of President and Mrs. Kennedy. They changed our lives for the better 
because they helped us to believe we could change for the better. That is still 
true. It is ultimately pointless and self-defeating to believe any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Saturday, mourners in New York continued to stop by Mrs. Onassis' 5th 
Avenue apartment building, congregating behind police barricades as family and 
friends arrived for a private wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Her granddaughters -- 5-year-old Rose and 4-year-old Tatiana -- arrived 
outside her apartment house in matching red coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis' daughter Caroline and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, brought 
the girls inside the building and past a media horde. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a great woman. For me, I will always remember her as a graceful, 
beautiful woman," Lisa Muica said as she wiped away tears and laid a bouquet of 
white roses at the door of the luxury building. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis, who became America's youngest-ever First Lady at age 31, died 
Thursday night at age 64 after a short battle against a virulent form of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. 
</P>
<P>
 A private funeral Mass is scheduled for 10 a.m. Monday at St. Ignatius Loyola 
Roman Catholic Church on Park Avenue. Afterward, her body is expected to be 
flown aboard a chartered plane to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Burial will follow at Arlington. Mrs. Onassis will be laid to rest next to 
Kennedy and their two children who died in infancy: Patrick, who died three 
days after birth in August, 1963; and a daughter who was stillborn in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said Saturday that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will 
attend the funeral service in New York "as a friend of the family" and that the 
President will speak at the burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton will fly with the Kennedy family aboard the jet carrying Mrs. 
Onassis' coffin to Washington and the President will be at National Airport to 
meet the entourage, a spokeswoman said.

CLINTON WRAPS UP 2-DAY CALIFORNIA VISIT; POLITICS: AFTER GOLF AT RIVIERA, THE 
PRESIDENT FLIES TO SACRAMENTO FOR ARMED FORCES DAY SPEECH AT AN AIR BASE AND A 
DEMOCRATIC FUND-RAISER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Saturday concluded a two-day trip to California that 
brought careful ladlings of praise for political allies and varied ethnic 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it was planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton seems to have erred slightly at a ceremony on Friday commemorating 
UCLA's 75th birthday when he referred to the Cinco de Mayo celebration as a 
"Mexican Independence Day." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of hailing the different racial and ethnic groups of Los 
Angeles County, the President enthused about an event he said is "now as big a 
celebration in America as it is in Mexico, because of our diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 The President got hearty applause -- except from those who knew that Clinton 
would have to stay around Los Angeles until Sept. 16 to celebrate Mexico's 
Independence Day properly. That date, in 1810, is considered the day that an 
independent Mexico was created. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he was thinking of the Mexican Independence Day," a White House 
spokeswoman said. "I think he was thinking more generically." 
</P>
<P>
 Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Battle of Puebla, in 1862, in which a group of 
Mexican fighters beat French forces seeking to consolidate control of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is often confused with Mexico's Independence Day, the distinction is 
important to many in the Latino community, who regard Cinco de Mayo as a symbol 
of a David-and-Goliath struggle against oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are two completely different events," said Lou Negrete, a professor of 
Chicano studies at Cal State Los Angeles. "It's a common mistake, but he should 
have known better. Or at least his advisers should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton left Los Angeles on Saturday after a 5 1/2-hour golf outing at the 
Riviera Country Club with Mayor Richard Riordan, UCLA Chancellor Charles Young 
and entertainment executive Merv Adelson. 
</P>
<P>
 He flew on to Sacramento for an Armed Forces Day ceremony and a Democratic 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 At McClellan Air Force Base, Clinton stood before an array of military 
aircraft, including the cutting-edge F-117 Stealth jet fighter, to hail the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 "We honor your patriotism, your service and your sacrifice," Clinton said 
before a crowd of several thousand people. He observed that as the nation has 
seen in the past year, "the simple work of maintaining peace . . . often itself 
is life-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 The President also said Americans should pause to remember acts of glory on 
D-day 50 years ago and meet today's challenges "to keep America forever strong, 
and forever young." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a time when every American of every generation should pause to 
remember and honor the sacrifices of the airmen, soldiers and sailors of 
D-day," the President said. "Their individual acts of glory and valor and their 
common efforts changed the course of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said Congress should take a cue from the tough decisions that "our 
people in the military have to make when called upon to do it" and pass health 
care reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The health and strength of our nation depends on it, and we should act this 
year," he said.

MITCHELL PREDICTS HEALTH CARE REFORM PASSAGE THIS YEAR; LEGISLATION: DESPITE 
DEMOCRATS' DISARRAY AND A GOP AD, THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER SAYS FINAL VERSION 
WILL RESEMBLE CLINTON'S IN PRINCIPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) says he is not dismayed by 
apparent disarray among Democrats on health care or by a new Republican ad 
campaign charging that President Clinton's reform plan would create a huge 
government bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said in an interview that he continues to believe that Congress will 
approve health care legislation this year, though he acknowledged that the 
ultimate version may not resemble Clinton's original proposal except in 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will include universal coverage -- health care for every American that 
can't be taken away -- which is the only thing that the President insisted on 
being in the legislation," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond that, we have to work out a way through the various divisions" of 
opinion, he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 While that task may seem overwhelming, Mitchell said some lawmakers are merely 
taking negotiating positions that will yield to future compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can get the bills through both houses this summer," Mitchell said, 
noting that the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee is now marking up 
its version of the bill and the Senate Finance Committee soon will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is moving more slowly than expected not because of any stalemate 
on underlying issues, he said, but because of unforeseen delays by the 
Congressional Budget Office in making cost estimates for the major proposals 
under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's obvious to all that the current health care system is not 
functioning efficiently and there's a consensus of the American people that it 
should be changed. but there isn't a consensus as to what the change should 
be," said Mitchell, who is leaving the Senate at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our challenge -- how to make the right changes. The Democrats have an 
incentive to seek cooperation because we need Republican votes to pass a bill. 
Republicans don't want to be seen as obstructionist." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the GOP's $500,000 TV ad campaign, which features high-profile 
Republicans criticizing Clinton's plan and calling for relatively modest 
changes in health insurance practices, Mitchell agreed that it was going to 
make passage of more substantial health care legislation more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading Republicans in the Senate and House have advocated legislation that 
would revise some aspects of health care by ending the practice of denying 
health insurance to people with pre-existing conditions, as well as by making 
other changes to prevent loss of coverage when people change jobs or become 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, however, said that approach falls short of the broader health care 
reform goals because it would not provide insurance coverage to the tens of 
millions of people who do not now have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their (Republicans') solution is no solution," Mitchell said. "Their position 
is to do as little as possible and say they are for reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he is hoping for more bipartisan cooperation and noted that last 
week Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee had taken "a step in the right direction" by voting unanimously in 
favor of one cost-control provision. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee voted to give a national health board the power to curtail 
benefits and raise out-of-pocket expenses for consumers if necessary to 
restrain medical spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell gave high marks to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.), who has been sharply critical of some aspects of Clinton's 
health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's providing good and effective leadership," Mitchell said, 
rejecting as inaccurate many published reports that Moynihan has been an 
obstacle to passage of a health care bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He obviously doesn't like parts of the President's bill -- neither do I -- 
but I think he's committed to action this year on a good reform bill. I am 
confident that he will play a pivotal leadership role in getting it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell has taken the lead on the health care issue by conducting discussions 
at closed sessions of Democratic senators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I presented several alternatives -- some of which I favor and some of which I 
don't -- to provoke discussion," he said. "It ultimately will help in 
developing a consensus."

EX-MAYOR BARRY BATTLES 2 OTHERS IN D.C. COMEBACK BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 District of Columbia Council members Marion Barry and John Ray on Saturday 
formally began their battle for the mayor's office, assailing incumbent Sharon 
Pratt Kelly for failing to stem the city's decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Former mayor Barry stepped onto the stage at Coolidge High School in a bid to 
complete a remarkable political comeback by reclaiming the office he left in 
disgrace after his 1990 conviction for drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested and tried during the last year of his 12 years as mayor, he served a 
prison term and re-entered politics to win election to the council 18 months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry told supporters that his experiences have made him better qualified to 
lead the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who better to lead than someone who has faced the tumultuous fires of 
failures, disappointment, hurt, chastening, recovery, restoration, redemption?" 
he asked. "I know during the difficult times of my valley experience, I hurt 
and disappointed a lot of people, but none more than myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who better to say to our young people: 'Yes, you can fall down. You can be 
put down or you might even take yourself down, but what is more important is 
that you get up.' Look at me. I got up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray served notice that he will not watch Barry return without a fight. "I'm 
not going to allow Marion Barry to hustle the city again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's mayoral race is the sixth since the 1974 Home Rule Charter let 
D.C. residents elect their own chief executive.

WALTER MOSLEY'S SECRET STORIES; A RIDE WITH A MYSTERY WRITER WHO EVOKES THE 
UNCLICHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lynell George, Lynell George is a Times staff writer. Her 1992 book, No 
Crystal Stair: African Americans in the City of Angels, will be reissued in 
paperback by Anchor Doubleday in July.

<P>
 Midafternoon, and we are sailing. The wide span of Century Boulevard seems 
vast in its possibilities, a seductive expanse with room to roam or expand. At 
quick glimpse, it is sparkling, but a brief pause at a light reveals something 
quite different -- a poorly patched facade, a wall of chain link encircling 
nothing, rubble from some long-lost decade left to rot or rust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at these giant streets!" Walter Mosley rides jump seat, taking in L.A. 
the way many Angelenos do, at 45-miles-per, the window raised, studying the 
blur of color and shapes skidding outside the windshield. We make a left onto 
Central Avenue, slowing enough to see features on figures sitting in Will 
Rogers Park. Picnics. A ballgame. Families, black and brown, taking advantage 
of the sun, the air carrying a cool mist that, with imagination, could conjure 
the nearby ocean. "These houses are nice -- they're little, tiny," he says. "A 
lot of people come here and say: 'When are we gonna get to the bad community?' 
" The answer comes in a voice colored the softest shade of irony: "You're in 
it, brother." 
</P>
<P>
 At the tip of 76th Place and Central slumps the shell of a broken and singed 
mini-mall threatening complete collapse. The All-American Liquor Junior 
Market's marquee still advertises "Hot dogs $2.50," as if the building is only 
momentarily darkened, the owner under the weather or off on a brief vacation. 
And there are survivors -- fish markets, a shoeshine parlor-cum-barbershop, a 
senior citizen center, the Universal Missionary Baptist Church, all grouped 
around empty lots strewn with trash and weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley grew up here, and he's been mining these broad streets, and their 
smaller side arteries, for stories for nearly half a dozen years. But at first, 
he doesn't seem to register the damaged terrain. Or doesn't speak about it. 
He's busier reconstructing the past, letting the vacant lots spark a fragment 
of a memory, reading the symbols in piles of wood and iron.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid along (this stretch of Central), there was a White Front, a 
hardware store, a liquor store, little markets and bars, a shoe store, 
television repair shops, a whole economic community," he recalls, his voice 
moving with a bit of a rhythmic lilt. In moments, he erects filling stations in 
empty lots, replaces the nuclear-age post office with the old Goodyear plant 
and a parking lot full of gleaming tail fins. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley's measure of fame comes from the detective stories he's astutely woven 
from that vanished place. His mysteries are period works, spanning 1948-1961 on 
these streets -- Denker and Slauson and hot-lit Central Avenue -- where dreams 
and hard work intersect. And Ezekiel (Easy) Rawlins, his reluctant private eye, 
navigates the hurdles of this world -- the Police Department, the subtleties of 
discrimination, unabashed racism -- with both feet planted firmly on the 
sidewalks banking these wide boulevards. A protagonist acutely sensitive to the 
mercurial nature of his world, Easy's not quite a social commentator, nor an 
island of a private eye like Philip Marlowe. Instead, he's at the center, 
struggling, hoping to make it through one day into the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy Rawlins is about to appear on film, played by Denzel Washington, as Carl 
Franklin ("One False Move") directs "Devil in a Blue Dress." "Devil" (1990) and 
Mosley's third book, "White Butterfly" (1992), were nominated for Edgar awards; 
"Butterfly" and his second, "A Red Death" (1991), were nominated for Golden 
Dagger awards ("Butterfly" won). President Bill Clinton has proclaimed Mosley 
his favorite mystery writer, and his works -- which sell well but have not hit 
the bestseller charts -- pop up on college reading lists with increasing 
frequency, surrounded by the works of Chester Himes, Richard Wright and Ralph 
Ellison, his most frequently cited literary forebears. The latest Rawlins 
installment, "Black Betty," set at the dawn of the '60s, four years before 
Watts blew, is due next month. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. itself, you could say, comes to Mosley in a dream. He lives in Greenwich 
Village in New York, estranged from this city for more than a decade -- L.A. 
was a claustrophobic web of the too-familiar and the unattainable, and he had 
to escape -- but he's never stopped feeling the pull of the city's 
possibilities. It's a somewhat idealized L.A. that Mosley creates in his books, 
patterned after the close, culturally diverse South Los Angeles community of 
his youth, not the alienating vastness he felt navigating through the rest of 
the city. He re-creates that early community, those connections, those voices, 
with memory, history and the grand stories of his late father, Leroy Mosley. 
The vision of Los Angeles that persists in his writing is a clever variation on 
the one he remembers but is worlds apart from the one he confronts on brief 
visits. Though the city inhabits his heart and head, "I don't get it from 
L.A.," he says. "I get it from how I stand in relation to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing about Easy, he says, "is in a way reclaiming experience." And in 
recasting the past, Mosley also lends a sense of clarity to the present -- and 
possibly the future.  
</P>
<P>
 IT IS QUINTESSENTIAL RAYMOND CHANDLER: "I WENT ON OUT AND AMOS had the Caddy 
there waiting," Chandler's detective Philip Marlowe observes in "The Long 
Goodbye." "He drove me back to Hollywood. I offered him a buck but he wouldn't 
take it. I offered to buy him the poems of T.S. Eliot. He said he already had 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Amos, Chandler's "middle-aged colored chauffeur," is a shadow figure whom 
Walter Mosley would eagerly give flesh and form. With lyric grace, Mosley has 
evoked many of those who passed through in silence, subtly sketching faces and 
histories for figures that have appeared as ghosts in this genre. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 1948 when Easy Rawlins, in Mosley's first installment, is laid off from 
his aerospace job in Santa Monica. World War II had created a humming assembly 
line of defense-industry jobs that helped fuel a mass migration west to fill 
them. But when an exhausted Easy refuses to put in a little overtime after a 
particularly hard shift, his high-strung boss fires him, leaving Easy in a 
spot, unsure of how he'll raise his $64 mortgage payment. As he mulls it over 
in a neighborhood bar owned by an ex-boxer named Joppy, his answer sidles up to 
him: DeWitt Albright, a white man in a flashing white suit glaringly out of 
place in these environs, who knows a little too much about Easy's private 
affairs but offers him fast money to a find a white woman who "has a 
predilection for the company of Negroes." It's Easy's chance out.  
</P>
<P>
 "Working for Joppy's friend was the only way I saw to keep my house. But there 
was something wrong, I could feel it in my fingertips. DeWitt Albright made me 
uneasy. . . . I was unhappy about going to meet Mr. Albright because I wasn't 
used to going into white communities like Santa Monica to conduct business," 
says Easy, ". . . but the idea that I'd give him the information he wanted, and 
that he'd give me enough money to pay the next month's mortgage, made me happy. 
I was dreaming about the day I'd be able to buy more houses, maybe even a 
duplex." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy is the tangible, full-coverage insurance, the safety net, for his 
clients, Mosley explains. "The idea about Easy is, who will be there for you 
when you really need it? And this is not whether you need $10, this is like 
when you come running and somebody's after you. Easy is not the kind of guy who 
figures, 'Well if I do this, I'll get killed.' He says: 'I'll do this, and I 
might get killed but I'm going to do it anyway, because this is where you have 
to stand up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Mosley speaks of Easy, it's as if he's relating the escapades of an 
irascible cousin or the brother with the gold tooth who always gets the barber 
chair with the best light -- a figure he knows inside and out. In the stories, 
Easy emerges as the sort of black male figure that so much of popular culture 
has collectively erased from public consciousness or has yet to find a place 
for at the dinner table. There is a familiarity about him, a human softness 
that despite the unrelenting violence of his life allows him to be sickened by 
the sight of a corpse or to open his heart and arms to children, whom he takes 
in like strays. There are friends to answer to, comeuppance to be paid. He, 
unlike Chandler's Marlowe, is irrevocably tied to his world, his community, the 
landscape. "He has a lot of commitments in the world. These people are people 
he knows and he's responsible for. I don't understand how somebody like Marlowe 
could live," says Mosley. "He had no friends, no lovers really. No children, no 
parents, no job. I mean nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy's universality, his human side, appealed to Jesse Beaton, who is 
producing the film version of "Devil in a Blue Dress" with Gary Goetzman; 
Jonathan Demme and Ed Saxon are executive producers. Browsing at a West 
Hollywood bookstore, Beaton, who was eager to find another project to tackle 
after "One False Move," pulled the book from the mystery shelves a few years 
back. She was taken by it for a couple of reasons. "There's so little 
documentation of that period in L.A. We know a lot about Harlem, what a rich, 
lively, vital world it was. Unfortunately, so much of that (L.A.) world is 
physically lost. Burned in fires, riots, rezoned, crashed down, empty lots. 
Very little of Central Avenue remains. The Dunbar (Hotel) is there, but what 
was surrounding it is not." On a personal level, she emphasizes, "I was about 
to lose my house. I thought, in this world we live in, people who feel that 
they would never have anything in common with someone like Easy Rawlins do. We 
all are trying to hold on to that bit of the American dream. I felt that 
whoever you were, you would understand this. I lost my house," she says with a 
chuckle, "but Easy kept his." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy Rawlins has friends to spare, in more than one city. "He sort of 
represents that mass movement out of the South and into L.A. during the war," 
says David Fine, editor of the anthology "Los Angeles in Fiction" and professor 
of English at Cal State Long Beach. "Watts is filled with displaced 
Southerners. There is this sense in his novels of people living on the edge, 
being uprooted and displaced. I don't know anybody who writes about 
South-Central that way. He's got a real sense of life lived exposed, raw, right 
on the edge of existence." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Mosley's work sound authentic to many black readers' ears is that 
he never uses the shorthand "South-Central" in his writings. He steers clear of 
sweeping generalizations, working to create an image so clear one can see its 
pores or recognize the voice in the dark. Many a behatted church lady will be 
happy to tell you that before the '70s, "L.A. Negroes" lived on the east side 
or the west side of a city efficiently divided by Central Avenue. "It was 
wonderful," says Mosley's childhood friend Kirsten Childs, "to see (in Mosley's 
books) this place that's not a caricature and not smaller than life. Not 
meaner, not nicer. People live here, grow up and die here. It was like this 
whole world was created as I remembered it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Richard Yarborough, associate professor of English and 
Afro-American studies at UCLA, compare Mosley's simple yet vivid landscapes to 
those of filmmaker Charles Burnett, who directed "To Sleep With Anger" and 
"Killer of Sheep," both about black life in Los Angeles. Their manner of 
revealing the uncliched complexities of life in black L.A. is often elegant, 
even in its grittiness. Yarborough sees the most striking similarities in the 
way Burnett's and Mosley's work shows big-city life in the postwar decades 
merging with the superstitions and pace of the South. And Mosley, he says, 
"captures the oral tradition right in the movement from the one site where it 
grew up to the other where it is changing. Easy can speak quote-unquote, 
conventional English, or he can speak black English. In 'A Red Death,' he is 
reading about Roman history, yet he has Army experience and is part of the 
street."  
</P>
<P>
 Easy finds his surest footing as a black everyman -- someone's father, 
brother, cousin, lover -- with bills to pay, marital problems, feuding friends 
and an insatiable lust for a life that is seldom anything less than hard. He's 
not a formal detective with a license, he's a "utility man" who does favors; in 
his part of town, he knows where to go, what to ask and how to ask it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a secret glee when I went into a bar and ordered a beer with money 
someone else had paid me," Easy confides in "Devil in a Blue Dress." "I'd ask 
the bartender his name and talk about anything, but really, behind my friendly 
talk, I was working to find something. Nobody knew what I was up to, and that 
made me sort of invisible; people thought that they saw me but what they really 
saw was an illusion of me, something that wasn't real." 
</P>
<P>
 THERE ARE MANY WHO MIGHT LAY CLAIM TO BEING MOSLEY'S PARADIGM for Easy. 
Neighborhood cronies. Back-room prophets. It's Mosley's father who's most often 
cited. But, says Mosley's friend Childs, "I know that Easy is based on a lot of 
different people, but there is a part of Easy that is definitely Walter. This 
major vulnerability. There were certain things that were letting you see part 
of Walter's soul, part of Walter's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, a pretty air-tight argument can be made that Easy's progenitor, 
a man whose favorite color is gray, is just as elliptical as the character he 
so impeccably created. Even though he would furiously argue the point, he, too, 
could meld with the shadows -- if his eyes didn't skitter about so much.  
</P>
<P>
 "Easy isn't a shadow," Mosley maintains, and so begins the dance, the teasing 
smile in his voice. "You know what he's thinking, doing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the people in his life don't." 
</P>
<P>
 "True." 
</P>
<P>
 "So wouldn't that make him a shadow?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well . . . not exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is interspersed with a running commentary as we drive through 
vaguely familiar haunts, but if the conversation veers too close to the 
territory Mosley chooses not to discuss, he deflects questions with veils of 
jokes and riddles and anecdotes or turns inquiries inside out. The entire 
production is performed always with the most elated version of his smile, fully 
revealing a generous gap separating his front teeth. Shifting characters, maybe 
slipping into the voice of Easy's best friend Mouse, or giving voice to an 
anonymous man standing on the corner, Mosley's a mimic at the ready with quick, 
and many times acerbic, remarks.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the '40s, there was a time of great hope in Los Angeles," he says, his 
eyes lit with the momentum of a story. "It was a big place, it was a 
countrified place. It was a place where if there was a job, the job was digging 
ditches, it wasn't somebody saying: 'We're looking for colored people or 
Japanese people (to dig) ditches.' It was, 'We're looking for people to dig 
ditches.' So no matter what color you were, you were working there. And if you 
were a white man and said: 'I'm not working next to that niggah,' they'd say, 
'Well, get outta here, because I got 20 niggahs working here and I need to dig 
my ditches.' There was hope and opportunity. And as L.A. began to redefine that 
hope, that possibility, the dream lost a lot of its glitter. Even though a lot 
of the dream came true -- a lot of us who came through that time became lawyers 
and doctors -- still, a lot of us are down in the boarded-up 'hood." 
</P>
<P>
 At once warm and veiled, there is the public Mosley: the raconteur, the 
debater, the banterer, the charmer, the wild and wide-eyed 8-year-old; there is 
a more contained Mosley: the thinker, the analyst, the inquisitor. He's as 
obsessed with the intricacies of "Married With Children" as by the stories of 
his orphan father's vagabond youth in Louisiana and Texas. He's a conundrum who 
pulls from Louis Armstrong and folk singer Mary McCaslin with equal fervor and 
fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is kind of an elusiveness to his soul," says Frederic Tuten, who was 
Mosley's writing instructor and is now his best friend. "I can't presume to say 
that I know Walter." This understanding seems only to deepen their connection. 
"We both have this kind of strange part of us that didn't grow up, so the world 
is always full of surprises. It's as if the two of us have been condemned to 
solitary confinement, and when we're let out, we are sort of amazed by what we 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 What passes in Mosley's view this particular afternoon is not the 
often-resurrected image of a bombed-out war zone, although these communities 
and their collections of wide boulevards and tree-lined streets are struggling 
with their wounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a community of scarring," says Mosley. "It started in '65 and 
(then) just got more and more." We roll along, verbally sifting the remains, 
wondering about the cause of the damage: urban unrest of '65 or '92? Maybe a 
neighborhood fire or the earthquake or just plain old garden-variety urban 
blight? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's great wealth in the city, but there is a kind of disintegration going 
on," he says, still watching, recording the image, possibly filing it away. He 
readjusts himself in the seat. "You have to understand the character of these 
people from the inside, not from the outside. I don't know who this fellow is," 
he says, gesturing toward a stout man in a three-piece suit, glasses, Bible in 
hand, his black hair powdered with patches of silver. "He's not walking like 
he's nervous, you know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley believes, as do many African-American educators and pundits, that what 
rests at the core of this community's unraveling has less to do with absence of 
monetary riches than it does with historical amnesia. "An identity has been 
misplaced, and that's one of the things that I'm a very small part of. 
Everything that happens to black people in America is not talked about. So we 
lose it. It's not written down." Countering this loss within popular fiction, 
Mosley suggests, is like chasing a remedy with that proverbial spoonful of 
sugar. "It's an adventure," he says with a coy laugh, "because most of the 
things that Easy does are kinda fun." 
</P>
<P>
 On this stretch of road, the juxtapositions are jarring -- the crumbling 
detritus of some once-fetching 1940 storefront squats next to a circa-1980 
convenience structure of glass and concrete. The ragtag collection plays tricks 
with time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 These darkened doorways inspire brighter memories. "Even though most of those 
stores were owned by white people, at least there were stores in the community 
where people could go shopping, where people could get jobs. There was a 
relationship developing with the community, and that's really what's gone. And 
that, I think, is analogous to a physical reflection, in a negative sense, (to) 
the hope that is also gone from the community." His voice goes soft, loses 
speed. "But a lot of the people are the same. They're still here." 
</P>
<P>
 And 76th Place itself pulses on. For 10 years, the Mosleys lived here, near 
Central, in a white wood-frame house edged in green, with a small front porch 
that provided a perfect stage for stories. Today, it's a street of 
single-family dwellings, pastel duplexes, rose bushes, birds of paradise 
exploding askew. A woman, on her knees, polishes the knob of her iron screen 
door while children, mostly Latino, command the center of the street with balls 
and bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the corner, a large wood-frame court of bungalows painted crisp white, 
its property line marked off by a tall iron fence, sparks something. Mosley 
leans forward in his seat to frame the picture better. "Right here is the court 
-- Poinsettia Court -- they're all over L.A.," he says, finger jabbing at the 
glass. "That's where I imagined Easy living." 
</P>
<P>
 It all comes back in a flood. An easy smile moves across his sand-colored face 
and large, sad eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 "My father raised me in this neighborhood and he had high hopes for me. It 
wasn't: 'Walter can get a job at the garage, maybe, if he's lucky.' He was 
saying, 'My son is going to make it, 'cause I'm going to make something out of 
my son,' which he did."  
</P>
<P>
 What might be absent physically is made up for by what has failed to dissipate 
spiritually, Mosley notes. "This community is still really kind of wonderful 
because when you really look directly at people, people are kind of smiling a 
lot and telling each other stories. (But) it's kind of a funny (feeling). It's 
not like what I remember physically, but then again, it is what I remember 
physically." 
</P>
<P>
 The unfolding scene plays tricks with one's memory. With the notion of memory 
itself. Vaguely familiar backdrops, partly familiar players. This lively 
tree-banked street next to Central Avenue, where life persists despite its new 
ghost-town feel. Beauty parlors specializing in a "Texas press and curl" and 
soul food cafes now coexist with discotecas and mariscos and taco stands. And 
behind it all, lending a somewhat surreal backdrop, the downtown skyline hovers 
like Oz. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the block a little farther, Mosley points out a house stripped, he says, 
of its former character. His full lips return to a gentle pout. "That's my 
house right there, but it's not the same anymore."  
</P>
<P>
 This little strip of small homes, duplexes and bungalow courts was, Mosley 
believes, much more of a neighborhood than could be found elsewhere in the 
basin. He remembers a community that often disregarded color, religion and 
ethnicity, possibly important for a child whose father was black and whose 
mother was white and also Jewish. He grew up relating the struggles of his 
black forebears to those of his mother's Eastern European lineage. He speaks of 
fleeting crushes on the Mexican girls who lived nearby and was fascinated by 
them because they were "so Catholic." This community that "got along" was 
perhaps a built-in comfort zone for Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knew one another. People are still living there who lived there 
when I was a little kid, and that's not the way you think of L.A. The real Los 
Angeles, the Los Angeles I lived in, there was no Hollywood. One thing," says 
Mosley, his voice drifting like a whisper, "even though you couldn't find a way 
out, there was a great sense of possibility."  
</P>
<P>
 ELLA MOSLEY ADMITS SHE KEPT a sentinel's watch on her only child. She and her 
husband met at a local school (she was an elementary school clerk, he was a 
plant manager), and Walter Ellis Mosley was born in 1952. "I always worried 
about him, and you don't want to be that way, but you can't help it," she says. 
"Walter wanted to walk down the street one time to the store, he was 6 maybe, 
he had never done that before. There was nothing that could have happened to 
him, so we let him, but I'm walking on the other side, trying to keep out of 
sight." 
</P>
<P>
 About the time Walter was ready for junior high, the family moved across town 
to a comfortable four-plex just off the western stretch of Pico, a new retreat 
that Leroy Mosley, who collected property as others do stamps, made a hideaway 
by planting an exotic array of vegetables, fruits and flowers.  
</P>
<P>
 Drifting back to his adolescent years, Mosley recalls most clearly the ache at 
the pit of his lungs from the air that so often smudged the skies ocher. He 
remembers feeling trapped within the flat, hot vastness. 
</P>
<P>
 He read voraciously. "I'm not sure that it was traveling through books. I love 
to read. I was reading Dickens, Hesse, that kinda brooding youth stuff. I was 
reading whatever I got introduced to in school that I liked, and stuff my 
parents had just read. My first favorite book was 'Treasure Island.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His intake later increased to include a steady diet of comic books and 
paperback sci-fi. Mysteries didn't enter into the picture until his 20s, and 
the only writing he was flirting with at the time didn't venture further than 
poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very unhappy," he says. "It seems to me like I wanted something, but 
the something was intangible; I didn't know how to get it. In L.A., that big 
middle portion of L.A., people don't walk on the streets, people don't come 
from the same background or the same area, so your connection with people is 
very tenuous at best." Once out of his little neighborhood, the connection was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 He cut it completely when he decided to attend Goddard, a "radical" arts 
college in Vermont. "I thought I really had to go someplace where people will 
be like me. Things that I will say, they will understand." But upon his 
arrival, Mosley wasn't sure he understood them. "They had a large black 
population . . . and they were all living in the same dorm, except me. It 
wasn't that the school wanted them to live there, it was the decision on their 
part. I thought, 'I'm going to search out a ghetto to live in? Nuh uh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He drifted from one campus to another and from one set of adventures to still 
others without a goal, with not even the essence of direction. "I think I was 
informed by like the Kerouac and Ginsberg sensibility, and also by L.A. and the 
hippie movement," he explains. And what was he studying? Mosley pauses, then 
lets out an explosion that doubles as a laugh -- "Who knows?"  
</P>
<P>
 Writing came a little later, like a storm out of nowhere. After receiving a BA 
in political science from Vermont's Johnson State College in 1977, he met Joy 
Kellman, a dancer-choreographer, while he was working on a Ph.D at the 
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. They married in 1988. He'd shown talent 
as a potter and painter and some aptitude for computers. "I was sitting in a 
room, and I was working as a consultant programmer. It was a Saturday, and 
nobody else was there. I was writing programs. I got tired of it, so I started 
typing on the computer," he says. "I typed: 'On hot sticky days in southern 
Louisiana, the fire ants swarmed. . . .' I said -- 'Hey, this is cool. This 
means I could be a writer.' So I start writing." 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, a manuscript, "Gone Fishin'," under his belt, he enrolled in 
a graduate creative writing program at City College of New York. It was 1986. 
"He was writing these wonderful, beautiful stories," says Mosley's onetime 
instructor Tuten, author of "Tallien: A Brief Romance." "The vividness of the 
characterizations, the very simple, elegant beauty of the prose. And there is a 
lyricism there that you don't find in much American writing today." 
</P>
<P>
 After Mosley had completed his instruction with Tuten and won CCNY's De Jur 
Award, he asked Tuten to critique a new manuscript. Excited by the power of the 
work, Tuten took it to his agent, who promised to sell the book -- and did, six 
weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't give it to me with that kind of anticipation," Tuten says. Since 
then Mosley has weathered the blizzard of events, Tuten believes, with ego 
safely in check. "He's had plenty of occasions to play a big shot. He's never 
done it with anybody. I can't say that he's humble. He knows the value of this 
work, but he didn't become a writer to become famous. He didn't become a writer 
to become a celebrity. That happened, and I've never seen anyone else handle it 
so well as he."  
</P>
<P>
 Walter happy at last? Well, happy would seem a stretch. Contented but busy 
seems to sum up his demeanor, which at moments makes him appear as if he is 
leaning on a gilded railing of some grand balcony, watching it all unfold. 
Lately, his thoughts center more on the final tinkerings on his blues novel, 
"RL's Dream" (due next year) and testing his chops with a screenplay, his own 
take on the relatively nascent 'hood-film genre that he's been banging out on 
his laptop in his Santa Monica hotel room. With all the clamor surrounding him 
of late, Mosley seems to fly from vague disinterest to a quiet merriment when 
talk of his success rises in conversation. "He's very controlled," his mother 
confides later. "But being too controlled is not good. I always thought that 
his head would get too big, but he is just as easygoing. (He) never lets on 
that everything is great." 
</P>
<P>
 AT ITS DOWNTOWN source, Pico Boulevard, crowded with life, noisy with 
enterprise, serves as the vivid bridge, the wide road to the Westside. It's the 
bridge from Central Avenue to Mosley's teen years, the period in which he 
planned his grand escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so L.A., these palm trees standing here, big wide streets and all 
these completely innocuous cinder-block buildings. It seems like this place 
where nothing real is going on, which is why you can really write crime fiction 
about L.A. -- because really behind all these things, there is all this weird 
stuff, and strange people who come from all over the place . . . and you don't 
know where they went after they left here. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see something like this," he gestures toward the boulevard, "this 
isn't as real as what's in your head. In your head, you have the details," says 
Mosley. His gestures are careful, understated. His hands are reserved only for 
the most dramatic moment in the action, a crescendo. "When I was a kid, and 
this was before cable, black people got together and told stories. And 
storytelling is its own fuel. All you have to do is evoke a feeling. Sometimes 
it's just a word. A sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 However, unlike Easy, who has cast his lot with Los Angeles ("He's going to 
live in his neighborhood. And either he is going to get killed in that 
neighborhood or he's going to survive in that neighborhood"), Mosley hasn't.

 "I wouldn't live in Los Angeles," he says. "The center of Los Angeles, though 
I am moved by it aesthetically, living in it, I remember being very kind of, I 
(didn't) know how to get out. There were no walls, but there was great 
distance."  
</P>
<P>
 He's tiring of questions or maybe of just coming up with serious answers to 
them. The 8-year-old peeks from behind the hedge, the trickster upsetting the 
balance, toppling the status quo. With a part-dreamy, part-devilish expression 
inhabiting his eyes, he takes a breather.  
</P>
<P>
 Roaming around his hotel-room carpet on stocking feet, he finally pauses to 
install himself in the love seat, to take advantage of its view of the very 
edge -- the lazy Pacific as it curls and stretches eight stories below. He 
sits, legs pulled beneath him, dressed entirely, once again, in black: socks, 
jet shirt tucked into charcoal trousers. His calf-length cashmere coat, which 
he wears on the dust jacket of "White Butterfly," and his Kangol hat (one of a 
pair he and his father purchased in London) are draped across the foot of the 
bed, suggesting that the pause is only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the week, he's been busy with a varying collection of 
duties and diversions: lunch with his mother, a visit to his father's grave (he 
died of lung cancer late last year), a meeting with "the movie people," 
interviews, more pages filed away on the screenplay and, of course, some time 
set aside to catch up with his favorite TV family, the Bundys on "Married With 
Children." The room is cluttered with tools of his spare time: a Hilma Wolitzer 
novel, a copy of Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451" (for an essay he's working 
on), a flute and sheet music. His laptop, folded away, rests on the room's only 
table. His morning writing ritual is a constant. With the jet-lag, it begins at 
3:30; he quits at about 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "A novel, it seems to me, has to be larger than the mind of the writer," he 
says. The largeness of L.A., though daunting and "stultifying" to a younger 
Mosley, is now the precise dimension he seeks to replicate in his work. "The 
novel is based on a plot, and the best way to describe a plot to me is the 
structure of revelation. If you can hold it all within a small space, a space 
small enough for you to see and perceive, then you don't have the feeling of 
revelation, because it's too controlling. What you want is something big, where 
things surprise you, where things become." 
</P>
<P>
 He would like to avoid narrow pigeonholes or empty spokesman roles, despite 
the expectations of those of any hue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expectations?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you know if you're black and you make it, you should want to be helping 
other black people in ways that most people don't even help their family. And I 
think a lot of black people feel that responsibility. I know I do," he admits. 
"But at the same time, it can interfere with your work. People come up to you 
and say, 'Well, you have to write in African tones, my brother.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Well, you know, I'm writing the way I write.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'But you see, your mind has been brainwashed by The Man, and you have to 
return to our true identity.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He tends to be more populist and universal in his thinking. "A good novel 
comes out into the world and grows as people read it. Other people, they see 
things, learn things, they get a little inkling of something that may make its 
way into something else (or in the) actions that they take in their own lives. 
I want black people to have a good time. I mean, I want black people to read 
the book and say, 'That's my language, that's my life. That's my history. But I 
want white people to say, 'Boy, you know, I feel just like that!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Human struggle, failure, and the occasional reward of good fortune serve as 
the dramatic and emotional engines for much of Mosley's work. "I'm not really 
happy," he says, "with political writing as political writing. That kind of 
sociopolitical writing they do about black life -- 'The Black Man, blah, blah, 
blah, and the Black Woman, blah, blah, blah.' And then the white this and Jim 
Crow and all this other stuff. I mean I like mentioning it, because I think 
it's a part. But it's such a small part of black life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics?" I coax him toward elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, politics is a big part of our life, and so is racism. But most black 
people are living lives, making love, raising children, listening to music, 
working hard, saving money, learning new skills in order to survive, watching 
television, telling jokes, telling stories -- so much of life is that. And 
black life in America is really kind of a celebration. Even when people are 
really sad," says Mosley, eyes wide, hands painting vast landscapes, portraits, 
busy triptychs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when they're sad, how do they celebrate it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is sly, trademark-simple: "That's the blues."

WAR AND REMEMBRANCE; FROM LONDON TO NORMANDY TO BERLIN, A DAUGHTER FOLLOWS HER 
VETERAN FATHER IN SEARCH OF HIS MEMORIES AND THE SOURCE OF HIS GRAND SILENCE.

<P>
 WE HAVE RENTED A RENAULT, MY FATHER, MY MOTHER AND I, AND ARE MAKING haste 
through rain-washed Norman countryside toward Omaha Beach. My infant daughter 
sleeps in a car seat in the back; my father, uncharacteristically expansive on 
this blustery morning, is telling about how Allied reconnaissance flights flew 
up and down over these verdant coastal farmlands 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew every square inch of these beaches," he says. "They knew some of 
them were sand, some of them were shingle and some had cliffs, but what they 
didn't know about, and why not I don't know, were the hedgerows." 
</P>
<P>
 I try to look at the terrain without running off the road. The dread hedgerows 
of June 6. Centuries-old walls of root and earth, trees, shrubs and vines 
sprouting out of the top, they border every cultivated field around here; 
anyone could see why they made for so much trouble during the invasion we have 
come to contemplate. Nine thousand British, American and Canadian casualties by 
the close of business on that first day of Europe's liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain has stopped when we pull into the American cemetery overlooking Omaha 
Beach, but a special-effects wind sweeps fiercely up from the Channel. Under 
sullen, early spring skies, the grounds are of a heartbreaking sweetness and 
mesure . Little signs urge "Silence and Respect" in English and "Picnicking 
Forbidden" in French. The only sound is the wind raking the pines. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother stays in the car with the sleeping baby. Not far from the graves, my 
father and I come to a small, tidy house where records are kept of those buried 
here. A young Frenchwoman helps my father search for his friends from basic 
training. He finds Joseph Woodbury, from Michigan, and one Willy Preiss of 
Georgia, who went airborne when my father didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willy Preiss. . . . We used to talk about politics." He recalls that they had 
read some of the same books and shared progressive views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he joined the 101st Airborne, and I didn't see him for about a month," 
he says. "I finally ran into him in London. He was on furlough, on his way to a 
movie. He said he liked the Airborne. Glad he signed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Frenchwoman invites my father to sign a log of veteran-visitors, and we 
step back outside and return to the car. We say nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR 15 YEARS AS A REPORTER, I HAVE MADE A LIVING BY JUST LISTENING TO people: 
a Red Army general in Kabul, a Senderista in a Peruvian dungeon, earthquake 
survivors in a broken, flaming metropolis. . . . I am permitted to ask such 
people more or less what I want. The arresting thing about this work is not how 
hard it is to get people to open up, but what a chore it can be to get them to 
give it a rest. And yet for all the notebooks filled with anecdotes and 
confessions, there is one "subject" I haven't listened to, haven't penciled in 
for an hour of Q&A, haven't wanted to confront at all. That is my father. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an intensely quiet man, a journalist's nightmare, really, someone who 
answers questions with a straight-up yes or no and then shuffles off into the 
substantial acreage of his private preserve of thought. He was an 
insurance-claims examiner whose dislike of the work he did for 40 years would 
be hard to overstate; a dour, card-carrying Grant Wood Calvinist, an elder of 
the Presbyterian Church, no less, and one who really means it, to judge from 
his tithing; and a tree-farmer who has all his life been most content alone, in 
an unheated shack in the piney realm of northern Wisconsin, feeding on 
sardines, Wonder Bread and a cup of Swiss Miss brought to a boil on a Coleman 
stove. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband likes to say Thomas Edward Williams is wired to an invisible 
Walkman: "If taciturnity were an Olympic event, your father'd make it to the 
medal round, no question."  
</P>
<P>
 "Surely the Serbs will come around after a whiff of the grape!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Could be." 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet the Blue Jays take it in six!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, I have accepted my father's grand apartness as just the way things 
are with him. I never cared -- or is it dared? -- to look beneath the smoother 
surfaces. But when he turned 72 recently, the silence began to grow unsettling. 
I was seized by a sense of something left undone. There are no gut-spillers in 
my family, but I began to think it far better to address certain yearnings now 
than pack around regrets later. 
</P>
<P>
 And I knew that there was only one solvent for any decent conversation with 
him -- the Second World War. On this topic, my father is not just willing to 
talk, he can turn positively garrulous, even with perfect strangers. I once 
stood by in astonishment as he buttonholed a man with an English accent in a 
Hong Kong bus queue. He was Of a Certain Age, and my father decided to see 
whether the fellow felt like discussing what his war had been like.  
</P>
<P>
 My father is anything but a war-lover, but in the years since his return in 
1945 from occupied Germany to Wisconsin, his beloved trees, his desk job and my 
mother, he has made himself an accomplished amateur scholar of this war, his 
war. How many other little girls would bike home from their flute lessons and 
find their father curled up with Marshall Zhukov's memoirs?  
</P>
<P>
 "What did you do in the war, Daddy?"  
</P>
<P>
 I had never bothered to ask. Neither had my brother, or either of my sisters. 
All of us had other demands on our attention, I suppose -- like "Gilligan's 
Island" -- and enough teen-age foolishness to keep us from wondering what the 
last generation had seen, and whether it might not hold something for us.  
</P>
<P>
 In any case, I had only the most notional sense of what my father's GI life 
had been all about -- he had not seen any action, he was a clerk, something to 
do with Operation Overlord, the planning for D-Day. Now I wanted to know just 
what it was, and why those times seem to mean so desperately much to him, even 
five decades later. 
</P>
<P>
 Could his great, mysterious silence be traced to the war, to some 
transformative moment of awfulness as he soldiered in 1944 and 1945 from 
southern England to Normandy, and finally to Berlin? 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, things seemed to come together to provide a father and daughter 
convergence -- half-century observances were pouring down on the consciousness 
of all but Europe's dead and addlebrained -- and I was moving to Berlin. It was 
probably impudent to ask the Second World War to serve as the backdrop for a 
big-time, last-chance exchange with my father, but that is what I decided to 
do. We would retrace his wartime route, and at some point he would begin 
speaking and I would finally know my father. I gathered my courage and phoned 
Wisconsin: Could we meet for tea at the Connaught in London and take it from 
there? I knew he'd say yes. And not much more. 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS RAINING IN LONDON, A GENTLE SPRING SHOWER THAT KNOCKS THE apple blossoms 
off dripping black boughs. We have loaded the baby stroller into the back of a 
boxy taxi and are rolling through the streets of Belgravia to a place called 
Norfolk House. I had not yet found a good baby-sitter in Berlin, so I brought 
my 10-month-old daughter along. My 2-year-old son stayed behind with his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 My father is indeed happy to have an excuse to return to Europe. And he has 
come for our recherche equipped with two copies of an essay on his 
wartime-London experience, something he'd written in response to an American 
historian's call for reminiscences. I had known nothing about this exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 From the manuscript I learn much about my father. By the time he was a 
sophomore at the University of Wisconsin, the Nazi writ extended in Europe from 
Norway to Crete, from the outskirts of Leningrad to the boot of Italy. He was 
ready to enlist in the army air corps, until he learned he was colorblind. He 
tried the Marines but was sent away as underweight. So he joined the Army, 
figuring he would be commissioned. The Army had other ideas. It made my father 
a rifleman and after much to-ing and fro-ing on trains and trucks, he found 
himself in Halifax's harbor aboard the Mauritania, a British Merchant Marine 
vessel, which duly weighed anchor for England. In Liverpool, he learned that he 
was being sent to London to work for something called COSSAC. 
</P>
<P>
 More trucks, more trains and, finally, there is my father, all of 21, in an 
office just off Piccadilly Circus, now the keeper of the keys to a filing 
cabinet that, he is told, houses the master plans for the invasion of France. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of nowhere, certainly without having asked for it, he has a secret 
clearance. It will be his job to copy the Normandy plans as needed and to sleep 
on a cot next to the files, a carbine beside him, ready to defend the contents 
against any intruder. The code-name COSSAC would soon change to Supreme 
Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. SHAEF was doing business, for the time 
being, out of Norfolk House. 
</P>
<P>
 Very big-deal stuff for a Wisconsin game warden's son who'd seen little of the 
world. And what's this about the Marines? I came of age at a time when the 
blood-and-guts Marines were having a nasty go of it in Vietnam, and the news of 
my father's attempt to go the "Full Metal Jacket" route makes no sense, given 
his demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the Marines had the reputation of an elite fighting group," he says. "I 
thought if I was going to be a fighting man, I might as well live up to my 
potential."  
</P>
<P>
 A fighting man, my quiet father. Wasn't he racked with fear and, um, loathing 
as he boarded the Mauritania? Again, Vietnam drove my thinking; I cannot redo 
his climb up the gangplank without great shuddering. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. I was glad I was healthy and able to do something. I don't think 
anybody had any idea of what combat was really going to be like." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they never do!" offers my mother. "I think that's why we keep having so 
many wars. One generation can't pass its experience with war on to the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. As we roll through the streets of Belgravia, my father calls out the 
names of churches, art galleries and office blocks, telling which ones had been 
hit by the Germans, finding the place where he had picked up the bomb fin he'd 
later bring home for a souvenir. He remembers that the Tube stations would fill 
up at night with Londoners too frightened of the Luftwaffe to sleep in their 
own beds. And that homeowners spaded up their front yards and planted 
wall-to-wall Brussels sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 I crane this way and that, trying to take hold of what he must have felt as a 
youngster. But to me, Belgravia is little more than a tony district in 
post-Thatcher London. No craters, no scorched facades, no Brussels sprouts.  
</P>
<P>
 But then, maybe my mother has it right: One generation can't pass on its 
experiences to the next, at least not in a simple morning's cab ride through 
the rain. I think of my husband, a former Marine turned cameraman in Vietnam. 
During the 1980s, he taught at Duke University and found that none of his 
smart, young-and-happening students had ever heard of the Tet Offensive, much 
less Khe Sanh, Ia Drang Valley, Hill 943. This was a glum business for him, and 
now I wonder if my father feels the same way, having flown through seven time 
zones at my urging, to tell me how life went with him long ago, and probably 
suspecting that I couldn't wrap my brains around much of it. 
</P>
<P>
 His children came of age in a time of popular skepticism -- what could they 
understand of a man for whom the war years were the richest of his life? 
Perhaps my father had remained silent out of self-imposed courtesy; no one 
seemed interested anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 We climb out of our taxi at St. James Square, across from a building enveloped 
in scaffolding. Sing to me, oh Norfolk House, oh SHAEF, oh Ike, oh Dad. We pass 
under the scaffolding and walk through the doors to encounter an imposing 
security station in the lobby. My father flashes an ID card from 1944 and says 
his office used to be on the third floor, but the otherwise friendly guard is 
unimpressed.  
</P>
<P>
 The building was remodeled at the beginning of the 1980s, he says. The owners 
offered the original fittings -- desks, chairs, sconces -- to the American 
Embassy, but there were no takers. Now the London branch of AT&T is precisely 
where PFC Williams cranked out copies of the Normandy invasion plan. "People 
don't know what an important place this was," the guard concedes. "They think 
it (D-Day) was all planned in pubs and clubs and places like that." We are free 
to go up for a peek, he says, but my father sees no point. 
</P>
<P>
 "WHAT WAS BUSHEY PARK?" MY MOTHER ASKS. "IS IT A VILLAGE?" 
</P>
<P>
 We are sitting motionless on an elevated stretch of the Tube line that goes to 
the suburb of Richmond, becalmed by a massive power failure. We are trying to 
get to a onetime encampment outside London, a place with a Beatrix Potterish 
name, where my father was stationed just before D-Day. SHAEF moved there as the 
bombing of central London intensified. In his essay, my father reports that 
SHAEF had gotten a captured German map, with a menacing X over Norfolk House. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," says my father. "It's just a big park. You'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you live in tents?" my mother asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, wooden huts." 
</P>
<P>
 End of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 I am impatient with the delay and with my situation: My aging parents have 
schlepped their suitcases in and out of taxis and across terminals, and here we 
are in London, with the same old "Could be" and "We'll see." Must life with my 
father always be a game of 20 Questions? If it's this much work to find out 
that he lived in wooden huts, how will we ever be able to talk about the 
personal, about feelings ? 
</P>
<P>
 But of course I don't say this. Instead I ask about buzz-bombs, which I had 
heard my father mention. Here is what I learn: They were something the Germans 
dreamed up in 1943. Crude precursors of the cruise missile, they were powered 
by gas motors. The motors were supposed to cut out over London and the bombs 
would dive. But, my father says, they sometimes didn't dive -- they kept 
gliding along to come down somewhere else.  
</P>
<P>
 "Once I heard one cut out overhead while I was standing about as far away from 
a shelter as that roof over there," he says, pointing at a garden shed. "I dove 
into the shelter just when it exploded. It made an impressive bang." 
</P>
<P>
 All right! Now we're clicking. I fix on the shed. It looks unnervingly far 
off, even for a 21-year-old who ran the half-mile in high school. And as I 
stare at it, I remember an afternoon of my own five years back, when I traveled 
closer than sound judgment really dictated to Jalalabad, a besieged provincial 
capital in Afghanistan. I heard a MiG coming in for a run and dove for a ditch. 
My escort estimated that the bomb hit 150 yards away. It made an impressive 
bang. Yes, yes.  
</P>
<P>
 The Underground jerks to life. Our plan is to meet an old friend of my father, 
Susan Hibbard, at the Richmond Tube station and continue by car to Bushey Park. 
She was the secretary to the British head of planning and operations for SHAEF, 
and her job was to type the plans for the invasion that my father then 
duplicated, filed and guarded with the carbine. On the last day of the war in 
Europe, she typed the Allied-drafted instrument of surrender, signed at Rheims. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Hibbard is a charmingly turned out woman with high English coloring and a 
rise of white hair, who apologizes that she has been stuck in traffic. Bushey 
Park turns out to be an endless expanse of grass planted with rows of trees -- 
horse chestnuts, my father notes -- and a pond with a statue in the middle and 
a herd of tamed deer. My father leads us over to where he thinks the enlisted 
huts once stood. We find a small monument, but the inscription commemorates the 
army air corps, not SHAEF. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mrs. Hibbard has brought an envelope stuffed with the past, hang the 
monument makers -- a SHAEF insignia from her uniform, newspaper clippings, 
pictures of my father in uniform. I stare at the pictures while they laugh 
about the good gone days. Mrs. Hibbard mentions that one evening, a few days 
into the Normandy campaign, her boss announced that the evening's dictation 
would be of plans for a British retreat. She must have looked horrified, she 
says, because he told her, "Don't worry, we have to have a plan for 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 17 years old and I was in the middle of everything," she laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 I try to remember what I was doing at that age, but immediately think better 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 ABOARD THE P&O FERRY, plying the Channel to Le Havre on our way to Normandy, 
we encounter head-winds and rough seas; the trip takes 7 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the weather gives us a feeling for the misery of the invaders, making 
their way across on the hellish evening of June 5. The ferry's evocative 
pitching makes my father talk about the hallowed beaches. Many of the Allied 
soldiers who spent the night crossing the Channel were wrung out by the time 
they made their horrific wadings onto shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad we don't have to rappel up a cliff under machine-gun fire at the end 
of this trip," he offers. I smooth my daughter's hair and try to picture my 
father making the famous assault at Pointe du Hoc -- a 100-foot cliff, three 
companies from the 2nd Ranger Battalion scaling a sheer wall of rock to an 
incantation of German bullets -- but find this difficult to do, since if he 
had, I probably wouldn't be here. There were 225 Americans at Pointe du Hoc 
that morning; only 90 were alive at day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother does her needlepoint and dozes, the baby wants to crawl and doesn't 
understand why she isn't permitted to. My father continues to talk quietly. He 
doesn't know, he says, why he was plucked out of the infantry and assigned to 
the safety of a copying machine. He does know, however, why he didn't reach 
Normandy by parachute. When he first arrived in England, recruiters from the 
101st Airborne came and made a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 My father was tempted, but something stopped him, something his own father had 
passed along to his only son. A Wisconsin doughboy, my grandfather saw his 
share of trench life in France 25 years before. Some of his friends volunteered 
for a tank unit. Tanks were new on the armaments scene and wretchedly designed 
for human cargo. Most of my grandfather's more adventurous friends were either 
killed or maimed. My grandfather advised his son to stay clear of the 
razzmatazz units until all the bugs had been worked out.  
</P>
<P>
 I think about how my grandfather's war stories literally saved my father's 
life. I have no warrant at all to think that my little son, now all flaxen hair 
and cornflower eyes, will never be hustled aboard a Mauritania of his own. And 
I have no reason to think he'll luck out like my father, and get tagged for a 
job in which you come in for a bit of low cost glory and have an 
almost-splendid time of it. Perhaps somewhere in the flat delivery that is my 
father's storytelling style, there is a fateful phrase or sentence that will 
protect my son. I try to listen more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROPRIETRESS IN A SMALL restaurant in Paris, on the Boulevard 
Montparnasse, is so eager for warm, paying bodies that she opens early at the 
sight of us. My father, who doesn't speak French, is eager for me to tell her 
that he made it to Paris during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 This has happened time after time over the course of our travels. My father 
spots someone who looks as if he or she might be old enough to remember -- or 
even some who don't -- and makes me tell them who he is and that he was there 
in liberated Paris. Sometimes he pulls from his wallet a 50-year-old two-franc 
note -- "occupation money," he calls it -- and shows it off. 
</P>
<P>
 " Soldat! " exclaims the owner after suffering through my recitation in 
cast-iron French. She holds up her arms as if gripping an assault rifle and 
sprays the room with imaginary bullets. Then she asks to hold the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 In stores, on the street, on the train to Versailles, I see him reaching for 
his wallet with that worn two-franc note. And usually there is a disappointing, 
blank-faced reaction. I feel badly for him each time and wish I could 
understand why he keeps wanting to try. 
</P>
<P>
 But one day, success! We stop at a Paris grocery store for fruit. My father 
and I go into our usual routine with the elderly cashier and the bored, 
teen-age help. My father produces the occupation money. There is moment of 
incomprehension, and then the woman breaks into a smile.  
</P>
<P>
 " Il etait un des anciens soldats ," she tells the kid, "He's one of the 
former soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 My mother whoops, thinking the woman has called my father an "ancient 
soldier." But the teen-ager understands and actually seems impressed, 
interested in studying the worn bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good job!" says the old woman, and the teen-ager gives a thumbs-up. 
</P>
<P>
 I AM NOT THE ONLY DAUGHTER trying to find my father in the commemoration of a 
war. A new German friend, an East Berliner, is the daughter of a Luftwaffe 
veteran who flew bombing missions over London when my father was on the ground 
with his file cabinets. After the war, Petra says, her father was so sickened 
with everything having to do with the Third Reich that he joined the Communist 
Party and became a minor functionary of the German Democratic Republic. When 
the East German regime collapsed, Herr Falkenberg slipped into a severe 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Petra hoped to bring her father around by taking him and her mother on a trip 
to London. She picked London without thinking of his Luftwaffe service, and was 
alarmed to see him spend an afternoon staring at the Thames from Westminster 
Bridge, brooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Herr Falkenberg, like my father, is 72 years old. Like my father, he has lived 
a life of quiet office work since the war, pushing paper for Karl Marx instead 
of Adam Smith. Like my father, he has delegated most family matters to a 
bustling, sturdy wife. Like my father, he has never met a combatant from the 
other side. Petra and I arrange a lunch in Potsdam. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what to expect. But it couldn't be easier, it seems, for these 
two to be chummy across a restaurant table. Herr Falkenberg instantly 
recognizes my father's two-franc note. "Occupation money!" His eyes are on the 
sad side, and yet he laughs, delightedly, at my father's accounts of Army 
screw-ups.  
</P>
<P>
 After all these years, my father gets the chance to ask a German about that 
map of London with the big unfriendly X. Did the Luftwaffe know where 
Eisenhower's office was? 
</P>
<P>
 There was no particular strategic plan, says Herr Falkenberg, sad again. He 
and his crew just flew up the Thames estuary and launched the rockets whenever 
they could and got out as expeditiously as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started out, there were 15 crews," he says. "At the end, only two had 
survived." A bit of fellow feeling for the men who bombed London? How very odd. 
Yet here in this attractive Potsdam restaurant, a little beer, wine and much 
translated goodwill carry the day. My father becomes expansive -- more so with 
this former enemy then he has been with me, but what the hell. The baby is 
passed from lap to lap. Photographs are exchanged. Herr Falkenberg has brought 
along a tattered we-regret-to-inform-you letter sent in error to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us are very lucky to have survived," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The old gents make affecting toasts. The daughters trade winks. Children of 
loving but remote fathers, each has sought some sort of -- well, what? Let's 
say it's a smoothing out of certain family things. In bringing off this 
handsome little scene, each of us hopes to take home something for ourselves 
about our fathers, about life. 
</P>
<P>
 And what do we have? At least a mild sense of completion for me. There has 
been a seemliness to this meeting, this breaking of bread with a former enemy. 
Something has fallen into place. 
</P>
<P>
 But damn it all, there's some secret handshaking going on between these lodge 
brothers of history, a code Petra and I can't crack. The daughters are 
outflanked. 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS LATE AFTERNOON AND my father, my husband, my son and I are climbing the 
"hill" behind the Charlottenburg flat we have sublet. It is a strange hill, 
this one, rising abruptly out of the east German plain. It is in fact a 
Trummerberg , a "rubble mountain." After the war, where to put all the 
bomb-blasted bits of urban Germany? Most large cities targeted by the Allied 
air command have been left with these burial mounds. Birch groves cover the 
slopes of this one; hobbyists fly stunt kites on the top and there's a ski run 
down the western side. 
</P>
<P>
 My son chirps and runs on ahead. He wants to climb the steepest parts, and he 
wants grandpa to come with him. This talkative little boy has attached himself 
to his quiet grandfather. He isn't put off by four-word answers to questions of 
exceptional scope and cunning. He is excited to think that grandpa was in the 
war -- whatever it is a 2-year-old conceives war to be -- and runs on with 
toddler-chat. Airplanes! Helmets! Guns! 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, grandpa was a soldier," I tell him. "But grandpa was a lucky soldier. He 
didn't have to fire his gun." 
</P>
<P>
 And how lucky, indeed, my father was. He has been allowed the happy 
satisfaction that, in his own small way, he helped rid Europe of German 
fascism. Maybe things took on a dull cast after the return to Wisconsin -- the 
teeth-gritting work at the insurance company, the small-town upbringing of four 
children. But that was all right. He's had a good time of it, he says, planted 
80,000 trees by hand -- each of his grandchildren has been treated to a grove. 
Yes, a good time of it -- that's the plain English of my father's story, and it 
is left to me to say so. For his part, I think, he has always understood that 
to run on about such good luck was sort of rude, like eating peas off a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 So: I "talked" to my father. What have I learned? Something I should have 
known all along: Life doesn't work out like Italian opera. No outpourings, no 
neat conjunctions in the final act. Still, my father's glad he made the trip. 
He says they'll be back in the fall, when it's too cold in Wisconsin to do much 
with the trees. Next time, he asks, how about dinner with that nice Luftwaffe 
fellow?

SPEED DEMON; NEXT WEEK AT THE INDY 500, ROBBY GORDON WILL BE RACING AGAINST THE 
BEST IN THE WORLD -- AND HIS OWN REPUTATION FOR DANGEROUS DRIVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 SCREAMING DOWN SHORELINE DRIVE IN HIS REGAL BLUE VALVOLINE LOLA-FORD race car 
at three times the national speed limit, Robby Gordon all but pounds on the 
steering wheel in frustration. Italian driver Teo Fabi, in the bright yellow 
Pennzoil-sponsored car, is blocking his path. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach just laps from the finish, Gordon is 
sitting safely in third place, but every nerve ending in his body is telling 
him he can catch the leaders, Al Unser Jr. and Nigel Mansell, who are within 
sight, just beyond Fabi. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon knows he should be able to leapfrog a back-marker like Fabi. After all, 
he qualified seven places ahead of the Italian, who is now a lap behind. The 
problem is, Gordon's car is seriously down on power, so instead of being able 
to pass Fabi easily on the straightaway, he'll have to try to take him on the 
twisty back side of the Long Beach course. In the dangerous curves, driving 
skill can compensate for lack of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take it easy," comes the radioed order from Valvoline team owner and manager 
Derrick Walker as Gordon flashes by the pits. "Pace it." 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, Robby Gordon might have ignored such advice and followed 
his instincts, risking everything trying to pass in the curves. In 1993, his 
first full year in Indy car racing, a similar maneuver here at Long Beach 
landed him on the sidelines, disqualified for deliberately crashing into 
another car after they came together on the same curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Which set the tone for Gordon's season. That DQ for rough driving -- virtually 
unheard of in a sport where rubbed wheels and swapped paint are everyday 
occurrences -- combined with nine accidents in his first six races. By 
midseason the rookie had gone from "Flash" Gordon, the fair-haired boy of Indy 
car racing, to "Crash" Gordon. No one doubted he was fast, the question was, 
could he ever learn to control it?  
</P>
<P>
 What a difference a year makes. With 85,000 fans lining Shoreline Drive, 
straining against the catch fences, waiting for the pass, Gordon makes a non 
-move. In front of him, it's clear that Fabi is in his own battle with another 
driver and could easily miss seeing Gordon's go-around attempt. It isn't hard 
to imagine a crackup -- Fabi punting Gordon into the course-side tire barriers 
or another car -- and Robby Gordon risking life and limb while blowing another 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 So Gordon swallows his frustration. When he hears Walker's gravelly, 
Scots-accented voice say "pace it" over the two-way radio, he does just that, 
reining himself in and holding on for a respectable finish. In the pits, 
Walker's stiff jaw relaxes into a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 GRAND PRIX SUNDAY DAWNED CHILLY AND OVERCAST IN LONG BEACH, but by the time 
Gordon jumped up on the three-tiered podium last month to accept his 
third-place award, the marine layer had rolled back to reveal resplendent 
late-afternoon sun. With the winner, Unser, and second-place finisher Mansell, 
Gordon accepted the accolades of the crowd and spent nearly a quarter of an 
hour taking off and putting on sponsor hats for photographers from around the 
world. It was his first podium finish of the year, and it was doubly sweet: As 
an Orange County kid, not only was it nice to finish well before the hometown 
crowd, but it helped to make up for last year's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the worst loser of them all," Gordon readily admits the next day, at his 
race shop in an Anaheim industrial park, close to Disneyland and the Big A. 
"You show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, at the age of 25, he says he understands that there's losing and 
there's losing. His day in Long Beach began with the discovery that his car was 
running slow (a valve problem it turned out). So from the start, he and Walker 
were determined to pace the race, counting on the action coming back to Gordon 
as the faster runners burned themselves out over the course of the 166-mile 
event. Even though he was tempted to change that game plan, Gordon opted to win 
by losing: "I wanted to pass Fabi," he says, complaining that Walker had him 
driving at 75% capacity by the end, "but it would have meant a chance at 
missing the podium finish, so I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon has hoisted himself up onto a counter in the immaculate shop. Across 
from him, a team of mechanics is working on a gleaming desert-racing truck that 
he will be driving this year when he isn't taking care of his Indy car duties. 
Sandy-haired and movie-star handsome, Gordon smiles a lot. For all his 
brashness, he's almost shy, and when it comes to talking about his 1993 season, 
he puts on a sheepish look. He knows that he has to live down a rambunctious 
reputation. "You can't finish first if you don't first finish" goes an old 
racing saw. Gordon laughs: "I've heard it a thousand times over the last year." 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, disappointment over Gordon's results last year can be traced in 
part to impossible expectations and an overload of pressure. The hype 
surrounding him has been intense, and more than slightly jingoistic. The idea 
is that Gordon, who has been a dominant force in off-road racing since his 
debut at age 16, will reinvigorate U.S. hopes on the Indy car circuit, a 
16-stop series that includes the Indy 500 and the race in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Indy cars -- 900-horsepower, lightweight, open-wheel racers -- have long 
symbolized U.S. industrial know-how. And the Indianapolis 500, the cars' 
signature race, remains the world's single most-watched automotive event; it is 
the fastest (speeds average more than 220 m.p.h.) and most prestigious car race 
in the world. But Indy cars and even the 500 have taken on an international 
flavor. Next week, for example, Ford will be the only U.S. automobile 
manufacturer competing at Indianapolis, and it is facing incipient challenges 
from Mercedes, which is returning to Indy competition for the first time since 
1915, as well as Honda and Toyota. Foreign sponsors and drivers will abound. At 
Long Beach this year, the warm-up event for the 500, 12 of the first 16 drivers 
were born outside the United States; Gordon alone represented new American 
talent near the head of the field (the other top Americans, Unser Jr. and 
Michael Andretti are veterans). 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon wasn't shy about playing to his image as the great American hope. 
Before he had ever won an Indy car race, he named himself among the top five 
drivers on the circuit. And early in 1993, it seemed as though he might 
actually live up to that assessment. The year before, his best finishes had 
been twin eighths, in Toronto and Cleveland. Over the winter, Gordon signed on 
with the racing team led by legendary four-time 500 winner A.J. Foyt. In the 
1993 Indy car opener, the Surfer's Paradise Grand Prix in Australia, he placed 
third behind two former world champions, Mansell and Emerson Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Gordon says he was simply following Foyt's orders when he drew the 
disqualification for running Eddie Cheever off the track. Cheever had cut off 
Gordon at the sharp turn from Shoreline, knocking him out of contention for a 
podium finish. Foyt, considered to be the most pugnacious driver of the modern 
Indy era, apparently told Gordon at a pit stop to deliver a pay-back and, 
according to Gordon, who never denied that the move was intentional, he 
performed as instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The events at Long Beach might have been forgotten, if it hadn't been for what 
happened next in Indianapolis. During the weeks of training and hype that 
traditionally precede the 500, Gordon was at best inconsistent. He posted the 
seventh-fastest time around the oval, but he also cracked up several of his 
cars. In a very public dressing down, Foyt, who was driving in the race as well 
as running his team, ordered him off the track for a three-day cooling-off 
period. (When it was pointed out to Foyt that Gordon's style perfectly matched 
his own, Foyt was heard to mumble that it was OK for him to crack up 
half-million-dollar cars; after all, he owned them.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon started 25th at Indianapolis and finished 27th. And his next few races 
were again marred by crashes. He finished out the season quietly, making only 
about $800,000 -- big-money winners in Indy car racing make upward of $3 
million -- and it was clear that Foyt was not going to renew his contract. By 
then, Gordon's Darth Vader-like image was as well cemented as his potential. An 
ad appeared showing the other rising star of Indy car racing, Canadian Paul 
Tracy, in his white Penske car with Gordon's menacing black Ford bearing down 
on him. The copy line read: "Never has the future of Indy car racing been so 
black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon insists that despite the DQ, the crashes and Foyt's displeasure, the 
bad-boy image was simple misapprehension. The criticism "won't change my 
style," he says, "but it will teach me to be a little more cautious, to pay 
more attention to the big picture" -- winning the Indy car championship and, 
eventually, the Indy 500 itself. "Last year, I got a reputation for crashing," 
he says ruefully. "I got this reputation from people who don't know me at all." 
</P>
<P>
 AS HIS MOM, MARLENE, REMEMBERS IT, GORDON COULDN'T WAIT TO GO fast, even as a 
kid. "At Christmas, 1970, when he was 11 months old, we got him a little 
electric car to ride on," she says, standing outside her Robby Gordon 
paraphernalia trailer at the Long Beach race. "The problem was that his foot 
couldn't reach the pedal. We had to tape the gas pedal down before he was 
happy." By his second birthday, Robby desperately wanted a kid-sized electric 
motorbike -- which his parents refused until he came up with a compromise: He 
would stop sucking his thumb if he got one. Laughs Marlene: "Of course, he went 
back to sucking his thumb the minute he got the motorcycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter the Gordons, who then lived in Lakewood, got a call from 
the police -- their son had been terrorizing a neighbor's petunias. "I would 
ride up and down the streets, on the sidewalks, everywhere," Gordon told a 
reporter in 1989. "The police took me to the station and wouldn't let me go 
until my dad came and signed for me." By age 8, Gordon, whose father is 
prominent Southern California off-road racer Bob Gordon, was racing motorcyles 
competitively; by 10, gasoline-powered minibikes. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a case of ego-driven parents pushing a child into something he 
wasn't ready for. While the entire family is almost impossibly white bread -- 
these are the people East Coasters hate us for, the perfect postwar suburban 
family, the father with the granite-chinned face, the mother with the grace of 
Donna Reed -- neither parent wanted him to follow in his father's footsteps. Or 
his great-grandfather's, for that matter -- Robby's father's grandfather once 
held the San Francisco-to-L.A. racing record. His father tried to interest 
Robby in sports like baseball (a world champion Connie Mack-league pitcher, Bob 
Gordon was a Little League coach) or football (Robby, built with a defensive 
back's powerful shoulders and thin hips, played one season at Orange's El 
Modena High) -- while his mother pressed academics ("His main interest seems to 
be racing cars," his first-grade teacher wrote on his report card). 
</P>
<P>
 Robby even managed to turn the family business to an advantage -- Bob runs a 
thoroughbred feed business, supplying Southern California race tracks from 
Santa Anita to Del Mar. While the business is based in Los Alamitos, the feed 
itself is grown several hours away near the Mexican border in the Imperial 
Valley. There Robby would go every season to help with the hay harvest. And 
while the desert sun made it too hot to bale during the day, Robby would work 
all night with the laborers in the fields and ride his dirt bike all day. It 
paid off when, at age 13, he finished second at the world minibike grand prix 
in Ponca City, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after Robby broke too many bones on his motorcycle, his dad gave up 
and let him drive a race car -- a dune buggy. At 16, an age when most 
teen-agers are worried about passing their road test, Robby Gordon won the 
first race he entered, the Nevada 500, against competitors more than twice his 
age. In an off-road truck less than two weeks later, he won his second, a 
Mickey Thompson stadium race, named after the late Southern California Indy car 
racer and world land-speed record holder who first put off-road truck racing 
into stadiums like Anaheim, the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 By 19, Robby had been discovered, first by Toyota, which hired him to drive 
its stadium-racing trucks, and then by Ford for its desert-racing division. 
Along the way, he managed to rewrite some rules -- that season, the Toyota team 
won seven of eight races and "they couldn't come up with any way to keep us 
from winning," he says today. "They did everything they could, including 
changing the rules halfway through the season." Among the new rules: An 
inverted starting order, meaning the fastest qualifiers had to start in the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning of Gordon's reputation for dirty driving -- with only 
12 laps in the short stadium heats, he had no choice but to push his way to the 
front as fast as he could, even if it meant elbowing more experienced drivers 
out of the way. As Walker Evans, the dean of off-road racing, told The Times in 
1989: "He's leaned on a lot of guys and that doesn't sit too well with his 
competitors." On the other hand, he admitted, "he's talented and knows how to 
get to the front. You can't take that away from him." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of observers who have looked at Gordon's fast rise in truck racing -- 
and beyond -- called him lucky. With his family background, they say, he had it 
easy. Gordon doesn't agree -- his father made him earn every penny he spent on 
his racing cars and he passed up a normal teen-age lifestyle to pursue his 
racing career. "I must have missed out on a bunch of good parties," he says, 
laughing. "While my friends were out screwing around, we were either at a race, 
going to a race or coming from a race." 
</P>
<P>
 After he graduated from high school, Ford invited him to test its new racing 
sports car with an eye toward having him join its 1990 endurance racing team. 
Of the eight or nine drivers tried out, he was the only one with no pavement 
racing experience. Yet he was by far the fastest of them. Not only did Ford 
sign him up for its endurance races -- Gordon has since won four Daytona 
24-hour races in a row -- but Roush Racing, Ford's International Motor Sports 
Assn. team, signed him to drive its sports cars for the entire road-racing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 By far his most impressive performance that year was an amazing same-day 
victory in the off-road Baja 1000 and the IMSA finale at Del Mar. Under 
contract with Ford for desert racing, Gordon felt obligated to compete in both 
races. Fortunately for Gordon, the desert race started the day before the IMSA. 
After driving 17 hours to win the Baja 1000, at 6 Saturday morning, he drove 80 
miles from race headquarters in Ensenada back to the border, arriving in Del 
Mar about 9:30 a.m. He drove a 15-minute warm-up, took a nap and woke just 
before the race. He started in the sixth position, and 46 laps later he had 
beaten the sports car-series champion Pete Halmser. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after yet another win at Del Mar the next year, as well as additional 
IMSA victories, that he finally attracted attention from the big boys of car 
racing. Chip Ganassi, a team owner whose drivers have been top racers for 
years, invited him onto his team in 1992, and Gordon became one of the few 
young racers to successfully negotiate the distance from motocross to desert 
truck events to sports cars on pavement to automobile racing's big time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Robby Gordon the secret of his success and he'll tell you it's simple 
competitiveness -- he hates to lose and seldom has. His live-in girlfriend, 
Inge Stikbakke, a former Norwegian beauty queen who met Gordon when she handed 
him his trophy at Del Mar in 1992, calls that quite the understatement. On the 
way home from the race shop in Anaheim, she says, Gordon used to stop at a 
nearby video arcade. He had run into an elderly gentleman there and 
consistently lost to him in a video racing game. "Robby could not beat the guy 
and it ticked him off," Stikbakke says. He started getting home later and 
later, putting in practice time perfecting his moves. Finally, after days of 
pumping quarter after quarter into the video machines, Gordon whipped the old 
gent, and the real-time racer emerged victorious in cyberspace, too. 
</P>
<P>
 PHOENIX INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY LIES HARD AGAINST THE LOW SCRUB mountains that 
surround the city. Just outside the racetrack gates is the Fleming Thoroughbred 
Farm, home to more than 100 horses. Most days, the farm's co-owner, Marv 
Fleming, can hear the sound of the turbocharged Indy car engines bouncing off 
the mountains as he takes his horses on lap after workout lap. "Horse racing is 
all mental," says Fleming. "There are horses that just want to burst out of the 
gate and run as fast as they can, but they're done in half a mile. You've got 
to 'rate' them, teach them to go for the win." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the raceway gates, Derrick Walker is proving that horse racing and car 
racing have much in common. It is early April, just weeks before the 1994 Long 
Beach Grand Prix, and Walker is "rating" Gordon. Walker, 49, started in racing 
as a mechanic, graduated to leading teams for Roger Penske, champion driver 
turned millionaire racing sponsor, and then in 1991, went out on his own as a 
team owner and manager. In his time, Walker has helped bring along such Indy 
champions as Rick Mears (another driver who came up from Southern California 
desert racing), Teo Fabi and Danny Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gordon in particular, it's been a long learning process. "It's a big jump 
from off-road racing or sports cars up to Indy cars," says Walker. Gordon 
himself offers up a Zen-like definition of Walker's tutelage: "I've always been 
fast," he says proudly. "Now I'm learning how to go fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Some might say that it was once again a matter of luck that got Gordon back in 
an Indy car with a mentor like Derrick Walker. After 1993, it was clear that 
Gordon's one-year contract with Foyt's team would not be renewed. But then Al 
Unser Jr., who had raced for years under a Valvoline sponsorship, got another 
offer and left his contract behind. Valvoline, a subsidiary of Ashland Oil that 
pours up to $10 million a year into Indy racing, began to look for a successor. 
Its search came down to two drivers -- rookie Gordon and Canadian Scott 
Goodyear. Goodyear had it all over Gordon in terms of experience, but, says 
Valvoline spokesman Mark Coughlin, it didn't hurt "that Gordon was an 
American." When Valvoline signed with Gordon, Gordon -- and his Valvoline money 
-- signed with Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Gordon had gotten in about a half-day's practice before the Phoenix 
race. This year, Walker has him running flat out around the track for four full 
days, experimenting with suspension settings and getting that all-important 
"seat time" that drivers talk about. Standing behind the pit wall as his young 
charge cracks out 190 m.p.h. laps, Walker says Gordon must forget about the 
naysayers and the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he can harness his natural capabilities," Walker says, "he's going to be 
one of the great drivers of Indy car racing. But it's not automatic. He's going 
to have to work for it. As an Indy car driver, he's just at Day One; he's got a 
lot of racing to do. The real question for Robby Gordon is not how great he 
will be, but how he controls his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning to win at this level is what Robby's got to do -- that's the 
difference between a fast driver and a great driver," says Walker. "What we're 
looking for now is consistency." 
</P>
<P>
 WITH THE INDIANAPOLIS 500 just a week away, both Walker and Gordon are feeling 
positive. In Australia in March, Gordon was running third until mechanical 
problems caused him to spin out and knocked him out of the competition. At 
Phoenix, the second race in the 1994 lineup and the short-term focus of all 
those practice laps, Gordon was in the lead before an error by his refueling 
team cost him seven positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the podium finish in Long Beach came as a kind of graduation ceremony. As 
the announcer said before handing Gordon his trophy, "It's a ways from desert 
trucks to Indy cars, but this guy has made the quantum leap." 
</P>
<P>
 Robby Gordon's biggest test will come next weekend at Indianapolis, when he 
finds out if he can maintain his momentum against the world's finest. Taking 
the microphone at Long Beach, Gordon displayed the new-found maturity his fans 
might see again at the 500: "We played it cautious today. We're looking forward 
to going to Indianapolis." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect him to play it too cautious there. "I've been a winner at 
everything I've tried," he says. "If I can't win at Indy cars, I'll have to 
find something else to do."

HOT PROPERTY: MOVING, BUT NOT BURNING BRIDGES 
</P>

<P>
 JEFF BRIDGES, who just started work as the legendary Wild Bill Hickok in the 
Western-adventure film "Wild Bill," has put his Santa Monica home of 13 years 
on the market at $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not planning to move out of Southern California. He just wants to move 
farther out (of the L.A. area)," said Susan Stark, who shares the listing with 
Birgitte Michaelsen, both with Coldwell Banker, Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges, who plays an Irish-born leader of the Boston police bomb squad in the 
upcoming action film "Blown Away," starred in the 1993 movie "Fearless" as an 
architect who survives a plane crash and leads a group of fellow passengers to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 When not at his Montana ranch or on location, the three-time Oscar nominee 
lives in his Santa Monica home with his photographer wife, Susan, and their 
three young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which is gated and hidden behind tall hedges but has ocean and 
canyon views, was built in the 1920s and has four bedroom suites, each with a 
balcony; a solarium, butler's pantry, office, gym, guest house and black-bottom 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly 7,000-square-foot residence also has a ballroom that has been 
turned into a screening or music room. An accomplished amateur pianist, Bridges 
played his own keyboard scenes in "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989). He is also 
a painter, who had several of his works in "Fearless," and a photographer, who 
had an exhibit in Santa Monica last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges, 44, was raised on the Westside with his older brother, actor Beau, 
and younger sister, actress Lucinda. Their parents, veteran actor Lloyd Bridges 
and former actress Dorothy Simpson, still live near the UCLA sorority house 
where they met. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has been described as "an unusually tight clan that functions . . . 
in the tradition of other great theatrical families, co-starring with each 
other. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff and Lloyd Bridges co-star with Tommy Lee Jones in "Blown Away," due to be 
released July 1, and Beau and Lloyd Bridges appear in the TV series "Harts of 
the West." Jeff and Beau Bridges also co-starred, with Michelle Pfeiffer, in 
"The Fabulous Baker Boys." 
</P>
<P>
 The Benedict Canyon home where actress SHARON TATE and four others were 
murdered by Charles Manson's gang in 1968 has been torn down. In its place, a 
17,000-square-foot Mediterranean villa is being built, with completion expected 
in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Weintraub, who has owned the property since 1991, said, "We'll try to sell 
it, and if we don't sell it, I'll move into it." The new home is for sale at 
$12.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the home in which the murders occurred was for sale at $4.95 
million. Last year, it was rented by musician Trent Reznor, the mastermind 
behind Nine Inch Nails. Reznor set up a studio in the house to record an album 
for the synthesized-rock group.  
</P>
<P>
 The new home will have city-to-ocean views, a sunken north/south tennis court 
and an infinity pool on its 3.3-acre grounds. Jerry Sax and John Aaroe of John 
Aaroe & Associates, Beverly Hills, share the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bel-Air home that Joan Rivers sold nearly five years ago for $5.2 million 
after she moved to New York has just been sold again, this time for about $2.5 
million, according to public records. The last official asking price was just 
under $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer/department-store heir TED FIELD, who had purchased the home from 
Rivers so that one of his former wives could live in it, sold the home, because 
the ex-wife has remarried and relocated, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer was described as "an overseas businessman" who was living in a condo 
on Wilshire Boulevard but wanted a house where he could live with his wife and 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the 1930s by architect Paul Williams and renovated in 1986 by Rivers 
and her husband, the gated, two-story Colonial has six bedrooms in about 7,500 
square feet. It's on an acre with a rose garden, adjoining the Bel-Air Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivers and her husband, Edgar Rosenberg, purchased the house in 1981. He died 
in 1987. She bought a flat on New York's Fifth Avenue in 1988 and sold the 
Bel-Air house in August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer was represented by Minoo Borookhim, Myra Nourmand and Kurt 
Rappaport, all of Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 CARYL KRISTENSEN, who co-stars with Marilyn Kentz on the NBC Saturday night 
comedy show "The Mommies," and her husband, Len, have purchased a four-bedroom 
second home in Tarzana for about $500,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's primary residence is in Petaluma, where "The Mommies" stars, who 
were neighbors, parlayed their stand-up comedy act about car-pooling and 
morning sickness into the TV show. (They also just signed to do a yearlong, 
$20-million ad campaign for a dishwashing liquid, replacing Madge, the 
manicurist/confidante who pitched the product on TV for 26 years.) 
</P>
<P>
 Len Kristensen, an architect, plans to oversee a renovation of the 
2,700-square-foot Tarzana home. Nicki Marcellino of Rodeo Realty, Sherman Oaks, 
was the selling broker.

TIPS FOR HOME BUYERS WITH KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN JAMES MARTIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Distributed by Universal Press 
Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was the president of an established realty company. She was one of the 
firm's top-selling agents. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all their real estate experience, the couple flubbed when it came to 
selecting the right home for their three elementary school-age youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months after moving to their 5,000-square-foot house, the couple knew 
they'd erred. The neighborhood, with its oversized estate lots, yielded 
scarcely any playmates. And the family soon vowed to move to an area with more 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple made the mistake of rushing to buy without giving thorough thought 
to what they wanted for their youngsters. A big house with a beautifully 
landscaped yard wasn't enough. They wanted the spirit of a real family 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you planning a home purchase with your family in mind? Then realty 
specialists suggest these 10 tips: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Define what you want for your children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all very intangible. One person could think a neighborhood is good for 
kids and another wouldn't," said Leigh Latreille, an agent for the Re/Max real 
estate chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents think children thrive in quasi-rural settings with large spaces 
in which to roam. Others like tight-knit communities with a more urban feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal preferences are even more diverse when it comes to picking the 
"right" public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Most buyers want high test scores. But some place still more importance on 
school athletic programs, racial diversity or other factors, said Erik 
Weisskopf, who sells homes through the Prudential real estate chain. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Go right to the neighborhood for information. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people rely on real estate agents for information. But residents of a 
community know the most about an area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to search the computer to find out how many 5- and 6-year-olds 
live in a neighborhood," said Latreille, the Re/Max agent. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out whether a community is child-friendly, walk around on a Saturday 
and ask questions of residents, Latreille recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll tell you right away about the personality of the school principal. 
They'll even tell you what time the ice cream man comes down the street," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Hunt for the vehicles that indicate the presence of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minivans, Volvos and Taurus wagons are definite signs of kids," said 
Prudential's Weisskopf. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Look for a neighborhood at the right point in its generational cycle for 
your family. 
</P>
<P>
 Communities have definite life cycles that can last several decades or longer. 
Today's empty-nester neighborhood could be full of toddlers in a couple of 
years, after elderly residents move or die and their houses turn over. 
</P>
<P>
 Given generational patterns, the number of children is important and also the 
typical ages living there. Your school-age youngsters could be bored in a 
community where baby strollers abound. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Look for the longest-term housing choice you can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Many young couples buy into town-house or condo-apartment communities with the 
expectation of moving on to a detached home later, when their youngsters reach 
school age. 
</P>
<P>
 But stability is an important factor for children. And the chances are your 
youngster will keep his playmates a lot longer if he starts in a community of 
separate homes, where turnover is usually less frequent, Latreille noted. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- Go directly to the schools rather than counting on third-party services. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reporting services you can pay to assess a school's quality. But 
knowing how many computers a school has and how its students score on tests 
won't give you the same feel for the institution that you'll get by walking its 
halls and talking to its faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Be careful about buying into a neighborhood with a highly popular public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's popular school is often tomorrow's overcrowded school, as many 
families hear of its reputation and move into the neighborhood to enroll their 
children there. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowding often leads to redistricting. When boundary lines are changed, 
the students with the best chance of continuing at the school are those who 
live very close by. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Look for a house on a cul-de-sac or other dead-end street. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents appreciate the relative freedom of movement that life on a 
dead-end street gives their children. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, one couple working with Leigh Latreille, the Re/Max agent, 
restricted their search solely to houses located on cul-de-sacs. 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Consider your child care needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since so many households have two parents in the work force, care for the 
children is hardly an inconsequential matter. 
</P>
<P>
 One well-to-do couple, for example, narrowed its house hunt to the community 
where the husband's mother lived. The reason? She provided personalized care 
for their two young children. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Remember there's such a thing as a neighborhood with too many children. 
</P>
<P>
 In their quest for a community with kids, some parents get too much of a good 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in the midst of myriad young children who are generating noise and 
activity can be exhausting, cautioned Weisskopf, the Prudential agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Working parents, who need quiet time away from the labors of the day, may be 
especially sorry if they buy into a neighborhood with too many kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come home from the office bushed and there's 15 kids outside your 
house riding big wheels, it can drive you just crazy," Weisskopf said.

RENT WATCH: OWNER WANTS TENANT, NOT HER FIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times; This column is prepared by Project Sentinel, a rental 
housing mediation service in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: A few months ago I rented one room in my three-bedroom home in order 
to share some expenses. Two weeks ago, my tenant's fiance moved in with her, 
and I don't know how long he plans to stay. As I have indicated in the rental 
agreement, I do not want more than one tenant in my house. What are my rights 
as a landlord in this situation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You do have a right to specify how many tenants can share your home with 
you. You should first try to speak with your tenant in order to make sure that 
she fully understands the provisions of her rental contract. If necessary, 
point out the section naming her as the only legal tenant. If you find that she 
does not wish to discuss the matter with you, or that she refuses to honor her 
contract, then you may give her a conditional three-day notice in writing, 
offering her the opportunity to either remove her fiance from your house or 
face eviction of them both. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, you may also seek assistance from your local mediation service. 
Perhaps with some negotiation, your tenant's fiance can reduce his visiting 
hours to a reasonable level or prove he maintains his own residence elsewhere. 
If such measures do not remedy the situation, then you may be forced to evict 
them both with a three-day notice. Making Ex-'Adults Only' Complex 
Kids-Friendly 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My husband and I and our two children live in a complex that was designed 
as an "adults only" residence back in the 1960s. At that time, it was legal to 
exclude children from such complexes, so we understand why the builders did not 
see a need to provide amenities for children. Now that the law has changed 
however, our children live in a setting that was designed with only adults in 
mind and suffer because they have no place to play. The stringent rules 
enforced by management add additional complications. The management feels small 
patches of grass outside the units will be ruined if they are constantly used 
as playgrounds. How do you think we could go about getting the management to 
loosen up on its policies toward children? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It sounds like it's time to contact a local agency that can arrange a 
mediation between you and the owners and managers. By taking this approach, you 
may be able to engage in an open, honest dialogue about the situation and, in 
turn, find workable solutions that will please both the families with children 
and the management. Perhaps with some creativity, an existing outdoor space 
could be turned into a small play area, or a meeting or recreation room that 
gets little adult use could be turned into an area suitable for children's use. 
A mediator can help you and your neighbors facilitate a productive discussion 
with management. Restrictive rental rules that you are unable to modify through 
the mediation process may be a form of familial status discrimination and 
should be referred to your local fair housing agency for investigation.

TRUST PROVIDES DONORS INCOME, TAX BENEFITS FOR GENEROSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY LUKAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Lukas is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Longtime Westwood residents Alan and Elaine Armer have accumulated a lot of 
real estate during their 44-year marriage, but, aside from a living trust 
created in 1979, they hadn't given too much thought to estate planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic couple have always been otherwise occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan, now 71, spent part of his working life as a television producer. He 
produced the first three years of "The Fugitive" (1963-1965) before moving on 
to other TV assignments. Then, after leaving the industry 14 years ago, he 
began teaching screenwriting and directing at Cal State Northridge, and he's 
still there. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Elaine, 63, was busy modeling, raising their four children and, 
during the '70s, decorating houses the couple had purchased as income property. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, however, the Armers focused their attention on estate 
planning after a relative urged them to do something to minimize future taxes 
on their estate, which amounts to $4.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with the guidance of an estate planning attorney, the Armers have created 
a charitable remainder trust (CRT), a device that allows owners of 
mortgage-free properties to give the property to their favorite charity and to 
receive an assortment of tax advantages and a lifetime income in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply stated, a CRT is a device by which a person transfers property to an 
irrevocable trust and retains lifetime income from the sale of that property. 
At death, what remains in the trust goes to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Armers did with the help of their attorney was to create a CRT that 
contains their $2.5 million Malibu beach house. When the trust sells the 
property -- it is now on the market -- and invests the proceeds, the Armers 
will receive income during their lifetime. The designated charities will 
receive what remains in the trust when the last remaining spouse dies. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes a CRT so advantageous? 
</P>
<P>
 -- It removes a piece of highly appreciated property from your estate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It allows you to avoid capital gains taxes when the property is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It allows you handsome income-tax deductions because you've given the 
property to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It provides you with lifetime income, which is taxable unless it comes from 
tax-exempt bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, if you become disenchanted with the charity you originally named as 
beneficiary, it allows you pick another one. 
</P>
<P>
 How is all of this achieved? Because the CRT is irrevocable, property put into 
the trust is out of your estate because it's out of your hands forever. Once 
created, the trust is administered by a trustee, which could be you or a trust 
company or the trust department of a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the trust is a tax-exempt entity, no capital-gains tax is paid when it 
sells the property. This allows 100% of the sale proceeds to be utilized to 
generate income. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the IRS looks favorably on charitable donations, it grants generous 
income-tax deductions to those who make them. 
</P>
<P>
 Because one of the conditions of the trust contains an income component for 
the donor, you receive an annual income for a specified period of time -- 
usually as long as you live. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these elements suited the Armers' estate planning goals: They wanted to 
generate additional income for their retirement, they wanted to avoid capital 
gains, earn income tax advantages and, perhaps even more important, they wanted 
to provide financial support for two favorite charities. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only two prerequisites to qualify: You must own some highly 
appreciated real estate and -- perhaps even more important in your final 
decision -- you must be willing to give it away forever to some favorite 
charity. If you're giving away your home, a third requirement is that you must 
be willing to move when the home is transferred to the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armers, who have strong ties to Cal State Northridge's Radio, Film and 
Television Department and to Jewish Big Brothers of Los Angeles, have named 
both as recipients of the trust proceeds when they die. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge and Big Brothers are, in legal terminology, "remainder 
beneficiaries," which means they will share what remains in the trust after the 
Armers die. The Armers are "income beneficiaries," meaning they earn income 
from the trust while they are alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the qualified personal residence trust (QPRT), your age and the duration 
(or term) of the trust are important factors to consider in deciding whether 
this is the appropriate vehicle for you. 
</P>
<P>
 The older you are, the larger the tax deduction. The reason is obvious: The 
older you are, the sooner the charity will get what remains in the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS tables are used to calculate the income you will receive based on the 
value of the trust, but you must specify a minimum of 5% as an annual return. 
The Armers have selected an 8% return. Based on the expected value of their CRT 
($2.5 million), their estimated annual income will be $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When considering a charitable remainder trust, you'll need to ask yourself 
some pragmatic and philosophical questions: Does it make economic sense for 
you? Do you own highly appreciated real estate that you'd like to permanently 
remove from your estate? And, perhaps even more important, do you feel 
benevolent? Do you want to make a significant gift to a favorite cause or a 
favorite university? 
</P>
<P>
 The market value of your property is an important component in these 
considerations. If it's worth more than $1 million, the designated charity is 
likely to absorb all the legal fees (ranging from $2,500 to $5,000) involved in 
preparing the trust. But even if the intended gift is less than $1 million, 
most charitable institutions and schools are eager to work with prospective 
donors, estate planners report. 
</P>
<P>
 From the donors' viewpoint, however, a CRT makes financial sense only if your 
free-and-clear property is worth $250,000 or more, according to estate planning 
attorney Jane Peebles of Los Angeles. "When you consider the cost of setting up 
the trust and the benefits of the tax break, anything less isn't really worth 
it," she said. "But in Southern California, that covers a lot of real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 A CRT prepared by the charity's legal staff is usually reviewed by your own 
attorney to assure it contains all the important conditions. One particularly 
important condition that these trusts should contain is the freedom to change 
the beneficiary -- just in case you become dissatisfied with your original 
choice. You can't pull out of the trust but you can change charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armers said they paid a total of $2,000 for legal consultations relating 
to the trust, and that included the all-important review. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other estate planning techniques described in this series, such a trust 
is complicated and needs an estate planning attorney to prepare or, in some 
cases, review. How the CRT Works 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a hypothetical example of how the charitable remainder trust works. 
</P>
<P>
 You're an unmarried 67-year-old retired librarian who owns a highly 
appreciated rental duplex that's worth $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to sell the duplex and invest the profit to supplement your Social 
Security and pension, but selling involves capital gains taxes that would 
minimize that profit. In this example, you would face state and federal taxes 
of $160,000, leaving only $240,000 to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, you can give that duplex to a charity by way of a CRT. The 
CRT is tax-exempt, so when the trust sells the duplex, there are no capital 
gains, and the trust is able to invest the entire $400,000 to provide you with 
at least a 5% return -- $20,000 annually, in this case. Then, when you die, the 
charity you've named in the trust receives whatever funds remain. 
</P>
<P>
 You gain one other benefit as well: generous income-tax deductions for having 
made a charitable gift. Those deductions can be carried forward for five years' 
worth of tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also receive the same benefits if you create a charitable remainder 
trust and put your home into it. The caveat here, of course, is that you must 
be willing to move once the home is transferred to the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the trust is irrevocable, you do have the option of changing the 
beneficiary if you become disenchanted with the first charity you have 
selected.

IN CALIFORNIA, POLITICS AND FAMILY DON'T MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Starr, Kevin Starr, a contributing editor to Opinion, teaches in the 
School of Urban and Regional Planning at USC. His next volume on the history of 
California, The Dream Endures: California Through the Great Depression, will be

<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown is quick to dispute the point if anyone 
compares the Browns of California to the Kennedys of Massachusetts. The 
comparison offends her sense of how things work in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But was not Treasurer Brown's father the 32nd governor of California, her 
brother the 34th? Is not her Uncle Harold a retired justice of the state Court 
of Appeal? Is not her cousin, Jeff, San Francisco's Public Defender? 
</P>
<P>
 The name Brown certainly carries high political-name recognition in 
California, and is thus an advantage. But there the comparison to the Kennedys 
of Massachusetts comes to an abrupt end. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts is localized, tribalized, politicized to chthonian intensity. 
Accents change from town to town. Social status varies with an almost 
biological determinism, depending upon one's religion, ethnic background, high 
school or college, trade, social associations or neighborhood. Metropolitan 
Boston commands the politics of Massachusetts to an overwhelming degree. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a social environment -- tribal, xenophobic, parochial -- the Kennedys 
emerged more in the manner of clan leaders in ancient Ireland than modern 
politicians. As did ancient clan leaders and their successors in the feudal 
nobility, the Kennedys laid claim to total, mostly uncritical, enduring loyalty 
of their still tribalized followers. All the rituals of the Kennedys -- display 
of family, touch football games, the nonchalance of son following father or 
nephew following uncle into office, the carousing -- are characteristics of 
clan leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns, by contrast, lived quietly during the 1950s in the solidly 
middle-class Forest Hill section of San Francisco, with Jerry, Cynthia and 
Kathleen taking their sack lunches to St. Brendan's Grammar School each 
morning, even when their father was attorney general. No mystique attached 
itself to any of the Browns, parent or child, despite the fact that Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown was, with Hiram W. Johnson, Earl Warren and Ronald Reagan, one of 
the four most influential governors state history. 
</P>
<P>
 California has never developed a political dynasty, at least one that was 
related to itself by bloodlines. Does the lack of political families bespeak a 
lack of political loyalties? Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalty, however, has tended since the post-World War II boom to be highly 
localized. Californians, Southern Californians especially, are intensely 
committed not to government in the abstract, but to government as the deliverer 
of local services -- schools, police and fire, beaches and parks -- many of 
them organized as autonomous districts cutting across state, county and 
municipal jurisdictions. Add to these entities neighborhood and homeowners' 
associations and you have what political scientists have long considered the 
Phantom Government of California. 
</P>
<P>
 For the overwhelming majority of Californians, in other words, California 
itself -- so vast, so diverse -- remains an abstraction in a way that 
Massachusetts -- so local, so uniformly textured, so comprehensible in its 
geography -- can never be. Local life, by contrast, is intensely tangible, 
linked to self-interest, capable of engendering fierce loyalties. From this 
perspective, California has been in the forefront, for something approaching 40 
years, of a phenomenon in which modernist political structures, largely 
abstract, are refashioned, even disestablished, by local identities and 
loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a number of California's politicians have been related. Mining 
mega-millionaire George Hearst, for example, served in the U.S. Senate from 
1886-93, and his son, William Randolph, served a term in Congress -- but in New 
York City and only for four years. Oakland Tribune publisher Joseph Knowland 
served in Congress from 1904-06 and his son, William, served in the U.S. Senate 
from 1945-1958. In their domination of East Bay Republican politics, with their 
linkages of publishing and elective power, the Knowlands come closest to a 
political family in the history of California. But there were only two of them, 
and Bill Knowland was trounced by Pat Brown in the governor's race of 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco is another special case. San Francisco Congresswoman Florence 
Kahn succeeded her husband, Julius, when he died in 1924. So did Sala Burton 
upon the death of her husband, Rep. Philip Burton, in 1983. But neither wife 
was succeeded by offspring or relative, and the line ended. On the other hand, 
Philip's brother, John, a former congressman, now serves in the state Assembly 
and is contemplating a run for mayor. Today, former Mayor Joseph L. Alioto is 
spearheading the campaign of his daughter Angela, president of the Board of 
Supervisors, to deny reelection to Mayor Frank Jordan and thus become the first 
father-daughter mayoral duo in the history of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of California, by contrast, has little political family to show, with 
the exception of the father-son secretaries of state, Frank Chester Jordan and 
Frank Morrill Jordan, who dominated the office from 1913 through the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The scarcity, even non-existence of political families in California doesn't 
mean it lacks families with a consistent record of giving. The Haas family of 
San Francisco solidly anchored in its ownership of Levi-Strauss since the 
1870s, have been ardent political donors for four generations. In this 
generation, Madeleine Haas Russell has kept up the Democratic side, while 
Richard and Rhoda Goldman have favored Republican causes and candidates. 
Similarly, the Fleishhackers -- Mortimer and Herbert in the early 20th Century, 
Mortimer II and Janet in the mid-20th Century, Mortimer III currently -- have 
exercised continuing influence in Bay Area politics, as have the hotel-owning 
Swig family, real-estate mogul Walter H. Shorenstein and his son, Douglas, and 
Napa winemakers Barry and Audrey Sterling, and their daughter, Joy. 
</P>
<P>
 A noticeable number of two-generation political donors has recently emerged in 
Los Angeles. Leon T. Garr, founder of Founders' National Bank, and his son, 
Carlton Jenkins, the current CEO, are a pioneering father-son donor team in the 
African American community. Shogo Suzuki, chairman of the board of Suzuki 
Enterprises, one of the nation's largest purveyors of airline food, has been 
followed into political donorship by his daughter, Shelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Other two-generation donors include TV executive Barbara Corday of "Cagney and 
Lacey" fame, president of New World Television, and her daughter, Evan, founder 
of Politically Speaking, a Democratic forum; Carmen Warschaw and daughter Hope; 
entertainment lawyer Susan A. Grode and sons, Jason and Josh; attorney Harvey 
Silbert and daughter, Lynne Weingarten; MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman and daughter 
Lynn, and the late auto mogul Holmes Tuttle, a member of Ronald Reagan's 
kitchen cabinet, and son Robert. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any of these parent-sibling activist-donors will survive into the 
third or fourth generation remains an open question. Old Republican money, for 
example, has tended to turn to philanthropy and the arts by the third 
generation. It is no accident, therefore, that Republican fund raisers in 
California have been light years ahead of their Democratic counterparts in 
employing sophisticated techniques of direct mail to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 California is simply not a place where local alliances flourish because its 
citizens tend to be people from elsewhere. As such, they can hardly be expected 
to recognize recurring political names. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1930s, Clem Whittaker and his partner (later his wife) Leone 
Baxter, recognizing the isolation, the individualism, even the autism of the 
California voter, invented a new form of political campaign based in mass 
media. In their first big election, they defeated the efforts of Pacific Gas 
and Electric to sink the Central Valley Water Project. The following year, the 
pair was retained by a temporary alliance of Republicans and conservative 
Democrats to defeat the candidacy of Socialist-turned-Democrat Upton Sinclair 
for governor. Whittaker and Baxter destroyed Sinclair in a mass-media blitz 
that has become a founding classic of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker and Baxter grasped a simple but essential truth. Californians could 
be reached individually -- by the millions! -- through the mass media, which in 
the 1930s meant pamphlets, leaflets, newspaper and magazine advertising, 
planted stories, commentary and cartoons, billboards, spot announcements on 
radio, slides and trailers in motion-picture theaters, and direct mail. To this 
program of managed media, they added the values of contest, image and timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of us inhabit a California that is as much a state of mind as a place. 
Each Anglo-Californian, especially, stands autonomously before the universe, a 
figment of his or her imagination, re-invented, reborn in the Golden State. 
Asian and Latino California still show the strong influence of family. In this 
matter, family, African American California is experiencing its own distinctive 
ordeal. The price of such independence among Anglo-Californians is frequently 
isolation, loneliness, narcissism -- not a good beginning for family life, even 
of the political variety.*

THE NATION; CONCENTRATING ON PROCESS, WE MISS BREYER'S STRENGTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Estrich, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What makes Judge Stephen G. Breyer such a "safe" choice for the U.S. Supreme 
Court is also what makes him such an out standing choice. Here is a man who has 
won the respect of an Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and an Orrin G. Hatch 
(R-Utah), a Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and a Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.). He is 
precisely the sort of politician who can have a major impact on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The coverage of Breyer's nomination has focused more on the selection process 
than on the judge's qualifications. Many in the press seem far more interested 
in what went on inside the White House during the last week or two than what it 
is likely to go on inside the Supreme Court for the next few decades. But the 
true measure of a process is its result, and in this case, the result is 
first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer is, even his critics concede, extraordinarily smart. This is passed 
over quite quickly in most descriptions of him -- as if it doesn't matter much 
as a qualification for being on the court. But unlike many smart people, Breyer 
does not have to constantly prove to everyone else in the room that he is 
smarter than they are. He is secure enough to care more about getting things 
done. This quality may be even rarer than his intelligence -- and far more 
prized. 
</P>
<P>
 I know Steve Breyer well. He was my colleague at Harvard, and my boss in the 
Senate. In the two years I worked for him on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I 
never saw him waver in his commitment to equal rights or civil rights. I never 
saw him compromise on a matter of principle that he or Kennedy, our boss, cared 
deeply about. He did not win the respect of the Republicans on the committee by 
kowtowing to them on issues, or by abandoning his values. He won their respect 
by being honest, acting in good faith and searching hard for common ground. He 
won their loyalty by listening, and dealing fairly. Those political skills will 
serve him well on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure that Breyer could ever get himself elected to the state 
Legislature, much less to Congress. He's not a comfortable glad-hander; he 
doesn't have the kind of instant likability that sells in a 30-second ad. But 
he is a superb politician in ways that count on the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for any moderate or liberal on the court today is to find five 
votes. Without five votes, a brilliant opinion is a dissent. Breyer is no fan 
of dissents. On the First Circuit Court of Appeals, where he serves as chief 
judge, dissents are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding five votes on the U.S. Supreme Court on ideologically sensitive 
questions is no easy task. At least for the foreseeable future, it means 
convincing a David H. Souter and a Sandra Day O'Connor or an Anthony M. Kennedy 
to join the more moderate Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens and Breyer. 
You have to be smart enough to see the common ground, honest enough to be 
trusted, determined enough to keep trying, strong enough to know where to 
yield, secure enough to share credit. 
</P>
<P>
 These are, of course, precisely the same skills it takes to forge a consensus 
between Kennedy and Hatch, and Biden and Thurmond. Breyer, perhaps more than 
any other appellate judge today, knows how to do that job. He's done it. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, when Harry A. Blackmun was appointed to the court, he was 
the safe choice. After bruising battles over the nominations of Judges Clement 
F. Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, President Richard M. Nixon reportedly 
asked his aides to find him someone who could be easily confirmed. They found 
Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
 No one predicted that the former counsel to the Mayo Clinic would express his 
interest in health law by authoring Roe vs. Wade. When he was appointed to the 
court, Blackmun was known disparagingly as one of the "Minnesota twins" -- the 
other being the conservative Chief Justice Warren Burger. In his early years, 
Blackmun voted with the chief justice 90% of the time; in his later days, no 
one would accuse Blackmun of being anyone's twin, least of all the conservative 
chief justice's. 
</P>
<P>
 The court has shifted over the years -- but so has Blackmun. In 1976, Blackmun 
was part of the majority that allowed executions to begin again in the United 
States; this year, he declared he would no longer support the death penalty in 
any case. Blackmun was the deciding vote in holding flag burning to be 
protected speech, in upholding affirmative action, banning prayer at 
high-school graduations and barring Nativity scenes from courthouse steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun's unpredictability was a strength. The best justices have grown and 
changed and developed on the job. It is the ones who don't change at all, who 
don't grow, that should worry us. Fifteen years ago, some women's organizations 
opposed Stevens' nomination to the high court because of a decision he had made 
as an appellate judge in a discrimination case. They disagreed with his 
decision; and based on that, they were afraid that he would not be a friend to 
women on the court. They were wrong. No one in the last decade has been more 
sensitive to issues of sex discrimination. Predictions are a dangerous game 
when it comes to the best justices. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks on Monday in the Rose Garden, Breyer went out of his way to 
reassure those who worry that he is too far removed from real people who are 
affected by the court's decisions. "The Constitution and the law," he said, 
"must be more than mere words. They must work as a practical reality. And I 
will certainly try to make the law work for people, because that is its 
defining purpose in a government of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The question that should be asked about any nominee is whether he or she has 
the intelligence, the values, the wisdom and the experience to serve as a 
justice on a court that is, by definition, infallible. Breyer does. And the 
members of the Senate who worked with him know that. That is why his nomination 
is drawing bipartisan praise. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is indeed confirmed easily, as most expect, it will be because so many 
people judging him know firsthand how well qualified he is. In these days of 
sharp partisan divisions on almost every issue, Breyer's ability to win truly 
enthusiastic support across the ideological spectrum -- from Hatch to Kennedy 
-- makes his nomination an occasion for hopefulness about the future of the 
Supreme Court.*

THE NATION; JURIES DEMAND BIG STICKS, BUT CARRY SOFT HEARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Neal Gabler, Neal Gabler, author of An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews 
Invented Hollywood (Anchor/Doubleday), is now working on a book about columnist 
Walter Winchell. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk to any prosecutor and he or she will tell you a horror story. There is 
the one about the bank robber who was identified in court by four witnesses and 
whose face was cap tured by the bank's surveillance camera but who was, 
nonetheless, acquitted. Or the one about the assassin who shot a man in a 
crowded hotel but who was still acquitted. Or about two brothers named Lyle and 
Erik who admitted to shotgunning their parents and then were reprieved by hung 
juries. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to square these tales of leniency with the deafening roar for 
law and order we're hearing. But at a time when the American public cheers 
Singapore for caning a teen-age vandal, when a tough new crime bill mandating 
sentences is being weighed in a Senate-House conference committee and when TV 
lionizes crime fighters, there is some evidence that rates of conviction are 
actuallyfalling. Everyone is tough on crime these days -- everyone, it seems, 
but juries. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the current division between hawkish advocates of law and order 
and dovish jurors began more than 20 years ago, during the Nixon presidency. It 
was Richard M. Nixon who first politicized crime by raising the level of 
rhetoric and suggesting that there were actually some politicians for crime. It 
had never occurred to anyone before. And it was Nixon who, by abusing the power 
of his office, created such distrust of state authority that he would leave a 
legacy of doubt for at least a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 What Nixon bequeathed to us, then, was two radically different, competing 
visions of crime: one shouted from political rostrums and editorial pages, the 
other quietly purveyed in courtrooms; one full of bluster with little real 
impact on crime, the other with no bluster whatsoever but with a very real 
impact, albeit negative, on crime; one loudly acknowledged, the other quietly 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives may claim these views simply reflect political divisions: 
hard-headed conservatives vs. soft-headed liberals. The problem for 
conservatives, though, is that while it is easy to blame allegedly liberal 
lawmakers and judges for permissiveness toward criminals, it is far more 
difficult to impugn juries. Whatever else they are, juries are not cabals of 
bleeding-heart liberals; rather, they are a collection of strangers without any 
collective political agenda. Jurors are presumably our peers, our friends, our 
neighbors, our co-workers -- us. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most ready explanation for the difference between these visions is 
that sitting on a jury changes a person. It is one thing to rail against crime 
as we all do in our living rooms; it is quite another when one is confronted by 
a particular defendant in a particular set of circumstances and then asked to 
render judgment. But if that were the whole story, conviction rates would have 
more or less held steady over time -- the experience of being a juror 20 years 
ago being not all that different from the experience of being a juror now. 
</P>
<P>
 But something else is clearly going on inside jury rooms, and every prosecutor 
I've talked to will attest to it. Juries will flagrantly ignore incriminating 
evidence, dismiss eyewitnesses, disregard their own senses, not to mention 
their own common sense. As one prosecutor sanguinely put it, "Sympathies tend 
to lie with the defendant." It is not unheard of, in fact, for defense 
attorneys to take jurors to dinner after an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 What has effected this change is not so much what goes on inside the courtroom 
as the cultural atmosphere outside it. Since most of us, thankfully, are not 
victims of crime, we view it metaphorically: Crime isn't a thing that happens 
to us; it is a symbol of what is happening to society. 
</P>
<P>
 For the hard-liners, and that includes many of us now, crime is the most 
glaring symptom of a larger social dysfunction that includes drugs, teen-age 
pregnancy, homelessness and racial tension. We live in anomie. End crime, and 
you restore the old moral order.  
</P>
<P>
 For others, however, the metaphor of crime is not so simple. Some see crime as 
a tragic expression of implacable social and psychological forces and criminals 
as corks bobbing helplessly on the waves of these forces. After the acquittal 
of Lorena Bobbitt for cutting off her husband's genitals and the mistrials of 
the Menendezes, there was a great deal written about a new culture of excuse in 
which every defendant was also a victim -- of abuse or intimidation or 
presuggestion or, in the famous Twinkie defense, of too much junk food. In a 
society where what one does is the sum total of what has been done to him or 
her, no one is responsible. A lawyer friend calls it the "Oprah defense." 
</P>
<P>
 But even while conceding that the culture of excuse is invading our 
courtrooms, a larger metaphor is needed to explain the Menendez mistrials, the 
Bobbitt acquittal and the acquittal in the first trial of the Rodney G. King 
assailants, among others. In our courts today, it is the system of justice that 
is on trial, for it seems to have failed everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with the Nixon presidency and intensified by Ronald Reagan's cynical 
anti-government rhetoric, the state fell into disrepute. We all feel that state 
authority cannot be trusted, and nothing so represents state authority as the 
criminal-justice system. That is why a criminal outside the courtroom may be 
considered a miscreant at war with society and deserving of all the opprobrium 
we heap on him. But once he enters the courtroom, once he becomes part of the 
judicial process, a criminal becomes an antagonist not of society, but of the 
state. Think of it in movie terms. Suddenly, you have the cold apparatus of the 
state against an individual. Now try and get a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, this is a metaphor with special appeal to women and minorities, 
groups who can identify with the individual, and, off the record, there are 
prosecutors who will tell you that the real problem in court is that women and 
some minority jurors do not want to convict. (The Menendez juries split along 
gender lines, with women for acquittal.) 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this theory, based on anecdotal evidence about women minorities, holds 
or not -- the burden of proof for the discredited state is high, indeed. The 
jurors in the bank-camera-surveillance case later told prosecutors that they 
couldn't be sure the defendant was the man on the tape. The jurors in the hotel 
shooting later said that witnesses didn't actually see the assailant shoot the 
victim, though he was armed and fled. And any prosecutor will tell you how 
difficult it is to get a juror to believe the testimony of a police officer 
today. In short, it is as if the entire judicial system were a ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be unusual that calls for Hobbesian order should also give rise 
simultaneously to fears of Orwellian abuse. Certainly, given the last two 
decades of social deterioration and political disappointment, it should not be 
surprising that Nixon's twin legacies of law and order and distrust have only 
grown. We continue, divided by our metaphors -- wanting order while distrusting 
the system that dispenses it, girding to fight crime while wary of the 
authority that will prosecute it. 
</P>
<P>
 Order, yes. But from whom?*

THE WORLD; HAS NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR BRINKMANSHIP FINALLY CROSSED THE LINE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert A. Manning, Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Progressive 
Policy Institute, was a State Department policy adviser on East Asia from 1989 
until March, 1993. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The term "crisis" has been applied to the standoff over North Korea's 
nuclear-weapons program so often in the past 15 months that skepticism can be 
forgiven. But this time there is a difference -- one that will lead to either a 
real breakthrough or an inexorable confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the twists and turns in the on-again off-again diplomatic games played 
between North Korea and its interlocutors, there has been, at bottom, the hope 
that some worthwhile deal could be reached to end its nuclear program. But 
North Korea's latest gambit -- removing spent fuel from the core of its nuclear 
reactor with no international monitoring -- may be the step that takes it from 
brinkmanship to the point of no return. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who are now at 
North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex completing an inspection blocked by 
Pyongyang in March, confirm that Korean technicians have begun removing some of 
the 8,000 plutonium-rich fuel rods from its 25-megawatt reactor. This defueling 
of the reactor, which takes some two months to complete, is a make-or-break 
issue, because the fuel rods hold the key to one of the chief mysteries about 
Pyongyang's nuclear program: Has North Korea attained enough plutonium to make 
one or two nuclear devices? 
</P>
<P>
 The frequently repeated mantra of U.S. officials in recent years has been that 
Pyongyang "may already have one or two nuclear bombs." That conclusion is based 
on a worst-case estimate of what North Korea might have done during a 100-day 
period in 1989 -- when North Korea shut off its reactor and claimed it had 
"removed damaged fuel rods." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not known exactly how much plutonium was reprocessed during that 
period, only that IAEA laboratory analysis revealed that North Korea produced 
more than the 90 grams it claimed. (Five to eight kilograms are needed for a 
nuclear bomb.) By taking samples from the removed fuel rods, the IAEA would be 
able to solve that mystery, and measure with precision the amount of plutonium 
North Korea has acquired. If North Korea carries out the defueling, it will be 
impossible for the IAEA to learn the truth about its nuclear history. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. negotiators have stressed repeatedly to North Korea that preserving the 
history of its nuclear activities is a precondition of any package deal that 
would provide diplomatic and economic incentives in exchange for ending its 
nuclear program. Why, then, would North Korea recklessly embark on a course 
almost certain to lead to confrontation? 
</P>
<P>
 Brinkmanship is a standard North Korean tactic. But always before, they have 
pulled back at the last moment: Pyongyang backed off its March, 1993, threat to 
become the first member to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; 
and again, last February backed off a threat to prevent the IAEA from 
continuing to safeguard its nuclear facilities when faced with the threat of 
sanctions. But this time, they appear to be going over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that the pattern of empty U.S. threats in Bosnia, Somalia and 
Haiti, mixed signals and the fact that Washington has yet to put an offer on 
the table, may have emboldened Pyongyang to push the envelope once again and 
force the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plausible explanation is that, by destroying its nuclear history, 
North Korea's strategy is to attain the ambiguous status of nuclear-threshold 
countries, such as Pakistan. If so, it would try to force the international 
community to accept freezing rather than rolling back its nuclear program as 
the basis of any deal -- and so keeping both its nuclear option and getting 
economic aid.  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's approach to proliferation in South Asia has been to put a 
cap on the program of Pakistan and India, with the hope of later reversing 
them. North Korea might believe that "a few are OK" might apply to East Asia, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, where does this leave U.S. efforts to stop the North Korean 
nuclear threat? It still may not be too late to reach a diplomatic solution. 
Before Pyongyang's defueling of its reactor, the Clinton Administration was 
prepared to start a new round of high-level talks in Geneva where it would, for 
the first time, put a package deal of diplomatic and economic incentives on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 The only obstacle to moving ahead with negotiations was the completion of an 
IAEA inspection of North Korea's reprocessing facility, which North Korea 
prevented in March. The IAEA nuclear detectives returned to North Korea on 
Tuesday to accomplish that task -- and to find a solution to the refueling 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 One way out is for Washington to tell Pyongyang immediately that, if it 
reaches some arrangement with the IAEA either to supervise the reactor 
defueling or to separate and seal the fuel rods the IAEA has identified as 
necessary to determine its nuclear history, the Administration will send a 
presidential envoy to present a package deal. The IAEA could then analyze the 
fuel rods later, as long as they were kept under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if, as it appears, North Korea is deliberately destroying the history 
of its nuclear activities, the United States and the entire international 
community are faced with a devil's alternative.  
</P>
<P>
 If Washington and its Asian partners accept the new facts created by Pyongyang 
and decide it is better to try and stop its nuclear program from going any 
farther, and live with the possibility of one or two nuclear bombs than to 
punish North Korea for its perfidy, the integrity of the NPT and IAEA would be 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if the U.N. Security Council decides to begin applying 
progressively tougher sanctions against North Korea, the United States and the 
international community would head down a path likely to lead to a second 
Korean war. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither option is appealing. Perhaps more troubling than living with 
proliferation on the Korean Peninsula, however, is the question raised by North 
Korea's behavior: With a track record of terrorism, aggression and broken 
pledges, is any deal negotiated with North Korea worth the paper it is written 
on? 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy of U.S. policy is that Washington has yet to present a clear and 
precise offer to North Korea to test its intentions. Now we may be drifting 
toward a confrontation without knowing for certain if any deal was possible.*

THE NATION; A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE WITH BOTTOM-LINE EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Friedman, David Friedman, director of the New Economy Project, writes 
frequently on regional and technology issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1970, more than 90,000 people were working in high-tech jobs inside 
Boston's Route 128. In California's Silicon Valley, 60,000 were so employed. 
Twenty years later, Silicon Valley's employment exploded to 265,000, while 
Route 128 grew to just 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, in 1990, 39 of the 100 fastest-growing electronics firms in the 
country called Silicon Valley home; only four were headquartered in Route 128. 
1992 total sales of Silicon Valley's largest public companies rose to a record 
$77 billion, an increase of more than 15%. Route 128's major computer firms -- 
Digital Equipment Corp., Wang, Prime and Data General -- experienced 
spectacular failures and retrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the gap in achievement? 
</P>
<P>
 In her new book, "Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon 
Valley and Route 128," Berkeley professor AnnaLee Saxenian explains that the 
Silicon Valley greatly benefited from the state's open, entrepreneurial yet 
highly collaborative business culture. Saxenian's findings are important 
because they highlight the fundamental organizational practices behind 
California's economic successes in several key sectors, a reality dangerously 
ignored by many of the state's political and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the industrial-development proposals currently emanating from state 
and federal governments -- R&D subsidies, consortia, "conversion" grants, 
training schemes, access to technology, capital and major research 
universities, or encouraging "clusters" of firms in related industries -- 
explains why Silicon Valley boomed and Route 128 didn't. Both regions enjoyed 
similar resources. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the inflexible, cradle-to-grave employment typical of 
Massachusetts, Silicon Valley's culture encouraged talented engineers to leave 
their companies and join or open new ones. As a result, cutting-edge managerial 
and technical knowledge was spread around and informal, but crucial business 
links created. Route 128 companies tended to be vertically integrated, doing 
most phases of a product's design and manufacturing in-house; Silicon Valley's 
perfected a system of collaborative subcontracting in which companies 
specialized in one or two design or manufacturing tasks, then combined their 
expertise with other highly specialized suppliers to produce a continually 
improving array of new, advanced products. 
</P>
<P>
 In head-to-head competition, California's approach, which Saxenian calls a 
"network" economy, repeatedly outperformed Route 128 in adjusting to new market 
trends. Silicon Valley became so good at this game that it not only displaced 
its Massachusetts competitors, it also beat back a challenge from the prototype 
network economy, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 This history offers important economic-development lessons. More than 
technology, capital and infrastructure are needed to compete successfully in 
the global economy. Most important is the ability to stimulate and sustain a 
culture of openness, opportunity, collaboration and entreprenuerialism. Regions 
able to organize their economies along these lines spawn industries that 
constantly learn, develop new products and adapt to a world in which even the 
most sophisticated breakthrough can be copied virtually overnight by cheaper 
producers from somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that California is unquestionably one of the world's most 
hospitable places for network economies. Indeed, the core of the state's 
industrial base is organized much like Silicon Valley's, resulting in such 
thriving sectors as entertainment, computers, agriculture, business services, 
medical equipment and fashion. This advantage allowed California to perform 
better during the last recession than many other areas that, on the surface, 
seemed healthier. 
</P>
<P>
 From peak to trough, California lost 4.8% of its non-farm employment. New York 
and New Jersey each lost more than 7%, and Massachusetts, a staggering 11.5%. 
If heavily defense-dependent Los Angeles County is excluded from the figures, 
the remaining parts of the state lost just 1.8% of their non-farm jobs from an 
employment base larger than New York or Texas -- a better record than such 
supposedly "lucky" states as Illinois, Ohio or North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that much of California's business and political elite is not 
only unaware of this economic reality, their policies often work against 
expanding the industrial culture Saxenian describes. Particularly misguided, 
for example, is the language of withdrawal, closure and insularity that has 
infected the politics of regulatory reform, trade and immigration. Neither the 
notion of ruggedly individualistic "cowboy" firms -- which either want to be 
left alone or they'll ride away to greener pastures -- nor the idea of an 
economy protected from international trade and purged of its burgeoning Latino 
and Asian participants -- which have rates of learning achievement and income 
increases several times higher than the statewide average -- is consistent with 
building and maintaining the collaborative relationships state industries need 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Route 128's decline illustrates the danger of ignoring industrial 
fundamentals. For years, the Massachusetts High Technology Council lobbied for 
lower taxes to improve a "bad" business climate. At the same time, however, no 
one was paying attention to Route 128's real competitive challenge -- building 
more flexible technology- and product-development relationships. Massachusetts 
eventually enacted pro-business tax reforms, only to see its treasured 
high-tech industrial base decline even more rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally troublesome are the big-science, retraining and R&D programs 
relentlessly pushed by state and federal officials to "save" California. Such 
programs inevitably end up subsidizing and protecting politically savvy but 
industrially dysfunctional groups at the expense of network economies. 
Ironically, many of the organizations favored by such policies exhibit cultures 
that crippled Route 128. 
</P>
<P>
 No party or individual is now putting forth a political message consistent 
with the network economies that Saxenian describes. The essential starting 
point for such a strategy would be to adopt the networks' core values of 
openness, opportunity and regional responsibility as baseline political 
principles guiding public policy. Government efforts would then be reoriented 
to support activities consistent with network creation. States such as 
Pennsylvania have shaped their economic policies according to this strategy, 
insisting that regulatory, tax, financial and other business incentives be 
coupled with explicit commitments by private-sector recipients to foster 
regional relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread diffusion of Silicon Valley practices enabled California to 
generate jobs and assimilate a diverse population on an unprecedented scale. 
Perhaps one day the state will create a political system worthy of its 
remarkable industrial achievements.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW / THE GOVERNOR'S RACE; KATHLEEN BROWN; A CANDIDATE 
SEEKING TO CARRY ON THE FAMILY LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Stall, Bill Stall is a political writer for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a touch of regal bearing about Kathleen Brown, fitting since she now 
carries the torch of what is being called the Brown political dynasty of 
California. Her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Sr., was governor 1959-67, in a 
booming, building California that matched his expansive political spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was gloomy brother-governor, Edmund G. (Jerry) Jr., in office 
1975-83, the rebel who rejected the trappings of power, said less was more and 
is remembered mostly for satellites and diamond lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Kathleen, 48, always Pat's favorite who -- Brown family observers 
insist -- got all the best genes: mom's smarts and poise and dad's political 
touch. Brown served on the Los Angeles Board of Education 1975-80, moved to New 
York with her new husband, television executive Van Gordon Sauter, went to law 
school, became a Wall Street bond counsel, rubbed shoulders with the Brokaws 
and Rathers, returned to Los Angeles, a political tuneup on the Board of Public 
Works and then state treasurer. Fulfilling the Brown destiny, they say, she is 
favored to win the June 7 Democratic primary. If she does, she would go against 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps never has a California politician enjoyed such sudden national star 
status as Brown, grandmother, housewife-turned-lawyer and then pol, touted by 
national glamour magazines as a potential President of the United States, while 
still not fully tested on the statewide political stage. She and Sauter, who 
ran CBS network news and now heads Fox News, are at home on Los Angeles' 
Westside or New York's West Side, or in their Idaho mountain getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 They are somehow symbolic of an improbable modern marriage, or a mushy 
old-fashioned fairy tale. She is an intense Democrat with strong liberal roots, 
with lean, hawkish, sharp-featured good looks, a conciliator, mother of three 
grown children from an earlier marriage and now doting grandmother. Sauter is a 
roly-poly, bearded man with a quick, throaty laugh; an argumentative, 
opinionated, Republican conservative working in a high-stakes, high-risk 
industry, with two children of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's treasurer's office in the Bradbury Building on Broadway seems to 
perfectly reflect the candidate: rooted in California history, but restored and 
decorated in smart, efficient modern style. Never really comfortable giving 
stand-up speeches, Brown prefers just to talk, as she did on a recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why do you want to be governor?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think frustration, anger at the direction that my state is headed 
under the leadership of Pete Wilson. I have seen everything that I grew up to 
believe was special about California -- whether it was the opportunity for good 
jobs, the opportunity for a good education, whether it was the quality of life 
-- being destroyed, job by job, and school by school, and element by element. 
And I want to do something about it. And that's why I'm running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You could have run for reelection without a problem and then for governor 
four years from now without an incumbent running. Was that a consideration?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I learned from my dad that timing is everything and that you ought not let 
opportunities and moments go by. And what this man (Wilson) has done to our 
state in terms of fiscal mismanagement -- and I speak specifically of the 
summer of 1992 and the IOUs -- and what he has done to damage our state's 
credibility in the marketplace . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But it is beyond just fiscal mismanagement. California is a state that is 
built on its people and our people are diverse, and our people are 
entrepreneurial, and our people have always had kind of a grit and 
determination to overcome all the different crises that have beset the state . 
. . . What this man has done is to divide our people unnecessarily, 
provocatively divided them, purposely divided them for political ends. And I 
just think that's wrong . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I think there's a new California that is brighter and better and more 
prosperous than the California before. And this man is standing in the way of 
that new California from emerging. So I'm not going to sit there in the 
treasurer's office and continue to fight against his fiscal mismanagement, 
continue to fight against his lack of vision. I'm going to go out in the 
marketplace and let the people decide which vision they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When Pete Wilson was deciding whether to run for governor in 1990, some 
advisers urged him not to because they thought California was ungovernable. Did 
you have any such concerns?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I did not. This is a great job. I've got to tell you, this is a great 
state to sell. There's a lot of problems -- lots. And people are leaving by the 
vanloads. But people are coming, too. And people will stay if they are given a 
reason to stay. And I can't imagine a more extraordinary opportunity in life 
than to try and put California back on track to be the state that sets the mark 
for the nation, the state that celebrates its diversity, celebrates its 
at-times oddities, celebrates its uniqueness, or eccentricities. Because those 
are the productive creativity of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach that I took was: Can governors make a difference? I looked at 
other states around the country, because so many states have experienced the 
kind of fiscal upheaval that California has. In looking across the country, I 
saw conditions weren't that different, but that who was in charge, and what 
they did and how they did it, did make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Richards has made a huge difference in the way the people of Texas feel 
about themselves . . . . And Mario Cuomo, for all his wide array of different 
reviews about his administration, has always made the people of New York 
believe in their future. So you never have the kind of malaise in New York that 
you have in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have been glamorized in the national magazines with so many articles 
setting high expectations. Has that been a problem?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think there have been expectations, issues that I have to contend with. 
But I'm pretty fortunate to have those kinds of articles written about me, if 
I'm interested in running for governor. If the pictures are good and they spell 
my name right, by and large, it's OK, my mother says. Because most people don't 
read those long stories. I know that when there's a really bad one, and they 
say, "Great article, Kathleen." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Here in California, you were the assumed front-runner and had raised all 
this money and people started questioning: What does she stand for? Then you 
did your policy speeches, and they were criticized. What was your reaction to 
that? Damned if you do and damned if you don't?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah. A bit of the damned if you do and damned if you don't. But mostly 
knowing from an internal compass that there is a path that you travel to 
achieve a goal. It's the difference between a marathon runner and a sprinter . 
. . . I raised the money. That was the first thing that I did, because you can 
have the best candidacy and the best message and if you don't have the money to 
get you through the tough times and to buy the media and to build the 
reputation -- I am sorry, the way it is today, you don't win . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't want to be a candidate for governor who was ill-informed, so I took 
the time to do my due diligence. And in pulling together that information and 
pulling together those issues and weighing them in the context of my vision for 
California, the agenda for California began to emerge for me. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were rolled out in incredibly boring speeches. But life isn't 
perfect, you know. They were hard to give, because I thought that they were 
really boring. That's one of the reasons I gave them so fast . . . . I did that 
and I feel very good about it. Because I go back and I read those speeches now, 
and they're very solid. And they fit together with the continuum of values that 
I think I bring to this race and will bring to the office of governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What role does your husband have in your campaign and what role would he 
play in a Brown Administration?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, he's been asking my mother. My mother would say, "Well, Van, here's 
what I think you should be called: First Mate -- First Mate." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, in the campaign, there is no one who is more supportive than Van Gordon 
Sauter. And we differ on lots of political issues. So I'm much better in any 
debate as a consequence of arguing with him, the issues. But he is like a 
ballast of strength and support. And he's been through his own campaigns, as it 
were, in life -- and so there is a kind of camaraderie that we share. He's just 
remarkably supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 What role would he play? He has a job of his own that is important to him. But 
I think he would be an asset -- is an asset, in terms of any role that I would 
want him to play in selling the state of California, marketing the state of 
California, providing whatever leadership in whatever area. It's kind of 
uncharted. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there any silver bullets out there as solutions to California's 
problems ? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think that there are a lot of silver bullets. The only silver 
bullet there might be is the recognition that we can't go back to what we were. 
The acceptance of a new economy, a new California, a new opportunity: That is a 
silver bullet. That's where I think leadership is important. Governors don't 
solve problems. People solve problems. What governors do is they identify a 
strategy that has a logic to it, and value to it, and then they identify 
opportunities and empower people to take advantage of those opportunities. You 
put things together and things begin to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you ever think about how you would like California to be at the end of 
the second term of a Kathleen Brown governorship?  
</P>
<P>
 A: A million new jobs -- that's at the end of the first term. I do think about 
it. It is very definitely a vision of a California that believes in itself 
again, that has kind of -- not a swagger -- but a lift to the step, because 
you're from California. That, I want to be able to see again in the people of 
this state. I want to see us be a leader again. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I would like to see, in sort of concrete terms, I would like to see 
the Alameda Corridor done. That is something concrete. I think it is important 
not just to have ideas, not just to have notions be a part of one's legacy, but 
I am firmly in the belief that the building of things becomes a measure of the 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd love to see some aspect of the Los Angeles River revitalized. We just came 
from San Jose, where we walked yesterday morning, and what they've done with 
the Guadalupe River -- you see what it brings to the sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to see a university of a different kind. Not another UC, but a 
Ft. Ord model, the conversion of a major military base -- CSU and UC and the 
community colleges working together collaboratively. Let's have it be a model. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to see every classroom in every school wired for the 21st-Century 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other things that are really important to me. Don't know how to do it yet, 
but many pieces of it are there. Some kind of state commitment to nurturing and 
developing a mentorship program for youth at risk. It's not the state throwing 
money, because all these programs are out there. It's more people being 
committed to other people . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Along with that, teen pregnancy is an issue that is both the heart and soul of 
the welfare problem, the poverty problems, the family problems we have today. 
</P>
<P>
 I was nearly a teen-age mom. It was four days after my 20th birthday that I 
had my first child. And I had lots of support. And yet it was the loneliest, 
scariest, most terrifying experience of my life. I was 20 years old, and I had 
two years of college, and I had graduated from high school and I was married -- 
and had a good marriage and a good family. And it was just absolutely 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think of these children -- at age 13 and 14 and 15 and 16 -- having 
kids. It's wrong. And as governor, I want to be able to talk about that and 
want to be able to do something about that . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I think I can speak to that issue with a sense of purpose and connectedness 
that might make a little difference.*

PACIFIC PARAMETERS: A PUNISHING TIME IN ASIA... SIZING UP RICHARD NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sampling of commentary from around the Pacific Rim:  
</P>
<P>
 * New Zealand "I wonder how many New Zealanders wouldn't willingly trade the 
dubious "freedoms" of gum chewing, the endless diet of sex and violence in our 
media and the near certainty that we'll be the victim of crime over the next 12 
months, for the safety, security and prosperity of a state like Singapore." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Letter to the Evening Post, reacting to an editorial condemning the caning 
punishment of U.S. citizen Michael Fay. " 'Punishment' is at the heart of the 
difficulties the U.S. is having with Asia. The offense too often appears to be 
as much defying Uncle Sam as it is pursuing questionable domestic practices." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Editorial in the Herald, Auckland. * Hong Kong "By imposing these strict 
laws and fines, the Singapore government has given me freedom , a freedom that 
I cannot find in many places around the world. My parents never ask where I'm 
going or what time I'll be back, because they know that in Singapore there is 
no need to worry about my safety. The most precious freedom is the freedom of 
the mind and I enjoy such freedom thanks to my government." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Letter to the South China Morning Post from a Singaporean youth, regarding 
the Michael Fay caning. "When considering the legacy of President Richard 
Nixon, it is useful to remember the lines from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, 
"The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their 
bones." In Mr. Nixon's case, that might appear not to be true. The villain of 
Watergate in his later years succeeded in erasing many of the memories of his 
own wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- South China Morning Post editorial. "The Sino-American relationship is 
entering the post-most-favored-nation phase even as the Middle Kingdom is 
gearing up for the post-Deng Xiaoping era.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States, however, has yet to display the kind of leadership and 
diplomacy that would anchor bilateral ties on something more than mere 
Machiavellian calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Willy Wo-Lap Lam in the South China Morning Post. "In international terms, 
Watergate would, given the space of time and reflection, turn out to be only a 
footnote in history. Richard Milhous Nixon, by contrast, will be remembered as 
one of the great statesmen of this century." -- Editorial in the Straits Times.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW / THE GOVERNOR'S RACE; JOHN GARAMENDI; A 
CENTRAL-CASTING CANDIDATE FACING AN UPHILL BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the dog days of the campaign for governor, the candidate sitting down to 
answer questions in the buzzing lobby of a downtown Los Angeles hotel is 
hurting, literally and politically. Several days before, Insurance Commission 
er John Garamendi was fixing lights hung in a tree at his Northern California 
ranch when a branch broke. In the fall, Garamendi broke the smaller bone in his 
lower right leg, and the resulting ache causes a visible wince. 
</P>
<P>
 More important to his long-term prospects, Garamendi is still running behind 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown in their bid for the Democratic nomination for 
governor, and that has left him in a painful uphill struggle to persuade 
Californians that he would be the best to carry the party's standard this fall 
against incumbent Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has long been known as an iconoclast in the clubby world of 
Sacramento; he proudly considers himself an outsider and loner, a man who 
spurned the capital's nightly rounds of fund raisers and lobbyist parties. But 
he is also a man with a streak of righteous ambition that has often rubbed his 
colleagues the wrong way -- and the pay-back has come in this race as Brown has 
been crowned the Establishment candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In any other political year perhaps, Garamendi would be a central-casting 
vision of a candidate for governor. A rangy, handsome man, he moved from 
college stardom on the UC Berkeley football team to an idealist's job with the 
Peace Corps in Ethiopia in the 1960s. He came home with his wife, Patricia, and 
started a family and, soon after, a political career. After a short time in the 
Assembly, he moved up to the state Senate. Not satisfied there, he sought the 
governorship in 1982 and the state controller's slot in 1986. Both tries were 
unsuccessful, and he remained in the Senate until 1990, when he finally won 
statewide office as California's first-elected insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he likes to present himself as simple -- "I mean what I say and I say 
what I mean," he frequently boasts -- Garamendi is complex, and all sides of 
his personality were on display. Capable of detailing the minutia of 
governance, he also reflected his vision of California. The product of a rich 
ranching family, a man for whom almost everything, save statewide campaigns, 
has gone right, Garamendi is, by turns, engaging, caustic, scornful and droll. 
Most of all, he seems increasingly fed up with the Democratic front-runner, 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've been in Sacramento as a legislator or government official for 
roughly 20 years. You've run for statewide office three times. Yet, you are 
positioning yourself as the outsider. Do people see you as someone who is part 
of the system?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Well, I don't think the answer is known. But what is known is that I 
am the outsider. The years that I was in the Legislature, I never became one of 
the good old boys. When my work was done, I didn't go down to the bars, or 
schmooze with the lobbyists. I went home, raised a family -- been doing it for 
20 years -- and in the process never became an insider. I've also been very 
impatient with the pace of change in the Legislature and pushed the envelope of 
change to the point where it upset many of my colleagues. But that's just the 
way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Indeed, you became known as somewhat of an ambitious loner who wasn't part 
of the club. Is that a detriment now when you've come to run for governor?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We'll find out. I don't think it's ambitious after 20 years to run for 
governor . . . . I would suggest that Kathleen Brown, after 3 1/2 years in 
government, is the ambitious one. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As you alluded to, you're up against a woman who has 3 1/2 years of state 
elective experience, yet millions of dollars in the bank and sort of media 
cache --  
</P>
<P>
 A: Who told the New York Times that if her name wasn't Brown, she wouldn't be 
running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you resent that it's come to this state of affairs in the governor's 
race?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not a matter of resentment. Californians, I believe, will understand 
on Election Day that this is not a job that you inherit. This is a job you have 
to work for and earn. This is the most important job in this state for the 
future well-being of our children and ourselves, our economy and our 
environment. And that simply saying that your father was governor, your brother 
was governor and, therefore, I should be governor is not sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think of her as a person, as a candidate, as a potential 
governor?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Pauses) You have another question? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is that particularly touchy? I don't understand.  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not for me to evaluate Kathleen Brown. It's for the voters to evaluate 
the fact that, after 3 1/2 years in government, she's running for governor. 
And, in fact, she began running for governor the day she was elected treasurer. 
What has she done? What has she accomplished? What has prepared her to govern 
32 million people? What are her life experiences? What is her knowledge? 
</P>
<P>
 Those are questions that I believe voters will be asking as they go to the 
voting booth, and I think that in each of those questions, they'll be comparing 
my experience and me in every one of those questions with Kathleen Brown. And 
I'll benefit from that comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have concentrated much time, often to the consternation of your cam 
paign manager, on workdays -- working across California with ordinary 
Californians. Could some of that time have been better spent raising the kind 
of money that you might need in the crunch of the last couple of weeks of the 
campaign?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Of course! Of course this campaign would be better off if I sat in a room 
and dialed for dollars, if I indulged in the normal game of politics, of 
raising bucks and promising my life and promising the future of California to 
some interest group . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There's something insidiously wrong with the campaign processes in California, 
when you and every other press person in this state says my campaign is dead in 
the water because I don't have money. Never mind that I may have a great idea. 
Never mind that I or somebody else might be a great leader. But that fact that 
we don't have money says we're not qualified to be governor of California? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about some issues. The state budget is the primary 
responsibility of the governor, and we're looking this year at a probable 
$5-billion deficit unless the federal government comes up with more money than 
is expected for the payment of immigration services. There has not been much 
talk of it in specific terms. Why is that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Because -- I'll give you the answer and then I'll tell you what could be 
done. The answer is that there is nothing any of us could do about this year's 
budget except for Pete Wilson. And the issues that we can do something about go 
beyond the budget. Now the next question normally asked of me, at this point, 
is what would you do? Since you want to be governor, what would you do? 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, if I became governor today . . . . I would call for major reform, 
immediately, of several fundamental systems in the state of California. The 
Legislature would be asked to work overtime between now and July 1 to do the 
following: Institute in California a universal health-care system so we can 
contain the cost of health care. If you don't contain the cost of health care, 
the California state budget, the L.A. County budget, the Orange County budget, 
San Francisco and Alameda budgets, Fresno budget and San Diego County budgets 
are in the tank. Cannot deal with them now or in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Secondly, we would immediately begin construction of boot camps, taking 
nonviolent offenders out of the prison system into the boot-camp system. And 
I'd expect those boot camps to be up and operating by Sept. 1 of this year. And 
we would begin to move people from the expensive prison environment into a 
working environment and disciplined environment of a boot camp, which is about 
half as expensive, so that we can save big-time bucks in the prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any estimate as to what proportion of the prison system could be 
accommodated?  
</P>
<P>
 A: A whole lot more than Wilson presently has -- which is zero. And they 
wouldn't be fancy. And if the Inmate Bill of Rights wasn't repealed on the day 
I take office, it would be repealed the next day. So that we can get about the 
business of doing those things. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirdly, I'd have the Legislature create a 24-hour care system that would be 
integrated into the health-care system so that I could save $5.5 billion in 
worker's comp and auto insurance . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We would move that money into the vitally needed programs of California. 
Specifically education -- $1 billion to hire 20,000 teachers. Another billion 
dollars into policing, to hire 20,000 police. Now, the remaining money? I would 
ask the people of California: Do you want to build a modern transportation 
system? If so, let's take a billion, maybe $2 billion of the remaining $3.5 
billion in savings, and we'll build a massive transportation system here in the 
state of California . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Of that $5.5 billion, a lot would be private savings -- people not having 
to pay their auto insurance or into worker's comp. How would you get that money 
out of their hands? Are you essentially talking about a tax increase?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Wouldn't you love to write that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It has to go out of one pocket before it goes into the other, doesn't it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are a lot of different ways to bring that money into those programs 
that need it. We would explore that with the Legislature. We would put the 
issue to Californians: Would you rather pay the insurance company or would you 
rather pay the school? Would you rather have the money for police or do you 
want to send the money to State Farm? -- your choice. Which way do you want to 
go here? . . . Let us understand that the present workers' compensation system 
and the auto-insurance system is a tax. It is a quasi-tax. It is mandated by 
the government that people buy this product. If that isn't a tax, I don't know 
what is. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's move on to crime. That's also much discussed in this race. The 
perception is that Democrats have taken on what seemed the coloration of 
Republicans on this issue, coming on harder than in the past.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have always been tough on crime. I have a 20-year record of having voted 
for and supported and advocated tough-on-crime measures. This is not a new 
position for me suitable for this campaign. It is rather a long-held conviction 
that I've had about how to deal with crime in this society. And I've always 
seen this issue as a constellation of problems. Punishment, to be sure, and 
therefore "three strikes and you're out" for violent felons, absolutely. The 
death penalty -- I believe in it and support it. Kathleen Brown does not 
believe in it -- major policy difference. What kind of judges will she appoint? 
What kind of bills will she sign or veto? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You did, some years back, support the Inmate Bill of Rights.  
</P>
<P>
 A: 1975 -- before Rose Bird, Jerry Brown's judge, expanded it to the point of 
being ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned three strikes. Will you vote for the three-strikes initiative 
that's on the ballot in November?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You favor a move that would be more restrictive in terms of the types of 
crimes --  
</P>
<P>
 A: I said very clearly, for violent felons "three strikes and you're out." You 
are locked away, you are out of here, George, goodby. We'll see you in a coffin 
the day you leave jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: S o , to be explicit, your problem with the current three-strikes 
legislation is?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Badly written . . . . In the legislation today, there are felonies that are 
not violent at all that could be included. That's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you make of the state now? What's the state of the state?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The state's at a crossroads. There is wonderful, beautiful potential in 
California to be the leading economy in the world. We are creating a fabulous 
mix of cultures here with great excitement in art and science and music. 
</P>
<P>
 There is enormous energy with the people of California, there is a passionate 
determination with the families of California to survive and prosper. There is 
a great spirit of entrepreneurial activity. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, as we stand at that crossroads, there is awesome energy to 
destroy. There is the lack of trust in the institutions of the state, both 
public and private, that denies us the ability to use those institutions as 
tools in our progress. And there is an emotion -- it's a, I can't find the word 
-- in any case, there's an impatience in Californians that all too often turns 
to distrust and violence, that can, and we could -- we will take one or the 
other of these two paths. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of the governor of the state of California is to cause Californians to 
take the positive path -- and we can. And if we do, this is going to be a 
fabulous place.*

FICTITIOUS MEMORIES?; TIGHTER REGULATION IS NEEDED IN PSYCHOTHERAPY COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The real message sent by a jury in Napa goes well beyond the $500,000 in 
damages it ordered two psychotherapists to pay Gary Ramona. The verdict was a 
ringing call for leaders of the mental health community to police their 
professions better, and for state legislatures nationally to enact new laws to 
bring more verifiability and more forensic science to the use of psychological 
evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The case marked the first time that a non-patient was allowed to sue a 
therapist for monetary damages suffered incidentally as a result of treatment 
of another person. Ramona, once a $400,000-a-year winery executive, charged 
that the two therapists had elicited from his adult daughter false memories of 
his raping her as a child. After she sued him, he lost his job, his home and 
his marriage. The defendants were a psychiatrist and a marriage and family 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is perhaps the most dramatic among a rising number of painful family 
confrontations stirred by recovered-memory techniques. Most often, the patient 
is a woman who enters treatment for bulimia or other psychological disorder. 
The therapist -- employing various aggressive memory-enhancement techniques 
such as hypnosis, the drug sodium amytal, dream analysis and even body massages 
-- often recovers "repressed" memories of childhood abuses, sexual and 
otherwise, some in great and lurid detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, memories of childhood incest can be repressed, and thousands of 
people have been helped by such therapy to regain psychological balance. And 
undoubtedly sexual abuse of children is real and widespread. But evidence grows 
that many of these memories are, in effect, implanted by therapists' 
suggestions. They are wreaking considerable damage on families, as the jury in 
Napa seemed to have agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 The False Memory Syndrome Foundation in Philadelphia claims that 12,000 
families have been disrupted by this problem. That number is difficult to 
verify, but clearly the psychotherapeutic community must confront the issue. In 
some parts of the country, public crime victims' funds are going to these 
"victims," leaving little for true victims. 
</P>
<P>
 California alone has 75,000 licensed psychotherapists, including 
psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, family counselors, social 
workers and others, not to mention all manner of unlicensed free-lancers. Few 
of them engage in recovered-memory methods. But they operate largely in 
privacy, without the supervision and peer review common in other professions. 
It is time for the California Psychological Assn., national groups, state 
licensing boards and other authorities to take a stronger hand in monitoring 
these practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious reform is to require therapists to use the same informed 
consent asked by doctors when they perform routine surgery, spelling out the 
risks and alternative therapies. The mental health professions are notoriously 
underregulated; state licensing boards are largely empty shells that discipline 
only the most egregious offenders and do little to enforce minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, though, the time has come for more concerted legal efforts to 
distinguish real from false memories. A model for national adoption comes from 
the Minnesota State Board of Psychology. It requires that any oral testimony or 
written reports by therapists include descriptions of the limitations of the 
techniques used and any reservations about their reliability and validity. In 
addition, states must re-examine the recent trend toward extending the statute 
of limitations on bringing charges of childhood sexual abuse from the date of 
alleged crime to the date of recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Ramona suit say it is part of a backlash against recent legal 
gains made by women in punishing men who rape and abuse women as a means of 
domination. We agree that sexual abuse is a serious matter that deserves stern 
punishment by the courts. But both the courts and therapists must be careful 
not to find it where it does not exist, nor to ruin families on the basis of 
unproven and unreliable evidence.

FEAR OF GUN CRIME: DEEPER THAN ANY SET OF STATISTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People feel threatened by crime these days because their instincts and 
experiences tell them they are not safe. And they are not calmed by recent 
crime statistics that suggest a 3% drop in serious crimes and a 1% drop in 
violent crimes. They just do not believe the figures; they believe their 
instincts. They believe something has gone wrong with America: There is too 
much serious, and violent, crime. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why liberals and conservatives, to some extent, are coming together on 
the crime issue. The liberals emphasize crime prevention; the conservatives 
emphasize punishment. But more and more wise members of each camp are agreeing 
to agree that America needs more of both. As a result gun control is no longer 
simply the cause of liberals alone. Even some conservatives recognize that the 
absolute freedom to possess guns is no more sensible than the absolute freedom 
to shout "Fire!" in a crowded theater. They recognize that no responsible 
society would require licensing and testing for automobile operation but 
nothing comparable for gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Congress, though well policed by the National Rifle Assn. and 
traditionally resistant to gun-control measures, passed the Brady bill last 
year and looks to be close to enacting a historic federal ban on 19 varieties 
of semiautomatic assault weapons. And in the next week or so the House, led by 
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), will make a run at limiting handgun sales. 
Schumer's efforts fully deserve support.  
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, when The Times published the first in a series of editorials 
spelling out a comprehensive plan for severely limiting gun possession, it 
received an avalanche of letters in response -- more mail over a single 
editorial than in anyone's recent memory. Even more tellingly, only half of the 
letter writers opposed our stand, suggesting that the organized letter campaign 
that inevitably stalks any gun-control proposal was at least equaled by the 
unorganized voices of ordinary, concerned readers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the tide toward effective gun control won't calm down soon. Gun control is 
increasingly seen not as some fuzzy, do-good Utopian vision but as a practical 
anti-crime step. Sure, there are many ways to kill the guy next to you, but you 
have to hand it to a gun: It surely does the job. Yes, people -- not guns on 
their own -- kill people. But guns multiply the carnage, make the violence 
easier, swifter, more deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 If further proof were necessary, the Justice Department reported last Sunday 
that U.S. handgun crime was 50% higher last year than the average of the five 
previous years; handguns were involved in 980,7000 violent crimes and 917,500 
nonfatal ones. Tragically, black males between 16 and 19 were the most likely 
targets of handgun crimes. And last year, compared to the previous five years, 
handgun homicides increased 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt The Times' call for a near-comprehensive ban on guns, with special 
procedures available for collectors, hunters, target practice aficionados and 
the like, struck some readers as controversial, maybe even far out. But with 
each new violent month, this approach, or something like it, will seem a lot 
less far out. Still, many readers wonder: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Whether Gun-Control Advocates Think That Gun Control Might Prove to Be Some 
Kind of Cure-All. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the case at all. Crime is a complex problem -- with roots in the 
social and economic system. Even if every gun were removed from our society, we 
would still have crime. But the presence of all these guns -- heck, kids take 
them from the home and carry them to school nowadays -- adds to crime. With 
firearms under tighter control, crime would not disappear but it would be less 
violent. And gun accidents -- a major problem -- would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Whether Gun-Control Advocates Understand That Even Under Gun Control, the 
Bad Guys Would Have Guns. 
</P>
<P>
 What we propose is not some snap new legislation that would magnetically suck 
guns away from the gangs, the street, the home overnight. It is a call to 
America to change a long-established direction. A polyglot nation of 250 
million people simply cannot handle all these guns on the streets; and the 
police simply are swamped by the gun-driven crime problem (which is why so many 
law enforcement groups now favor gun control). Yes, some bad guys would manage 
to get guns under comprehensive gun control. But an America that is intolerant 
of guns -- like most other civilized nations in Europe and Asia -- would at 
least make it a whole lot harder for anyone to be carrying a gun on the street, 
to work or to school. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Whether Gun-Control Types Respect the Second Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 They do, but the Second Amendment is not an absolute license to carry a gun. 
The amendment was designed to allow states to maintain their own militias, not 
to allow individuals to build their own private arsenals. The amendment was 
aimed at balancing the military power of the federal government. At the time, 
people first and foremost feared the unchecked power of a cruel central 
government -- basically the European experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, since 1939 no federal court has found gun-control laws 
to be in violation of the Second Amendment. Indeed, the proposition that this 
amendment does not guarantee individuals a right to keep and bear arms for 
private, non-military purposes is among the more firmly established 
propositions in U.S. constitutional law.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, citizens do have rights. But, as the latest report on handgun violence 
shows, America has not been acting responsibly with guns. That absolutely must 
change.

BRADLEY ON BOYARSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Bill Boyarsky's April 27 column repeated an allegation, purportedly made to 
his superiors by Robert Inouye, a former employee of the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement to Boyarsky was that contracts were steered by staff to a friend 
of Mayor Tom Bradley.No supportive evidence or supportive statement was ever 
produced. It seems to me that such a statement should be reinforced by at least 
one piece of credible support before publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I didn't have any idea what this reference to me was all about, and I 
couldn't find any explanation from Inouye, who I called, or from an exhaustive 
search of court records or the files of the Transportation Commission, I called 
Boyarsky to find out if he had any relevant evidence to support this blatantly 
false statement. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sensitive to this kind of character assassination by speculation or 
innuendo. I suffered in silence for more than two years while hundreds of local 
and federal investigators conducted exhaustive investigations, fueled solely by 
speculations by the press and others. In the end, all these investigators 
reported that they did not find any evidence to justify any action whatsoever 
-- a point which I maintained throughout the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 My point then, and now, is that a reporter who learned the basic elements of 
ethical principles and fairness in any school of journalism owes it to these 
principles to find some independent evidence or supportive statement before 
printing an allegation such as appeared in Boyarsky's column.

MAYOR RIORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "GOP Activists Disillusioned With Riordan" (May 16) gives too much credence 
to a few right-wing kooks with access to a button-making machine. Republicans 
know that the election of Mayor Richard Riordan is the best thing to happen to 
Los Angeles since they removed the diamond lane! 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's victory, along with Rudy Giuliani's in New York City, has breathed 
life back into campaigns in urban areas for our Grand Old Party. For 
Republicans to concede urban America to the Democrats would be suicide for our 
party -- yet it is a strategy that some narrow-minded Neanderthals seem bent on 
pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
 When right-wing extremist Celeste Grieg criticizes Riordan (along with other 
Republicans she disagrees with) for failing to meet her self-anointed litmus 
test, doesn't Grieg truly become the one who is "Republican in Name Only"? 
</P>
<P>
 TED GREEN 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * GOP activist Grieg, who claims Mayor Riordan is a Republican in name only, 
is quoted as saying, "Either you are a Republican or a Democrat, but you can't 
be in between." Why not?

with the elected officials from their own party. Please recall the hostility 
toward Gov. Pete Wilson and how they attacked President Bush before they 
realized he was going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one day they will realize, as I did, that many of their ideas just do 
not work. Life is hard work; it's time for these people to get a grip on 
reality.

SBA QUAKE LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I own a small medical supply business in Chatsworth. It was severely damaged 
by the Northridge earthquake in January. In fact, we lost almost two-thirds of 
our inventory.We also were forced to move due to damage to our rented 
warehouse. I applied to the SBA immediately for an SBA disaster loan. All 
paperwork was taken by hand instead of mailing it because I was informed that 
this would expedite the process. I received loan approval at the beginning of 
April and was told the paperwork was right behind. I get a different story on 
every bi-weekly call I give the SBA. The latest story is six to eight weeks 
more, the middle of July. Six months from the earthquake! 
</P>
<P>
 We have been hanging on with the help of the manufacturers that we buy from, 
but they are reaching a point where they can no longer continue to fill our 
orders. I am not asking for a grant or a free ride, only a loan that I will pay 
back in full. By the time we receive the loan, we could be out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand the large amount of applications to the SBA has made the process 
longer, but I need help immediately and have no one to turn to. I am sure that 
I am not the only small business in this situation. I am begging the SBA to 
please try to expedite the disaster loans to small business owners before it is 
too late.

PERSPECTIVE ON TRADE; HEADING THE WRONG WAY ON CHINA; A U.S. PROPOSAL TO TARGET 
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES WOULD HURT THE HUMAN-RIGHTS CAUSE AND SOCIAL-RIGHTS 
GAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM H. SIMON, William H. Simon is a professor of law at Stanford Law 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has concluded rightly that the cost to America of 
adhering to its announced human-rights policy toward China is too high. 
However, there is now a danger that the Administration will try to save face by 
adopting measures that spare China's American trading partners but intensify 
the previous policy's perverse effects within China. 
</P>
<P>
 Categorically denying most-favored-nation trade status to China as a means of 
inducing human-rights reform was a bad idea. Selectively imposing trade 
sanctions on state-owned enterprises -- the position to which most sanction 
proponents have retreated -- is a worse one. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that America's human-rights policies focus on the political 
rights that are threatened by a powerful state, while ignoring the social 
rights that depend on an effective state. A strategy to punish China by 
undermining its sources of public revenue would be much more likely to 
undermine social rights than to strengthen political rights. 
</P>
<P>
 America tends to evaluate China's human-rights performance on a very narrow 
range of values -- preeminently, political speech and secondarily, freedom of 
organization and humane treatment of prisoners. We have rightly rejected the 
argument of Chinese leaders that such values are a Western imposition alien to 
their culture. Even putting aside the general defects of such "cultural 
relativism," liberal and humanitarian values have strong bases in Chinese 
culture and widespread domestic support. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chinese leaders fault America more plausibly for ignoring other areas of 
human rights no less important to the freedom and welfare of their people in 
which China's relative performance has been good. Because of achievements in 
health, nutrition and housing, life expectancy in China is years longer and 
infant mortality is about half the rate of such countries as India and Brazil. 
And the educational system has achieved high rates of literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese leaders are bewildered by America's obsession with their treatment of 
prison labor (which for the most part differs little from comparable practices 
here), when America seems so indifferent to the abuse of free labor through 
horrendous working conditions in countries such as Mexico whose MFN status has 
been unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, China's considerable achievements in social rights are now 
threatened by the very developments that sanctions proponents applaud. The 
process of economic liberalization has produced dramatic benefits, but it has 
also left the state in a fiscal crisis that impairs its ability to maintain the 
social safety net. What was once a model system of health care is in disarray. 
Access to education has become more difficult for many. Inflation has priced 
the majority out of the housing market in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most disturbing, sweatshop working conditions are proliferating, 
especially in the coastal provinces where foreign investment has been zealously 
courted. The reports of worker mistreatment in the new capitalist enterprises 
rival the ugliest stories of prison labor abuse and include unhealthy 
conditions, long hours, humiliating discipline and even beatings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 200 workers died in three recent factory fires in the coastal areas. In 
one reminiscent of the notorious Triangle Shirtwaist fire in New York in 1911, 
workers were trapped by doors the employer had locked to prevent them from 
taking unauthorized breaks. Laws regarding minimum wages, health and safety and 
union organizing rights are widely unenforced. At the end of 1992, only 1% of 
foreign enterprises complied with Chinese laws requiring that workers have a 
union to represent them. 
</P>
<P>
 The failures to maintain the social safety net and to enforce workers' right 
to humane treatment are both related to the fiscal weakness of the state. The 
loosening of control over the economy, and particularly the state enterprises, 
has deprived the government of a large portion of the revenues on which it 
previously relied and has made it dependent on foreign investors, including 
those who will not accept public regulation of its employment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In these circumstances, the currently proposed sanctions targeted on state 
enterprises seem perverse. They would favor private enterprises without regard 
to their standards of worker treatment. If successful, they would hurt public 
enterprises (which at least in the rural industrial sector include some of the 
most dynamic and innovative firms in the economy), and they would worsen the 
fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent agonies of Russia ought to remind us that a weak state can be as 
dangerous to human rights as a strong state. Paralyzed by fiscal crisis and 
political stalemate, the Russian government is unable to provide basic police 
protection of personal security, much less of economic and social welfare. 
Since selective sanctions amount to an indiscriminate attack on all the 
activities of the Chinese state, they are not a sound way to advance human 
rights.

COLUMN LEFT / JONATHAN FREEDMAN; A DEAL THAT EVEN A GNAT CAN APPLAUD; 
DEVELOPERS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS HATCH A COMPROMISE FOR SAVING ENDANGERED SPECIES 
AND JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman is a writer in San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court's decision to remove the California gnatcatcher from the 
endangered species list once again puts Southern California's fragile coastal 
sage habitat at risk. Developers are poised to unleash herds of bulldozers, the 
Feds to step in with tougher regulation. Already, Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt is appealing the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold on a minute. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Southern California, reeling from natural disasters and record unemployment, 
can ill afford an eco-civil war that could make the Pacific Northwest's fight 
over the spotted owl look like a schoolyard skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a better way, now in the hatching stage in San Diego County. There, 
the Multiple-Habitat, Multiple-Species Conservation Program has joined 
landowners, environmentalists, builders and government agencies in an effort to 
protect rare species and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego has the painful distinction of being home to 130 species, ranging 
from the celebrated California least tern to the modest thorn mint, that are 
candidates for the endangered list. That's more imperiled breeds than any other 
region in the lower 48 states. Meanwhile, development is stymied by recession, 
and the county's bruised economy has lost 60,000 jobs. Within this disaster 
zone, enemies have found common ground in the struggle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiated by the 1991 California Natural Community Conservation Planning Act, 
San Diego's three-year, $3-million program has identified 93 threatened species 
holding on for survival in 565,917 acres of land patchworked across 12 
jurisdictions. Its ambitious goal is to preserve tens of thousands of those 
acres and dozens of resident species. By defining permanent areas of protection 
and clear areas for development, it also seeks to restore and protect the 
economic vitality of the region, and to bring back thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an evolutionary step forward from the single-species preservation 
efforts -- and court battles. Success here could be a model for the whole 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's interlocking principles are simple: You can't protect a single 
species in isolation; you also have to protect the web of animal and plant life 
in which it lives. You can't save a natural habitat that crosses jurisdictional 
boundaries without bringing all government agencies -- city, county, regional 
-- to the bargaining table. And to accomplish all this, you have to persuade 
avowed enemies that their survival depends on one another. 
</P>
<P>
 A working group of about 30 landowners, environmentalists, bureaucrats and 
politicians began meeting three years ago. That was before the gnatcatcher -- a 
small bird with a call like a mewing kitten -- was even on the endangered 
species list. The plan they came up with is unique: Set aside contiguous swaths 
of habitat in which many species will be protected, instead of trying to save 
every creature everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 This trade-off poses risks and sacrifices on all sides: Environmentalists must 
give up the romance of waging a guerrilla war, species by species, habitat by 
habitat, until developers are pushed into the sea. Developers must give up half 
of their land -- 35,000 acres of prime real estate valued at $700 million. 
State and federal agencies must be willing to turn over thousands of acres of 
parkland. Finally, local elected officials must find the courage to ask 
taxpayers for millions of dollars to acquire private lands for preservation.  
</P>
<P>
 The scope of the proposal is immense. Between 85,000 and 167,000 acres of 
terrain would become a connected system of habitat preserves, from the Pacific 
to the edge of the Laguna Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, it's no surprise that the process often bogged down. 
But it was revived every time.  
</P>
<P>
 When the gnatcatcher was abruptly "delisted" on May 2, partisans on all sides 
held their breath wondering whether the fragile ecosystem of compromise could 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the consensus is holding together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a sterling opportunity to show good faith," says developer Jim Whalen 
of the Alliance for Habitat Conservation, a group of builders who collectively 
own 70,000 acres. In a letter to Babbitt, the alliance pleaded for restraint in 
defending the gnatcatcher, so that the multispecies conservation program can be 
completed.  
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists welcome the opportunity to move from planning to 
implementation. "This is a watershed moment," says Michael Beck, San Diego 
director of the Endangered Habitats League. 
</P>
<P>
 The multispecies, multihabitat approach is a practical, feasible alternative 
to waging case-by-case battles in court during which vulnerable creatures and 
jobs are lost. 
</P>
<P>
 If developers, environmentalists and public agencies can build a habitat for 
compromise, there may still be a home for endangered species in Southern 
California.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S HIDDEN ECONOMIC ENGINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven B. Sample, Steven B. Sample is president of the University of 
Southern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The media here and across the nation are fond of depicting Southern California 
as a region staggering from a series of natural and man-made disasters. One 
result is that few people who live here are aware that most of the elements for 
a renaissance are already in place. And few elements are more important than 
the region's intellectual capital, especially as the new information age 
unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California has 175 accredited colleges and universities attended by 
more than a million students. Generation after generation of professionals, 
scientists, teachers, artists, public officials and business leaders have been 
educated here. This "hidden industry" has attracted billions and billions of 
research dollars, and millions of the world's best and brightest, to the area. 
Their intellectual contributions have sustained industries as diverse as 
aerospace, biotechnology, communications and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these successes, higher education must be strengthened to enable it to 
better position itself for the social and economic challenges ahead. This will 
require a partnership among government, business and higher education. Such 
cooperation will expand our technological base, create jobs and enhance 
existing industries. 
</P>
<P>
 How important is higher education to our economy? 
</P>
<P>
 A quick survey reveals that Southland universities and colleges annually 
generate about $30 billion in regional economic activity and directly support 
more than 120,000 full-time jobs. Interestingly, tourism, which is widely 
touted as an economic pillar in the region, also generates about $30 billion 
annually, directly supporting more than 250,000 full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the city of Los Angeles' largest private employer is a university. Not 
a defense firm, not a movie studio, but the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 USC generates nearly $400 million annually in tuition income, and most of it 
comes from outside Los Angeles. The university attracts more outside money than 
any other private corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other major private employers, USC won't be sold, merged or moved to 
Phoenix. And neither will Caltech, UCLA and UC San Diego, which, together with 
USC, bring in about $700 million annually in federal funding for basic research 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 These four institutions are members of the Assn. of American Universities, the 
56 key institutions that conduct most of the nation's basic research and 
produce most of the nation's researchers. Southern California's AAU 
institutions attract tuition dollars from thousands of students from other 
states and nations. Many of these students stay in Southern California after 
graduation, the most beneficial form of immigration imaginable. And the Asian 
business and government leaders trained here will, in coming years, increase 
the economic and technological ties between Asia and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The universities also attract large sums of philanthropic money. UCLA and USC 
now raise about $100 million annually in private gifts and pledges. And the 
largest private investment in Los Angeles since the riots has been Walter 
Annenberg's $120-million gift to USC, which will strengthen the region's 
competitive advantage in communications. 
</P>
<P>
 It is long past time to recognize that colleges and universities are 
magnificent economic engines and centers for social, technological and cultural 
development. Toward that end, Project California is bringing government and 
business together with universities to make the state a global leader in 
transportation and telecommunications technologies. And at the Southern 
California Earthquake Center, six universities have joined with USC to develop 
the means to understand and predict earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hollywood, Disneyland and beaches will always be keys parts of its 
image, it will be universities and colleges that will keep Southern California 
a forward-thinking region.

COUNTY REPORT / REBUILDING THE ECONOMY; BUSINESSES ADAPTING TO A NEW CLIMATE;

 Three years ago, with defense dollars drying up and the aerospace industry in 
full sputter, APS Systems traded its swords for plowshares to avoid being 
ground up by a peacetime economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same warehouse where it had helped tune the nation's military engine, 
the Oxnard aerospace firm began building electric buses. While a neighboring 
defense contractor shut its doors, APS was busy designing the first 
battery-powered school bus in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Ventura County was losing about one of every five of its 
defense-related jobs over the past four years, the changes at APS helped put 
engineers, machinists and welders to work. 
</P>
<P>
 And the same phenomenon of change that gave new life to companies throughout 
the county was also working at the personal level -- as thousands of residents 
adjusted to the troubled economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 For Newbury Park resident John Thatcher, change meant finding a new career. 
Thatcher will be unemployed in August, when the Canoga Park aerospace company 
that he joined straight out of high school moves out of state. But, as others, 
Thatcher is changing with the times, preparing to transfer his skills to the 
computer industry or another evolving field. 
</P>
<P>
 "With my age and where I am in life, they're not jamming many people into the 
job market," said Thatcher, 51. "You learn to adapt and you just pray that the 
economy is going to take an upshot." 
</P>
<P>
 That might, in fact, be happening. After sliding headlong into the depths of 
recession, Ventura County's economy is rebuilding and showing signs of 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 There are over 12,000 more county residents working today than there were a 
year ago. Housing sales are climbing, while unemployment continues to dip. 
Commercial buildings are filling, with vacancy rates plunging to some of the 
lowest levels since before the great slump of the early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Building activity is on the rise, as real estate speculators look into the 
future and for the first time in years don't cringe at what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the classic measurements of economic health. But the local 
economy also can be measured by how it has adapted to the devastation of the 
past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Ventura County's economy is being reinvented. New business 
opportunities are surfacing even as the old ones fold up or move away. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers displaced by the economic downturn are shifting gears, striking out on 
their own or transferring old job skills into new professions. Many companies 
have survived the hard times by overhauling the way they do business, tying 
into expanding technologies and service fields that promise to rebuild the 
economy and lead it into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is growing enthusiasm on the potential for increased traffic at the 
expanding Port of Hueneme, the possible development of a commercial airport at 
Point Mugu Naval Air Station and the proposed construction of a state 
university near Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 So just how far along is the local recovery? 
</P>
<P>
 At a business gathering last month hosted by the Ventura County Economic 
Development Assn., association board member Bill Simmons summed it up this way: 
"If there was a 12-step process to (economic) recovery, we would be at Step 1: 
We now realize we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Others measure the recovery by how businesses have survived the carnage of 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the business climate is at least beginning to solidify its 
losses," said Mark Schniepp, director of UC Santa Barbara's Economic Forecast 
Project. "It is a turnaround, but it's nothing you should pop champagne bottles 
over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even a slight upturn is a welcome break from the four-year barrage of 
bleak economic news. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the county's unemployment rate has more than doubled, soaring to a 
high of 10.4% before settling at its current rate of 8.4%. Retail sales fell 
15% while the median housing price plummeted $65,000, a 24% decrease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, Ventura County has lost more than 10,000 jobs, 
resulting in a massive restructuring of the county's work places. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two decades, there had been a steady increase in the number of 
firms employing 250 workers or more. But starting in 1991, during the heart of 
the recession, the number of large firms dropped off dramatically while the 
number of firms employing fewer than 50 people increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "A drastic reduction and downsizing is happening," explained Jamshid Damooei, 
an economics professor at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says to me that what we are losing are high-tech wages and that's going to 
have an effect on the purchasing power in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the county's diversified economy has helped it ward off hard times 
better than many of its neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture remains one of the county's strongest industries, even though last 
year's $722-million crop was one of the poorest in years. The Navy remains the 
county's top employer, putting to work nearly 15,000 civilian and uniformed 
personnel at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 And tourist dollars continue to pour into the county, especially in the west 
county cities of Ojai, Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the east county where the most dramatic rise has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 A collection of recession-proof companies has made a home in the Conejo 
Valley, bolstering the east county economy with high-tech jobs and paychecks to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology giant Amgen Inc., the east county is 
poised to become a critical biotechnology center, the equivalent of the Silicon 
Valley to the computer industry, economists and others agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology firm, reported revenue of $364 
million, and profit of $93.5 million, for the first three months of this year. 
That translates to a 17% increase in revenue over the same period last year and 
a 14% increase in profit. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 2,000 employees, Amgen is the county's second-largest private 
employer. And the Thousand Oaks City Council recently endorsed an expansion 
plan that will make room for 6,300 new workers at Amgen's corporate campus over 
the next quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, council members praised Amgen for bringing so many high-paying, 
non-polluting jobs into the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amgen's success has produced other benefits as well. A steady stream of 
smaller high-tech manufacturing plants have moved to the area in recent years. 
Baxter Healthcare Corp. is setting up its first large biotechnology 
manufacturing plant near Amgen's world headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter, which manufactures a protein used to treat patients who suffer from 
the blood disease hemophilia, hopes to have hundreds of employees at the site 
by the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Johan Vandersande, Baxter's vice president of manufacturing, said he knows all 
too well the lure of Ventura County when trying to attract the best-qualified 
workers: Baxter's Los Angeles facility has lost plenty of good engineers to 
Amgen over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people prefer to live in Thousand Oaks than Los Angeles. Can you guess 
why?" he said. "People like the ocean, it's not as crowded and it's a pretty 
safe community." 
</P>
<P>
 Other firms are also spilling over the line from Los Angeles into Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacancy rates for commercial properties dropped in the first three months of 
this year, especially in the east county where many quake-rattled San Fernando 
Valley firms have come seeking refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The east county also leads the way in retail spending, with Moorpark, Simi 
Valley and Thousands Oaks all showing gains over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the auto empire founded by formeS. Ambassador Robert D. Nesen in the 
Thousand Oaks Auto Mall, sales are the best they've been in years. They're so 
good, in fact, that Nesen recently added two new lines -- Rolls-Royce and 
Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nesen Motor Car Co. recorded more than $200 million in sales last 
year, Gary Nesen, now president of the firm, said the economic slump choked 
sales by forcing motorists to hang onto their old cars rather than buy new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it was never a question of if the economy turns for the better, but 
when the economy turns for the better," he said. "I think things have turned to 
the positive. People eventually will have to buy new cars." 
</P>
<P>
 It is that eternal optimism that continues to draw people to Ventura County, 
and keeps them here when the going gets tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sour economy produced the slowest growth rate in decades, 
employment officials say many displaced workers are choosing to stay put and 
hunt for local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace worker Thatcher, the Newbury Park resident who will be unemployed in 
August, declined an invitation to leave the state with his company. He has 
planted deep roots in Ventura County and has no desire to pull them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Jeffries feels the same way. After 32 years in banking, she left her 
job to care for her ailing mother. Now, after five months of unemployment, the 
51-year-old Thousand Oaks resident is ready to get back to work, but not 
anxious to relocate to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, she showed up at the Thousand Oaks office of California 
Job Search looking for help preparing a new resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Peter H. Wolf asked about her job skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "All there is is banking," she explained. "That's all I've done since I've 
been 24 or 25." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolf poked and prodded, asking about management experience and other 
skills to help fill out her resume and make it more attractive to potential 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important that you position yourself for other industries," said 
Wolf, who for 10 years has matched employers with those eager to work. "You 
have to be able to transfer all of those skills because the banking industry 
isn't a great industry right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, few industries have been harder hit than banking. Four years ago, 
leaders of the county's two largest locally owned banks expressed little 
concern about the economic slump that was just starting to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, both banks have incurred severe losses. And only recently have 
they begun to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based Bank of A. Levy last month reported a profit of $1.36 million 
for the first quarter of this year, its first gain in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are poised very well for the future," said Marshall C. Milligan, 
the bank's president and chief executive officer. "As the economy improves, we 
are in position to do a lot of business with existing businesses and new 
customers, and we are eager to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bank recently reported a $114,000 loss for the first 
quarter of 1994, cutting its losses by $1.4 million over the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank reported a loss of $12.1 million last year, contrasted with a profit 
of $685,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Ventura County National Bank's semiannual business survey that reveals 
the strongest evidence of a slow but steady recovery. Nearly 70% of the 603 
businesses that responded to the survey said they believe economic recovery is 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, released earlier this month, revealed strong sales performance and 
job creation among companies with annual sales of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the respondents with more than 100 workers reported increased 
employment last year, and more than 40% predicted they would hire more workers 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a trend that bodes well for commercial real estate, about one-quarter 
of the companies with annual sales of between $5 million and $10 million 
reported they would need to find more office space this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these trends continue, we should begin to see measurable gains in 1994 and 
a healthy recovery under way by 1995," the survey concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses were among those hardest hit by recession, according to the 
survey, and many are still reeling from the effects of four years of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the entrepreneurial spirit lives on. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, Louis Carrizales decided to start his own business after getting 
laid off from Abex Aerospace. The Oxnard company, once the city's largest 
private employer, announced in 1992 that it would shut down, putting more than 
500 employees out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrizales is doing the same type of work Abex had trained him to do, but he's 
now doing it on his own. He has even hired his father, a 33-year Abex employee 
also cut loose last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Ventura, a mother-daughter team recently opened a coffee shop in a busy 
shopping center near Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe College Square is staffed by Ruby Perkins and her daughters, Deborah and 
Diane Claridge. Between them, they have 60 years of restaurant experience. 
</P>
<P>
 They possess no fancy business degrees. They pay themselves minimum wage. And 
they advertise by dragging out a hand-painted sign and setting it by the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this unforgiving economy, the women say they are confident they can 
make their business work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You stick it out and you hang on," explained Deborah Claridge about the 
family's approach to rising above the economic gloom. "There's a lot to say 
about good, old-fashioned hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, no one worked harder than those in the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid- to late-1980s, the industry rode a streak of hot sales and fat 
profits. Then the recession tightened its stranglehold. Housing sales slowed to 
a crawl and new residential construction dropped measurably. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the industry is just starting to dig out from the downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County housing sales rose 18% during the first three months of this 
year compared with the same period last year, the largest quarterly increase 
since the late 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, building activity has started to pick up, with the economy 
adding more than 500 construction jobs since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite strict policies enacted to control explosive growth in Ventura County, 
the issuance of residential building permits countywide jumped by half during 
the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And real estate developers, who track the market the way air traffic 
controllers track jumbo jets, say they are finally regaining confidence in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Winchester Homes proceeded with the fourth phase of a Simi Valley 
subdivision that stalled years ago when the slowdown hit. Immediately, 
drywallers and plumbers and tractor drivers went to work. So did sales 
representatives who show the model homes, and gardeners who tend them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the mood is guarded: Until the developer is certain the market has 
healed, only 15 residences will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been sitting on this for awhile, waiting for the economy to get 
better," said Dick Moses, who heads the construction crew carving up a hillside 
that is circled by hawks and chewed by cattle. "I guess it's looking up." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo-based Pardee Construction Co., the county's biggest housing builder, 
also is throttling forward with projects put on hold because of the 
recession-choked real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going nuts," said Bill Teller, Pardee's project manager for Ventura 
County. "There has been a marked increase in activity since the first quarter 
of this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Teller said he sees the economic slump as a needed correction to allow the 
real value of houses to catch up with their inflated prices after years of 
double-digit increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're watching the market to make sure that what we are seeing are not 
short-term blips," he said. "But we see companies moving in, unemployment going 
down and jobs being created. That makes us optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are industries that will never be the same again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's aerospace industry took the brunt of the economic shakedown, 
hemorrhaging thousands of jobs over the past four years, more than any other 
sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon Co. in Oxnard shut down. So did Northrop Corp. in Newbury Park. 
Defense contracts were their lifeblood, and circulation was cut off when 
military spending was cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned at the closures, many surviving firms learned that they needed to 
change the way they do business to avoid becoming casualties of the Cold War's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo-based California Amplifier Inc., for instance, used to split its 
operations between defense work and commercial manufacturing of amplifiers for 
home satellite television dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1990, anticipating troubled times ahead, the company shifted entirely 
to the faster-growing non-defense field. Sales have jumped more than 300% in 
the past three years and employment has grown from 160 to 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, a Ventura County consortium was the first local group to 
receive a federal grant under the initial phase of President Clinton's defense 
conversion program. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One Corp. in Camarillo, the lead firm in a group that also includes 
Rockwell International of Thousand Oaks, will get $1.9 million to develop small 
battery-like devices that store electric power. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Oxnard, APS Systems has secured contracts of more than $1 million to 
build electric buses. From a warehouse in the shadow of Oxnard Airport, the 
company offers one of the best examples of an economy in the midst of 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers once in danger of losing their jobs now earn a living fashioning 
sheets of metal into a fleet of energy-saving shuttles, the latest in 
developing public transportation technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches are painted in a giant metal hangar built a few years ago when APS 
was building trailers to haul M-1 tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers here need only look out the door to see what might have been. A little 
way down the road, the green glass Abex Aerospace complex stands dark and 
abandoned and choked by weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried for all of us here," said Bob Roberts, the leather-faced 
64-year-old foreman who orchestrates the machine shop at the APS plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we saw the writing on the wall. We knew we had to change our ways or 
eventually close down."

COUNTY REPORT / REBUILDING THE ECONOMY; BUSINESSES ADAPTING TO A NEW CLIMATE;

<P>
 Three years ago, with defense dollars drying up and the aerospace industry in 
full sputter, APS Systems traded its swords for plowshares to avoid being 
ground up by a peacetime economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same warehouse where it had helped tune the nation's military engine, 
the Oxnard aerospace firm began building electric buses. While a neighboring 
defense contractor shut its doors, APS was busy designing the first 
battery-powered school bus in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Ventura County was losing about one of every five of its 
defense-related jobs over the past four years, the changes at APS helped put 
engineers, machinists and welders to work. 
</P>
<P>
 And the same phenomenon of change that gave new life to companies throughout 
the county was also working at the personal level -- as thousands of residents 
adjusted to the troubled economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 For Newbury Park resident John Thatcher, change meant finding a new career. 
Thatcher will be unemployed in August, when the Canoga Park aerospace company 
that he joined straight out of high school moves out of state. But, as others, 
Thatcher is changing with the times, preparing to transfer his skills to the 
computer industry or another evolving field. 
</P>
<P>
 "With my age and where I am in life, they're not jamming many people into the 
job market," said Thatcher, 51. "You learn to adapt and you just pray that the 
economy is going to take an upshot." 
</P>
<P>
 That might, in fact, be happening. After sliding headlong into the depths of 
recession, Ventura County's economy is rebuilding and showing signs of 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 There are over 12,000 more county residents working today than there were a 
year ago. Housing sales are climbing, while unemployment continues to dip. 
Commercial buildings are filling, with vacancy rates plunging to some of the 
lowest levels since before the great slump of the early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Building activity is on the rise, as real estate speculators look into the 
future and for the first time in years don't cringe at what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the classic measurements of economic health. But the local 
economy also can be measured by how it has adapted to the devastation of the 
past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Ventura County's economy is being reinvented. New business 
opportunities are surfacing even as the old ones fold up or move away. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers displaced by the economic downturn are shifting gears, striking out on 
their own or transferring old job skills into new professions. Many companies 
have survived the hard times by overhauling the way they do business, tying 
into expanding technologies and service fields that promise to rebuild the 
economy and lead it into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is growing enthusiasm on the potential for increased traffic at the 
expanding Port of Hueneme, the possible development of a commercial airport at 
Point Mugu Naval Air Station and the proposed construction of a state 
university near Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 So just how far along is the local recovery? 
</P>
<P>
 At a business gathering last month hosted by the Ventura County Economic 
Development Assn., association board member Bill Simmons summed it up this way: 
"If there was a 12-step process to (economic) recovery, we would be at Step 1: 
We now realize we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Others measure the recovery by how businesses have survived the carnage of 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the business climate is at least beginning to solidify its 
losses," said Mark Schniepp, director of UC Santa Barbara's Economic Forecast 
Project. "It is a turnaround, but it's nothing you should pop champagne bottles 
over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even a slight upturn is a welcome break from the four-year barrage of 
bleak economic news. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the county's unemployment rate has more than doubled, soaring to a 
high of 10.4% before settling at its current rate of 8.4%. Retail sales fell 
15% while the median housing price plummeted $65,000, a 24% decrease. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, Ventura County has lost more than 10,000 jobs, 
resulting in a massive restructuring of the county's work places. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two decades, there had been a steady increase in the number of 
firms employing 250 workers or more. But starting in 1991, during the heart of 
the recession, the number of large firms dropped off dramatically while the 
number of firms employing fewer than 50 people increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "A drastic reduction and downsizing is happening," explained Jamshid Damooei, 
an economics professor at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says to me that what we are losing are high-tech wages and that's going to 
have an effect on the purchasing power in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the county's diversified economy has helped it ward off hard times 
better than many of its neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture remains one of the county's strongest industries, even though last 
year's $722-million crop was one of the poorest in years. The Navy remains the 
county's top employer, putting to work nearly 15,000 civilian and uniformed 
personnel at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 And tourist dollars continue to pour into the county, especially in the west 
county cities of Ojai, Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the east county where the most dramatic rise has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 A collection of recession-proof companies has made a home in the Conejo 
Valley, bolstering the east county economy with high-tech jobs and paychecks to 
match. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Led by Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology giant Amgen Inc., the east county is 
poised to become a critical biotechnology center, the equivalent of the Silicon 
Valley to the computer industry, economists and others agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology firm, reported revenue of $364 
million, and profit of $93.5 million, for the first three months of this year. 
That translates to a 17% increase in revenue over the same period last year and 
a 14% increase in profit. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 2,000 employees, Amgen is the county's second-largest private 
employer. And the Thousand Oaks City Council recently endorsed an expansion 
plan that will make room for 6,300 new workers at Amgen's corporate campus over 
the next quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, council members praised Amgen for bringing so many high-paying, 
non-polluting jobs into the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amgen's success has produced other benefits as well. A steady stream of 
smaller high-tech manufacturing plants have moved to the area in recent years. 
Baxter Healthcare Corp. is setting up its first large biotechnology 
manufacturing plant near Amgen's world headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter, which manufactures a protein used to treat patients who suffer from 
the blood disease hemophilia, hopes to have hundreds of employees at the site 
by the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Johan Vandersande, Baxter's vice president of manufacturing, said he knows all 
too well the lure of Ventura County when trying to attract the best-qualified 
workers: Baxter's Los Angeles facility has lost plenty of good engineers to 
Amgen over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people prefer to live in Thousand Oaks than Los Angeles. Can you guess 
why?" he said. "People like the ocean, it's not as crowded and it's a pretty 
safe community." 
</P>
<P>
 Other firms are also spilling over the line from Los Angeles into Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacancy rates for commercial properties dropped in the first three months of 
this year, especially in the east county where many quake-rattled San Fernando 
Valley firms have come seeking refuge.

 The east county also leads the way in retail spending, with Moorpark, Simi 
Valley and Thousands Oaks all showing gains over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the auto empire founded by formeS. Ambassador Robert D. Nesen in the 
Thousand Oaks Auto Mall, sales are the best they've been in years. They're so 
good, in fact, that Nesen recently added two new lines -- Rolls-Royce and 
Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nesen Motor Car Co. recorded more than $200 million in sales last 
year, Gary Nesen, now president of the firm, said the economic slump choked 
sales by forcing motorists to hang onto their old cars rather than buy new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it was never a question of if the economy turns for the better, but 
when the economy turns for the better," he said. "I think things have turned to 
the positive. People eventually will have to buy new cars." 
</P>
<P>
 It is that eternal optimism that continues to draw people to Ventura County, 
and keeps them here when the going gets tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sour economy produced the slowest growth rate in decades, 
employment officials say many displaced workers are choosing to stay put and 
hunt for local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace worker Thatcher, the Newbury Park resident who will be unemployed in 
August, declined an invitation to leave the state with his company. He has 
planted deep roots in Ventura County and has no desire to pull them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Jeffries feels the same way. After 32 years in banking, she left her 
job to care for her ailing mother. Now, after five months of unemployment, the 
51-year-old Thousand Oaks resident is ready to get back to work, but not 
anxious to relocate to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, she showed up at the Thousand Oaks office of California 
Job Search looking for help preparing a new resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Peter H. Wolf asked about her job skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "All there is is banking," she explained. "That's all I've done since I've 
been 24 or 25." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolf poked and prodded, asking about management experience and other 
skills to help fill out her resume and make it more attractive to potential 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important that you position yourself for other industries," said 
Wolf, who for 10 years has matched employers with those eager to work. "You 
have to be able to transfer all of those skills because the banking industry 
isn't a great industry right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, few industries have been harder hit than banking. Four years ago, 
leaders of the county's two largest locally owned banks expressed little 
concern about the economic slump that was just starting to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, both banks have incurred severe losses. And only recently have 
they begun to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based Bank of A. Levy last month reported a profit of $1.36 million 
for the first quarter of this year, its first gain in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are poised very well for the future," said Marshall C. Milligan, 
the bank's president and chief executive officer. "As the economy improves, we 
are in position to do a lot of business with existing businesses and new 
customers, and we are eager to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bank recently reported a $114,000 loss for the first 
quarter of 1994, cutting its losses by $1.4 million over the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank reported a loss of $12.1 million last year, contrasted with a profit 
of $685,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Ventura County National Bank's semiannual business survey that reveals 
the strongest evidence of a slow but steady recovery. Nearly 70% of the 603 
businesses that responded to the survey said they believe economic recovery is 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, released earlier this month, revealed strong sales performance and 
job creation among companies with annual sales of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the respondents with more than 100 workers reported increased 
employment last year, and more than 40% predicted they would hire more workers 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a trend that bodes well for commercial real estate, about one-quarter 
of the companies with annual sales of between $5 million and $10 million 
reported they would need to find more office space this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these trends continue, we should begin to see measurable gains in 1994 and 
a healthy recovery under way by 1995," the survey concludes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Small businesses were among those hardest hit by recession, according to the 
survey, and many are still reeling from the effects of four years of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the entrepreneurial spirit lives on. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, Louis Carrizales decided to start his own business after getting 
laid off from Abex Aerospace. The Oxnard company, once the city's largest 
private employer, announced in 1992 that it would shut down, putting more than 
500 employees out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrizales is doing the same type of work Abex had trained him to do, but he's 
now doing it on his own. He has even hired his father, a 33-year Abex employee 
also cut loose last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Ventura, a mother-daughter team recently opened a coffee shop in a busy 
shopping center near Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe College Square is staffed by Ruby Perkins and her daughters, Deborah and 
Diane Claridge. Between them, they have 60 years of restaurant experience. 
</P>
<P>
 They possess no fancy business degrees. They pay themselves minimum wage. And 
they advertise by dragging out a hand-painted sign and setting it by the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this unforgiving economy, the women say they are confident they can 
make their business work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You stick it out and you hang on," explained Deborah Claridge about the 
family's approach to rising above the economic gloom. "There's a lot to say 
about good, old-fashioned hard work." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For years, no one worked harder than those in the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid- to late-1980s, the industry rode a streak of hot sales and fat 
profits. Then the recession tightened its stranglehold. Housing sales slowed to 
a crawl and new residential construction dropped measurably. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the industry is just starting to dig out from the downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County housing sales rose 18% during the first three months of this 
year compared with the same period last year, the largest quarterly increase 
since the late 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, building activity has started to pick up, with the economy 
adding more than 500 construction jobs since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite strict policies enacted to control explosive growth in Ventura County, 
the issuance of residential building permits countywide jumped by half during 
the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And real estate developers, who track the market the way air traffic 
controllers track jumbo jets, say they are finally regaining confidence in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Winchester Homes proceeded with the fourth phase of a Simi Valley 
subdivision that stalled years ago when the slowdown hit. Immediately, 
drywallers and plumbers and tractor drivers went to work. So did sales 
representatives who show the model homes, and gardeners who tend them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the mood is guarded: Until the developer is certain the market has 
healed, only 15 residences will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been sitting on this for awhile, waiting for the economy to get 
better," said Dick Moses, who heads the construction crew carving up a hillside 
that is circled by hawks and chewed by cattle. "I guess it's looking up." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo-based Pardee Construction Co., the county's biggest housing builder, 
also is throttling forward with projects put on hold because of the 
recession-choked real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going nuts," said Bill Teller, Pardee's project manager for Ventura 
County. "There has been a marked increase in activity since the first quarter 
of this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Teller said he sees the economic slump as a needed correction to allow the 
real value of houses to catch up with their inflated prices after years of 
double-digit increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're watching the market to make sure that what we are seeing are not 
short-term blips," he said. "But we see companies moving in, unemployment going 
down and jobs being created. That makes us optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are industries that will never be the same again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's aerospace industry took the brunt of the economic shakedown, 
hemorrhaging thousands of jobs over the past four years, more than any other 
sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon Co. in Oxnard shut down. So did Northrop Corp. in Newbury Park. 
Defense contracts were their lifeblood, and circulation was cut off when 
military spending was cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned at the closures, many surviving firms learned that they needed to 
change the way they do business to avoid becoming casualties of the Cold War's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo-based California Amplifier Inc., for instance, used to split its 
operations between defense work and commercial manufacturing of amplifiers for 
home satellite television dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1990, anticipating troubled times ahead, the company shifted entirely 
to the faster-growing non-defense field. Sales have jumped more than 300% in 
the past three years and employment has grown from 160 to 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, a Ventura County consortium was the first local group to 
receive a federal grant under the initial phase of President Clinton's defense 
conversion program. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One Corp. in Camarillo, the lead firm in a group that also includes 
Rockwell International of Thousand Oaks, will get $1.9 million to develop small 
battery-like devices that store electric power. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Oxnard, APS Systems has secured contracts of more than $1 million to 
build electric buses. From a warehouse in the shadow of Oxnard Airport, the 
company offers one of the best examples of an economy in the midst of 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers once in danger of losing their jobs now earn a living fashioning 
sheets of metal into a fleet of energy-saving shuttles, the latest in 
developing public transportation technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches are painted in a giant metal hangar built a few years ago when APS 
was building trailers to haul M-1 tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers here need only look out the door to see what might have been. A little 
way down the road, the green glass Abex Aerospace complex stands dark and 
abandoned and choked by weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried for all of us here," said Bob Roberts, the leather-faced 
64-year-old foreman who orchestrates the machine shop at the APS plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we saw the writing on the wall. We knew we had to change our ways or 
eventually close down." Ventura County Economy at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Since the recession took hold, Ventura County's economy has proven more 
durable in several areas than that of its neighbors. The following comparison 
of Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties, and the state of 
California, demonstrates job losses and measures other key economic factors.
