AN ISLAND IN THE MIST; WITH SO MUCH OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY LOST, THE STORY

 Sapelo is an island off the Georgia coast, inhabited by descendants of slaves 
brought there almost two centuries ago. Near the end of "Sapelo's People," a 
self-styled "meditation on race," William S. McFeely, Pulitzer Prize-winning 
biographer of Ulysses S. Grant, writes that he wants to restore their own 
history to the black people of Sapelo Island. Only one of those islanders, for 
whom McFeely's gift was intended, can truly judge how successful he has been. 
But I -- merely an outsider, but one whose history this could have been -- am 
deeply grateful for McFeely's magnificent effort of thought, empathy, 
scholarship and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 McFeely's story of the blacks on Sapelo is a searing, metaphorical X-ray of a 
people battling to find space where they can become themselves rather than 
succumb to the weight of a hostile majority determined to master an island, a 
region, a continental nation. Using the stories the Sapelo people told him, the 
advice of a professional genealogist for the Georgia Department of Natural 
Resources and the tools of the historian's trade, McFeely delineates a spare 
trail from slaves like Bilali -- the great-great-great grandfather of one of 
his sources on Sapelo -- to the poor and decent lives led by the few remaining 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 For most blacks the past is not prologue. It is a fog created by whites who, 
while romanticizing their own stories, expended much effort attempting to 
destroy or demean the history of blacks. Had McFeely followed the duplicitous 
historical traditions that prevailed up to the middle of this century, not only 
would Bilali have been lost in the mist, but the long road from him to James 
Banks Jr., a Sapelo native now studying at Georgia Southern University, would 
have been profoundly distorted. Losses inflicted by bad or incomplete history 
are incalculable. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other blacks, I feel this on a personal level. On American soil, I 
feel whole, but when I travel to Africa, I feel incomplete, overwhelmed by the 
presence of a part of me that has been lost. Luckily, that began to change on a 
visit to Ghana earlier this year. In a guest house in Accra, I was stunned 
while looking at a painting of an African scene to see a face that bore a 
striking resemblance to my father's face. On another day, I encountered a young 
Ghanaian woman who looked very much like my aunt and my older daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, I visited the Cape Coast Castle, a fort on Ghana's Guinea 
Coast that for two centuries served as both a warehouse for slaves consigned to 
the Western hemisphere and as their point of embarkation: the place where they 
lost their native soil, the communities that had shaped and nurtured them and 
more often than not, their entire families. Having just seen evidence of 
African stock that carried down to my family in the United States, I knew that 
centuries ago at least one ancestor of mine had suffered in her own filth, 
crammed with scores of others in the dark dungeon where I was standing as she 
waited for a slave ship and a future filled with unknowable horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strange way the power of the hideous memory was healing. It gave me back 
a tangible sense of an important part of my history. While in a different way, 
McFeely's sketch of the specific histories of Sapelo's people brought me a 
similar sense of restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilali, the patriarch of the Sapelo Island slaves, was purchased either in the 
West Indies or in the Charleston slave market in about 1802 by Thomas Spalding, 
the patriarch of the Sapelo Island slave owners. Ultimately Spalding, a highly 
successful planter -- with enormous help from his slave driver/plantation 
manager, Bilali -- was able to will 1,000 slaves to his children. Ultimately, 
Bilali, a devoutly religious Muslim with some formal education, was able to 
pass on the spirituality he brought from Africa by writing a book for his 
descendants about his faith and hereditary slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us who need to establish a human link to Africa but cannot reach 
back to a specific ancestral moment, Bilali, born in what is now Guinea in 
about 1760 and abducted and shipped from the Guinea Coast about two centuries 
ago, is a good stand-in. In describing the plan the Spaldings developed to 
control and train their newly purchased work force, McFeely suggests what 
Bilali experienced in the transition from free-standing human to slave: 
</P>
<P>
 "The terror of those enslaved in Africa, forced into the stinking holds of 
slave ships . . . for the Middle Passage, and then driven from those ships and 
into the slave pens of the Charleston Market. Already separated from family and 
other familiar people, having seen their fellow cargo, dead and no longer of 
value, thrown into the sea, these were the survivors. Unable to communicate 
with most of the other people in the pens and shouted at in a language wholly 
alien, they can scarcely have imagined what would be their fate." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that was in store for them was work. McFeely observes that Thomas 
Spalding "exacted a fierce amount of labor from the slaves." Those who imagine 
slavery as principally a bucolic occupation, characterized primarily by stoop 
labor, miss by a very wide margin the degree to which slaves laid the 
foundation of this country. Here is McFeely's description of the labor the 
slaves performed in wresting from a wilderness the broad, rich lands that 
provided Spalding his fortune: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of live oaks were sawn down, trimmed, squared and hauled by oxen to 
boats and sold as timber. Other trees were ringed of their bark and, when dead, 
felled and burned. Stumps were pulled and the woodland floor laboriously 
cleared of saplings, ditches were dug and salt marshes drained, to create 
cotton fields. Once the spring planting was up, the soil between the rows of 
low, bristly bushes was chopped with long-handled hoes to banish weeds and to 
loosen the soil baking under the intense summer sun. When it came time for 
harvesting, the cotton was picked into long gunny sacks dragged by stooping 
workers through the fields that spread over Spalding's four thousand acres." 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil War smashed the Spalding empire. In an effort to preserve many of 
their "assets," some members of the family took their slaves off the island and 
marched them into the interior of Georgia. But some Sapelo slaves, like others 
across the South, took the occasion of the war to liberate themselves. Some 
simply ran away. Others ran away and joined the Union Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their course during the war, the main sword of freedom for Sapelo's 
blacks was wielded by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. His great march to the sea 
broke everything in its path, including the shackles that bound the Spaldings' 
remaining slaves to their hereditary condition. As a result, as McFeely notes 
dryly, freedom meant becoming "war refugees." Some of the former Sapelo slaves 
returned to the island. 
</P>
<P>
 There were obviously many reasons why the Sapelo people returned, but surely 
one of them was Sherman's Special Field Order 15, issued in January, 1865, 
which set aside a stretch of territory, including Sea Islands, for the 
exclusive use of the newly freed blacks. Sherman acted on the advice of a black 
delegation, which assured him that the freed people's deepest desire was to 
obtain the means to achieve independence and thus true freedom. Two months 
later the Freedmen's legislation passed by Congress perfected and extended 
Sherman's idea. It gave the President the authority to assign up to 40 acres of 
abandoned Southern lands to "loyal refugees and freedmen." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many other promising Reconstruction initiatives, this measure, which 
held great promise of independence, disappeared under a concerted onslaught of 
white power. On the national level, President Andrew Johnson nullified the 
lands provision of the Freedmen's legislation by exercising his pardon power in 
favor of the former Confederate ruling class. Locally, the Spalding family, 
citing Johnson's policy, sent land agents to reduce the Sapelo people to 
something very close to slavery. Although the blacks successfully resisted 
being reduced to sharecroppers, they were deprived of any land other than the 
little garden plots they had been allotted during slavery. While the schemes of 
Spalding heirs failed, successive waves of other wealthy whites took some of 
the best land on the island, thereby assuring that the people who remained 
would live perpetually in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, other Reconstruction measures were also thwarted. Education in 
which the blacks had placed so much hope was restricted first to youngsters and 
then to the daylight hours. The idea of adult education, which might have 
empowered the blacks, shriveled and died. Politics had also once seemed 
promising. But violence, misuse of the law, the indifference of the North and 
finally the unremitting zeal of Southern whites left Georgia blacks 
disenfranchised again by the first decade of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 In their long climb out of the brutal post-Reconstruction disappointments, the 
people of Sapelo abide and grow. The last of the Spaldings -- their plans for 
rebuilding their empire long dashed -- have gone. The descendants of the 
Africans brought to the island to wring wealth out of it for their masters have 
become one with the island. It has become their island and they are its people. 
Little in their lives symbolizes this better than the First African Baptist 
Church, which was established in May, 1866, and which celebrated its 125th 
anniversary while McFeely was working there. Two of Bilali's grandsons were 
founders of the church which, while Christian in name, is African in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 McFeely describes Bilali's latter-day descendants and their community as they 
arrive for the 125th Anniversary church service: 
</P>
<P>
 "On this first Sunday in May 1991, 125 years after angels of their better 
nature gathered and made a joyful noise, Sapelo's people slowly, sedately, but 
richly in anticipation, come together outside today's First African Baptist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Climbing down from vans and pickup trucks, the men stand at the edge of the 
shade in black suits; the women moving into the shelter of the large oak wear 
hats plastic and giddy, straw and smart. . . . From head to patent-leather toe, 
these people are, this day, adorned for celebration. They have come to make the 
Lord's day a fine party." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapelo's people came back from New York and Miami and Dayton to celebrate the 
anniversary of the church, which is also a celebration of Sapelo's families and 
Sapelo's community. As McFeely observes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course there had been vast change since Thomas Spalding hauled his wild 
Africans onto the island as slaves, these slaves who became free and, free, 
learned that freedom can be held captive to poverty. Freedom can be inched in 
on in other ways as well by outsiders meaning well or thinking ill. Sapelo's 
people have experienced too many other people doing for them; they want, as 
they always have, to do for themselves. And what seems to be immensely 
difficult for any but themselves to see is how well they have done." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, of course, is the ultimate story. These people have endured every 
brutality and every indignity that a mighty nation could heap on them. They 
have taken what little they had . . . only their bare lives at first . . . and 
built people and families and churches and dignity. Some have fallen by the 
wayside under the weight of the onslaught or just because of their own human 
frailties. But others have lived to fight back and to throw up offspring who 
have left the island and enriched the nation. A few have stayed husbanding 
their memories and continuing to live in the circle of simple dignity and 
concern they have constructed out of their years of tribulation. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is that the story of black Americans is not really about O.J. 
Simpson or Colin Powell or Toni Morrison or Oprah Winfrey or Rodney King or 
gangsta rappers or even university professors or newspaper writers. We all have 
a part of that story, but the symbol of the great thrust of black history can 
be seen on Sunday mornings as the people in their worship clothes spill out of 
the churches they have made and greet each other after a week of ordinary work, 
surviving in a hostile land that still belittles, slanders and underpays them, 
but to which they continue to give their dignity, their persistence, their 
values and their strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been guided through McFeely's book by his Sapelo muses both living and 
dead, I am proud to be one of those whom McFeely lovingly calls "colored people 
in a land of careless hatred." Good history does have its uses and McFeely's 
gift is a splendid one.

THE MAKING OF A FRENCH CHEF IN AMERICA; A CHEF'S TALE: A MEMOIR OF FOOD, FRANCE 
AND AMERICA, BY PIERRE FRANEY WITH RICHARD FLASTE AND BRYAN MILLER (ALFRED A. 
KNOPF: $25; 259 PP.)

<P>
 In the opening montage of Pierre Franey's PBS series "Cooking in America," 
there is one scene that is fixed indelibly in my mind: Franey, dressed in dusty 
saddle-poke garb, bounces across the prairie on the back of a horse. Rarely has 
a man looked more uncomfortable, yet he does it so earnestly -- a Frenchman so 
doggedly trying to break out of his natural reserve and break through to 
American good-ol'-boy bonhomie -- that it is kind of endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 That brief glimpse is probably more revealing than anything in his new 
autobiography/cookbook, "A Chef's Tale." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a minor tradition of French chef autobiographies and they seem to 
follow a pattern. Sun-Dappled Boyhood Close to the Land (whether it's Provence 
or Burgundy, it is always treated as the sole repository of honest French 
cooking), Early Lessons at the Table from Maman (a paragon of all honest French 
cooks), Teen-age Apprenticeship (which seems to us almost Dickensian but is 
warmly remembered by the author as a character-building experience), First 
Great Chef (slightly awe-struck, gradually becoming confident as the great man 
comes to recognize his potential) and, finally, The Big Break ("I was nervous, 
but knew I could do it"). 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds suspiciously close to American military or sporting 
autobiographies, it's no coincidence. While the career path for American-born 
chefs sometimes seems dictated by a sort of intellectual dabbling (there are an 
amazing number of art history majors), the classical French chef has climbed a 
ladder more akin to an Army officer or football star. It is not a life that 
encourages introspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Franey is typical in that he began his cooking career at 14, scrambling from 
peeling vegetables to polishing stoves at an age when most American boys were 
engaged in sandlot baseball and playing soldier. Work in this kind of kitchen 
was not creative, it was disciplined. The emphasis was not on creating new 
dishes, it was on perfect preparation of dishes codified 50 years before. It 
was not about painting, it was about brush strokes. As Franey points out, 
potatoes were treated like "diamonds . . . slicing seven -- not six or eight -- 
facets on each one." 
</P>
<P>
 After coming to the United States in 1939 to work at the French Pavillion of 
the New York World's Fair, Franey became chef at Henri Soule's Le Pavillion 
(generally regarded as the first great French restaurant in this country). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Franey is atypical in one important way -- he is one of the few French 
chefs of that day who became public personalities in this country and who 
actually affected the way Americans cook. Remember, the great popularizers of 
French cooking in America -- James Beard, Julia Child, Waverly Root, M. F. K. 
Fisher, Richard Olney, etc. -- were Americans. French chefs, as per their 
training, rarely ventured out of the kitchen. The kind of dining-room touring 
and glad-handing that is almost required of a chef today would have been 
regarded as unseemly. That kind of frivolity was for lesser souls, like maitre 
d's. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, Franey's influence for much of his career was at one remove -- 
through the offices of New York Times restaurant critic and food editor Craig 
Claiborne, who first befriended him at Le Pavillion. Before long, Franey -- who 
had quit the restaurant world to become vice president of Howard Johnson's -- 
was accompanying Claiborne on many of his restaurant review visits and helping 
him devise recipes for his weekly cooking stories. For many years, this 
contribution was never acknowledged: The reviews and recipes ran under 
Claiborne's byline only. Today, certainly, the ethics of this would be regarded 
as questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 The association continued -- apparently quite happily for both parties -- for 
nearly 20 years. Claiborne and Franey and his family lived nearly next door in 
East Hampton. Their working patterns were regular and revolved around 
Claiborne's dinner parties, which soon became legend. "I would cook," Franey 
writes, "he would figure out how to get a newspaper story out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late '70s, Franey -- apparently at his wife's urging -- "felt the 
need to cut back on the seven-day cooking weeks, which is what they had now 
become" and withdrew from the partnership. How much impact the success of his 
own New York Times column "The 60-Minute Gourmet" (ghostwritten, in a fine 
irony, by Claiborne's eventual successor as restaurant critic, Bryan Miller) 
had to do with that decision is not spelled out in the book (which is also 
ghostwritten by Miller and a former Times editor, Richard Flaste). 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, very little of a personal nature is revealed in this book. Franey 
is still reluctant to step out from the kitchen, treating autobiography as 
expanded resume: "I did this, then I did this, then I did this." Contrast this 
with Claiborne's own autobiographical cookbook of several years ago in which he 
not only came out of the closet as an alcoholic and a homosexual, but also 
revealed his first sexual experience -- with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, not everyone has led a life so full of anecdote, but still we would 
like to get more from Franey than the mean gruel that is offered here. In fact, 
the only time he opens up at all is when he talks about food. We find out much 
more about how he makes a turbot souffle than about how he feels about his 
relationship and break-up with Claiborne -- or about his marriage, the death of 
his brother and father, his experiences as a foreigner in this country . . . or 
anything else for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the sense in writing an autobiography if you can't tell us any more 
about your life than we could have gotten by watching the introduction to a 
cooking show?

 Excellent piece on the pleasures of becoming a restaurant regular ("The 
Regular," by Jonathan Gold, Three on the Town, June 19). But becoming one of 
the anointed is easy to arrange.Simply order a good bottle of wine, then send 
what you don't consume to the chef with your compliments.

 I always thought the point of being a regular was getting "the usual" without 
having to place an order. When I was 10 years old, I attempted to achieve this 
distinction by ordering a hot roast beef sandwich and a chocolate soda at 
Benton's coffee shop in Laguna Beach every day for an entire summer. 
</P>
<P>
 On our way back to Los Angeles at the end of August, my parents agreed to stop 
at Benton's for one last lunch. Showing off, I confidently ordered "the usual," 
but the waitress -- the same one we'd had all summer -- peered at me over her 
pad and said, "Now what would that be, honey?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Gold's piece, I see now that it was me and not the waitress who 
missed the point.

AT A LOSS

 Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan laments that President John F. Kennedy's program 
to move retarded and mentally ill people out of asylums and into 2,000 
community centers was "absolutely catastrophic" because only half the program 
was implemented -- asylums were closed while only a small fraction of the 
facilities that were to replace them were built ("The Lost Faith of Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan," by Karen Tumulty, June 19). He has backed off from his 
humanitarian values, claiming that these failures could have been avoided "if 
we hadn't set out to improve things." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, in this example and many others, is that noble plans were 
initiated but were abandoned before completion. They were sabotaged by 
subsequent conservative administrations and betrayed by liberals who gave up 
before the game was over. Perhaps if those 2,000 community centers had actually 
been built, with training, counseling and development services, we could now 
enjoy a society with neither asylums nor homelessness. Perhaps if we improved 
our schools and adopted realistic drug prevention and rehabilitation 
strategies, we wouldn't be building so many prisons. 
</P>

<P>
 It is more accurate to characterize Moynihan's position as a loss of naivete 
than a loss of faith or confidence in what government is able to do. He is much 
too bright not to have observed that most of his colleagues truly are much more 
interested in their personal careers and in petty partisanship than in 
addressing problems meaningfully. On the infrequent occasions when they do 
implement something bold, the nightmarish, unintended consequences often 
overwhelm the intended ones.

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE CONFUSING; THE GAME OF THIRTY, BY WILLIAM KOTZWINKLE 
(HOUGHTON MIFFLIN CO.; $21.95; 272 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

October from Carroll & Graf; Avon will publish The Long-Legged Fly in paperback 
in August.

<TEXT>
<P>
 What does one expect next from a man who has written a book of mystery stories 
in which all the characters are insects and a book that has as its main 
character a talking handkerchief? 
</P>
<P>
 William Kotzwinkle isn't likely to be inducted into the literary pantheon 
anytime soon. He writes too much, for one thing. And little of it is in the 
approved manner; it's rather as if he keeps turning up in heavy boots or 
barefoot when everyone else at the party is wearing loafers. His novelization 
of "E.T. The Extraterrestrial" was the top bestseller of all 1982. (So what if 
major points of view were those of a dog and an extraterrestrial botanist?) And 
aside from that he's best known, not as the author of properly reflective, 
socially relevant novels, but of a cult classic about die-hard hippie Horse 
Badorties ("The Fan Man") and a novel decrying animal experimentation ("Doctor 
Rat"). 
</P>
<P>
 This latest, Kotzwinkle's 20th book, is a detective novel. Not some 
revisionist, postmodern exercise fingering mystery tropes to squeeze out thin 
juice for existential cocktails, mind you, but a straight detective story. 
</P>
<P>
 Good guys, bad guys, and a hell of a lot of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, as in much of the author's work, a fantastic element. It's not the 
one feinted at by ongoing references to an ancient Egyptian game. Nor is it, 
really, the one foreshadowed by early allusions to Janus, brother gods 
Ephialtes and Otus, and Maat, goddess of truth. Though when it comes, to some 
readers it may appear more fantastic than either. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy McShane, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen and was once a federal agent, is 
now a private investigator. He wears expensive Italian suits, carries in the 
pocket of those suits a thousand-dollar pen with radio transmitter on board, is 
able at the drop of a whim to enlist and afford the full-time services of New 
York's best electronic mole or a surveillance specialist whose van does 
everything but call up the judge for you. 
</P>
<P>
 A wealthy dealer in Egyptian antiquities has been murdered, injected with 
cobra venom; his organs cut out of his body and carted away, and Jimmy is 
brought in by daughter Temple to investigate. Oil quickly turns to roux: Jimmy 
receives by fax the image of a cobra, other (unidentified) players appear; 
Temple's mother attempts to stop the investigation and, indeed, to enlist 
Jimmy's help in institutionalizing her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimmy doggedly follows the thread into mazes he never even knew existed, 
toward the inevitable Minotaur. 
</P>
<P>
 It leads him from apartments aloofly overlooking Central Park to the 
storefronts and shrouded upper floors of Times Square. From diamond-studded 
47th Street to suburbs of executive privilege so saturated with superfluous 
money that children have become a kind of ultimate wampum. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotzwinkle's adroitness in gathering up the various loops and bows of his 
novel without ever forcing them into knots is a marvel to behold. So much 
happens here, and at such deep levels; yet somehow it passes by so lightly. I'm 
reminded of the grass in Lawrence Durrell's poem "Style" -- an assassin of 
polish, "blood from the unfelt stroke." 
</P>
<P>
 Of an abused child, Jimmy says: "The truth was she was tough. She'd been hurt, 
but she grew around it the way a tree will grow around any impediment to its 
progress; the force is upward." 
</P>
<P>
 That seems finally what Kotzwinkle, with all his talking handkerchiefs, 
crickets and the men who fall in love with them, his chief-inspector mantises, 
extraterrestrials, hippies and ex-federal agents, has to say: Whatever 
historical cataclysms, whatever self-destruction, injustice and cruelty befall 
us, we will survive, both individually and socially. 
</P>
<P>
 We may survive changed, changed in ways we now absolutely cannot imagine, but 
we will, absolutely, survive.

THE GREAT GOOD DOG; NOP'S HOPE, BY DONALD MCCAIG (CROWN: $20; 240 PP.) ; 
DUMB-BELL OF BROOKFIELD, POCONO SHOT, AND OTHER GREAT DOG STORIES, BY JOHN 
TAINTOR FOOTE, ILLUSTRATIONS BY GORDON ALLEN (LYONS & BURFORD: $24.95; 336 PP.) 
 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Vicki Hearne, Vicki Hearne's most recent book is Animal Happiness 
(HarperCollins). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The authors of these two books are separated by a couple of generations. John 
Taintor Foote was born in 1881; Donald McCaig nearly 60 years later -- but they 
have a couple of things in common that should be noted at the outset. One is 
that both books believe in the great dog. The more than exemplary, uncanny 
heart and intelligence and drive for work that quite eclipse the mere 
cleverness and devotion celebrated in this century in stories about Lassie and 
Lad of Sunnybank Farm are at the heart of most of Foote's stories, and of 
"Nop's Hope." And both books acknowledge in different ways the authority of the 
great dog and the honor due him. 
</P>
<P>
 In Foote's stories, especially about setters, greatness is figured as 
uneclipsable; the great dog is never outfaced. In the first of the title 
stories, "Dumb-bell of Brookfield," the great setter Dumb-bell becomes, while 
hunting, lost in a snowstorm. Dumb-bell is not at this point a young dog, and 
he is hunting in an unfamiliar terrain, an old pine wood. As the storm strikes, 
driving his human companions indoors, he is on point, having scented a grouse. 
The storm rages, Dumb-bell grows weaker, but stays on point -- and is found the 
next morning, frozen to death, but still on point. The grouse he is pointing is 
still there. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one figuration of genius, as of a courage and will that are immune to 
vicissitudes; I have known dogs who tempt you to think in this way. But in 
"Nop's Hope," things are otherwise, and it is therefore, in this beautiful and 
canny book, a more problematic matter to honor the great dog. The dog is Hope, 
a Border Collie, son of the great Nop (of McCaig's earlier wonderful sheep dog 
novel, "Nop's Trials.") His handler is 26-year-old Penny Burkholder. (In both 
of these books, a handler, or trainer, is someone who is in some ways the dog's 
master but as deeply the dog's servant, like a tennis coach or any teacher who 
is aware of the awesome possibilities of the activity.) 
</P>
<P>
 When we meet Penny, she is on the road, competing in sheep-dog trials. She is 
in a sense an allegorical figure, having no history besides her quest, which is 
to win, with Hope, the National Handlers' Trials, a kind of sheep-dog 
equivalent of the Olympics. She seems to be made all of absolutes. She is given 
to the adamantine, as when she says, not callously but passionately after a ewe 
has been killed in order to try to save her lamb: "It's a mother's job to die 
for their young. That's what mothers do. Mother won't die for her baby isn't 
worth a damm in this world or the next." When she says this we don't know that 
Penny's husband and small daughter have been killed in a truck wreck, nor that 
at least some of Penny's adamantine drive is a drive to forget, or at least not 
remember so much -- "when I'm out in that trial field . . . I don't have to be 
me . . . and at night, when I lay down, I'm too tired to dream." 
</P>
<P>
 The wife of a farmer who sees Penny work a dog feels that "somehow she might 
have done something different, something cold and bright and beautiful." 
Penny's genius with the dogs is true genius, not a symptom. It shines 
throughout the book, but especially perhaps at that farmer's place, where Penny 
starts helping him with his farm dog Shep, and the farmer "heard Shep talk, 
clear as a bell. He wondered why he hadn't heard him before." 
</P>
<P>
 But to say this much about Penny's quest is to obscure the central and 
glorious presence of Hope. Hope talks in this book. I don't mean that Penny 
interprets his gestures, but rather that he is given dialogue. Sometimes the 
dialogue is clearly understood by Penny, as when she tells him about the 
awesome difficulties of the National Handler's trials, and he says he can do it 
-- "If I am handled correctly." She says: "I'm not so bad!" He says: "Thy 
commands come late or too soon and thee (CQ?) fail to read thy sheep." At other 
times she isn't interested, as when he says, "I will guard thee from ghosts," 
and she tells him to lie down and stop padding around. 
</P>
<P>
 There are various possible responses to this, from the psychologist's favorite 
cry, "Anthropomorphism!," to the more ordinary person's cry, "Dogs don't talk," 
or, perhaps, the objection of some dog trainers, which might be, "Dogs don't 
talk like that." The psychologist and the person who has never worked dogs in a 
serious way simply don't know what they are talking about, unlike McCaig, who 
has run dogs at national level trials, but the dog trainer's possible objection 
is more interesting: Dogs talk, but not like that. But what is not merely 
interesting but uncannily skillful here is that Hope's dialogue bears the same 
relationship to real exchanges between dogs and handlers (these are, remember, 
people who are both masters and servants to dogs) that virtually any dialogue 
bears to the talk it represents. Hope's lines are no more and no less literally 
true than those of any human character in any movie, which is not to say that 
the dialogue is "metaphorical," but rather that the truth here is poetic, true 
to, faithful to the world it sings. (Hope's talking to Penny is not only 
controversial in the world of human opinion. His father, Nop, says, "When we 
talk, they learn more about us than is proper.") 
</P>
<P>
 As I said earlier, it turns out in this wonderful novel that neither a great 
handler nor a great dog are invulnerable; both can be over-faced and thus 
shown, for the moment at least, what hell is like. To say more would spoil the 
story for you, though it would take more than a reviewer's prattling to spoil 
this splendid novel. McCaig, who with "Nop's Trials" showed us what might be 
possible when the words "serious" and "dog story" were put together, has done 
it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dumb-bell of Brookfield" is edited by Foote's son, Timothy Foote. The world 
in Foote's dog stories is at once less and more human, or at least in some ways 
more "ordinary," than the one in "Nop's Hope." As I have said, a major 
difference is that, here, great dogs cannot be over-faced, discouraged, burnt 
out -- indeed, in the last story of the book, "Pocono Shot," even a hatchet 
blow that virtually severs the dog over the shoulders fails not only to kill 
him, but to slow his work in the field. Pocono Shot has a scar from the 
incident, but is otherwise the dog he was. Having a badly broken leg does not 
stop the tiny puppy, Allegheny, from doing battle with a mechanical rabbit. 
Jing has a torn pad, but he runs the field trial and wins the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Foote's dogs can be killed, but they cannot be pitied or shamed. Even when the 
mistress of Brookfield stops the master and the kennel manager from putting 
down the ugly, snarling bulldog cross (mockingly named Buttercup), the reader 
is invited to feel not pity but admiration -- and the mistress herself seems to 
be motivated at least as much by a sense of challenge as by pity for the brute, 
who later saves her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The reader is not unmoved by Dumb-bell on his last point, frozen in the storm, 
but at no point is that modern bath of pity that allows people to feel superior 
to dogs encouraged. It is not that the tender emotions are here absent or 
discouraged, but rather that the emotion of admiration for great dogs that 
these stories invoke, an admiration that within these stories compels the human 
characters deeply and surely, is a more tender emotion than pity. In its grip, 
the human characters are more vulnerable to the dogs than anyone can be when 
merely pitying; this is love, the fullblown thing. Love, admiration and awe 
lead the narrator of "Jing" never to hunt again with any other dog, any lesser 
dog, after he loses Jing. In this world there are one-man dogs, and one-dog 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 These stories are not about sharing suffering with dogs, which makes them very 
anti-modern. They are, rather, even in the case of "Trub's Diary," about an 
unrepentant bull terrier, and "The White Grouse," about deciding that a lesser 
hunting dog is better because with such dogs the birds have more of a chance, 
about sharing joy, the dog's joy in his or her won mastery. Hence the 
authorities, the beings who have power, ability and transcendence, are the 
dogs. The idea of acknowledging a dog's authority to do anything but suffer is 
so alien to many ways of thinking that the impact of these stories may not be 
felt by those who cannot conceive it. 
</P>
<P>
 I called the stories anti-modern for their celebration of the authority of 
dogs, but not old-fashioned. They are in another way old-fashioned, that is, 
the current of social and political chatter in them is not nowadays terribly 
acceptable. In particular, in "Pocono Shot," the vote for women and the reading 
of Russian literature leads to a mixing of gender lines and to rape, murder, 
and to the dog's being nearly cleaved in two by a hatchet. ("Pocono Shot" was 
first published in 1924, before the Cold War, the McCarthy era and the Berlin 
Wall. "Russian" here means something more like "effete" and hasn't anything to 
do with the red menace.) Those details are, however, not the meat of the story, 
they are simply the accidental and local expression of a quarrel at least as 
old as Xenophon's complaints about the Sophists, between the Bounty Bumpkin, 
for whom an awareness of hard-earned skill (in, say, writing) and of the 
consequences of actions, is central, and the City Slicker, who is repelled by 
what looks limited, narrow, even brutal. 
</P>
<P>
 In this story, the brutality belongs to the city slickers, though there is 
more than one murder, one of them committed by the quintessential city slicker, 
the other committed by the dog's true owner, in revenge for the terrible wound 
inflicted on the dog. An unsympathetic reader might say that simple hypocrisy, 
as common by a trout stream as in Manhattan, is the source of the evil in the 
story, and there would be some justice in this, but it is a story worth 
attending to, apart from the wonderful creation of the character of Pocono Shot 
himself, for its concept of the dichotomy sometimes called "city versus 
country" for its vision of what "nature" means in one American tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of both of these books is in their possession of a genuinely 
moral, rather than merely moralistic, vision of possible relations between 
people and dogs, relations in which the dogs are full participants. McCaig is 
more alert than Foote to the problematic of that relationship, is the more 
worried and philosophical writer, the one more congenial to a taste developed 
on particular ideas of fiction. Both books are indispensable.

 PEOPLE HAVE MORE FUN THAN ANYBODY: A Centennial Celebration of Drawings and 
Writings by James Thurber, edited by Michael J. Rosen (Harcourt Brace & 
Company: $22.95; 169 pp.) The art on this page is from his book, which includes 
18 prose pieces and more than 75 previously uncollected drawings (many, of 
course, from The New Yorker).In the essay "I Like Dogs," Thurber writes with 
characteristic forthrightness and restraint: "I am not a dog lover. A dog lover 
to me means a dog that is in love with another dog. I am a great admirer of 
certain dogs, just as I am an admirer of certain men . . . . I do not believe 
in any such sentimentality as that man's best friend is the dog. Man's best 
friend is man. A friend is one who cleaves to you in spite of the left side of 
your nature, the dark and sticky side. To him you are one fine guy, without any 
faults." Susan Salter Reynolds

<P>
 The girls are still crazy about the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, those TV teen dreams that television keeps delivering right to 
the family room. In earlier decades, a smile from Paul Petersen or Ricky Nelson 
could cause a swoon. Then came heavy sighs directed at the Monkees, Bobby 
Sherman, Lance Kerwin and Shaun Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday's Donny Osmonds, Jason Batemans and Kirk Camerons are today's Joey 
Lawrences, Jonathan Brandises and Mario Lopezes. And waiting in the wings are 
plenty of other young hopefuls more than willing to fill their Doc Marten 
boots, ripped jeans and plaid shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the formula? Besides the X factor, certainly a prerequisite of cute, 
followed by likability, charm and an easy-to-relate-to quality. Being able to 
carry a tune, appearing on a weekly sitcom and having a persistent publicist 
who knows the editors at Tiger Beat, 16 and Bop couldn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
 So, a few "fantasy" fan letters to some of the hottest young hunks on the 
small screen: JOEY LAWRENCE

 You're so-o-o cute. It's so neat you're on a show that shows how smart you

 Social Life: "It's not that interesting."

 What's Hard About Teen Idol Status: "The preconceived notions."

<P>
 We just adore you on "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." You were the cutest on "My

 Los Angeles natives are presumed rare, but we always manage to make our 
oversensitive presence felt the minute anyone from elsewhere dares bash our 
turf. After all, no one can trash our beloved city better than we home folk.

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; BLOWIN' IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. Daniel Foster 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a kid, my brother Mike hopped Burlington Northern boxcars, wailing on his 
harmonica as he headed out of St. Paul, bound for adventure. That sound, mixed 
with the clatter of train wheels, signaled escape. I have wanted to play the 
instrument ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 I know he never played "You Are My Sunshine," the inane ditty my harmonica 
teacher has assigned to me. I decided to learn to play after the Harmonica 
Store, apparently the only music shop around devoted to the instrument, opened 
last year in North Hollywood. At my first group lesson taught by David McKelvy, 
who for 25 years has made his living playing the harmonica for films and TV, I 
blew a single note for nearly 15 seconds, hyperventilated and nearly passed 
out. This would be an arduous journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing is a complex task that includes learning to hinge my hands to produce 
a vibrato, bending notes, tongue blocking, playing out of both sides of my 
mouth and mastering trills, shakes and tremolos. I have had a private lesson 
from McKelvy, who has taught hundreds of harmonica wanna-bes, but I prefer to 
learn at my own pace using a workbook and tape he sells. 
</P>
<P>
 I am resolute in my efforts to avoid what McKelvy terms the campfire sound, 
the waaah waaaah waaaaaaah or "wienies and marshmallow vibrato" that only a den 
mother could love. "I can teach the techniques," McKelvy tells me, "but not the 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 And attitude is my goal. McKelvy has encouraged me, saying "your tone is nice 
and fat," but I'm tired of playing "Camptown Races." Today I glanced ahead in 
the book and dreamed of the day I can wail off "Boil that Cabbage Down" and 
"Snake Tongue Blues." Even on my $4.95 tin Hohner All-Band, I know they'll 
sound right, especially in the acoustics of the boxcar I'll hop back to St. 
Paul. R. Daniel Foster

HIPPIE BUSINESS; HOW TWO GUYS SCOOPING ICE CREAM IN A VERMONT GAS STATION BUILT 
A $140-MILLION-A-YEAR BUSINESS.; BEN & JERRY'S THE INSIDE SCOOP: HOW TWO REAL 
GUYS BUILT A BUSINESS WITH A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE AND A SENSE OF HUMOR, BY FRED 
"CHICO" LAGER (CROWN PUBLISHERS: $22.50; 256 PP.)

<P>
By Philip Glouchevitch, Philip Glouchevitch is a former reporter for Forbes 
Magazine and the author of Juggernaut: The Keys to German Business Success 
(Touchstone/Simon & Schuster). He lives in Vermont. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a recent, vintage Ben & Jerry's press conference, Ben Cohen announced he 
was stepping down as CEO of the ice cream company he and Jerry Greenfield 
founded some 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the occasion, Cohen and Greenfield wore Uncle Sam-style top hats fashioned 
from ice cream containers and held up a poster bearing their pictures and the 
slogan, "We want you to be our CEO." All candidates were invited to enter a 
100-word essay contest. The media lapped it up as eagerly as they would a pint 
of the company's super-premium ice cream, and the story was in all the papers 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. has outgrown Cohen and Greenfield, but then, 
neither one ever imagined that the crepe and ice cream scoop shop they opened 
in an abandoned Burlington, Vt., gas station would ever grow to its current 
size, with $140 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, their flavorful ice cream, rich in butterfat and loaded with 
large chunks of Oreos, Heath Bars and other goodies, seduced American taste 
buds. A nation of dieters saved room for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with great taste came savvy marketing. Cohen and Greenfield have 
cultivated a reputation as a couple of successful, hippie-ish entrepreneurs who 
use profits for causes such as saving the rain forests and opposing nuclear 
power. In the 1980s, most of the business news was dominated by doings on Wall 
Street and talk of yuppies and greed, so it was refreshing to find "real guys" 
in Vermont producing ice cream and trying to do something "socially 
responsible" with the profits. Indeed, Cohen and Greenfield learned to milk 
favorable publicity from the media as well as a Vermont dairy farmer strokes a 
cow. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes an engaging, behind-the-scenes look at the company and its founders 
from Fred Lager, the company's CEO for much of the 1980s. Cohen brought Lager 
on board so he could focus on marketing, but took over the job again when Lager 
retired in 1990; Greenfield, meanwhile, withdrew from full-time duty in the 
early 1980s but continued to work on special assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Ben & Jerry's: The Inside Scoop," Lager traces the friendship of Cohen and 
Greenfield back to the seventh grade, briefly sketches their formative years on 
Long Island -- odd jobs in Ben's case, rejection from medical school in Jerry's 
-- and picks up with the two deciding to go into business together. 
</P>
<P>
 After an abortive summer of trying to open an ice cream shop in Saratoga, 
N.Y., the duo moved to Burlington. There, at least, the cold weather ensured 
that they would have little competition. In a renovated gas station, they 
installed a secondhand rock salt and ice freezer and began making ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben's sinus problems meant he had trouble distinguishing flavor, a medical 
condition that would have profound implications for their future. To 
compensate, Jerry would double the recommended amount of ingredients and add 
lots of chunks with the idea of creating a "mouth feel" that Ben could 
appreciate. They also upped the butterfat content by reducing the amount of air 
that got whipped into the ice cream. Thus Oreo Mint, Heath Bar Crunch and other 
classic brands were born (for some reason, other flavors like Lemon Peppermint 
Carob Chip and Honey Apple Raisin Oreo never made it into commercial 
production). 
</P>
<P>
 The scoop shop was popular, and demand for the ice cream was high, but profits 
were unpredictable because it was hard to prevent scoopers from over-scooping. 
The pair tried selling 2 1/2-gallon tubs to restaurants, but that wasn't 
getting them far either. Ben, who at the time was driving the delivery truck to 
restaurants, hit upon the idea of packaging the ice cream into pints that he 
would sell to mom-and-pop grocery stores along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 From these modest beginnings, the business grew. Much of the tale is classic 
entrepreneurial stuff -- long hours, making do with limited resources -- but 
Lager keeps the narrative moving along briskly. He describes the major 
milestones: the move to a bigger facility in Waterbury, Vt.; expansion into 
metropolitan area supermarkets; the struggle against Pillsbury's Haagen-Dazs 
brand as well as Frusen Gladje and Steve's; the in-state initial public stock 
offering and the decision to contribute profits to social causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Lager manages to convey the founders' wry sense of humor: 
"Jerry and Ben . . . debated whether their customers would prefer fewer but 
larger-sized chunks, or a larger number of smaller-sized pieces. 'I argued that 
if the chunks were too large, you might not get a chunk in every bite,' says 
Jerry. Ben was willing to take that risk, convinced that it would be more than 
offset by the euphoria of finding a really huge chunk in the next spoonful." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the right number of chunks into each pint was indeed an obsession of 
Ben's. At one point he had pints sent through an airport X-ray machine and a 
hospital's MRI scanner to see if the chunk count could be accurately tested. 
Lager also recounts how Ben once asked for 144 variations on a product, with 
different chunk sizes and proportion of ingredients, so he could do a taste 
test. "Are you really going to eat all of these?" Lager asked incredulously. 
"No, " Ben replied, "I'm going to start eating them. Find out which ones I 
like, and then eat some more in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the humor and the laid-back image, though, Ben & Jerry's was, as one 
observer noted, "a sweatshop in a pastoral setting." The company's meteoric 
growth kept employees running. For all his savvy marketing and stroking of the 
media, Cohen was less smooth when it came to getting along with his own 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Lager himself was among those frustrated with Cohen. He argued against the 
company's seven-to-one pay scale ratio, whereby the company's top earner could 
only earn seven times what the lowest-paid person made. The ratio made it 
impossible to attract top talent for the executive positions. Ultimately, Ben & 
Jerry's had to drop the policy, but not until after Lager had left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield fought hard against big business, and in some 
ways became victims of their own success. Fred Lager pays them a worthy tribute 
in this fine book.

 A bit too moony for kiddies and a bit too stunted for teens, the 1991 Wild 
Hearts Can't Be Broken (NBC Sunday at 7 p.m.) is bland, rambunctious family 
fare that turns weepy-inspirational in its telling of a true story. The film 
centers on a young orphan (Gabrielle Anwar) growing up in Depression-era 
Georgia who ditches her uncaring aunt to become a rider on a diving horse in a 
traveling stunt show, owned by an embittered grouch (Cliff Robertson, who does 
the only real acting in the film). 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 hit Lethal Weapon (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a big, shallow, 
buddy-buddy cop movie redeemed by Mel Gibson in the title role as a suicidal 
L.A. officer. Careening through the film, Gibson generates an authentic sense 
of unpredictability and danger. Danny Glover plays his apoplectic partner. 
</P>
<P>
 So-so and ultraviolent, the 1993 TV movie Sworn to Vengeance (CBS Tuesday at 9 
p.m.) stars Robert Conrad as a Carson City, Nev., police sergeant obsessed with 
tracking down the killers of three teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 Stand By Me (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.) is Rob Reiner's compassionate, 
perfectly performed look at the real heart of youth, a treasure told in the 
form of a memoir, as a writer (Richard Dreyfuss) remembers back to his pivotal 
summer of 1959. Adapted from a Stephen King story and starring River Phoenix, 
Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hughes' Ferris Bueller's Day Off (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.) offers a 
tantalizing fantasy for adults as well as children: What if you could fool your 
parents and teachers (or your boss) into thinking you were sick, earning a 
24-hour free ride from the boredom and responsibilities of real life? 
Unfortunately, Matthew Broderick, in the title role, is so smug and invincible 
that he doesn't give us any chance to root for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Reed: Badge of Honor (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.), a 1993 TV movie, finds the 
ever-reliable Brian Dennehy again cast as a real-life Chicago cop, who he first 
played in the popular 1992 "Deadly Matrimony" miniseries. This time Reed's 
working on a murder case when he discovers a larger plot by a brilliant 
sociopath out to hijack arms. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET's Saturday night double feature offers two films that helped establish 
the international stature of the Australian cinema: Gillian Armstrong's deft 
and dazzling 1979 My Brilliant Career (at 9 p.m.), which launched Judy Davis, 
who is splendid as an astringent, independent young woman who became an 
important novelist; and Breaker Morant (at 10:40 p.m.), Brian Beresford's 
compelling courtroom drama about the tragic misadventure of military justice 
set against the Boer War. Edward Woodward, Jack Thompson and Bryan Brown star.

RAPPING SHALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was surprised by Tom Shales' column on MTV's "Real World" ("MTV's 'Real' Mix 
Makes for a San Francisco Treat," TV Times, July 10).He refers to Mohammed as 
"a rapper who calls himself a musician," and implores the young man to "GET A 
JOB." Tough words from a guy who watches TV for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't he realize rap music has been a commanding force for over a decade and 
good rappers make the kind of money he can only dream about? Given his 
condescending attitude and limited grasp of modern music, perhaps Shales, not 
Mohammed, should get a job ... in another line of work.

into the grand European tradition of painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Costumed as everything from a Renaissance Madonna to an anonymous woman in 
Cubist brown, and calling upon various technical sleights of hand available in 
a television studio, she maneuvered pictures of herself into reproductions of 
famous paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes artist Peter Campus or critic and curator Bruce Kurtz would show up 
too, in subsidiary roles such as an attending angel or a devoted saint. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Freed who took center stage in the hitherto established historical 
drama, which she was gaily rewriting through the new medium of television. This 
was "Art Herstory," as Freed's electronic pageant of the masters was pointedly 
titled, and a woman was its guiding star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art Herstory" is one among 39 videotapes by 21 artists currently featured in 
an important survey exhibition at the Long Beach Museum of Art, and it says 
something central about the art of the recent past. Twenty-five years ago, the 
coincidental rise of the women's movement and the sudden availability of 
home-video technology conspired to create a yeasty moment for art. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, "The First Generation: Women and Video, 1970-1975," is significant 
and timely. Like all exhibitions of single-channel video shown on a lone 
monitor, however, it does take a rather herculean effort to watch. The complete 
program runs 9 hours, 44 minutes. Critics are lucky enough to be able to look 
at review copies of the tapes via the privacy of a home VCR -- even at that, it 
took this writer more than a week to see the whole show -- but museum visitors 
don't have such a leisurely option. Repeat visits are the only way. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally it's worth it. Yes, there's a certain nostalgia factor inherent in a 
video exhibition in which almost nothing comes in the saturated color we've now 
casually come to expect from television fare. (Remember black-and-white video 
art? Who ever thought it would assume the rarefied patina of antiquity?) More 
important, "The First Generation" recalls to mind a number of individually 
first-rate works of art, while also suggesting larger cultural shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, when it sometimes seems odd for any American not to own a camcorder, or 
at least a VCR, it is hard to remember the heady excitement when finally, after 
many decades, the first portable video equipment became available to a general 
public. Artists, both here and abroad, were among the first to recognize and 
seize upon the underutilized potential of a medium that had previously been 
available only to corporate and commercial interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach show was organized by guest curator JoAnn Hanley for the 
nonprofit exhibition service Independent Curators Inc., and it is touring to 11 
sites around the United States and Canada. Almost all the artists surveyed are 
American, but the show does make a point to acknowledge the international reach 
of the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 In politically repressive Brazil, video afforded Anna Bella Geiger the privacy 
essential to the safe exploration of potentially volatile ideas. In socially 
conservative Japan, Mako Idemitsu and Kyoko Michishita used established 
techniques of abstraction and of documentary film, respectively, to deconstruct 
the rigidity of mainstream society. Lisa Steele in Canada and Valie Export in 
Germany approached the same medium from radically opposing angles: Steele as an 
intimate, diaristic tool for personal discovery; Export as a new kind of public 
visual space, waiting to be explored. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite logically, many of the first artists to pick up a video camera expended 
a good deal of effort examining the formal properties of television, for those 
properties differ sharply from the formal qualities of film, photography or any 
other visual medium. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed, for instance, had been trained as a painter; two years before she was 
to make the technically complex "Art Herstory" she made "Water Glasses," a 
technically simplistic but visually lovely, conceptually provocative videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Two rows of three water glasses are lined up on a reflective surface. 
Repeatedly, over the course of four minutes, water is poured into them. 
Dramatically speaking, nothing else happens. Visually and conceptually, a lot 
does. The repetitive scene of pouring water was shot close-up and from a 
variety of angles. Space is layered, smashed and shattered, fragmenting the 
image into kaleidoscopic shards. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of water flowing into a glass corresponds to the physical machinery 
of a television set, in which the transient picture on the glass screen is 
created by the fluorescent glow of an electron stream flowing through a 
cathode-ray tube. Fluidity, light, transparency, refraction, reflection -- the 
picture on the screen is a metaphor for the action inside the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water Glasses" soon begins to seem like a familiar Cubist still life from the 
early 20th Century that has been miraculously translated into the terms of 
late-century TV. Through this discursive visual essay, Freed began a formal 
reconciliation between television pictures and painted ones. That equitable 
accommodation became the basis for the social inquiry of "Art Herstory." 
</P>
<P>
 Each segment of the exhibition is prefaced by brief, incisive, well-edited 
comments made by the artists. (Appropriately, they were interviewed by 
telephone. Their filtered voices prepare you for the imminent TV pictures.) 
More than one artist declares the fundamental importance of recognizing just 
how exciting video was in the early 1970s. The excitement came from 
encountering a brand new medium. Certainly its newness was embraced for its own 
sake, much the way photography had been more than a century before. But there 
was more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Newness also meant that video art had no history -- and history had pretty 
much kept women out of art's precincts. Video art was a tabula rasa. The slate 
was clean. Women could start from scratch, without having to haul away the 
restrictive baggage of a patriarchal history -- and they did. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only history television did have was outside art: the commercial 
fare broadcast by the networks. Some artists, such as Eleanor Antin, Ilene 
Segalove and Martha Rosler, composed their work against that grain. 
</P>
<P>
 Antin, in "The Ballerina and the Bum," used the new portable technology to 
become a one-woman Hollywood studio, using dramatic narrative to explore issues 
of art and life that a network would never dream of considering. Segalove made 
her suburban-housewife mom into a home-made sitcom star. Rosler's fearsomely 
funny "The Semiotics of the Kitchen," based on a cooking show, is like a Red 
Brigade terrorist-training film as hosted by Julia Child. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial broadcast television had been around for about a quarter-century, 
but with rare exception (such as Ernie Kovacs), it hadn't really examined the 
vast range of its own eccentric properties in any but the most timid, lumbering 
ways. From the start, TV's format was based on that of radio, its immediate 
predecessor. Broadcast television was -- and largely still is -- radio with 
pictures. The supposed "revolution" of music video in the 1980s was just the 
final commercial apotheosis of this ancestrally determined state of affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists, though, didn't worry about Nielsen ratings. Shirley Clarke and 
Shigeko Kubota each kept an electronic diary, in differing Pop art styles. 
Julie Gustafson made a documentary on women's sexuality, historically 
suppressed from mainstream television. Lynda Benglis tried to pinpoint the 
distinctions between film and TV. Barbara Buckner used a synthesizer to make 
Modernist abstractions. Steina hooked up her electric violin to her TV and 
turned the camera on herself, thus making the subject of the picture determine 
the picture's form. 
</P>
<P>
 The breadth of activity in such a condensed moment of time is truly 
remarkable, although today some of these tapes do resonate more deeply than 
others. My all-time favorite is Joan Jonas' "Vertical Roll," and its grandeur 
remains intact in the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts out with Jonas interminably (and loudly) banging a spoon on her 
studio floor, as if in some percussive tantrum, while the synchronized picture 
flips by in that annoying, electronic malfunction known as vertical roll. 
Nineteen minutes and 38 seconds of brain-busting craziness, it ends up being 
sort of like a TV mandala -- not visually, exactly, but in the way its 
relentless, grating patterns suddenly go from being utterly incomprehensible to 
radiantly, impossibly clear. When it's over you feel unexpectedly refreshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Made in 1972, "Vertical Roll" ranks as single-channel video art's first 
flat-out masterpiece. And you'll never see it on NBC -- or on cable.

 SUMMER OF LOVE: The Inside Story of LSD, Rock & Roll, Free Love and High Times 
in the West by Joel Selvin (Dutton: $22.95; 384 pp.). It definitely gives one 
pause -- a book entitled "Summer of Love" beginning with the denial that the 
"summer of love" ever existed, the explanation being that the phrase was 
invented by glib, Eastern news magazines. The title is just about the only 
misstep in the book, however, for San Francisco Chronicle music critic Joel 
Selvin has otherwise written a consummate page-turner, at least for anyone even 
moderately interested in rock and roll. The story of the San Francisco music 
scene is a familiar one -- the Grateful Dead playing Ken Kesey's Trips 
Festivals, the Jefferson Airplane living in a Haight-Ashbury mansion, Bill 
Graham producing everyone at the Fillmore -- but Selvin's book differs from 
most others on the same theme by ignoring everything but the music culture 
itself. His limited, risky approach pays off, in part because the "psychedelic" 
music scene merits detailed discussion, but also because Selvin has woven the 
particulars, old and new, into an engrossing narrative. Rod McKuen recommending 
the unsigned Airplane to his record label, RCA Victor, and hoping the band 
would play some of his songs; a charter pilot complaining about the Airplane's 
cigarette smoke, inspiring Paul Kantner to open a door in mid-flight to throw 
out his butt; Dead drummer Mickey Hart dosing his horse and dog with acid 
before dawn rides in Marin County; former actor Graham, years before Ronald 
Reagan, using a dramatic line from an obscure movie during a heated, public 
argument -- and getting caught; Quicksilver Messenger Service having to edit 
its dazzling "Who Do You Love" to 25 minutes to fit it onto a record ("Happy 
Trails").It's all here, in spades, meaning that Selvin's account of San 
Francisco's musical glory years is likely to be definitive.

 CALIFORNIA GARDENS: Creating a New Eden by David C. Streatfield (Abbeville 
Press: $55; 271 pp., color and b&w photos). Garden books offer great imaginary 
journeys as well as inspiration for the Green Thumb.Streatfield's is a garden 
tour par excellence -- not only of private spreads such as Las Tejas in 
Montecito out of California's landscape history -- a saga of railroad barons, 
movie moguls and visionary designers. From mission courtyards to Victorian 
follies to contemporary experiments in color and form, Streatfield, who chairs 
the Landscape Architecture Department at the University of Washington, 
interprets a complex tradition with the aid of exhaustive research. The photos, 
from a number of sources, are uneven but successful in showing the many shapes 
our Eden has taken in the hands of expired gardeners. Susan Heeger

 BULLET HEART by Michael Doane (Knopf: $23; 316 pp.). Truth is better captured 
by fiction, we're often told, than by purely factual accounts; tied not to 
external events but to feelings and impressions and ineluctable human 
character, fiction supposedly brings to life what nonfiction paints by number. 
Well, here's one case where the analogy actually works, for in "Bullet Heart" 
Michael Doane tells the story of a confrontation between whites and Native 
Americans to which neither journalism nor scholarship could possibly do 
justice. The novel takes place in South Dakota in the 1970s, when local 
developers start the short-lived Bones War while building a golf course on an 
ancient burial ground. The American Indian Movement is at its height, 
government authorities feel under constant siege, the U.S. appears on the verge 
of living up to its ideals or of falling flat on its face; Michael Doane uses 
this real-life civil strife to illuminate the individual troubles, and 
principles, such rebelliousness brings to the fore. There are many complex 
Native American characters in "Bullet Heart" -- the reader is reminded of 
Louise Erdrich's work -- but the central figures are Gaetan Avril and Tyrone 
Little, sympathetic local men labeled "Indian-lovers" by the rest of the white 
population. The two have many reasons -- some mysterious, some not -- for their 
largely unreciprocated friendliness toward the Lakota, the major reason in 
Avril's case being guilt: his father became rich by exploiting the natives, in 
one instance even resorting to murder, and the son is determined to make 
recompense.For all that, though, guilt is not a major factor in this book; 
indeed, the best thing about "Bullet Heart" is its even-handedness, for Doane 
neither idealizes Native Americans nor demonizes heedless whites. (It should be 
noted, however, that the Bones War bears a striking resemblance to the 1975 
FBI-AIM battle after which AIM founder Leonard Peltier was convicted of murder, 
and that in this book the Peltier model is unquestionably innocent.) "Bullet 
Heart," Doane's fifth novel, may be too thoughtful and too well-written to make 
headlines, but in its own quiet way it's a literary milestone.

 BAD HAIRCUT: Stories of the Seventies by Tom Perrotta (Bridge Works 
Publishing: $18.95; 208 pp.). Watergate, the oil crisis, disco, international 
terrorism, the Brady Bunch -- no, the Seventies are best forgotten. For those 
who can, at least; forgetfulness isn't possible for Tom Perrotta, a child of 
that uninspired decade who's able, providentially, to turn Seventies dross into 
Nineties gold. "Bad Haircut" is a funny and ingenuous debut collection of 
stories, one focused on the childhood and adolescence of a standard-issue New 
Jersey youth named Buddy. He's a good kid -- when asked by a schoolmate to grab 
a weapon and "rumble," Buddy thinks of his Swiss army knife and television's 
Fonzie -- but his teen-age hormones ensure he will get into minor fixes 
nonetheless. In "Thirteen," Buddy covers up for Kevin, who's been stealing from 
his stepfather's gas station; we seem to know all about the family just from 
Buddy's describing Kevin's mother as "a thin quiet woman who smoked extralong 
cigarettes and told him to be careful every time he left the house." Buddy 
shows himself to be a born follower in "Race Riot," when he says of a school 
troublemaker who drives a white Camaro with an eight-track, "I liked Carvello 
when he let me ride in his car"; he continues to be very much the observer in 
"Snowman," where Buddy describes his pal Neil, with a hot hand on the 
basketball court, as looking as though "he heard God calling his name, or one 
of Charlie's Angels."It's the late-high-school tales that stand out in this 
collection, however, for in these stories Buddy, no longer passive, begins to 
assimilate the mixed blessings of adulthood. In "Forgiveness" he tells how a 
football teammate, a star, quits the squad upon realizing the coach is a 
manipulative, unprincipled bully; in "You Start to Live" and "Just the Way You 
Were," Buddy learns about the joy of sex and the pain of love. It's tempting to 
call Bad Haircut an "auspicious" book, but that doesn't say enough; in fact 
Perrotta has already delivered the goods.

 THE WEEKEND by Peter Cameron (Farrar Straus Giroux: $17; 241 pp.). How clever, 
you think: Wouldn't a novella about weekend visitors make a sly, charming gift 
for your summer-weekend hosts? Think again: Peter Cameron's "The Weekend" is in 
fact a dark, sober tale, illustrating the ways in which unexpected company can 
expose the brittleness and instability of apparently solid relationships.Lyle 
and Marion are the best of friends, and both are looking forward to his 
spending time at Marion's beautiful home in the Adirondacks, where she lives 
with husband John and their small child. Marion is slightly alarmed, however, 
when Lyle asks if he can bring a friend, for Tony, Lyle's lover and John's 
half-brother, died in that very house exactly one year earlier. Marion's fears, 
naturally, come true: Lyle's new lover, Robert, is a normal, attractive young 
man, but his inquisitiveness, indeed his mere presence, unbalances the weekend 
gathering to the point that it spins in ugly, disconcerting directions. 
Cameron, author of three previous works of fiction, doesn't need to resort to 
melodrama to make the story work, for his characters are able through 
conversation alone to reveal how little they understand the arc of their own 
lives, let alone the lives of their friends. No, "The Weekend" is not a good 
house- warming gift . . . but it's the perfect book to read while a free- 
loading guest, and to leave behind should the weekend jangle.

 THE LIZARD'S SMILE by Joaoa Ubaldo Ribeiro, translated by Clifford E. Landers 
(Atheneum: $21; 355 pp.). It makes sense -- that countries with good beaches 
should also produce beach reading."The Lizard's Smile" certainly fits that 
genre, a Brazilian novel set in Bahia that's half sci-fi thriller, half comedy 
of manners, and ultimately less than the sum of its parts. The book -- deftly 
translated by Clifford Landers -- begins with biologist-turned-fishmonger Joao 
Pedroso discovering a two-tailed lizard that appears to grin, then 
doctor-turned-politician Angelo Marcos Barreto discovering an odd cancer in his 
lower intestine. The reader directly forgets this portentous-promising opening, 
though, for soon Joaoa Ubaldo Ribeiro becomes wrapped up in detailing the 
passionate, unanticipated love affair between Pedroso and Ana Clara, Barreto's 
wife. Ribeiro eventually returns to the novel's controlling plot, which 
involves strange creatures brought about by genetic engineering, but his heart 
doesn't seem to be in it; Ribeiro is more at home describing the vagaries of 
personal interaction than the intricacies of science, his discussions of the 
latter often reading like lectures. "The Lizard's Smile" is captivating at 
times nonetheless, for some of the domestic scenes -- especially the very sexy 
encounters between Ana Clara and Joao, and the angry ones between Barreto and 
Ana Clara -- could be outtakes from an Almadovar film. This is one novel where 
less -- less plot, less exegesis, less theatricality -- would have been more.

PALM LATITUDES: BOTTOM LINE; THE KING OF ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 On a quiet Monrovia street stands a house, ordinary in all respects but one: 
It's full of treasure. Its outer walkways and its interior are crazy with 
baskets, cages, drawers and wooden shelves filled to bursting with dazzling 
rocks and minerals: golden pyrite, purple amethyst, orange alabaster, amber 
iridescent hematite, marble, opal and more."We probably have 150 tons of rocks 
and minerals on the property," says George Burnham, owner of the house/rock 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham opened his company, Burminco, in 1946, together with his wife, 
Mildred, to whom he's been married since 1939. His customers run the gamut from 
individual rock hounds to JPL, which bought rocks to test moon-landing gear, to 
colleges and school districts around the country. "Tens of thousands of 
Angelenos have probably used Burnham's specimens in their introductory geology 
courses," says USC geology professor Greg Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about 9 years old when I first got interested in rocks and minerals," 
says Burnham, who turned 80 this month. "I had an Aunt Lillian who liked to 
find pretty stones, and I would go with her. I was born at Lake Elsinore, and 
the pegmatite gem mines of Pala and San Bernardino are not too far from there. 
One could go out and sometimes find quartz crystals on the ground and green 
epidote." Since then, he's wandered more afield: He's traveled from Africa to 
Iceland to gather specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any particular favorite. I like 'em all," Burnham says. And he 
calls finding the minerals "an aesthetic experience." Of course, there's a bit 
of specialist snobbery involved: "I enjoy picking up what most people think is 
an ordinary rock," knowing that it's really something much, much more. Michael 
Forrest

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; METHOD RE-ACTING

 Tom Wideline was almost glad when the Burbage Theatre production of "Red River 
Rats" closed last month. When he won the part of Woo Woo Walenski, he wasn't 
prepared for the personal impact of playing a former fighter pilot shot down 
over Vietnam.He hadn't expected the story of the annual reunion of POWs to 
evoke such profound memories of his own incarceration in foreign territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1979, while backpacking his way around  
</P>
<P>
 the world, Wideline was tossed into an Iraqi prison for failing to have his 
passport properly stamped. After several weeks of physical and mental abuse, he 
was released. 
</P>
<P>
 He began a mostly successful hiatus from thinking about the ordeal. Then came 
"Red River Rats," in which characters recall their experiences at the hands of 
the Viet Cong. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end, when one character, Jungle, talks about how he was tortured, it 
made me think about Iraq," Wideline says. "About how the prisoner in the cell 
across from mine was beaten for eight hours. Then it stopped, and the next day 
there was blood everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept waiting for my time to be tortured. You have no sleep, no sense of 
time. All you hear is this constant moaning. The play brought back that sense 
of constant fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wideline contends that being in the play was a positive experience: 
"For the first time in 15 years, I've had to come to grips with what happened 
and to start talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 A positive experience, of course, isn't necessarily a good experience. "I also 
hated being in this play," Wideline says, "because after the performance I 
would come home and think about the box and the light and the screams, the 
constant screaming. It took me a long time to go to bed." Ellen Alperstein

FOCUS; RAISING TITANIC QUESTIONS; WHY ARE WE STILL FASCINATED BY THE 1912 OCEAN 
TRAGEDY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of modern history's worst disasters. The very word Titanic has 
become virtually synonymous with doom: images of the "unsinkable" luxury liner 
plunging into the frigid Atlantic after striking an iceberg on its maiden 
voyage in 1912. Of the 2,224 passengers on board, 1,500 perished, most of the 
deaths attributed to an inadequate number of lifeboats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titanic tragedy has inspired 100 books, 300 songs, several movies, plays 
and even an opera. She's now the subject of a two-part documentary premiering 
Sunday on A&E. The compelling four-hour examination of the disaster features 
interviews with survivors, film clips and photos, discussions with experts on 
the ocean liner and a look at the aftermath of the sinking. The documentary 
culminates with the discovery of the liner in 1985 at a depth of 13,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary also tries to answer the question: Why are people still 
fascinated with the Titanic? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a Greek myth that really happened in our lifetime," explains 
producer Melissa Peltier. "It's so unbelievable. It's so mythic. The little 
human stories on board. All the morality plays that are happening, just the 
whole idea of the arrogance and the hubris of speeding through the ice field 
because (they thought) nothing could go wrong. It's a huge moral lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 For her day, the Titanic was the largest, most luxurious ship ever built. The 
double-bottom hull was divided into 16 watertight compartments; four could be 
flooded and the ship would remain afloat. Because of this unique feature, the 
Titanic was labeled "unsinkable" and only carried 16 lifeboats, enough for just 
1,178 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 14, 1912, the ship was en route to New York from Southhampton, 
England. Before midnight, traveling at a rapid 22 knots, the Titanic collided 
with an iceberg on its right side, rupturing five of its watertight 
compartments. She sunk at 2:20 a.m., 400 miles south of Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship, filled with wealthy first-class passengers, well-to-do second-class 
travelers and third-class passengers, mostly immigrants, was a microcosm of the 
rigid class system of the time. The privileged were saved first: 94% of the 
women and children in first- and second-class survived. Only 42% of the women 
in third-class survived; 52 of the 79 children in third-class died. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the tragedy, a liner named the California was a scant 20 miles 
away and might have been able to rescue the passengers had her radio operator 
been on duty to receive the Titanic's distress signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cascio, vice president of documentary programming for A&E, believes no 
other event in modern times "totally symbolized the transformation of one era 
to another. At that point, the Industrial Age ended." 
</P>
<P>
 "That (era) was the belief that you could build your way into anything. So it 
wasn't just a small ship that went down, it was the biggest of the big. I think 
part of the myth of the Titanic was there was a belief that you could build 
your way to success. This showed that you couldn't do it. It's nature against 
man-made things, and nature wins. It's a lesson for the ages." 
</P>
<P>
 All the mistakes that were made on the voyage, Cascio adds, were a "result of 
hubris and arrogance at the same time. It wasn't just stupidity for stupidity's 
sake. It was stupidity based on this kind of false assumption that we could do 
anything and it'd be OK. When stupid things happen like the lifeboats, they 
were a direct result of this feeling of the times of invulnerability: We can 
build an unsinkable ship. So when it went down it made the impact even greater. 
The impact was almost beyond the ship itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Peltier decided to focus on the Titanic's human drama. "I didn't want it to be 
a really dry documentary," she says. "Everything I read that really drew me in 
were the personal stories. Some of the people you expected to be heroes 
weren't, and some people you never expected to be heroes were," including a 
crewman who gave up his life jacket to save a woman and her two daughters and 
the stokers who remained down in the hole until the last minute to make sure 
the lights kept burning on the ship. "Even after they were released (from 
duty), they stood on deck in formation just waiting for orders," Peltier says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who survived, Peltier says, endured a horrible night on the ocean 
waiting to be rescued -- "hours and hours in freezing cold; 30 men tried to 
keep their balance aboard an overturned boat with their feet in the freezing 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Cascio said he believes films such as 1953's "Titanic" and 1959's "A Night to 
Remember" romanticized the incident. The documentary doesn't. "It was a dark, 
cold frightening night," Cascio says. "When people hit the water they were 
screaming. As the ship sunk, the sound and sights were not pleasant. There's 
not too much romance to it. It is really, truly a death of a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 "Titanic: Death of a Dream" airs Sunday at 5 and 9 p.m. on A&E: "Titanic: The 
Legend Lives On" airs July 31 at 5 and 9 p.m.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; HERE'S ONE COOL CAT THAT CBS VIDEO 
BRINGS HOME FOR A SING-ALONG

 Theodor Seuss Geisel, who will always be known simply as Dr. Seuss, 
revolutionized early reading when he wrote alternatives to the Dick-and-Jane 
primers. Children's access to his 1957 "The Cat in the Hat" increased by leaps 
in the '70s, when television -- with the good doctor's help -- adapted the 
humorous tales of the striped-hatted cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, on Wednesday, CBS Video repackages Seuss with lyrical songs, releasing 
Dr. Seuss Sing-Along Classics. The four-video set includes The Hoober-Bloob 
Highway, The Lorax and Green Eggs and Ham and Other Stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Seuss' stories are just incredible, since he was such a wordsmith and a 
punster," says Mindy Pickard of CBS-Fox Video marketing. "He loved language, 
and that's what lasts throughout all these years. Hopefully that love of 
language will rub off on youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Offering five to eight songs per half hour, the videos are "upbeat, very funny 
and offer a very different kind of music," Pickard says. "You get to see the 
lyrics at the bottom of the screen and it can help learn to read, if the kids 
are in that stage. Adults enjoy the playfulness of the language." 
</P>
<P>
 The "bouncing ball" that accompanies the lyrics in each video becomes a green 
egg or a hat or a tree in the sing-alongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seuss' stories, Pickard says, convey "lessons for every age, and they work 
despite the changes in society -- they're the basic things in life, the basic 
morals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Seuss was way ahead of his time. They really stand up to time and are 
hip." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Dr. Seuss Sing-Along Classics" (CBS Video, $10) is available in stores 
Wednesday. For ages 2 to 8. More Family Shows

 MESSENGER BIRD by Dan McCall (Harcourt Brace: $9.95; 208 pp.). McCall's 
understated novel rings with the honesty of a silver dollar on a barroom 
table.After completing medical school, Jim, the narrator, agrees to serve for 
two years in a neglected hospital on an Apache reservation in New Mexico. 
Despite his skill at repairing the effects of accidents, brawls and binges, he 
remains outside the lives of the people he serves -- until he meets Annie 
Messenger Bird. The gentle, resilient Annie shows Jim the battles her people 
constantly wage against rampant alcoholism and the brutal theft of their 
identity. In exchange for his services, Jim receives the rare gift of 
compassion.

 NORTHERN FARM: A Glorious Year on a Small Maine Farm by Henry Benson, 
illustrated by Thoreau MacDonald (Henry Holt: $13.95; 246 pp.) . Benson exults 
in the pageant of the changing seasons in New England in this popular 
collection of essays and journal entries. He savors the details of the natural 
world he observes, sharing his delight in the tracks of a snowshoe hare in the 
snow, the call of an owl, the flavors of newly picked vegetables. Castigating 
urban existence, which he perceives as divorced from the reality of nature, 
Benson concludes, "The consequence is that life and time and history become 
unnaturally a part of some endless and unnatural present, and violence becomes 
for some the only remedy."

 MARY RENAULT: A Biography by David Sweetman (Harcourt Brace: $13.95; 322 pp., 
illustrated). Although her historical novels remain enormously popular 
throughout Europe and America, Mary Renault chose to lead a secluded existence 
with her longtime companion, Julie Mullard. Sweetman's intelligent, balanced 
biography traces Renault's life from her unhappy childhood, which she sought to 
escape in books, through her successful career as a writer. Fans of "The 
Persian Boy," will be surprised to discover that its author spent most of her 
life in South Africa and was an early opponent of the apartheid system.

 BUT GENTLEMEN MARRY BRUNETTES by Anita Loos (Penguin: $7.95; 97 pp.). The 
sequel to "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" continues the delicious saga of the 
quintessential gold-digger, Lorlei Lee, now married to the scion of a wealthy 
Philadelphia family.Lorelei mauls the English language with the careless glee 
of a child encountering a puppy, offering such trenchant observations as, "No 
matter how inferior your complex is, you can always meet very promanent people 
in New York, who have not got any more brains than you have." Most of the story 
is devoted to the highly unconventional life of Dorothy, Lorelei's cynical 
friend from the Ziegfeld Follies, who fails to appreciate the sterling 
qualities of millionaires: "The worst that can happen is alimony."

 CIVIL RIGHTS DECISIONS OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT: The 19th Century 
(239 pp.) and The 20th Century (273 pp.) edited by Maureen Harrison & Steve 
Gilbert (Excellent Books, P . O . Box 927105, San Diego , Calif. 92192-7105: 
$16.95 each, paperback original). By removing the arcane legal terminology from 
the texts, Harrison and Gilbert enable the average reader to study how the 
Supreme Court shifted from a narrow definition of civil rights to a broad one 
over the last 160 years. The infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857, which 
confirmed the status of slaves as property, reflects the 19th Century attitude 
toward human rights, while Chief Justice Earl Warren's historic opinion in 
Brown vs. Board of Education, "Separate educational facilities are inherently 
unequal," epitomizes the liberal views of the later 20th Century. These 
important rulings continue to influence hotly debated issues. The early 
arguments over whether African- and Asian-Americans qualified as citizens 
entitled to the full protection of the law may affect upcoming decisions on the 
rights of illegal immigrants. The Court may reject recent anti-gay rights 
initiatives by citing Chief Justice Frederick Vinson's declaration in the 1948 
case of Shelley vs. Kraemer, "The Constitution confers upon no individual the 
right to demand action by the State, which results in the denial of equal 
protection of the laws to other individuals."

SUSIE BRIGHT TELLS ALL; PREACHING A DOCTRINE OF ADVENTURE, FANTASY AND SAFETY, 
THE FEMINIST BAD GIRL BRINGS HER PRO-SEX MESSAGE TO THE MASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Ehrman, Mark Ehrman, a free-lance writer based in Los Angeles, writes 
frequently for the magazine's Palm Latitudes section. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 SUSIE BRIGHT WANTS TO TALK ABOUT SEX. AND somebody, it seems, is always trying 
to shut her up. Back in 1990, for instance, at one of her erotica lectures, a 
women's studies class passed out flyers that read: "First, slavery in the Roman 
Empire . . . then the Holocaust . . . Now, Susie Bright comes to the University 
of Minnesota." In Northampton, Mass., a hotbed of radical feminist activity, 
police advised her not to eat out because they feared she'd be attacked by 
anti-porn fanatics.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the Wellesley College incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Bright was invited to speak at this elite, all-female institution 
outside of Boston. About 1,000 people showed up, and not just students and 
faculty. Throngs of the off-campus curious -- gay and straight, young and old, 
male and female -- poured into Alumnae Hall to hear Bright's "Sexual State of 
the Union Address," an oh-so-frank look at the current state of sexuality and 
sexual politics in America. In her honor, the Colonial-style auditorium was 
converted into a kind of carnal carnival, with condoms, safe-sex pamphlets, 
chocolate nipples and other sex-celebratory items on display.

 As it happened, President Clinton was in town, too, to give his take on the 
state of the Union -- jobs and health care. The President's speeches went off 
without a hitch. But at Wellesley, 15 minutes before show time, campus police 
received an anonymous phone call. "There's a bomb in Alumnae Hall," the voice 
said and hung up.  
</P>
<P>
 The threat -- eventually proven to be a hoax -- didn't cancel Bright's 
lecture. After an hour of frantic phone calls, campus officials found an 
alternate location. The slightly diminished crowd trudged across the 
rain-soaked campus to hear Bright preach her corporeal gospel in Houghton 
Memorial Chapel, Wellesley's house of worship. Not that Bright had a problem 
with that. Her rule of thumb: "the more religious, puritanical or 
fundamentalist the territory, the kinkier it gets." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so glad God is on my side," Bright quipped when, at last, her tall, 
black-velvet clad figure emerged behind the pulpit to thunderous applause. "I 
knew She'd want me to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 IT WAS JUST ANOTHER EXCITING chapter in the adventures of Susie Bright -- 
a.k.a. Susie Sexpert -- author, adviser, educator, pornography aficionado and 
all-around sex guru. Her credo is simple: Sex is fun. Prudery kills. Fantasies 
are healthy and important. And given empathy, latex and some basic instruction, 
anything that occurs between two consenting adults is A-OK. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sense of humor, unflinching candor and a sincere, nonjudgmental desire 
to help people improve their sex lives, this 36-year-old single mother has 
powered her way from an obscure performance artist on San Francisco's gay 
coffeehouse fringe to a sort of Ann Landers of all things erotic. Her mission: 
sexual empowerment, especially for women.  
</P>
<P>
 "In many years of teaching and talking sex," she says, "I've never had a man 
say, 'I don't know where my penis is and I've never had an orgasm.' And that 
will never happen. It's feminists who put the clitoris on the map. Now we're 
concentrating above the neck."  
</P>
<P>
 Such frankness is the hallmark of a new pro-sex politics that is emerging 
among women, especially young women. It is the reason Bright has suddenly 
gotten, in a word, hot. She packs college auditoriums and movie theaters across 
the country. Her writing -- including two books, "Susie Sexpert's Lesbian Sex 
World" and "Susie Bright's Sexual Reality: A Virtual Sex World Reader" and 
countless reviews, essays and articles -- has leaped out of the small-press 
league and into the major publishing houses. Her collections of women-authored 
erotica, "Herotica", and the co-ed "Best American Erotica," are selling well, 
and her presentation, "Susie Bright's Sexual State of the Union" is being 
expanded into a book to be published next year by Simon & Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been following her for a long time and I was aware that she was 
starting to get a national audience," says Mark Gompertz, publisher of Simon & 
Schuster Trade Paperbacks, for whom Bright edited "Best American Erotica 1993," 
which sold 60,000 copies in its first eight months. "The time is right. There's 
a lot of interest in sexual politics and sexual thought." 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. Between AIDS, Christian chastity clubs, anti-porn campaigns and 
date rape controversies, the national libido seems to be in full retreat. The 
time was ripe for someone with a librarian's knowledge, a mother's concern and 
a hooker's candor to put the F-word, fun , back into sex.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are starved for the kind of message that she imparts," says Janice M. 
Irvine, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and author 
of "Disorders of Desire: Sex and Gender in Modern American Sexology." "Susie 
integrates a health perspective, but she falls totally on the side of sexual 
adventure, experimentation and pleasure and is able to provide a voice for 
people who haven't been able to get information or see role models or really 
hear that kind of message from anybody. And let's face it. She's not boring." 
</P>
<P>
 "Close your eyes for a moment," Bright says, addressing the crowd from the 
Houghton chapel pulpit. "Remember the last time you had an orgasm. Now, at the 
moment of climax, how many of you were thinking about a walk on the beach or a 
bouquet of balloons?" The audience erupts into laughter. "None of you were! 
Come on, be honest! Beach walking is a really nice romantic fantasy, so are 
sunsets, dinner for two, etc. But as erotic fantasies, they don't come up."  
</P>
<P>
 It's a quintessential Susie Bright moment. Sexual fantasies take place in a 
seething psychic nether world but not many people will admit it. "If there's 
any explanation for my popularity on sexual issues," goes one Bright maxim, 
"it's that I never leave out the sex in sexual politics." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Bright has been the subject of an HBO "Real Sex" episode, a 
member of innumerable panels and is in the Rolodexes of countless magazine 
editors. She's weighed in for such diverse forums as USA Today, backing up one 
story's assertion that "sexual explicitness is all the rage" in fiction, and in 
Esquire, teaching men how to pick up girls, and her libertine pronouncements on 
feminism, pornography and sex have appeared in Playboy, Mother Jones and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 What many people find so attractive about Bright is her approach. She's 
doesn't bring with her a lot of ideological dogma. Rather, as in the case of 
"Esquire's" story on the new "Do-Me" feminists, she shows rather than tells, 
bringing to the interview a pornographic spanking video. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this kind of false front -- one of those emperor has no clothes 
problems -- and that happens with sex constantly," goes Susie Bright Gripe 1. 
"'The sexual pundits we're accustomed to have talked about their philosophy at 
great lengths without ever integrating their own sexual experience in to their 
polemics. Too often, it's not shyness or decorum that motivates their secrecy, 
but hypocrisy. Our leaders, from the Hall of Congress to the most politically 
correct, have plenty of life experience that directly contradicts their sexual 
rules for others." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Bright fearlessly and repeatedly point out the emperor's 
condition, she has the temerity to suggest that the rest of us might just want 
to get naked with him. Be it lesbian chic, virtual sex, "queer" culture or 
yuppie porn, there isn't a single controversial or cutting-edge erotic frontier 
that hasn't been embraced early on -- if not actually launched into American 
consciousness -- by the Susie Sexpert sex crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, she's not working in a vacuum; she is only the most user-friendly 
member of the emerging cadre of bad-girl feminists, a movement of sassy, 
sex-positive women whom Bright calls "women-centric, no compromises, 
read-my-lips Amazons." While acknowledging the struggles and gains of the 
earlier generation of women's libbers, these upstarts shuck off what they 
regard as the sex-negative, separatist, man-phobic direction that they claim 
current politically correct feminism has taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late '60s, there were a lot of real sexual radicals and a lot of real 
individualists," says Camille Paglia, professor of humanities at Philadelphia's 
University of the Arts and author of the much-acclaimed "Sexual Personae: Art & 
Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson." "But something seemed to happen 
by the early '70s. You began to get an anti-male, anti-sex kind of philosophy 
taking over. Ideology began to take over." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the '80s, Paglia believes, the culture began to turn. "You could 
almost feel the change, that people were sick of such political correctness. 
The fight over feminism is one of the only anti-PC fights." 
</P>
<P>
 As Bright explained in a rebuttal she wrote in response to a New York Times 
article criticizing the Do-Me feminists: "The second generation of feminists 
are the first young women to grow up at a time when neither our virginity nor 
our child-bearing ability is our prize possession, when sexual orientation is 
not criminal or pathological, but a matter of desire, and when sexual risk and 
experimentation are loaded with AIDS on one side and virtual technology on the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Comprehensive coverage of contemporary sexuality, therefore, needs to cover a 
lot of ground, analyzing everything from Christianity to cyberspace. "It's fun 
to talk about how these elements combine," she says, "to just keep stirring the 
mix and seeing what's going to bubble up next." 
</P>
<P>
 THE TYPICAL SUSIE Bright sexual revival begins with Bright, dressed in 
something form-fitting, facing the crowd with a pitcher of water and her 
PowerBook. Her address usually contains some standard Bright-isms, as well as 
some fresh takes on the hot sex topic of the day. At Wellesley, the topic -- 
repression of sexual speech -- was handed to her in the form of a bomb scare. 
The evening before, at New York City's 92nd Street YM-YWHA's prestigious Sunday 
Evening Lecture Series, an article in the paper about chastity clubs served as 
a springboard for her rumination on the futility of trying to shut off teen-age 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with the audience brought up to date on the sex world according to 
Susie, she'll pare off an equal amount of time for Q&A. And the questions fly. 
She fields the mundane and the taboo with equal felicity. "What's up with 
female ejaculation?" and "Where do you draw the line with violence in 
pornography?" are a few of the constants. (Her answers: There are a few 
excellent videos on female ejaculation. As far as sex and violence goes, "Do 
you mean behind the camera or in front?") Whether they're questions on sex and 
religion, tips on bisexual dating or locating the G-spot (It's the spongy mass 
of tissue just above your pubic bone), Bright tries to answer them honestly and 
clearly, occasionally throwing in a spicy personal anecdote.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike more mainstream sex researchers, Susie Bright isn't a chaste or married 
therapist rattling off data and safe-sex homilies. She's a sexually active, 
proudly polymorphous, bisexual. Even her Macintosh is programmed to moan 
sensuously. Her willingness to stand up and say, "I've done it and I liked it," 
and her ability to share the information she gleans through her sexual 
experience makes her unique in the sexpert biz. Rape fantasies? No problem, as 
long as you don't act them out. Does craving penetration make a lesbian a 
traitor? "Penetration is as heterosexual as kissing," sayeth Susie. Even the 
condemnatory Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (the Meese Report), 
which quotes sexually explicit material, brought her to a few roaring orgasms, 
she publicly brags. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's special about Susie is that she bypasses all the 
politicizing all the intellectualizing and is completely personal and honest," 
says friend and former co-worker Laura Miller. "Nobody does that. Nobody. And 
you don't even realize that until you hear her do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The way she stomps all over traditional religious, sexual and political values 
in today's highly charged climate, makes bomb threats nearly predictable. But 
there's something about her persona -- as much Susie Homemaker as Susie Sexpot 
-- that enables her to make these controversial forays into the American sexual 
conscience with minimal outrage. Far from coming off like some oversexed freak, 
Bright projects an image that's more like the friendly bisexual next door -- 
which is exactly what she is. Her green eyes are almost always concealed by 
librarianesque horn-rimmed glasses and her extensive sexual resume is delivered 
in a voice with a wholesome Middle-American ring to it. One-on-one, she'll 
usually lean forward, her wide, friendly face inches away, and discuss 
sexuality both personal and general in a compassionate fashion. At this 
distance, her lack of inhibition becomes contagious. Even the Wellesley campus 
police officer who sat with her during the bomb scare, Bright says, asked her 
about some of his own sexual concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a lot of kinky ideas about sex," says Lisa Palac, a Bright cohort 
who founded Future Sex, an explicit magazine for men and women she founded that 
explores sex, culture and technology. "And so do a lot of people, but you 
wouldn't want to hear it from them because they're just too militant or they 
think they're better than you or you can't relate to it. Susie is able to say 
it in a way that people can understand it, and it makes them feel comfortable." 
 
</P>
<P>
 So while many people cannot utter clitoris or masturbation without blushing or 
gagging, Susie Bright has given public demonstrations of some unspeakably 
esoteric sex acts with a seamless, what's-all-the-fuss-about conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you feel like it's very teacherly?" Bright asks about the way she opens 
up her bedroom antics to public scrutiny. "I might be able to say I've had anal 
sex. I might describe how it feels or why it feels good. But they see me 
talking about it like a really fun social science teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 "Susie Bright is one of the only people, if not the only person, who is 
talking frankly about women's sexuality and even men's sexuality," says Camilla 
Keating, a gay New York City high school teacher, who, with her lover, caught 
Bright's presentation at the Y. "It's really a specific source of information 
and I feel that as such I have really learned a lot about dealing with my own 
sexuality, in specific ways." 
</P>
<P>
 And Bright has attracted no shortage of mainstream types. "I'm just a regular 
straight white guy," says 38-year-old Stuart Cohn, who saw Bright read recently 
at the Book Soup Bistro in West Hollywood. "Any time that you read something by 
someone who's not in the group that you're in normally and you discover that 
they're really smart and then you feel something in common with them, there's 
sort of a universality. It widens your world a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 BRIGHT'S EARLIEST MEMORIES are of wanting to belong to the counterculture. Her 
parents divorced when she was young, and both her father, a linguistics 
professor at UCLA who now teaches at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and 
her mother, a teacher and librarian, were '60s liberals who taught her the 
importance of getting involved. Her activist membership was confirmed in 1974, 
when she was a student at West L.A.'s University High School. She filed a 
lawsuit that pitted the Red Tide, a Marxist-revolutionary newspaper, against 
the L.A. Unified School District, which had tried to prevent distribution of 
the paper citywide. The case was decided in the Tide's favor two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, however, Bright had moved to the Midwest to start a Red Tide 
among the Detroit urban poor and leap full time into socialist politics and 
organizing. By the late '70s, the country's countercultural fervor had run out 
of steam. Bright entered college, first at Cal State Long Beach, then UC Santa 
Cruz, majoring in theater and women's studies, a dual major tailor-made for the 
budding sexpert. 
</P>
<P>
 Being openly bisexual in an extremely politicized lesbian culture, she says, 
made her a sexual outlaw two times over. "There had been kind of a '60s, new 
age, feminist egalitarian sense about sexuality," says Bright, cooking pasta 
for herself and her 4-year old daughter, Aretha, in her San Francisco home. Her 
voice rises and falls in a kind of singsong sarcasm. "We hold hands. We talk 
about peace and environmentalism. Then I bring you to an orgasm, you bring me 
to an orgasm simultaneously. But there's no penetration and we don't look at 
each other's bodies. We just look into each other's eyes, because if I looked 
at your body, that would be demeaning you and objectifying you. And it was on 
and on and on, a very unrealistic idea of how to relate sexually." 
</P>
<P>
 Bright calls that egalitarian pretense "a new left version of very traditional 
religious hang-ups" and wanted no part of it. "Of course, people look at and 
enjoy other people's bodies. Of course it's exciting to feel seduction and 
power and conquest and ravishing somebody and giving it up to somebody. That's 
part of what passion is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Bright had begun questioning other aspects of feminism when she and her 
friends were organizing the first Take Back the Night marches in Northern 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had had a tremendous education about what was happening with street 
violence and women wanting to have safety and confidence when they walk to 
their dormitories or into town," she says. The idea was to gather at midnight 
in the most dangerous part of town, then hold a rally afterward. During one 
rally, one woman burned pornographic photos she had taken from the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people thought that was so great," Bright says. "And I remember this 
little voice inside me, the voice of a librarian' daughter saying, 'You 
shouldn't destroy anything in the library.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The evolution of Susie Sexpert began in earnest around 1981. Bright had been 
commuting frequently to San Francisco during her UC Santa Cruz days to fulfill 
her requirements for her self-invented emphasis: Sexual Politics. She joined a 
performance art group called Mainstream Exiles, which, she recalls, "was a 
bunch of queer artists of all persuasions holding events just to talk about 
lots of things that were on our minds." Through the connections she made in the 
group, she landed a job at Good Vibrations in San Francisco, one of the first 
woman-oriented sex toy shops in the country, which was started by sex educator, 
author and publisher Joani Blank. (Bright is still Good Vibrations' erotic 
video librarian.)  
</P>
<P>
 Blank's tiny store, which grew from a $35,000-a-year business to $2 1/2 
million in sales last year and has spun off many imitators, offered a 
comfortable environment for men and women to shop for sex toys, not to mention 
plenty of sex education material. It was here where Bright began to make a 
career of sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers began asking for erotica by women authors, but with the exception of 
Anais Nin and Erica Jong, there weren't any. That's when Bright and Blank 
edited "Herotica" and later, "Best American Erotica," an enterprise that 
continues to this day.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1984, Bright was asked to join a start-up magazine called On Our 
Backs, a for-women, by-women publication. The magazine -- its name a play on 
off our backs, the title of a still-extant, radical radical feminist newspaper 
-- literally flipped the notion of sapphic politics on it's back, offering 
sexually explicit "entertainment for the adventurous lesbian." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been writing political tracts for so long and then my more imaginative 
theatrical things," Bright says, having moved after dinner to her basement 
office, which contains her porno movie collection, her 1966 spelling bee 
championship certificate and her computer. "It never really hit me that I could 
write prescriptively like Ann Landers and that it would go over like 
gangbusters." 
</P>
<P>
 Her experiments with sex toys became column material for On Our Backs. Her 
readers learned how she organized a literary soiree, in which the women dressed 
to the nines and the all-male service staff worked in the nude. Then, when she 
became pregnant, sex during pregnancy became the topic du jour, despite 
considerable flak from the separatist community. (Aretha's father, Bright says, 
was someone with whom she had had an on-and-off affair. He had a fetish for 
impregnating women and, Bright says, popped the question just as her biological 
alarm clock was ringing. She accepted the offer as well as full responsibility 
for the child.) These essays were then incorporated into her two books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very creative, very vibrant, very exciting time, and also a 
struggle," recalls On Our Backs founder Debra Sundahl, who feels, as does 
Blank, that her accomplishments and contributions to the emancipation of female 
eroticism may have gotten lost in the roar of the Susie Bright express. "We had 
no money. People thought we were crazy. Lesbians weren't a trend then. We were 
a plague." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Sundahl, Bright and company were way ahead of the curve as far as 
lesbian chic goes. But with sexual candor in short supply, Bright also found 
herself talking to an audience much larger than "adventurous lesbians." "Not 
only was I hearing from lots of lesbians, but I was hearing from men -- 
straight and gay -- and straight women who felt my frank discussion about 
female sexual desire was very appealing," Bright says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, she moved further into the hetero world. While the pornography 
industry was going through its post-Meese retrenchment, she became the first 
female X-rated movie reviewer for Penthouse Forum, where she became known as 
"the Pauline Kael of porn." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the first person to critique pornography who really didn't give a damn 
about, 'Oh, yes, Debbie has such succulent breasts,' " Bright says. "No one had 
ever critiqued porn and said, 'This part is baloney and totally fake and a big 
disappointment, and the people should be horse-whipped for making such a bad 
movie.' Not because they're evil but because they made a bad movie! And then, 
on the other hand, looking at a movie and saying, 'This has some really great 
acting. There was some authentic feeling.' No one's ever discriminated in 
porn." 
</P>
<P>
 By the decade's end, Bright had completed the basic training necessary for an 
all-out assault on the sexual status quo and what she considered its underlying 
hypocrisy. On Our Backs was gaining recognition in both the gay and straight 
world, Bright had just published "Susie Sexpert's Lesbian Sex World," and the 
speaking engagements and panel discussion invitations began to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turning point was when Susie spoke at the Castro theater (in San 
Francisco in 1989)," says Sundahl. "And it was filled to capacity. I don't know 
what that theater seats. At least 1,000. It was full of women who just loved 
it. It was a moment where we knew that the work was gathering steam and 
momentum. It had changed people's attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 OBVIOUSLY, NOT EVERYBODY IS cheering Susie Bright on as she crashes through 
the barriers of sexual expression. While Bright's rising profile recently 
landed her on the radar of such "traditional" right-wing hit men as Jesse Helms 
and Rush Limbaugh, for the most part the critical salvos are being lobbed from 
the left. Bright promotes "erotic literacy" in many of her lectures, including 
"All Girl Action," a history of lesbian erotica, and "How to Read a Dirty 
Movie," an audiovisual presentation on the aesthetics of porn. She recently 
co-wrote the screenplay for one segment of "Erotique," a theatrical tryptic 
destined this fall for the national art-house circuit. Her 
if-it-feels-good-do-it attitudes about S/M, the sex industry and the expression 
of sexual fantasy have put her at ideological odds with feminists such as 
Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin (who both declined to be interviewed). 
They consider pornography both a catalyst for, and an institution of, rape and 
look upon Bright's coddling of the sex industry with unadulterated disgust. 
"Susie can speak for herself, if she likes, but she has absolutely no factual 
basis for the assertions that she's making," says Evelina Giobbe, founder and 
director of education and public policy for WHISPER, an acronym for Women Hurt 
in Systems of Prostitution Engaged in Revolt. "We believe that pornography is 
directly connected to women's social, sexual and economic subordination under 
patriarchy, and as that it is nothing more or less than part of women's 
oppression and social colonization." 
</P>
<P>
 Giobbe, a former prostitute turned activist who testified before the Meese 
Commission as a survivor of commercial exploitation, is active in anti-porn 
legislation. She says she comes at her beliefs "personally, politically and 
theoretically. (Pornography) is something that hurts women," she says. "It 
hurts your dignity. It hurts your health. It hurts your mind, spirit and body. 
These premises came from the lived experiences of women like myself. These 
women aren't finding this particularly empowering." 
</P>
<P>
 Bright is by no means the first self-described feminist to draw the wrath of 
her sisters over matters of the flesh. She is merely a lightning rod for a 
controversy that has seethed in this country since the late 19th-Century writer 
and activist Victoria Woodhull (the first woman to run for President of the 
United States) drove a wedge through the budding women's movement by insisting 
that free love was as unconditional a goal as female suffrage. 
</P>
<P>
 With such feminist credentials as a women's studies degree and a history of 
women's-rights activism, Bright dismisses the anti-porn arguments of what she 
calls "the Fundamental Feminists" as deterministic, dogmatic and, well, prudish 
and uptight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happened to saying, 'Sexual speech is important?' " she asks. "Of 
course, go ahead and make a legal basis for it, but sexual speech, sexual 
expression, sexual artistry, sexuality is important. It's vital. It's who we 
are. And why are we trying to keep suppressing it and why do we think it's so 
ugly?" 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to navigating the tricky questions surrounding date rape and 
sexual harassment, Bright, a rape survivor herself, argues that female 
reluctance to initiate or take responsibility for a sexual experience muddies 
the issue of consent. Sexuality equals empowerment -- "When women feel 
confident about saying yes to sex, it gets a lot easier to say no," is her 
stock sound-bite response. "Instead of sexual repression and silence, for me 
it's more openness about sexuality. That is what gives children and women -- 
the two groups that are always thought of as being sexually at a disadvantage 
and victimized -- a chance to react strongly with some kind of confidence and 
sense of intactness." 
</P>
<P>
 Bright's critics charge that such answers at best ignore the realities of 
women's oppression and at worst support it. And, in truth, Bright's arguments 
can get solipsistic, if not downright sloppy. Her response to the possible 
negative affects of pornography -- "when it isn't a sexual image, no one 
worries what we're going to do about it. People don't really believe that a war 
movie will make you buy a gun and shoot somebody" -- doesn't reflect the fact 
that the question of whether seeing violence causes violence is far from 
settled.  
</P>
<P>
 But Bright claims that she realizes that life off-stage is not as simple as 
her glib, flashy shoot-from-the-hip rejoinders make it out to be. "In my 
efforts to be encouraging, charming, coaxing and reassuring about sexuality, I 
think, for some people, it just sounds like I'm making it sound so easy, like 
'tra-la-la, you know, hopping down the bunny path of sexual freedom,' " she 
says. "I emphasize that because in America there's always an emphasis on the 
hardships and the dangers of sex. And I would like to say, 'Would you please 
shut up about the hardships for a moment?' But I'm not ignorant of that. I feel 
bad when people think that I don't take into account the pain."  
</P>
<P>
 And the Bright side has a few criticisms of its own. These feminists accuse 
Dworkin, MacKinnon and others of exploiting women's sexual anxiety and fear of 
rape, and oppose legislation of sexuality -- whether it's the banning of 
pornography or Antioch College's Sexual Consent Policy, a rigorous, 
step-by-step guideline for sexual behavior and consent adopted at the Ohio 
school that students are required to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a younger generation of women just doesn't buy that anymore," 
says Palac, the 30-year-old San Francisco editor who is compiling an 
audio-erotica CD for Time-Warner called Cyborgasm. "And they're not so into 
trashing men. We don't want to sit around and talk about what's wrong. We want 
to talk about what's right." 
</P>
<P>
 Closing ranks on this side of the divide is a diverse group of renegade 
feminists. Many, like sexually explicit performance artist Annie Sprinkle and 
erotic filmmaker Candida Royale, are themselves former prostitutes, porn 
actresses and strippers who not only disagree with Giobbe's views of the 
oppressiveness of pornography but are creating women-oriented erotic works. 
Others include pop and alternative voices Palac and lesbian S/M author Pat 
Califia and, from academia, people like Christina Hoff Summers and Paglia. 
While these women are not monolithic in their opinions and ideas, their 
attitudes tend to bring Emma Goldman up to date: If I can't orgasm, you can 
keep your revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tantalizing message, especially for some young women struggling to 
integrate feminist dogma and feminine desire.  
</P>
<P>
 "Susie's celebration of erotica, that was the strongest point for me," says 
21-year-old Ophelia Navarro, one of the two students responsible for bringing 
Bright to Wellesley. "In my women's studies class, when arguments like that 
were brought up -- examples of MacKinnon -- that pornography is bad, they 
virtually went unchallenged." 
</P>
<P>
 For women like Navarro, Bright's breezy sexcapades are a welcome change. "I 
just thought feminism was anti-pornography and that was the only way to go," 
says Kelly Besser, a women's studies major at UCLA. "When I was reading Susie's 
books, I felt a parallel with my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Bright, by her own admission, has originated few of these ideas. Paglia, who 
had a falling-out with Bright in 1992 over personal differences, says that 
Bright is intelligent but calls her an "anti-intellectual who doesn't want any 
deep thinking." Bright's talent, Paglia says, and many agree, is that "she's a 
great entertainer." This may diminish her in the eyes of Paglia, but to others, 
this quality makes her the cultural force that she is.  
</P>
<P>
 "She has a sort of mission around sexual pleasure that I think is unique," 
says sociologist Irvine. "Nobody else has really done that in a performance 
kind of way. She makes people laugh. She's entertaining. She allows people to 
feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 DISCUSSING THE INTRICACIES of your sex life may not be everybody's idea of a 
great job, but it is a living. In fact, as her audience has grown and 
broadened, Bright has recently been able to fulfill the dream of every '50s 
housewife -- she got out of her city apartment and into a house in the 'burbs. 
Some people, she jokes, accuse her of selling out. But what could she do? She's 
got Aretha to look after. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends in both the commercial part of the sex business and in sex therapy 
have said that it can be very difficult with family life because your kids 
might get embarrassed about who you are, what you do," says Bright, whose 
living room is adorned with all manner of erotic art. "It's not even that I'm 
worried. I'm just dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But fame, especially this particular brand, has a price. Her fans can be as 
high voltage as her critics and some find it hard to tell where the 
professional leaves off and the person begins. Although Bright always harps on 
the boundaries between fantasy and reality, sexual expression and sexual 
behavior, some people still don't get it. She warns that people coming on to 
her like she's some kind of "sexual wonder dog" won't make it to first base.  
</P>
<P>
 Bright insists, and many of her friends confirm, that every night is not orgy 
night at the Bright household. "I can't say often enough that I fall asleep 
before everybody," she says, pointing out that she's a single parent. "I'm the 
one on weekend nights watching reruns on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Bright jokes that lately her hectic schedule keeps her from enjoying the kind 
of lifestyle she advocates -- a condition she calls "busyogamous." Even when 
she does slow down enough to find a partner, her open-book approach to her own 
sex life can get in the way. The fact that she shares her sex life with a 
rapidly expanding public doesn't always sit well with a partner-to-be. "The 
times when I felt the most vulnerable is when somebody close to me rejected me 
for my sex work," she says. "That was very painful. Because I am intensely 
loyal to the people I love." 
</P>
<P>
 Because criticism of the philosophy of Susie Bright veers very close to 
criticism of the life of Susie Bright, she is also remarkably vulnerable to 
rejection from her audience. At a speech recently at UC Berkeley, the room was 
filled with highly politicized, academic feminist types. Bright was asked a 
question she has heard countless times before, about how race and class issues 
affect the question of feminist pornography. Afterward, some audience members 
said they felt that Bright's response -- a slightly off-the-point look at 
pornography in different cultures -- didn't really address the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 When later informed that her answer was found wanting, Bright reacted as if 
she'd been slapped. "Time and time again, there's some sanctimonious prude 
coming in under the guise of leftist politics saying that bread issues 
supersede sexual issues and that sexual issues are a luxury," she said, half 
fuming, half crying. "And that's part of their conservatism."  
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that after so many trips around the lecture circuit, Bright 
would be inured to this type of negative feedback. "No, I'm not," she says. 
"Because people go into it behind my back," she adds, apparently mystified that 
everyone with a bone to pick hadn't come up to her book-signing table afterward 
to hash the whole thing out. "I feel like I'm dealing with a lot of dishonesty. 
I was dealing with race and class issues in pornography when they were picking 
their noses."  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it isn't easy being Susie Bright, although onstage she makes it 
look that way. And it's in being Susie Bright -- not the construction of her 
arguments -- that her real significance lies. People would be hard-pressed to 
find any discrepancies between the values Susie Bright lives by and the ones 
she espouses. Unlike many of today's media darlings, she practices what she 
preaches, literally.  
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest question that we get here at GV is some variation on 'am I 
normal?' " says Good Vibrations representative Laura Miller, a friend of 
Bright. "We're all raised to believe that our sexuality is unacceptable, and we 
may be open about some parts of it, but there's always one part that you feel 
completely ashamed of. What Bright does is treat sexuality, fantasy, whatever, 
as something completely normal and acceptable. And she makes people feel 
accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why, when she cracked open the backstage door at the 92nd Street 
Y, people in the audience gasped as if they had caught a glimpse of Axl Rose. 
Or why the crowd at Wellesley endured the hourlong delay in the chilly New 
England night, waiting for Bright to appear.  
</P>
<P>
 It could also explain why even the Berkeley student who complained loudest 
about Bright's weak "race and class" answer ran up to a friend right after the 
conference and squealed, "Guess who I just saw speak? Susie Bright!"

 THE WAR: A Memoir by Marguerite Duras, translated from the French by Barbara 
Bray (The New Press: $10; 183 pp.). In a series of intense sketches, Duras 
recalls her life in occupied Paris during the last days of World War II.She 
describes the agony of waiting to learn if her husband survived the 
concentration camps -- and the heart-wrenching effort to restore some semblance 
of humanity to the wasted skeleton who returned. Pausing in her search for 
news, she reflects, "We're the only ones who are still waiting, in a suspense 
as old as time, that of women, always, everywhere, waiting for the men to come 
home from the war." In another episode, she plays a deadly game of cat and 
mouse with an amorous Gestapo officer, evading his advances while her comrades 
in the Resistance plan his execution. Reissued on the 50th anniversary of the 
liberation of Paris, Duras' memoir recalls little-known episodes in the 
struggle against Nazism.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: SATISFACTION GUARANTEED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Being funny comes easy to young adult writer Ron Koertge. The author of "The 
Arizona Kid" and "The Harmony Arms" outdoes himself in his latest comic novel, 
Tiger, Tiger, Burning Bright (Orchard: $15.95). Koertge's hero Jesse lives in a 
sleepy, dried-out Southern California town named Norbu. His dad has split a 
while back for parts unknown, his mom is the town chiropractor and Pappy, who 
lives with them, is a lovable old cowhand who is teetering toward senility. 
</P>
<P>
 Pappy's daughter wants to put him in the Golden Acres nursing home before he 
does something dangerous, like burning the house down -- either while he's 
cooking his favorite dish (canned beans, of course) or when he drifts off to 
sleep smoking a cigarette (this he does watching his favorite videotape, one of 
Dorothy Hamill figure-skating two decades ago). Jesse, who idolizes Pappy, 
mounts a heavy campaign to keep him home. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome for all, without giving too much away, is entirely satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 The northern part of the state is the setting in California Blue by David 
Klass (Scholastic Press: $13.95). In this new novel by the author of the 
award-winning "Wrestling With Honor" an amateur lepidopterist (that's a 
butterfly enthusiast) with a dying father and an unfortunate crush on his 
biology teacher discovers an endangered species in the Northern California 
forest near his home. The only problem is that his find may spell disaster for 
most of the town's breadwinners, who are loggers in the same forest where the 
fragile creatures live. Suspense -- and some violence -- ensue in this tale of 
a teen-age rebel with a timely cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Also of note: Jacqueline Woodson's "Maizon at Blue Hill" was an ALA Best Book 
award-winner. Her new novel for young adults, I Hadn't Meant to Tell You This 
(Delacorte Press: $14.95) concerns a friendship that springs up, against all 
odds, between 13-year-old Marie, an upper-middle-class black girl and a 
classmate Marie's father considers "white trash." . . . For Floyd, Native 
American culture isn't just a hobby -- he believes his destiny is to be a 
Native American; he signs school projects "Charly Brave Crow, a.k.a. Floyd 
Rayfield." James Bennett's novel Dakota Dream (Scholastic: $13.95) could have 
been an annoying wanna-be tale of one white boy's quest to do the impossible. 
But when teen-aged Floyd escapes a Dickensian "group home" and lights out for 
the Black Hills territory of the Dakota Sioux, his dreams take on a realistic 
shape. . . . There's now a handsome new illustrated edition of Chicano author 
Rudolfo Anaya's 1973 coming-of-age-in-the-Southwest novel Bless Me, Ultima 
(Warner: $19.95) with color paintings by Bernadette Vigil. This tale of a young 
boy torn between disparate branches of his close-knit rural family is one of 
the sharpest writings about childhood's wonders and terrors since Joyce's 
"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man." . . . Anaya, by the way, is one of the 
authors and artists represented in the coffee-table-worthy volume called Here 
Is My Kingdom: Hispanic-American Literature and Art for Young People, edited by 
Charles Sullivan, with forward by Luis R. Cancel (Abrams: $24.95). Poems and 
fragments of prose by authors such as Nicholasa Mohr and Octavio Paz are paired 
with full-color artwork reflecting Latino culture by the likes of Frida Kahlo 
and Rufino Tamayo. . . . Speaking of things ethnic, The Italian American Family 
Album (Oxford University Press: $19.95), by Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler is the 
second in a fine new series, following "The Chinese American Family Album." 
Among people covered in the second volume are such immigrant luminaries as the 
Grucci fireworks family, Eleanor Cutri Smeal (former president of NOW) and 
Mario Puzo ("The Godfather"). . . .

DANIELLE STEEL, IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leila Cobo-Hanlon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Releasing a novel by a best-selling author simultaneously in both English and 
Spanish is not a common publishing occurrence in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unprecedented, as a matter of fact. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the author turns out to be no less than Danielle Steel, one would 
imagine that a frenzy of marketing and strategy would have preceded this 
groundbreaking event. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, not really. Instead, the launching of Steel's newest book, 
"The Gift"/"El Regalo," which appeared in both languages in bookstores the 
first week of this month, has been one big experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did this very quickly, as something we can learn from," said 
Dell/Delacorte president Carole Baron. "Danielle and I had been talking about 
it for a long time . . . and when we thought of doing her next book, we thought 
of also having a Spanish edition." But, she added, "I'm not looking to make 
money on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that Steel has a knack for making it to the top of the bestseller lists 
nationwide, with a decent marketing plan, making money would seem to be a 
pretty safe bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishing in Spanish is a growing trend in this country, due in part to a 
burgeoning Latino population and to the success of original Spanish titles, 
such as Laura Esquivel's "Like Water for Chocolate" ("Como agua para 
chocolate"), a hit in both languages. Publishing Esquivel in Spanish was the 
author's idea, says Martha Levin, publisher of Anchor Books (a division of 
Bantam/Doubleday/Dell and so a sister company to Steel's publisher), and the 
person responsible for "Como agua." "I am hoping there's a market for ('El 
Regalo'), and I think we may be underestimating the diverse readership out 
there," says Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Spanish readers in the United States had to wait for the 
translated version of English titles to be published in other countries and 
then imported here, at higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But simultaneously launching the translated version of an English original, 
and publishing it as a cheaper trade paperback, is taking the trend a step 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know who our audience is, and the booksellers are not sure about 
their constituency," Baron said. "We printed a small number of copies, 
comparatively, for Danielle Steel, and if it takes off, we'll add more money to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steel's popularity in 28 languages around the globe, including Spanish 
(although there are no sales figures for each country), made her a logical 
choice to assess the potential for Spanish readership of bestsellers in this 
country, according to Lisa Seher, who works for the Lipton Communications 
Group, in charge of targeting Dell's Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
 However, says Baron, "I'm not sure that (Dell/Delacorte) really knows how to 
reach Spanish language readers, which is why we decided not to do it ("El 
Regalo") in hardcover." As a matter of fact, "we were told the Spanish market 
would accept the trade paperback better," Baron says. 
</P>
<P>
 "El Regalo" was translated by the Spanish publisher Plaza & Janes, which 
retains the rights to the hardcover edition in Spain. The translation, in 
Castilian Spanish, has not been tested on readers here, says Evan Boorstyn, 
senior publicist at Dell. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Boorstyn, aside from a Spanish-language print campaign, 
availability of "El Regalo" will be teased in all advertising for "The Gift." 
The Spanish version, he says, will be available in all major supermarkets and 
traditional book venues, including English bookstores with Spanish-language 
sections. The two largest bookstore chains in the L.A. area, B. Dalton and 
Crown will be carrying "El Regalo." 
</P>
<P>
 If it is a success, no doubt other bestselling authors will also go bilingual 
. . . but it's still one big experiment. Leila Cobo-Hanlon

TO CATCH A WHALE; WITH HANDMADE SEALSKIN BOATS AND SNOWMOBILES, WITH 
19TH-CENTURY HARPOONS AND CELLULAR PHONES, ALASKA'S INUPIAT KEEP ALIVE THE MOST 
PROFOUND RITE OF THEIR ANCIENT CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Balzar, John Balzar, the Times' Northwest Bureau chief, regards whale 
blubber as the most challenging food he has ever eaten. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally, after a long arctic winter, the vast polar ice pack cracks and slowly 
opens up along Alaska's north coast, exposing a thin ribbon of ocean between 
two vast frozen plates. Spring is the season of wonder here: The temperature 
has risen to 5 degrees, the wind blusters out of the east with the distant 
tease of more warmth to come, and darkness has lifted -- the sun bobs in the 
sky 23 hours a day. Now, as they have throughout their history, Inupiat Eskimos 
advance onto the blue-white shore ice in a ritual of renewal, affirmation, hope 
and blood. They have come to hunt the bowhead whale. 
</P>
<P>
 George Ahmaogak faces the ocean, the hood of his parka ringed with a ruff of 
wolverine fur and his almond eyes alive with anticipation. He grips my arm with 
a heavy-gloved hand and nods toward the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 " Agvik ," he whispers. "Big one!" 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the water, a shiny wet-black hump breaks the surface, a spout of gray 
steam emerges with a hiss, and an otherworldly low-pitched song vibrates the 
air around us. A shiver runs down my neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a *%* big whale," says Ahmaogak, peppering his speech, as usual, with 
the unprintable. A smile breaks out on his ruddy face. A smile with bite to it, 
the smile of a hunter who has sighted his prey. 
</P>
<P>
 At 45, Ahmaogak (pronounced Ah-MA-walk ) is the charismatic three-term mayor 
of Alaska's North Slope Borough, the northernmost municipal government in the 
United States. But more important, at least when the arctic whales migrate, he 
is one of a select group of men and women known as whaling captains. He and the 
others shoulder the responsibility of providing traditional food and keeping 
alive the most profound rite of Inupiat culture: the catching of the whales. 
</P>
<P>
 This is hunting on an epic scale. Hundreds of villagers are involved in the 
chase and conquest of one of the largest animals in the world. And there is no 
such thing as an observer. You are part of the crew or you are off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ahmaogak's signal, five whalers and I grab axes and chop a trail through 
blocky ice ridges between camp and the open water so Ahmaogak's two boats can 
be skidded to the edge and launched. One is an umiaq , a paddle craft out of 
the Stone Age made of laced sealskin, the other an 18-foot aluminum skiff with 
an 80-horsepower outboard motor. This is all-out work, and the crew breathes 
long streams of steam into the cold air. As ice cakes my beard, sweat runs down 
my back under my heavy parka. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmaogak, as befits his captain's role, supervises. "How long do you think 
you'd last if you went into the water?" he asks me at one point.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just seconds," I hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is full of danger," he says grimly. "And you have to know 
what the *%* you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 I, of course, have no idea what I'm doing. I put my head down and chop.  
</P>
<P>
 Another whale -- closer this time, huge -- surfaces and blows. Pssssshhhh! I 
chop faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon, we go out there. Then it's boom boom," Ahmaogak says to no one 
in particular. He flashes his teeth in another wild smile. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR CENTURIES, GEORGE AHMAOGAK'S ANCESTORS HAVE LIVED AND whaled in the land 
above the Arctic Circle. Anthropologists believe the Inupiat are the 
descendants, along with other Eskimo groups, of the second wave of migrants to 
cross the Bering Sea about 4000 BC. Early evidence of their whaling skills 
dates from at least AD 800. By the 1800s, when Europeans finally ventured 
through the Bering Strait, these Eskimos were the best sea-mammal hunters on 
the planet, and their most formidable prey was the bowhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the buffalo for the Plains Indian, the whale was the stuff of survival 
and social structure for the Inupiat. Whale meat was their food; whale oil, 
their source of heat and light. The Inupiat commonly lived in separate family 
groups, but for the whaling effort, they pooled their resources and talents, 
with umiaq owners and the best whalers as leaders. Their most important social 
gatherings were celebrations of the hunt.  
</P>
<P>
 Today in Barrow, and in seven other villages that dot the 89,000-square-mile 
North Slope Borough, the Inupiat continue to practice "subsistence" hunting -- 
and the whale remains their most prized prey. The whalers are still the 
community leaders. During my visit, the Borough Assembly couldn't muster a 
quorum at its monthly meeting in Barrow -- too many of its members were out on 
the ice, captaining whale boats. And, as they have through the ages, entire 
villages still assemble on the ice to haul in a whale and celebrate its 
capture. 
</P>
<P>
 To outsiders, it can seem a curious world. In 1994, these Eskimos take Hawaii 
vacations and own big-screen TVs. They wear starched white shirts and drive 
fancy pickups. Some are businessmen, and all of them are shareholders of the 
Arctic Slope Regional Corp., which was established by the federal Alaskan 
Native Land Claims Settlement Act in 1972. Thanks to the tax levies they 
collect on the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, which lie on their ancestral lands, and 
the corporation's investments, families of the North Slope Borough have the 
29th highest median income in the United States. But they also must spend a 
lot: A bag of Chee-Toes costs $4.99 in Barrow. And what other jurisdiction with 
so few citizens -- 6,300 total, 70% of whom are native -- pays its chief 
elected official $160,000 a year? 
</P>
<P>
 For the Inupiat, however, dollar prosperity is no substitute for whaling; it 
is a means to achieve it. Captains pony up thousands for the canvas tents, 
snowmobiles (which the Alaskans call snow machines), food, fuel, boats, weapons 
and radios. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, in the late 1970s the Inupiat applied their new wealth to 
scientific studies and international lobbying, beating back angry attempts by 
environmentalists to eliminate the native hunt along with all other forms of 
whaling. Now, the International Whaling Commission grants the Inupiat an annual 
quota of bowhead, based on the number scientists judge can be harvested without 
further jeopardizing this endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with their prehistoric skin boats and turn-of-the-century harpoons, 
with their snow machines and rescue helicopters, with their old razor-sharp 
pole knives and fur clothing, with their briefcases and stock portfolios, the 
Inupiat Eskimos hover between the past and the present. Holding onto the hunt, 
they believe, provides the ballast that keeps them upright in the late 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our food, our culture, our tradition, our heritage," Ahmaogak says 
simply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without whaling there would be no purpose to Barrow," says Glenn Roy Edwards, 
Ahmaogak's second in command and a jet-set businessman with the Arctic Slope 
Regional Corp. "I depend on my job, I like my job. But if it came down to a 
choice, I'd leave it to come out here and go whaling. I am first a whaler." 
</P>
<P>
 "GET ON. YOU'LL HAVE TO STEER THE SLED." 
</P>
<P>
 "Me?" 
</P>
<P>
 A resupply party is about to depart Barrow for Ahmaogak's whaling camp, about 
10 miles out on the shore ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Might as well learn now," I'm told. 
</P>
<P>
 In coastal Barrow, all the streets are gravel, and those that lead to the 
ocean are not impeded by stop signs. We have driven off the end of one of them. 
In summer, we would be on an Arctic Ocean beach. Today our caravan of three 
snow machines is aimed north on the ice. One of them tows a heavy wooden sled. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," I say, "What do I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 I grab the back of the sled and position my feet on the runners. An hour 
later, after bouncing across fractured shadowy white and aquamarine ice, I have 
become a sled steerer. Or at least I was able to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
 Winding through a two-story-tall pressure ridge, where shifting ice plates 
have collided and formed a mini-mountain range, we come screaming into the 
camp. It is pitched in what might be called a flat meadow of ice, lightly 
dusted with dry snow. Ahmaogak and his crew set it up a few days ago, when the 
ice first began to break up. It holds as many as 10 whalers -- the crew waxes 
and wanes with the press of outside business and the presence or absence of 
whales. At the moment, there are six of us packed into the camp's one 
plywood-floored 10-by-12 canvas tent. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, an umiaq and an aluminum boat rest on sleds next to crates of 
supplies and fuel. Everything is camouflaged white. Whales are known to be 
spooked by colors. High-powered rifles are slung casually on snow machines and 
propped against the tent. This is polar bear country, and polar bears aren't 
spooked by much of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter-mile away, across much thinner "young" ice, is the crack where the 
polar pack begins to recede. Depending on the wind and ocean currents, this 
"lead" of water can grow to almost three miles wide, only to close right back 
up hours later. Through this lead, the bowheads are migrating northeast from 
their winter grounds in the Bering Sea to their summer range north of the 
Canadian Yukon in the Beaufort Sea.  
</P>
<P>
 With the ice in front of us constantly moving, the landscape changes as if in 
a time-lapse movie. Watch carefully and you can see floes tugged this way and 
that. Ten minutes later, it's all different. The ice we are camped on could 
break loose at any time and join this flotilla. For the next seven days, we 
will rarely take off our boots and never remove our clothes, always ready to 
dash for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As the newcomer, I am the lowest person in the crew hierarchy; never mind that 
I am also the oldest and city-softest. I am assigned to chop and melt ice for 
fresh water, make the coffee -- endless pots of coffee -- do the dishes, help 
cook, chop trail, steer sleds. Even the children -- apprentice whalers -- 
outrank me. 
</P>
<P>
 I have lots of questions. Like, how do I get fresh water from a sheet of 
frozen sea ice? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's old ice there, the salt has leached out," Ahmaogak points to a nearby 
jumble of clear ice blocks with slightly rounded edges. "Now that, that is sea 
ice. No good." He points to another pile of younger ice farther away with 
sharper corners and a bluish cast. It is still filled with salt. 
</P>
<P>
 With no warning, he laughs -- a huge, contagious ha-ha-ha bellow, entirely 
free of cynicism. I am, as he will tell me from time to time, "a *%* dummy. Ha 
ha ha." I always laugh too.  
</P>
<P>
 It's dinner time, and the lead is closed so the atmosphere at camp is relaxed. 
Ahmaogak's wife, Maggie, is demonstrating the two recipes in the Inupiat 
cookbook -- animal flesh, uncooked or boiled. She is executive director of the 
Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, the Inupiat organization that manages the 
annual whale hunts and lobbies Eskimo interests before international 
regulators. Outside the tent, she opens a wooden grub box and gathers an 
armload of frozen caribou chunks, each a square the size of a fist. Here, the 
outdoors serves as meat locker, and ice chests are used to keep items such as 
soda pop from freezing. Tonight's menu turns out to be, first, slivers of 
uncooked caribou shaved from the frozen chunks, then caribou soup -- boiled, 
half-raw meat in a liquid thickened with pancake mix because someone forgot to 
bring flour. 
</P>
<P>
 A kerosene heater and a one-burner propane stove keep the temperature as 
uncomfortably hot inside the tent as it is uncomfortably cold outside. Idle 
time is passed smoking cigarettes and cigars and making small talk, half of it 
conducted in the language of the Inupiat, an emphatic monotone that few 
non-natives even attempt. We sit inside on storage boxes or on polar bear rugs 
that double as sleeping mats.  
</P>
<P>
 Always, someone is outside on watch, for bears, for signs that our ice is 
breaking loose, for whales. I feel myself becoming lazy and comfortable. 
Ahmaogak, lounging on a bearskin, detects a shift in the wind and is suddenly 
worried. If the breeze strengthens from the north, the ice pack in the distance 
could be propelled our way. 
</P>
<P>
 "That big ice out there starts moving, well, *%*. We gotta be ready to 
evacuate, or we'll end up in Siberia. Ha ha ha." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmaogak, like many Inupiat, speaks English softly, like a whisper brought up 
the register to normal volume, and gives equal emphasis to each syllable and 
every word, as if they are not to be expended lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the arctic twilight that passes for night, six of us prepare to sleep 
together Eskimo style, under shared blankets. Wind rattles the canvas. "*%*. I 
hope we don't have to evacuate at 4 a.m., if this country goes to hell," 
Ahmaogak says. 
</P>
<P>
 The snoring that commences puts me at ease. Better than listening for the ice 
to crack underneath me. Below that is 120 feet of frigid Arctic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 ALTHOUGH LEGEND TELLS OF BOWHEADS MORE THAN 60 FEET IN length, most of the 
large ones documented now are in the 50-foot range, and 30-footers are most 
commonly caught by the Inupiat. Chunkier than most whales, a big bowhead can 
weigh up to 100 tons. These days, the International Whaling Commission 
estimates that the bowhead population hovers between 6,900 and 9,200 in the 
waters off Alaska, compared with an estimated 20,000 a century and a half ago. 
But bowheads are increasing in number, and the Barrow whalers have been 
allotted a 1994 spring quota of 18 whales, including those that are landed and 
those that are harpooned but lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowheads are in the family of baleen whales, with giant mouths in the shape of 
upside-down smiles. Instead of teeth, they have an arrangement of slats, like 
vertical Venetian blinds. These baleens strain seawater for krill, the small 
shrimp that is the bowhead's main food. Bowhead eyes are down by their bellies, 
just at the corner of their mouths, and their breathing holes are atop a 
streamlined hump that forms the apex of a bow-like silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling on the edges and leads of the shifting polar ice, the bowhead has 
developed the ability to break through ice two feet thick to reach air. (Those 
were not bowheads but less-well-adapted gray whales that made news around the 
world when they found themselves trapped under the ice near Barrow in 1988.) No 
one knows how long bowheads live. But twice in recent years, the Inupiat have 
found ivory and jade harpoon tips embedded in the blubber of captured whales, 
which tantalizes the imagination: Such tips were last used on harpoons at the 
turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other great whales, the bowhead was savaged in the 19th Century by 
commercial whaling. In 1848, with other waters exhausted, Yankee whalers 
finally ventured north, through the strait between Siberia and Alaska, 
following the oil-rich bowheads. Within four years, there were 220 whaling 
ships in the Arctic, seeking oil and whalebone and bringing whites into 
everyday contact with the Eskimo. By the turn of the century, the abundant 
bowhead was dying out and so was commercial whaling. 
</P>
<P>
 Though contact with whites diminished along with commercial whaling on 
Alaska's north coast, the Inupiat culture had already been changed irrevocably. 
Missionaries had arrived, white diseases had taken their toll, and the natives 
had begun to adopt new weapons and tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Today in the Arctic, the traces of the Yankee whaling days are easy to see -- 
in the bloodlines of the Eskimos, for instance, and in the Christian invocation 
pronounced whenever a whale is taken. Nowhere is the link so apparent as in the 
primary tools used by the contemporary Inupiat to hunt bowheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the harpoon cannons of the modern commercial whalers, the Inupiat 
harpoon is unchanged from those of Yankee whalers in the last century. Hand 
held and hand thrown, it carries a brass-tipped point and is fixed with a brass 
gun barrel. The harpoons are still manufactured in New England, once the 
capital of the Yankee whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack commences like this: The boat is driven, or paddled, alongside a 
surfacing whale. In the bow, the harpooner, standing within a few feet of the 
whale's back, jabs the animal. Once the tip of the harpoon is embedded in the 
blubber, it pulls off from the 10-foot wooden harpoon shaft and triggers the 
firing of a "bomb" from the gun barrel -- an exploding foot-long shell on a 
seven-second fuse. The harpoon tip is attached to 33 fathoms of rope and a 
large float that can be followed when the whale dives. If the shell penetrates 
deeply into the animal and explodes near a vital organ, the whale dies 
immediately. Other times, it can take a dozen or more bombs fired from a 
supplementary 50-pound brass shoulder gun.  
</P>
<P>
 A minimum crew in a motor-powered aluminum boat is three people. With it, the 
strategy is to strike with speed. Success with the much more commonly used 
umiaq requires stealth and as many as eight paddlers to follow and stay with 
the whale. Once a whale is struck, the chase can last for minutes or for hours. 
 
</P>
<P>
 " &*, DID YOU SNORE!" 
</P>
<P>
 Good. I must have slept after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmaogak fills a skillet with Crisco and fries egg rolls for breakfast, a 
good-luck gift from a Filipino, a friend who runs a taxi in Barrow -- one of 
among the dozens of outsiders who drift here hoping to share in the oil wealth. 
The coffee is rich and gritty, four handfuls of grounds dumped into a pot of 
melted ice. The tent fills with cigarette smoke and kerosene fumes. A portable 
receiver is tuned to Alaska Public Radio and a marine-band radio crackles with 
"good mornings" as the whalers -- there are 44 crews on the ice from Barrow 
this year -- check in with their families. I have never met an Eskimo who did 
not have at least one electronic receiver on at all times -- CB, TV, AM, FM -- 
often several together. And this year, Ahmaogak is experimenting with a new 
toy, a cellular telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask about two Eskimo myths I remember from my childhood. Back in their more 
nomadic days, I was told, they left their elderly behind in the snow when they 
could not keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 True, says one. Not true, says another. 
</P>
<P>
 How about the one where a male traveler was invited to sleep with the Eskimo's 
wife? 
</P>
<P>
 Used to be, if he liked you. But the missionaries took care of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmaogak has been described as "the Eskimo John Kennedy," a man who inspires 
his people. He is like no politician I have ever met -- confident, 
authentically magnetic, entirely open, rough-hewn, bawdy and temperamental. 
It's a rare elected official you don't mind sharing a tent with. Ahmaogak 
boasts of earning three days of "good time" off his 10-day jail sentence after 
a drunken binge. He is a champion of native rights but has hired plenty of 
non-natives to keep the town running smoothly. He and Maggie met in high school 
and married in Los Angeles while she attended MTI Business College and UCLA and 
he went to Northrop-Rice Aviation Institute of Technology in Inglewood. At home 
in Barrow, they have a 54-inch TV in the living room and a whale skull and 
several frozen seal carcasses in the front yard.  
</P>
<P>
 At some cue too subtle for me, everyone suddenly leaps up and explodes into 
motion. We jump onto snow machines and scream out to inspect the lead. In front 
of us, bowheads break the surface, their heads high out of the water.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking around -- looking for a trail through the ice. Wouldn't you?" 
says Ahmaogak. We listen to their colossal splashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmaogak surveys the ice and picks a spot to launch the boats. Whaling 
captains are years in the making -- men, and a few women, who have apprenticed 
for the job since their youth and who command the respect of enough villagers 
willing to sign on as crew. They must also be successful enough in their other 
lives to have the money to finance the endeavor.  
</P>
<P>
 We begin to chop trail. Good-natured harpooner Perry Okpeaha is helping; so is 
stoical shoulder-gunner Larry Itta and 12-year-old Qaiyaan Harcharek, a 
determined sixth-grader who is in his sixth season as apprentice whaler. 
</P>
<P>
 By midmorning, we have finished the trail and pulled the aluminum boat down to 
the water's edge, lifted it off its sled and skidded it to the lip of ice, 
which rises white for several inches above the water and descends translucent 
blue for a foot underneath. But the wind shifts and the lead begins to close. 
We retreat. At midafternoon, the water opens again, and the boat is launched. 
By 6:30, the crew has chased four whales but never quite come close enough for 
Okpeaha to hurl the harpoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The routine is typical and repeated often -- the crew advances, retreats, 
rests and then resumes the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 On the marine radio, static turns into cheers. A few miles west of us, captain 
Jake Adams has caught the first whale of the year for Barrow, a 28-footer. 
"Bambi," says Ahmaogak. Once Adams' whale is secured by a rope to the tail and 
maneuvered to the shore ice, the crew delivers a prayer of thanks. Then the 
village airwaves crackle into life, filled with the news. In Barrow and on the 
ice, snow machines are fired up to carry as many as can come out to Adams' camp 
to help pull the bowhead from the water and butcher it into slabs of blubber 
and meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The first whale of the year is always divided up among all the crews in 
Barrow. From then on, only those who come out onto the ice to help will receive 
a share. It can take up to 36 hours or more of nonstop effort to land and cut 
up a big bowhead. A large portion of the food is stockpiled for the year's many 
coming feasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Something else comes over the radio. Not far away the ice has broken loose and 
two crews are adrift in the sea. On a big sheet of ice, there is little 
immediate worry. But big sheets can shatter into little ones by force of waves 
or in a collision with drifting icebergs, and that can be catastrophic. A 
search-and-rescue helicopter is launched from Barrow to retrieve the crews and 
their gear. "Should have watched their back door. Gotta watch the back door," 
growls Ahmaogak. Ha ha ha. 
</P>
<P>
 We hurriedly check the ice at our own back door. Holding solid, say those who 
know such things. By now, I'm so spooked I step only in the footprints of 
someone else. I have been advised to carry a quick-draw sheath knife so that if 
I fall into the water, I can stab the ice and keep from slipping under until 
help arrives, if help is handy. I try to visualize the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 We spend the evening -- which looks almost the same as the morning under the 
arctic sun -- sitting on a boat sled, with a white canvas windbreak stretched 
behind us, quietly scanning the water for the steam geysers of surfacing 
whales. Hours pass with hardly a word. 
</P>
<P>
 Even here, the primitive landscape of ice and water is clouded by development. 
With the Prudhoe Bay oil fields now past their peak, oil companies have their 
eye on expanding offshore drilling in the Arctic Ocean to keep the Trans-Alaska 
pipeline flowing. The Inupiat strongly oppose the idea. Not only would they 
receive no tax revenues for operations beyond the three-mile coastal boundary, 
they also fear an oil-well blowout would jeopardize the survival of the 
bowhead. But they are plenty eager for more onshore drilling, particularly in 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the east. Their taxing authority would 
extend to such development, plus they hold mineral deeds to some of the 
potential sites. 
</P>
<P>
 As the winds pick up, massive ice floes begin to dance across the near 
horizon. "That is some heavy *%*," says Ahmaogak. "Imagine wind and current 
pushing on this -- that's our worry. No drilling rig could stand up to that." 
</P>
<P>
 AS LONG AS THE LEAD IS OPEN, WE SLEEP ONLY INTERMITTENTLY, ON NO schedule 
whatsoever. Sometimes the tent is too full, and I borrow a bearskin and curl up 
in an 18-foot skiff. It is hard to keep a grip on time. "I have a feeling it's 
going to be a long day tonight," is the way one of the other whalers puts it.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever stimulates Ahmaogak into action remains a mystery to me. One moment 
we are sitting quietly. And the next, scrambling.  
</P>
<P>
 Ahmaogak and crew launch the skin boat and come within feet of striking a 
whale that approaches head on. They paddle behind a distant iceberg and I find 
myself alone on the ice. Just two days ago, a polar bear wandered near camp. 
Ahmaogak could put both of his oversized arctic boots inside the bear's paw 
print. The marine radio has been reporting bears lurking around other camps. 
Where did they leave those rifles? I wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 A bowhead breaches 100 feet from the ice edge, its mighty head rising more 
than 20 feet out of the water. I look into its saucer-sized black eye, and it 
emits a ghostly blow. 
</P>
<P>
 I take my turn in the aluminum boat as the crew races up and down the lead, 
futilely chasing whales but coming so near to their submarine-sized backs that 
my chest pounds. Okpeaha raises his harpoon, once, twice, three times. Never 
quite close enough to let fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at camp, our share of Jake Adams' whale is delivered to the tent, and I 
cook the traditional uunaalik -- pungent, boiled finger-sized pieces of whale 
blubber and skin with the overpowering redolence of fish oil that brings the 
whole crew scrambling to the pot. Recipe: Boil strips of whale in water until 
the blubber floats, about five minutes. We also snack on crunchy frozen chunks 
of whitefish dipped in seal oil. One night we break from the native menu and I 
open several cans of chili, which is followed by a rousing after-supper bout of 
gas passing, men and women joining in uproariously without the slightest 
self-consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's change our diet!" says Ahmaogak during another lull in the action. We 
race off to hunt seals, but find none. We do find a new launch site and move 
our whaling boats from fragile ice to an even riskier location, where we have 
to leap across a watery two-foot crack to reach the lead. Here the ice is so 
thin and flexible it undulates to the rhythm of the sea waves. When the largest 
icebergs I've seen bear down on our camp, Ahmaogak laughs. "Maybe tomorrow we 
have to move camp back closer to town. Then we'll go have a shot of 
Courvoisier, a cigar and a shower. Ha ha ha. Or maybe we break off and ride to 
Siberia." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we stay put. Next day, the lead is clear. West of us, the whaling 
action picks up. Three whales are struck, and the chase is on. A cease-fire 
order comes via radio for the remaining crews while the pursuit continues. No 
whales are landed, although they eventually will begin to rot and float to the 
surface as "stinkers," animals that can be only partly salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Again the radio comes to life. Whaling captain Thomas Brower III has caught a 
33-footer. I am set to leave soon; it's now or never if I want to see a whale 
brought in. I set out in a snow machine for the 30-mile journey across the ice 
to the Brower camp, joining perhaps 90 whalers and villagers who will converge 
to pull the whale out of the water and divide it up.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of more than an hour, in a massive tug of war, we use rope, 
block and tackle to inch the rubbery, lifeless whale onto the ice. Men climb 
onto the nine-foot-high carcass to slice it, crosswise, into 18-inch strips of 
skin and blubber that are undercut and peeled off in an assembly-line 
operation. While the adults work, children bounce and play on the carcass. 
Finally, the meat and tongue and internal organs are divided up. The baleens 
will be scrimshawed and sold to tourists, the only cash derived from a whale. 
By the time the job is finished, a ragged circle of snow near the lead has 
turned bright red. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN I DRAG INTO CAMP 10 hours later, I'm as tired as I've ever been. I begin 
my goodbys.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, it is suggested, I'll come back for the nalukataq feast, which 
celebrates the end of the whaling season. Then there are the geese and ducks to 
hunt, as they migrate in their turn. "Boom boom," says the mayor. And after 
that the hunt for caribou and moose, and after that, the whales once again, 
during their return migration.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's something out here, isn't it?" Ha ha ha. Ahmaogak pulls off his 
polar-bear mitten, squeezes my hand and turns. He and his crew climb into the 
aluminum boat. The last I see of them are the backs of three Eskimo parkas, 
hunched against the wind, fur hood ruffs flying as the captain guns his 
outboard and disappears into a tangle of icebergs.

BRETTSCHNEIDER SEEKS AFTER-'LIFE'

<P>
 "One Life to Live" fans will have to say goodby to Mark Brettschneider, who 
plays Jason Webb. The show had no front-burner story line planned for the 
actor, who has decided to move on. Brettschneider's exit date is scheduled for 
August 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In the story line, Jason's December-May romance with Dorian Lord (Robin 
Strasser) was interesting for a time but fizzled. Most recently, Jason was 
becoming involved with unwed mother Beth Garvey (Dorothy Barton), but Beth died 
during a killer flu epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Delphi Harrington will return to "One Life to Live" in her 
former role of Aunt Kiki, the aunt of Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell), and Ryan 
Phillippe has reprised his former role of Billy Douglas. Susan Pellagrino has 
also returned in the role of Billy's mother, Virginia Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Douglas will make his daytime debut on "One Life to Live" 
mid-August in the role of Dylan Moody, brother of Luna Moody Holden (Susan 
Batten). 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas has made appearances on the nighttime series "Burke's Law," "Married 
... With Children," "Saved By the Bell" and "Red Shoe Diaries."

 Television time around the household of Lynn Herring (Lucy Coe on "General 
Hospital") and Wayne Northrup (Roman Brady on "Days of Our Lives") is limited 
when it comes to their 3-year-old son, Hank. The tyke is only allowed to watch 
two hours of television a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't like Hank to watch too much TV," says Herring. "So I came up 
with this plan. He gets to pick his shows -- they're usually on the Disney 
Channel." 
</P>
<P>
 Herring has some definite reasons for her strict TV policy. "I think kids' 
little brains get fried if they watch television all the time," she says. "They 
don't play outside as much, so they're not as physically active. Plus, their 
imaginations suffer, too -- they don't expand and grow like they should." 
</P>
<P>
 Herring also recently took time out from her busy "General Hospital" schedule 
to tape a public-service announcement for the Defenders Of Wildlife 
organization.

 Mark McEwen, weather reporter and entertainment editor of "CBS This Morning,"

LET'S R-U-M-B-L-E!!!; SHARP JABS, VICIOUS UPPERCUTS AND STINGING HOOKS AT THE 
WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP POETRY BOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Lewis MacAdams, Lewis MacAdams is a Los Angeles poet, journalist and 
filmmaker. His last piece for the magazine was Loose Threads, on the rise and 
fall of L.A. clothier Cross Colours.

 1. The Buildup. Bets are down. Brown paper bags have sprouted, Bible-Belt 
style, amid forests of 7-Up and Coke cans. The capacity crowd of more than 500, 
which has paid $15 for general admission tickets and $25 for ringside seats, 
has just settled down inside the remodeled Piggly Wiggly Super-Market when 
referee Peter Rabbit slinks into the middle of the ring. Long and lanky, 
wearing a fedora and a thrift-shop seersucker suit, Rabbit grabs a microphone 
as it descends into his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Ramona's dance hall in beautiful Taos, New Mexico," Rabbit thunders, 
"the Poetry Capital of the World . . ." The crowd explodes into cheers. " . . . 
the challenger Quincy Troupe versus the champion Simon Ortiz . . . for the 
Heavyweight Poetry Championship of the World!" The wise guys on the back patio 
at the Caffe Tazza have established Ortiz, who is from Acoma Pueblo, the oldest 
continuously inhabited place in North America, as the home state favorite at 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The Prize. A spotlight focuses on the Max M. Finstein Memorial Poetry Prize 
-- a bronzed boxing glove atop a wooden pyramid -- known simply as "The Max" 
and named in honor of the poet, communard and con man who died in 1980 when his 
pickup truck spun off the road in a snowstorm on his way to Los Angeles. 
Leaning against the trophy is a fist-sized silver belt buckle engraved with the 
words "The Max." Beside it is a navy-blue baseball cap, the bill bordered with 
cut beads plotted and sewn by Cheyenne artist Joyce Starr. The crown says in 
white letters "World Heavyweight Champion Poet." 
</P>
<P>
 3. The Rules. Two poets, last year's champ and a challenger, selected by the 
World Poetry Bout Assn., compete in a 10-round bard-off. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, scoring is based on the Illinois Boxing Commission's 10-point must 
system. Each of the three judges, using entirely personal criteria, must award 
10 points to the round's winner; the loser usually gets nine unless there's an 
intellectual knockdown. In practice, the judges simply designate the winner for 
each round. 
</P>
<P>
 Poets must employ the naked human voice only, except during the seventh round, 
when accompaniment is allowed. (Last year, in taking the championship from 
Ntozake Shange, who used a boombox tape to back her poem, Ortiz shuffled river 
stones against one another to frame the title piece of his collection, "Woven 
Stone.") 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th round is extemporaneous. Each poet draws a slip of paper from a hat 
and has 30 seconds to create a poem based on the idea or phrase on the paper. 
(Bout vets still consider Victor Hernandez Cruz's inspired 1989 improvisation 
on the word "mud" the finest 10th round in championship history.) 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for the first time, poems must remain within a five-minute limit. 
(Wags refer to this as the Anne Waldman rule.) 
</P>
<P>
 4. The Contestants. In the recesses of Ramona's, handlers are giving the poets 
last-minute instructions. "It's a great crowd," Quincy's wife, Margaret, 
exhorts. "Don't hold anything back." Ortiz huddles in the green room with two 
Indian poets, Lance Henson and Sherman Alexie, who read in a preliminary bout 
two nights before. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in the Red Corner . . ." Rabbit intones, gesturing to an empty stool on 
the right side of the ring. "He battles demons every day. He walks unknown 
trails and many follow. New Mexico can be very proud of S-i-i-m-on " -- he 
elongates the syllables, stretching them back like the rubber in a slingshot -- 
" Or-t-i-i-z!! " The slight, bespectacled Ortiz, dressed for work in sneakers 
and jeans, bounces down the aisle, carrying a folder full of poems. The 
audience rises to cheer. Ortiz's sister, who has never heard him read, 
surprises him with a shout of "My brother!" and hugs him before he can reach 
the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Son of a railroad worker and a distinguished potter, Ortiz has been the 
Acomas' official "interpreter" to the outer world and a lieutenant governor of 
his pueblo, and is probably the greatest of all American Indian poets. The 
Native Writers' Circle of the Americas, an organization of indigenous writers, 
last year named him the winner of its second annual Lifetime Achievement award 
(novelist N. Scott Momaday won the first). In 1992, Ortiz wrote the narrative 
for the PBS documentary "Surviving Columbus." His 14th collection, "After and 
Before the Lightning," will be published this month. 
</P>
<P>
 A man of humility and strength, Ortiz is also, when alcohol engulfs him, a 
mean, scary, falling-down drunk, who knows the insides of VA hospitals all over 
the West. This contradiction is often at the center of his poems. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in the Black Corner . . ." Rabbit growls, pointing to the stool at his 
left. "His line is long. He spits on capital letters. He's gonna knock you out 
! The challenger, Quincy 'The Jazzman' Troupe!!" 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet, 2 inches and 220 pounds, Troupe towers over Ortiz. A professor of 
American and Caribbean literature and creative writing at UC San Diego, winner 
of the 1980 American Book Award for Poetry for "Snake-back Solos" and the 
co-author of "Miles: The Autobiography," one of the most inspiring books ever 
written about American music, Troupe strides down the aisle in a T-shirt 
imprinted with Miles Davis' face, his dreads bouncing underneath a multicolored 
baseball cap with "music heals" scrawled across the bill. The applause is 
noticeably restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Your Reporter -- I own a pair of Maxes myself -- the original version, 
designed by Linda Fleming, a solid bronze boxing glove on an industrial spring. 
One sits on top of the TV set. The other I use as a doorstop. 
</P>
<P>
 I won my first Max in 1984, when I blew Chicago poet Terry Jacobus out of the 
ring. To this day, he disputes the decision. Jacobus is not the only poet who 
swears he or she's been robbed. The great Nuyorican poet Victor Hernandez Cruz 
still won't accept that Anne Waldman, the doyenne of Boulder's Naropa 
Institute, the Buddhist Notre Dame, defeated him in 1989. Andrei Codrescu, best 
known for his surreal mini-raps on National Public Radio's "All Things 
Considered," has never admitted that Cruz outpointed him in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 And I, of course, have never believed for a second that Codrescu beat me fair 
and square in 1986, spoiling my three-peat the year after I overwhelmed the 
subtle Zen country poet Joanne Kyger. The Transylvania-born Codrescu resorted 
to a battery of evil mind-games for the bout, arriving in a Batman sweat shirt 
he'd worn a day earlier into the bat-infested depths of the Carlsbad Caverns. 
Like any good poetic device, Codrescu's shirt worked on more than one level. It 
reaffirmed his heritage, but he also knew that I would recognize the shirt as 
having once belonged to a mutual friend, a young poet named Jeffrey Miller 
who'd accidentally killed himself by wrapping his car around a redwood tree on 
the way back to his birthday party from a liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
 I've given poetry readings in the United States and Europe, in grade schools 
and colleges, in museums, theaters and bars, in front of thousands and in front 
of two, but nothing I've experienced is so naked, so pressure-filled, as a 
championship poetry fight. People listen so intently you can hear their minds 
whir. Late in the match against Codrescu, I fell apart. I knew I was down. 
Desperate for a knockout, I scrapped my game plan for a work that had wowed the 
judges the previous year. The fight was over. Codrescu knew it, I knew it and, 
worse, the judges knew it. In the first unanimous decision in championship 
history, I went down in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 6. The Promoters -- Early on the morning of the fight, Peter Rabbit and his 
partner Anne MacNaughton field telephone calls at WPBA headquarters with the 
help of the organization's new president, a smooth-talking Tarahumara Indian 
poet named Amalio (Mexican Bob) Madueno. Up a flight of metal stairs from 
Zeke's Auto Supply, the office -- barely a desk wide -- is strewn with 
manuscripts, plastic foam cups and old fight posters. T-shirts celebrating past 
bouts hang across the only window. For the last 13 years, Rabbit and 
MacNaughton have been the driving force behind the WPBA and its predecessor, 
the Society of the Muse of the Southwest. They met in 1969 while living at 
Libre, a still-thriving commune in southern Colorado. Rabbit, who changed his 
name from Douthit many years ago, was a founder of Drop City, one of the first 
large-scale, geodesic-domes-out-of-rusty-car-parts '60s communes. The 
no-nonsense MacNaughton, like Rabbit, has been a poet for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't have any idea what kind of a tepee rig we've got going here," 
she says wearily, hanging up the phone after sparring with one of the 19 print 
and electronic journalists accredited for the bout, by far the largest number 
ever. Since 1981, the championship has expanded from a restaurant-bar to the 
Taos Civic Auditorium to the Taos Convention Center to Ramona's, the biggest 
indoor space in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody in the WPBA collective gets paid a salary to produce the World 
Heavyweight Bout, the culmination of the group's annual Taos Poetry Circus, 
which this year includes eight days of workshops, readings and a daily, 
espresso-fueled, afternoon-long open session at the Caffe Tazza. The WPBA's 
budget is $20,000, financed by grants from the county and local foundations and 
from ticket sales. Both the challenger and the champ take home about $1,000 and 
expenses, hardly a princely sum even by poetry standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbit got the idea of holding a championship in 1981 after reading about the 
popularity of the "poetry slams" that Al Simmons had been staging in Chicago 
lofts and nightclubs. Those slugfests began after poet Jim Desmond signaled his 
displeasure with a Jerome Sala reading by going after Sala with a chair. Soon 
after that, they persuaded Simmons, a genial, smooth-domed poet, to come up 
with a forum where they could duke it out with words. Simmons did, and sold 
tickets to the event. He was thrilled when Rabbit asked permission to produce a 
similar bout in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbit, a born impresario and indefatigable idealist, had long sought to move 
poetry out into the world. "The older I get, the more that I think about it," 
he says, "my primary concern is community."  
</P>
<P>
 7. The Judges -- In scoring, the WPBA championship differs crucially from the 
slams, which have spread beyond Chicago to bars nationwide and will be featured 
in the Los Angeles stop of Lollapalooza. Slams, based on the notion that poetry 
can -- and should -- be judged by Everyman, usually employ judges chosen at 
random from the bar audience. Consequently, slammers tend to read directly to 
the pit, angling for bravura, one-punch knockouts. Slams often seem less like 
poetry events than like stand-up comedy. Or stand-up tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, WPBA judges must be residents of Taos and have no "erotic or 
commercial" interest in the bout's outcome. Their names are never disclosed. 
This year's judges are a photographer who takes pictures of minor league 
baseball, a sculptor who lives at the Taos pueblo and a secretary at the 
printing company that produces the program for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 8. In Training -- On the Sunday before the June 11 bout, Troupe wound up a 
series of tuneup readings with a performance, accompanied by trombonist George 
Lewis, at the Central Library in Downtown Los Angeles. As Lewis unlimbered his 
trombone and his Apple PowerBook (which had been programmed to synthesize 
sounds), Troupe talked about what he was doing to prepare. "Reading with 
musicians helps make me better able to phrase," he explained. "It helps me 
think about the words and how I can read them and manipulate the rhythms. I've 
been running up and down a mountain of words. I'm going to beat Ortiz up." 
</P>
<P>
 Most poets come to the bout with the same strategy: read your best nine poems, 
build to a climax the way you would in a regular reading, scatter your subject 
matter across the vast poetic landscape. But last year against Ntozake Shange, 
Ortiz fashioned a fresh approach. He elaborated on a theme -- how a man holds 
on to what is his own -- with one poem commenting on and reinforcing another. 
At first, Ortiz seemed monochromatic against the flamboyant, theatrical Shange, 
but as the rounds went by, Shange wilted under Ortiz's moral onslaught. Her 
poems -- which had seemed so sexy, confident and wise the previous year, when 
she'd defeated Waldman -- began to lose their swagger. Midway through the 
fight, one of her black mesh stockings ripped. Under the hot lights, her 
lipstick began to smear like blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its open embrace of competition, the event has made some poets 
uncomfortable. Waldman had to be coaxed for several years before she agreed to 
participate; the same with Ortiz. Over the years, masters like Allen Ginsberg, 
Robert Duncan and Amiri Baraka have observed the championship and even read in 
non-competitive prelims, but have refused to step into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think competition is always there in so-called polite literary society," 
says Troupe. "I just think Peter Rabbit's been dealing with it out front. 
People compete for grants and for publishers. People are loath to say it, but 
that's how it is. One time I read with Ginsberg, and I went on first. He came 
up to me at intermission and said, 'What are you trying to do, burn down an old 
man?' Then he took it to a whole higher level ." 
</P>
<P>
 The champ is much more ambivalent. "Competition is something poetry can do 
without," Ortiz insists, driving north toward Taos two days before his title 
defense. Still, he admits, the same two poets reading one after another 
probably wouldn't attract a bout-sized crowd. "The attention the championship 
gives to poetry is very important," he agrees. "But poetry as individualism is 
a waste of time." Ortiz stares out the window at the junipers and pinyon, at 
the sere landscape of New Mexico that's so much like his own work -- a plain 
surface only hinting at the richness beneath. "I think the real winner should 
always be the people and the people's voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Right before the bout I tell Troupe what Ortiz said. He's right, the 
challenger agrees, "but by God, one guy wins and another guy loses." He then 
admits that he spread gooba dust around Ortiz's stool. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Into the Ring -- Rabbit calls Ortiz and Troupe into the middle of the ring, 
then flips a coin. For the second year in a row, Ortiz loses the toss and has 
to read first. 
</P>
<P>
 The ring girl, Laurien Cook, in stiletto heels and a tight black gown, parades 
across the stage holding up a sign that announces "Round One." The ring girl's 
role is actually important: to clear the audience's palate between rounds, like 
crackers at a wine tasting. I scan the faces of the crowd. They're all types 
and ages: rich women in turquoise squash-blossom necklaces; poor folks in dusty 
sandals; grizzled hippies and nursing mothers; college students with notebooks 
poised; Pueblo Indians with their hair in braids; snowbirds looking like they 
just stepped out of their Winnebagos, and a sprinkling of kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, as he snarled out his pre-fight hype, Rabbit got so wound up, his 
false teeth fell out. Without missing a beat, he grabbed them up, waved them 
above his head and whipped the audience into a frenzy. Would he do it again? 
"All right," Rabbit bellows, his choppers firmly in place, "Let's R-U-M-B-L-E!! 
" 
</P>
<P>
 10. The Match -- Ortiz comes out all business, firing from his new collection. 
" Picture a man going from place to place in this country now called America ," 
he reads, pinpointing himself in a shifting landscape, simultaneously spreading 
the news and on the run, fighting to keep soul and culture alive in the face of 
long odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe steps up, blasting a poem about the liberation of Nelson Mandela, 
calling out the big spiritual guns, voodoo priests and deities like Elegba, the 
god of the crossroads. As he chants "go there spirit . . . Wa-Doo, ah-oom, " 
his earring glitters and shakes. I give the first round to Troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 The champion's got to know he's in a battle. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ortiz comes out for Round Two, he hangs his purple baseball hat on a ring 
post to reclaim the turf. " Seed ," says Ortiz, pressing together his index 
finger and thumb to indicate an invisible kernel. " He looked at the tiny seed 
for a long time ." The poem is about a man, sitting in the middle of a college 
campus, battling for his own sanity. " When he decided to give up poetry, it 
was 1 o'clock in the afternoon ." 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the press mumble to each other sotto voce , and a spectator 
shushes them. 
</P>
<P>
 " He did not want to be swayed by the lilt of a bird somewhere ." Ortiz 
continues. " . . . and he did not want to know . . . the seed that stood before 
his eyes as a tiny monument . . . of new life, the beginning that would flower 
by his seeing."  
</P>
<P>
 The audience explodes in applause. Next to me, a guy snaps his fingers in 
beatnik delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe comes back with "My Poems Have Holes Sewn into Them," but Ortiz has 
established the pace and tone, slowing things down the way the Knicks did in 
the Eastern Conference playoffs, forcing Troupe to play his game. If Ortiz 
keeps this up, focusing his poet's eyes on the essential, he's going to make 
the challenger look frantic, his words so much static in the void. Round Two to 
Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 The ring girl tickles Troupe under the chin with her feather boa when she 
crosses the stage for Round Three. Ortiz goes into his folder for another new 
poem, "Busted Boy," written after he moved to Tucson last January. " I'm new in 
Tucson, but I'm not a stranger to this scene/ waiting for the bus, I don't look 
around for plain clothes. I know they're waiting there in this America, they're 
here./ Waiting for busted boys, busted lives ." 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe rolls out a similar theme, "Skulls Along the River," which starts " up 
from new orleans on river boats . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, the World Heavyweight Poetry Championship is a duet, a 
call-and-response, with themes weaving in and out of both poets' work that 
allow the audience to see the world from many different sides. Troupe leans 
into the microphone to whisper, " We suffer because we must/ there is no other 
way to find beauty/ there is no other way to find love/ we suffer because we 
must/ there is no other way home/ to find the memory."  
</P>
<P>
 A whoop from the back of the room: "You got him on the ropes, Simon!" 
</P>
<P>
 I mark my score card 2-1 for Ortiz, as he steps to the lectern with "Some Past 
Poems I've Written," a new piece about Missoula, Mont. " Where are the Indians 
in this crummy town? " he begins. " My temptation is to go up to the nearest 
white man/ and say 'Where are all the Indians in your crummy town? ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Quincy Troupe's verse is descended from preaching, from jazz and blues. Not 
only is it about music -- subjects include Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Billie 
Holiday and Dinah Washington -- it is music. Troupe grew up in St. Louis around 
musicians; his brother was a drummer, and jazzmen like Arthur Blythe and Lester 
Bowie were family friends. "I think the language of poetry should be 
uplifting," he told me at the Downtown library. "I think of the written poem as 
a script to be performed." 
</P>
<P>
 Round Four belongs to Troupe's "River Town Packin House Blues": "big tom was a 
black nigga man/ cold & black/ eye say, big tom was a black nigga man/ black 
steel flesh/ standin like a gladiator / soaked in animal blood . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Troupe's fingers are high above his head, wriggling with electric energy. His 
dreads sweep like wild-horse tails when he corkscrews his body, bends his knees 
and stomps out choruses in rhythms as complicated as any in hip-hop. The voice 
in the back of the room spoke too soon. Now it's 2-2: two fine poets at the top 
of their form spiraling higher and higher. 
</P>
<P>
 For Round Five, the ring girl changes into long purple gloves  
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz's voice, of course, is also trained. He remembers his mother and father 
singing "Catholic Church-type music" as well as Pueblo songs, and long before 
he started writing, Ortiz sang country and western. "Sand Creek, Colorado 
Territory 1864," Ortiz announces quietly, invoking the U.S. Army's devastating 
attack on the Cheyenne. "Acoma Pueblo, 1599," he continues, marking the date of 
the Spanish onslaught against Ortiz's own people. "My Lai, Vietnam, 1968," he 
says, pausing before he launches into an improvised chant: " My Lai/ Oh why 
why?/ We know why,/ why you died/ Now we know why/ why you die . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 The words are repeated in dozens of combinations, as his keening voice probes 
the connections between the massacres. Cigarette smoke has engulfed the room. 
People fan themselves in the heat. " Sand Creek, you live on . . ." sings 
Ortiz, guiding his poem to a close, as a little kid yells out, "Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe's Round Five poem, "Las Cruces, New Mexico," which invokes Geronimo and 
" the high, great mesas, flat as vegas gaming tables ," echoes Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 At the break, I have it three rounds to two, Ortiz. While Tom Tom Club and 
John Coltrane boom over the sound system, I ricochet around the room with my 
periodista tie flapping over my shoulder, surveying the audience. I compare 
notes with a friend, Jack Collom, a fine poet out of Boulder, and his daughter, 
Sierra. Jack says he has Troupe a bit in front. Sierra is giving it to Ortiz. I 
talk to at least 20 other fans. It's a tossup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think that I've never been sure whether I'm a poet," Ortiz had 
said on the way into Taos, "I don't understand what poetry is. Poems are all 
story to me. Poems should give a sense of a mythic dimension to reality, even 
when writing about everyday things." 
</P>
<P>
 I think about this when Ortiz kicks off Round Six with "Histories, Places, 
Indians: Just Like Always." In the poem, Ortiz wanders down a street in New 
York, looking for a place to have lunch after serving on a panel at the annual 
colloquium of the Modern Language Assn., one of academia's most brutal meat 
markets, when he sees an elderly Indian leaning against a wall in Times Square, 
carrying a sign "Need Money to Get Back Home to Window Rock, Navajo Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 " I approach him, say 'Yaahteh,' holding out my hand, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
 The 42nd Street traffic up and down the street is ceaseless.  
</P>
<P>
 He looks at me, shakes his head, and ignores my hand. "  
</P>
<P>
 The Indians in the room -- there are more than I've ever seen at a bout -- nod 
their heads in recognition when Ortiz reads. For the first time, I realize what 
Troupe is up against. This is Indian country. 
</P>
<P>
 In his half of Round Six, Troupe weighs in with his quietest and most personal 
work of the evening, "Poem For My Father." Quincy Trouppe Sr., who died in 
1993, was one of the best catchers ever to play in the Negro Leagues as well as 
the game's unofficial historian. " father, it was an honor to be there, in the 
dugout/ with you . . . . " To the poet (who dropped a "p" from his last name), 
his father and his father's teammates were the harbingers of a new world: 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . the miraculous truth sluicing through  
</P>
<P>
 steeped & disguised in the blues  
</P>
<P>
 confluencing, like the point at the cross  
</P>
<P>
 when a fastball hides itself up in a slider, curve  
</P>
<P>
 breaking down & away in a wicked, sly grin  
</P>
<P>
 curved & posed as an ass-scratching uncle tom, who  
</P>
<P>
 like old satchel paige delivering his famed hesitation pitch  
</P>
<P>
 before coming back with a hard, high, fast one . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 I've got it even at the end of six. 
</P>
<P>
 In Round Seven, the poets usually go for the big work, the sweeping statement 
-- love and death -- that can blow an audience away. Instead, Ortiz staggers. 
With "Not Knowing And Knowing," another poem/story in which the poet, 
surrounded by tourists, has to find his way beyond dismay to beauty, he appears 
to be repeating himself. I wonder if Ortiz has anything left. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a good idea where Troupe will go in Round Seven. I saw him electrify 
the crowd in L.A. with the same verse at the beginning of the week, and he has 
set it up perfectly with Round Six. And sure enough, it comes -- "A Poem For 
'Magic' ": 
</P>
<P>
 " take the sucker to the hoop, "magic" johnson,  
</P>
<P>
 recreate reverse hoodoo gems off the spin,  
</P>
<P>
 deal alley-oop-dunk-a-thon-magician passes  
</P>
<P>
 now, double-pump, scissor, vamp through space  
</P>
<P>
 hang in place & put it all up in the sucker's face, "magic" johnson, & deal 
the roundball, like the juju man that you am . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 The poem embodies perfectly Troupe's sanctified, come-home-to-Jesus style, and 
the crowd goes wild. On my card, he's moved into the lead, 4-3. Ortiz needs a 
big poem here, and he gets it beautifully, with a quiet lyric, written recently 
at Rosebud, South Dakota, among the Sioux, which concludes: 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . It's this we perceive at the edge  
</P>
<P>
 of this rainy dawn, the water trembling  
</P>
<P>
 and gentling off the roof. It's this prayer  
</P>
<P>
 which insists we notice and cannot avoid.  
</P>
<P>
 It's Tuesday morning rain right now.  
</P>
<P>
 It could be California, Pacific Ocean clouds  
</P>
<P>
 like horses flying over the coastal hills,  
</P>
<P>
 across desert valleys, over the mountains  
</P>
<P>
 toward the Lakota prairie  
</P>
<P>
 It could be,  
</P>
<P>
 but right now, it's here, a Lakota Prayer-rain. "  
</P>
<P>
 Troupe responds with his own fine lyric, "Collage," and though the round is 
close, I give it to Ortiz, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 But just when he's ready to put Troupe away, Ortiz chooses to sing another 
song. This one is about a man who is hauled up before a judge and given a 
chance to make a statement. " Yes, you honor Judge . . . You have no honor, 
Judge ." Ortiz's deep voice is starting to fray. He's beginning to trip over 
his own words. 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe roars back with "Avalanche," the title poem from his next book: 
</P>
<P>
 " and i want this poem to kneel down itself before healing  
</P>
<P>
 want it to be magic there beneath the crucifixion of light  
</P>
<P>
 want it to be praise song, juju rooted  
</P>
<P>
 want it to be mojo hand raised up to powers of flight "  
</P>
<P>
 As Troupe acknowledges loud applause, the blond 4-year-old next to me turns to 
his mother and says "He's my favorite." At the end of nine, it's Troupe 5-4 
</P>
<P>
 Round 10, the extemporaneous round, separates the men poets from the boy 
poets, the women from the girls. In 1992, Anne Waldman, not a strong 
improviser, lost her title to Ntozake Shange in the 10th, when she croaked out 
a brief, panicked improvisation and abruptly sat down. The ring girl strips 
down to a G-string and a glittering halter as the poets strip to pure 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbit brings out a small Santa Clara Pueblo bowl, and Ortiz reaches in. 
Rabbit takes the folded paper and reads it out loud -- "black hat." A nervous 
titter runs through the crowd. Ortiz begins almost without hesitation, 
pronouncing each word deliberately: " 'Don't forget to take your black hat,' 
she said, before he left. He turned to ask foolishly what she meant. " Ortiz 
proceeds to take us through the provenance of the hat, the history of the 
relationship, and an exploration of the emotions symbolized. "As he reached for 
the black hat, she let it drop to the floor."  
</P>
<P>
 Any borderline psychotic can string together a bunch of words from which a 
listener could possibly make sense; in the poetry world, that's known as 
"turning on the poetry machine." But Ortiz has gone much further, shaping an 
emotionally complicated story about the ashes of a love affair -- from two 
words, on the spot. The crowd gives him a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Troupe comes back strong. Working off "sharkskin suit" -- " the man in the 
sharkskin suit reached into his pocket and pulled out a 10 " -- he creates a 
Stagolee tale: a hustler offers a woman $10 to go off with him, and she turns 
him down. The hoodoo syllables glitter like the silver "Q.T." of his earring, 
but the piece doesn't reveal that "sense of a mythic dimension to reality" that 
Ortiz had talked about in the car. Not even Troupe thinks he won the round. 
</P>
<P>
 I've got the fight dead even. As the lights go up, Rabbit collects the judges' 
cards and tabulates the scores. The crowd goes silent the instant he re-enters 
the ring. "Judge Number One scores it 6-4 Ortiz." The champ's supporters cheer 
nervously. "Judge Number Two calls it 7-3 for Troupe." Troupe's fans whoop in 
reply. "Judge Number Three," with a look of disbelief, Rabbit clears his 
throat, "Judge Number Three scores it 10-0, Quincy Troupe! The winner and the 
new Heavyweight Champion of the World is Quincy Troupe!!"

 City Councilman Bobby Duran leaps onstage to present the trophy as the press 
swirls around the two contestants. "I've read with Ginsberg," Troupe, looking 
dazed and exhilarated, says to the reporters, "I've read with Baraka, but I've 
never been as nervous as I was tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm in shock. I can't believe a judge would give Troupe all 10 rounds. I 
collar Ortiz. "Do you believe the people were the winner tonight?" I shout over 
the din. "Yes, I do," he replies. Frantically, I chase after Rabbit to complain 
about the scoring, but he's already in the center of the ring with an ecstatic 
grin as Ortiz and Troupe embrace. They join hands, then lift them above their 
heads. I look around Ramona's. Wild debates have sprung up in every corner of 
the room. People are alive with poetry.

LIFE IMITATES SUDS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME WEDDINGS

 Soap-opera weddings rarely come off without a hitch, but are there times when 
truth is stranger than fiction? Just about every actor we asked had a wedding 
horror story to relate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like in the movies," says Thom Christopher, who played Dante 
Partou on "Loving" and Carlo Hesser/Mortimer Bern on "One Life to Live." "I 
never thought I'd ever actually hear anything in response to, 'If there is 
anyone who can show just cause,' but I was at a friend's wedding, and someone 
came forward with a quite unprintable objection. It was an utter disaster, but 
ultimately the ceremony did continue." 
</P>
<P>
 The happily married Hillary B. Smith (Nora Gannon on "One Life to Live") 
luckily does not believe in omens. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy stood up at our rehearsal dinner to toast us," says Smith. "And then he 
proceeded to wish us more luck than the couple at the last rehearsal dinner 
he'd attended. At that one the bride-to-be stood up, thanked everyone for 
coming, and announced their gifts would be returned because her fiance was out 
back with the maid of honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Barrett (Frankie Winthrop on "Another World") just celebrated her 11th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a glorious wedding," says Barrett. But they could have played "Get Me 
To The Church On Time" in place of "The Wedding March" at her nuptials. 
</P>
<P>
 "My uncle served as my chauffeur, and he decided to stop at a bar for a 
pre-wedding toast," explains Barrett, adding with a laugh, "We were over an 
hour and a half late." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Irizarry (Nick McHenry Spaulding on "Guiding Light") says, "My 
sister's wedding was a near-disaster. The limo broke down on the way to the 
reception. We're on a highway -- no phones -- so there's five guys in tuxes 
hitching a ride. The guy who stopped went 20 miles out of his way to get us to 
the reception, but he had a Pinto, so it was like being in a clown car." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Holbrook (Kate Baker on "Another World") and her husband, Bruce, who was 
her childhood sweetheart, can hardly stop laughing as she tells her story. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at my husband's friend's wedding reception," says Holbrook. "It was a 
military wedding with just about everybody in uniform. I graciously wished the 
couple a marriage as happy as mine. When I asked where they were going on their 
honeymoon, I was greeted with silence. Still, I understood their desire for 
secrecy and continued to blather on until Bruce whisked me away, while 
muttering apologies. I was congratulating the wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Keith (Shana Burnell on "Loving") met her husband, James Kiberd (Trevor 
Dillon on "All My Children"), while both were on "Loving." It was hate at first 
sight, but, just as in soaps, it turned to love. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the morning of our wedding, it was 80 degrees and sunny," Keith explains. 
Kiberd continues, "By 1 p.m. it was 45 degrees with 4 inches of rain. The 
thunder was so loud the guests couldn't hear the vows. We won't even talk about 
the mud. We got anniversary gifts with thunderbolts on them." 
</P>
<P>
 When we asked Marj Dusay (Alexandra Spaulding on Guiding Light), she says with 
a hearty laugh, "Wedding horror stories? Two." Two divorces. 
</P>
<P>
 She says jokingly, "I believe in weddings -- for other people. Right now, I'm 
much more into grandchildren."

THE DRIVE WAY; NO LONGER THE HOTTEST SPOT IN BEVERLY HILLS, THIS RESTAURANT CAN 
STILL WARM A JADED PALATE 
</P>

 When Maple Drive opened 4 1/2 years ago, Los Angeles still had restaurant 
fever, and a table here was one of the hardest to get in town. With Dudley 
Moore and Liza Minnelli among the investors and a built-in clientele from 
Castle Rock, Lawrence Kasdan Co. and Steel Pictures right in the building, it 
was the ultimate insider restaurant. Those who happened to be members of the 
great unconnected ended up in restaurant Siberia -- near the kitchen or the 
piano. But in these recessionary days, and with several newer restaurants to 
lure the locals, that's no longer so. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked right in one night, no reservation, and was seated at one of the posh 
booths at the back. The best seats in the house are upholstered in a gray 
geometric damask and so generous in size you could set up housekeeping. From 
this luxurious vantage point, a bit secluded behind the booths' triangular end 
pieces, there is a great view of the action, as waiters in black vests sprint 
between white-clothed tables and the gleaming stainless-steel kitchen. The 
handsome room, with its angled concrete walls and abrupt textural contrasts, 
wears very well. 
</P>
<P>
 The polished staff rarely misses a beat. As soon as you arrive, a busboy 
brings butter and warm, yeasty dinner rolls with a crisp, crackling crust. 
Order beer, and it is poured into cool, frosted glasses. Dishes arrive swiftly 
and always go to the right person. It's a matter of teamwork. And the kitchen 
has most of the dishes on the straightforward menu down cold. Practice makes 
perfect, after all: The cooks send out order after order of updated American 
fare like meatloaf, steak, chops, grilled fish, salads at lunch and at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 One night we started with the signature kick-ass chili, a new American classic 
developed by executive chef Leonard Schwartz at 72 Market Street and brought 
with him when he moved to Maple Drive in Beverly Hills. All meat, no beans, 
this is substantial stuff, sludgy and complexly spiced with a smoldering kick 
that lingers in the mouth. It comes with a fine, firm corn muffin, for once not 
sweet, studded with fresh corn kernels. This is an appetizer? Well, yes, at 
least on Maple Drive's menu. A salad of roasted sweet red peppers, fresh greens 
and shaved Parmesan is understated and beautifully dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Seared tuna remains one of the menu's standbys. This particular kitchen has 
turned the by-now tired cliche into a warm salad of sorts. Grilled rare, the 
Hawaiian tuna is sliced thinly and set on a bed of spinach, bok choy and 
shiitake mushrooms swimming in a ponzu- like vinaigrette. An entree of steak 
tartare comes to the table seasoned so strongly, its taste is tiring after a 
few bites; the toasted walnut bread is a nice touch, though. Factor in a slice 
of the double chocolate cake, a devilishly dark wedge flanked with a warm 
chocolate sauce and a fast-melting scoop of dense vanilla ice cream, for an 
appealing summer supper. Expensive, yes, but on the whole, well done. 
</P>
<P>
 On another evening, we're seated on the enclosed patio, where the view is of a 
darkening sky behind manicured ferns and tree tops. It's Friday night, and the 
restaurant has a brash urban edginess. It's louder now, a strain to hear across 
the table. And a bassist has joined the jazz pianist at the grand piano in the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The meaty crab cakes, two pocket-watch-sized orbs accented with golden caviar, 
are delicious, if a bit pricey at $14. The lightly battered calamari are tender 
and tasty, paired with a bracing parsley sauce. Prosciutto with fig confit 
sounds terrific, but not this salty, thickly cut prosciutto with this jammy fig 
confit. "Barbakowed" shrimp salad is another idea that fizzles. Shrimp are 
coated in a sweetish red sauce, which weighs down the greens, and the pink 
ginger slices add a discordant note. 
</P>
<P>
 As for main courses, there is, of course, Schwartz's definitive, finely 
textured meatloaf, big enough for leftovers (a decided virtue in a meatloaf) 
and served with sterling mashed potatoes and the best spinach in the world. No 
problem devouring a tall pile of these deep emerald leaves. The generous veal 
chop is tender enough but, like most, without much flavor. Or at least not 
enough to stand up to the dark reduction sauce. Sometimes there's a hefty 
double pork chop with chunky homemade applesauce and almost always grilled loin 
lamb chops with lovely gratin potatoes and small bundles of slender green 
beans. A lean turkey sausage link with mashed sweet potatoes and whole-berry 
cranberry sauce is Thanksgiving-on-a-plate. 
</P>
<P>
 When I order the "steamed skinless chicken, matzo ball, vegetables, broth," my 
friend splutters, "$20? For matzo ball soup?" He quiets down once he tastes the 
clear, focused broth laced with big, moist chunks of chicken, uptown vegetables 
and a buoyant matzo ball flecked with parsley. This is an immensely satisfying 
bowl of soup, definitely in the comfort zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish dishes fare less well. The ubiquitous Chilean sea bass shows up grilled 
with artichokes and capers, but it is so acidic one night that it is virtually 
inedible. The waiter notices and returns shortly with another version, minus 
the capers; the fish is precisely cooked, its inherent sweetness a nice foil 
for the artichokes. On another occasion, the tomato topping on the halibut has 
an unpleasant vinegary edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are consistently well-executed. There's that splendid chocolate cake, 
but also a rich, ivory-colored rice pudding, which is even better with its 
small pitcher of cream poured over it. The classic creme brulee is just about 
perfect, and a refreshing blackberry Champagne sorbet is perhaps best of all. 
</P>
<P>
 The requisite prestige Champagnes, such as the '85 Dom Perignon ($150) are 
offered at hefty prices; even the '88 Scharffenberger Blanc de Blancs is $44. 
Drinking well here requires some serious spending, with few exceptions. Joseph 
Phelps' flowery Rhone-style '92 Viognier is $46, but the lush '92 Sauvignon 
Blanc from Honig is only $19. Heavily weighted toward Cabernet and Bordeaux, 
the red wine list includes a single Rhone wine, the 1990 Chateauneuf-du-Pape 
"Le Bernardine" (Chapoutier) at $46. 
</P>
<P>
 Maple Drive also boasts one of the city's great bars. Spacious and 
comfortable, it features charcoal leather banquettes and a few booths at one 
end. Weekdays from 4 to 7 p.m., it's happy hour: In addition to complimentary 
finger food like dainty meatloaf sandwiches, crusty oven-roasted potatoes or 
thin-crusted pizzas, you can order from the short bar menu, which includes not 
only that kick-ass chili but also plump, deep-fried chicken wings and a classy 
grilled cheddar sandwich on walnut bread. And for those high-rollers . . . 
sevruga caviar. 
</P>

 Maple Drive, 345 N. Maple Drive, Beverly Hills; (310) 274-9800. Closed 
Saturday lunch and all day Sunday. Smoking in booths at the back and at the 
bar. Dinner for two, food only, $68 - $100. Corkage, $15.

STAGE WATCH: SHOWTIME AND HBO GETTING INTO THE ONE-ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When F. Scott Fitzgerald observed that there were no second acts in American 
lives, perhaps he was foreseeing the current smaller-theater scene in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week seems to bring yet another one-act festival. One indication of the 
glut is that two different, unrelated festivals used the umbrella title "Act 
One." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most prominent festival so far was the Showtime-financed "Act 
One," which presented works by 15 writers from May 20-July 10 at the Met 
Theatre. Not to be outdone, Showtime's primary rival, Home Box Office, has 
announced that the First Annual HBO Festival of New Writers will introduce 10 
one-act comedies at a yet-to-be-announced theater in Los Angeles this fall. The 
10 will be selected from 25 scripts now in workshops at the Stella Adler 
Theatre in Hollywood (through next Sunday; those in turn were picked from more 
than 2,700 submissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The HBO festival is emphasizing the cultural diversity of its writers. Of the 
25 represented in the workshops, 18 are "of color," said executive producer 
Steve Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers would assume that the main agenda of any one-act festival 
sponsored by a giant cable programmer would be to find material that could be 
converted to the small screen. This is more openly the case with the Showtime 
festival than with HBO's. One of the "Act One" plays, "Sticks and Stones," 
already has received a Showtime go-ahead for development into a full-length 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 The HBO festival, Kaplan said, is "more focused on the writers as opposed to 
potential product for the network." But even that interest isn't purely 
altruistic. "The bottom line is to find writers who (HBO) can develop," Kaplan 
said. "If even a few become involved with HBO, we're successful." 
</P>
<P>
 While this may spell success for the corporation, does it spell success for 
the L.A. audiences? Showtime's festival was a sellout on most of the nights 
following its first couple of weeks, report "Act One" officials. The recent 
Naked Angels one-act program, "More Naked at the Coast," was another hot 
ticket. Apparently there is an audience for one-acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people like buffet more than a la carte," Kaplan said. "In a one-act 
festival, if you don't like what's on, just wait a second, and there will be 
another one. It's like vaudeville. And even if you don't like the plays, you 
can come out with an appreciation of the roaring talent that's in them." 
</P>
<P>
 Risa Bramon Garcia, a co-producer of Showtime's festival, said one-act fans 
like the variety of experiences available in one program. "People enjoy the 
changes. It's like appreciating different kinds of paintings in a museum." Or, 
to draw on a less lofty medium, it's like "TV channel-switching," she added. 
"People today have a harder time focusing for longer periods of time." So 
perhaps it's appropriate that TV powers are paying for these two festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the festivals don't have that kind of backing, but some of them do 
draw on the same creative wells. In addition to her duties on "Act One," Bramon 
Garcia is artistic co-director of the Ensemble Studio Theatre's L.A. Project, 
which is currently presenting its own program of one-acts, "Summer Shorts," at 
the Fountain Theatre. Most of the "Summer Shorts" are plays that came in 
through the "Act One" application process, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the "Act One" applicants also wound up on the bill of fare at "More 
Naked at the Coast," Bramon Garcia added. "We're all kissing cousins." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 PREMIERES: When the next Mark Taper Forum season was announced, the American 
premiere of Derek Walcott's "Odyssey" was promised. The show is still on for 
next summer, but Arena Stage in Washington can now claim the American premiere. 
The Arena production goes up Sept. 30-Nov. 6. . . . Sondheim fanatics don't 
have to wait for the Los Angeles professional premiere of "Assassins" on Nov. 
22 at LATC (Stage Watch, June 26). They can see the Whittier premiere now. Rio 
Hondo College opened "Assassins" on Friday. It'll play through next Sunday.

ON THE RECORD: PROKOFIEV: AN ALSO-RAN GETS HIS DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pity poor Prokofiev. His death, which should have made at least the bottom of 
Page 1 on newspapers worldwide, was barely -- and belatedly -- acknowledged, 
both in the Soviet Union and in the West. He had the bad fortune to die on the 
same day, March 5, 1953, as Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1991, when the world should have been honoring his centennial, Sergei 
Prokofiev's thunder was stolen again -- this time by a fellow composer, Mozart, 
whose bicentennial was getting all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Withal, Prokofiev's time seems to have come: the time of his acceptance as a 
repertory composer rather than as the occasional visitor. His music has made 
extraordinary inroads on orchestral subscription concerts, as the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic's upcoming season attests; his chamber and solo piano music is 
widely performed, and even his operas are getting the occasional hearing. 
"Alexander Nevsky" has become perhaps the most widely performed of 20th-Century 
choral works. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a month goes by when there isn't a worthwhile recording of his music. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reissues is a stunning set of 1960s performances by Itzhak Perlman: 
the two Sonatas for violin and piano, with Vladimir Ashkenazy, and the Second 
Violin Concerto, with Erich Leinsdorf conducting the Boston Symphony (RCA 
Victor Gold Seal 61454). 
</P>
<P>
 This is, of course, young Itzhak: prime examples of the talent and artistry 
that left audiences delighted and awed by his technical skill, musicianship 
and, not least, his obvious pleasure in making music. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership with Ashkenazy strikes sparks from the first measure of the 
stark F-minor Sonata: Perlman's tone is infused with the appropriate grit, 
something one no longer gets from him, and reaches heights of voluptuousness in 
the more popular D-major Sonata. The concerto performance is perfection, with 
the violinist's spiritedness set in relief by Leinsdorf's coolly efficient 
conducting of the BSO on one of its glory days. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with the Perlman-Leinsdorf effort, the work's most recent recording 
(coupled with Prokofiev's First Concerto) sounds merely dutiful. 
</P>
<P>
 On it, the soloist is Boris Belkin, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra under 
Michael Stern simply doing a job (Denon 75891). Belkin, it might be noted, 
showed his gifts to better advantage in these works a decade ago, in a recorded 
collaboration with Kiril Kondrashin and the London Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Previn's strong, supple 1970s interpretations of the Fifth and Seventh 
symphonies with the London Symphony must surely have been among those that made 
the prospect of his assuming the music directorship of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic a pleasing one. By the time of his arrival some years later, 
however, Previn seemed to have lost the spark that these performances so 
compellingly exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The London's Fifth is at once rock-ribbed and mobile, while the enigmatic 
Seventh finds Previn and his orchestra gracefully in tune with its oddball 
humors (EMI 65181). 
</P>
<P>
 The Perlman and Previn reissues are mid-priced and each runs nearly 80 
minutes. Spectacular value for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Alexander Nevsky" Cantata, one of the few viable products of Soviet 
musical jingoism, arrives from Semyon Bychkov and his Orchestre de Paris 
(Philips 434 070). 
</P>
<P>
 The interpretation is rather willful, with some inappropriately fast tempos -- 
above all in the "Field of the Dead," where the soloist, mezzo Marjana 
Lipovsek, is unable to make the composer's poignant points -- and a weak 
chorus. But the accompanying suite from the underappreciated "Cinderella" is 
vivacious and well played. 
</P>
<P>
 In another new release, France's youthful Manfred Quartet reinforces the 
strong impression made in its previous offerings, of Schumann and Schoenberg, 
on the tiny, classy Pierre Verany label. 
</P>
<P>
 Their editions of Prokofiev's two string quartets combine gleaming tone and 
rhythmic propulsion. The B-minor Quartet's plaintiveness is captured as 
effectively as the jovial, populist sentiments of the Quartet in F (PV 791112).

 The perplexing problem facing trumpeter Wallace Roney has been the sometimes 
misleading, sometimes accurate comparison of his playing with Miles Davis.His 
work within the Davis tribute ensemble and its subsequent recording has only 
tended to underscore the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, despite the excellence of Roney's playing, most of the tracks 
here won't do much to relieve the Davis connections. Pieces such as "Last to 
Know," "Meu Menino," "Muerte," "In Her Family" and the title number resonate 
with Davis sounds. Many of the arrangements, mainly provided by Gil Goldstein, 
have the lush, shimmering qualities that Gil Evans employed for his 
collaborations with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 To Roney's credit, he still attempts to hold his own. The brilliantly 
burnished lines on most of his improvised solos may be Davis-influenced, but 
their substance is all Roney, willfully stretching the envelope of the style 
both technically and aesthetically. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent).

POP MUSIC CHARTS: 'LION' VS. 'LOUNGE' 
</P>

<TEXT>

 The Rolling Stones can't be too pleased about being beaten out by the 
soundtrack of a cartoon--"The Lion King"--in their first week on The Times' 
Southern California pop album chart. And what may be more aggravating to the 
rock veterans is that their "Voodoo Lounge" album, which debuted at No. 2, may 
never chase "Lion King" out of its perch at the top. "Lion King" seems ready to 
reign for at least another few weeks--when "Voodoo" is at its sales peak. In 
fact, don't be surprised if another hot soundtrack--third-ranked "Forrest 
Gump"--slips past the Stones' album. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,42,11 Title, Artist

RECORD RACK: HE'S YOUR DESK CLERK AT HEARTBREAK HOTEL

<P>
 Freedy Johnston needs melancholy the way a fish needs water. It's his habitat, 
his sustaining element, and on the few occasions when he flops onto a musically 
sunny shore, he seems lost and anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a sky made overcast by cello, shrouded in minor-chord mists, the 
Kansas native becomes an authoritative chronicler of betrayal, heartbreak and 
missed connections. On his major-label debut, following a couple of 
cult-building independent releases, Johnston gives us characters who use any 
means -- even death -- to escape loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, Johnston embraces the pure-pop tradition that ruled the world in 
the '60s and resurfaced post-punk as an underground movement. The kind of hooks 
that made Tommy James & the Shondells disposable product are transformed by an 
ironic twist into conduits for deep emotions -- into something approaching High 
Pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston (who plays at McCabe's on Saturday) brings a folk-rock roughness, a 
little samba and a taste of Tin Pan Alley to the blend -- all of which should 
add up to a richer, more dynamic sound than comes across in Butch Vig's 
production. "Don't you want me now . . . I'm just breakin' down," Johnston 
sings, but the music -- restrained and formal -- doesn't do anything to express 
that condition. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it tough to deliver the subversive edge that's been his calling 
card, but the neurotic quiver in his Neil Young-like voice and his cutting 
touch with a lyric keep him safely immersed. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

<P>
 If rappers were packaged like carbonated beverages, L.A. rap veteran Coolio 
would be in the refrigerator case marked "Compton Classic." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the hard-edged beats, the rhymes, the familiar '70s soul samples, the 
goofed-up comedy of the hard-core life that worked so well on the early Eazy-E 
12-inchers. N.W.A.-style crime narratives, told from the point of view of a 
well-armed burglar, seem uncomfortably well-researched; the street-corner 
giggles come at the expense of crackheads, knuckleheads and ugly women. 
</P>
<P>
 But while you've heard most of this before, this may be one of the best 
hard-core Compton rap records since the first N.W.A. album. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 More than Hendrix the space bluesman or rock song performer, "Woodstock" 
spotlights Jimi the jammer, and his seemingly infinite inventiveness in the 
loosely structured format far outweighs the occasional slack moments.Of the 
previously unreleased material, "Red House" is taut and powerful while "Jam 
Back at the House" alternates between spellbinding sections and forced 
transitions. "Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)" launches a nonstop, half-hour flow 
through "The Star-Spangled Banner/Purple Haze," five minutes of dazzling solo 
guitar improvisation and the bitter-sweet gem "Villanova Junction Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 STICKERY SITUATION: Can a record company release an album and not be 
responsible for what the artist says? That seems to be what Epic Records is 
attempting to do with the latest from Compton-based rapper MC Eiht.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the usual "Parental Advisory" warning, Epic has put a sticker 
on the album, "We Come Strapped," stating, "The lyrical content contained on 
this album solely expresses the views of the artist." 
</P>
<P>
 The intent is apparently to protect the company from such lawsuits as those 
that claimed Judas Priest lyrics led to a youth's suicide and a song by rapper 
Tupac Shakur caused the murder of a police officer. One MC Eiht song, "Take 2 
With Me," portrays a Compton drug dealer vowing to kill two policemen who are 
chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclaimer probably doesn't hold any legal water, says a noted music 
industry First Amendment attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly the record company has elected to release the album and presumably 
will advertise and promote it and is hoping for the highest sales possible," 
says Stephen Rohde. "They are enjoying the revenues and are responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhode notes, though, that no civil or criminal cases have held artists or 
record companies liable for claims that their lyrics caused deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Eiht shrugs off Epic's move to distance itself from his lyrics. "They're just 
trying to protect their backs," he says, adding that the company is not 
slacking off in promoting the album. "It just shows how cowardly some people 
can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Epic Records issued a statement that the wording of the sticker was arrived at 
jointly by the company and the artist, and that the company supports free 
speech. STEVE HOCHMAN

 ROXY ROAD: The 1994 rock reunions are still in progress, but it's not too 
early to start talking about possible regroupings for 1995. One that's looking 
like a good bet is Roxy Music. 
</P>
<P>
 The English group has not recorded since 1982's "Avalon" album, but leader 
Bryan Ferry brought in his Roxy co-founders Brian Eno (who left the band in the 
early '70s), Phil Manzanera and Andy Mackay to help on his latest solo album, 
"Mamouna," which will be released Sept. 20. Eno and Ferry even co-wrote one 
song, "Wild Cat Days," and the album returns to the silky, atmospheric feel of 
"Avalon." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferry plans to tour under his own name this fall, but a full Roxy reunion 
album and tour next year seems likely, says Andy Gershon, the singer's new U.S. 
manager, who described Ferry as "keen to repeat working with (his old 
bandmates)." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Mamouna" represents a reunion for Roxy Music, it is also a parting of 
the ways for Ferry and his longtime U.S. label, Warner Bros. Records. The album 
will be released by Virgin, which has always had Ferry's records for the rest 
of the world. STEVE HOCHMAN

 RELIEF PITCHING: Last year a number of top musicians, including Pearl Jam, Lou 
Reed and Soul Asylum, came together for concerts and the "Sweet Relief" album 
to benefit L.A. singer-songwriter Victoria Williams, who was stricken with 
multiple sclerosis. Now Williams is returning the favor to the music community. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to paying for her expensive medical treatments, Williams used some 
of the benefit money to start the Sweet Relief Foundation to help pay for 
crisis health care for musicians who, like her, are uninsured. Contributions 
from record companies and private parties have brought the fund up to $250,000, 
says Williams' manager, Danny Heaps.  
</P>
<P>
 A committee consisting of Williams, R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, T Bone Burnett, Don 
Was and Michael Penn has begun evaluating applications for grants and loans up 
to $15,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's kind of a vacuum there where musicians are concerned," says Williams. 
"When I got sick everyone was so beautiful to me that I thought I'd like to 
start something that would be ours, for musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams continues to feel the impact of the disease, which attacks the 
central nervous system, but treatments have been effective and she's been able 
to keep an active recording and performing schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 She has just finished recording her new album, "Loose," which will be released 
by Atlantic-distributed Mammoth Records in October. Guests include Soul 
Asylum's Dave Pirner and Williams' husband, Mark Olson of the Jayhawks. STEVE

 It's a little warm to think of Christmas, but a number of top pop artists are 
already preparing to hear those silver bells of holiday cash registers: Mariah 
Carey has a seasonal album due Sept. 20, while Kenny G's will be in stores in 
October. Veterans Neil Diamond and Tony Bennett also have Christmas albums due 
Sept. 20. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Cole is also readying a Christmas collection, but first she'll be 
heard singing "Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?" on the soundtrack to 
Ken Burns' PBS documentary series "Baseball." The soundtrack album of songs 
associated with the national pastime will be released in early September, 
shortly before the series debuts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Unwrapped" is the description Ann Wilson has coined for a live, acoustic 
Heart album that will be recorded during a five-night stint at the small 
Backstage club in the band's hometown, Seattle, starting Aug. 12. Plans are for 
the album, due in early '95, to include a new song titled "Cherry Blossom 
Road," along with new arrangements of '70s and '80s hits. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Grant was joined last week by Travis Tritt on an Altadena video shoot for 
their duet "House of Love," the title song and planned second single from 
Grant's upcoming album, due Aug. 23. . . . L.A. rap trio Cypress Hill is at 
work on another collection of homages to weed smoking, tentatively due early 
next year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Luther Vandross has selected mostly ballads for his album of others' songs, 
scheduled for late September. Among them are Barbra Streisand's hit 
"Evergreen," Lionel Richie's "Endless Love" and the "Man of La Mancha" show 
tune "The Impossible Dream." One of the few up-tempo songs is Stephen Stills' 
"Love the One You're With." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 New Age queen Enya, who wasn't planning to have a release this year, changed 
her mind and is working on an album that's coming out at the end of the year. . 
. . Boyz II Men's next album, featuring producing and writing by Babyface and 
the Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis team, is due in mid-September. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 TAFKAP (The Artist Formerly Known as . . .) produced and wrote all the songs 
on a collection titled "1-800-New-Funk" -- which also happens to be the 
toll-free number for his merchandising service. Among the performers on the 
collection, due in stores this week, are George Clinton and Mavis Staples. Also 
included is the TAFKAP-Nona Gaye duet "Love Sign."

 LONDON FALLING: The future of the English band London Suede (simply Suede in 
its home country) is in doubt following the exit of guitarist Bernard Butler, 
who wrote the bulk of the band's songs with singer Brett Anderson. The three 
remaining members insist that they will find a new guitarist, but in Britain -- 
where the band has been a spectacular success -- the move is being compared to 
Johnny Marr's leaving the Smiths, -- a fatal blow to Morrissey's former band. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler walked out on sessions for the group's second album, reportedly due to 
disagreements with producer Ed Buller. However, in a recent interview, Butler 
declared, "I'm desperate to do things outside of Suede. Brett's so . . . slow 
it drives me insane." 
</P>
<P>
 The news came the same week that the Wonder Stuff, another much-loved band on 
the British alternative scene, broke up. The group had announced its intention 
to disband after its latest album, "Construction for the Modern Idiot," sold 
less than expected. Dave Jennings, from London

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurosawa, widely regarded as the world's greatest living film director, has 
come up with some of the most beautiful images he has ever conceived -- and 
also some of his most ponderous moments as well -- in this 1990 film. However, 
what works in the film's eight episodes, actually inspired by the director's 
own dreams, far outweighs what does not.It is rich in the varied contemplations 
of an octogenarian artist looking back and looking ahead with humor and 
concern. One of the eight dreams features Akira Terao, left, with Martin 
Scorsese as Vincent Van Gogh (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 a.m.).

 Mike Nichols' knowing direction provides the perfect witty touch in bringing 
to the screen Carrie Fisher's adaptation of her own novel about a very bright 
actress (Meryl Streep, left), who short-circuits her talent with drugs, and her 
brassy, competitive mother (Shirley MacLaine), a golden era Hollywood star. (Of 
course, we're not supposed to think of Fisher herself or her mother Debbie 
Reynolds). A truly sophisticated entertainment that offers a sharp insider's 
view of Hollywood (Cinemax Monday at 5 a.m.). Kevin Thomas

 Wickedly funny, undeniably moving, featuring a knockout series of performances 
and the most sensual of love scenes, this 1992 film has everything audiences 
have been missing in American films. It just happens to be about three 
hospitalized men (Eric Stoltz, pictured, William Forsythe and Wesley Snipes). 
Helen Hunt is the young woman seriously in love with Stoltz's Joel Garcia, 
though married to someone else (Showtime Tuesday at 2:05 a.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Filmmaker Marc Rocco understands how difficult it is to capture the immediacy 
of street kids' lives in a dramatized format.His 1992 film works best when it's 
at its loosest and most improvisatory. Whenever the seams in the script show, 
it loses its grit and takes on the aspects of a made-for-TV drama about 
runaways who end up on the streets of Hollywood. The cast features, from left, 
Dermot Mulroney, Ricki Lake, James LeGros, Balthazar Getty, Will Smith, Sean 
Astin and Lara Flynn Boyle (Cinemax Wednesday at 4 a.m.). Peter Rainer

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; HOW DARREN BURROWS' 'SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS' LANDED HIM 
IN CICELY 
</P>

<P>
 It's not your everyday career dilemma: Ed isn't sure if he wants to be a 
shaman or a filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 But Darren Burrows, who plays "Northern Exposure's" thoughtful and inquisitive 
Ed -- Cicely, Alaska's resident half-Native American -- knows what he wants to 
be: an actor. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrows, 27, is thrilled he's doing it, despite the show's long shooting 
schedule in Washington state that lasts more than 10 months in often-freezing 
temperatures. The actor's journey to the chilly north and the hit CBS show 
wasn't an easy one. At 16, he ran away from Kansas to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for adventure," he explains from a cellular phone somewhere in 
South Dakota, where he and his wife and their two Neopolitan mastiffs are 
camping. "I was a real rebellious kid and I had to figure it out for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 After running away, he never returned to formal education. He says he 
"graduated from the school of hard knocks." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can believe it," he adds, speaking at a faster pace than Ed, which 
isn't hard to do, "I wanted to be an airborne ranger, so I was killing time 
until I was 18 and I could join." 
</P>
<P>
 He ate "a lot of ketchup and mustard sandwiches" to survive and, being only 
16, "took a lot of part-time jobs. I worked in an ice-cream parlor, a pizza 
place, a printing shop and drove a forklift." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrows also discovered a way to express anger without any repercussions: 
acting classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," he says good-naturedly, explaining how he could fit auditions into his 
schedule, "I was a high school dropout, and I was starving anyway, so why not 
starve for the arts?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Acting is a great way to get people to feel things," he says. "That's a great 
thing about being an actor -- you get to live your own life and then someone 
else's too." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrows managed to land roles in the high-profile movies "Casualties of War" 
and "Cry Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the luckiest guy in the world," he declares. "I've worked with Brian de 
Palma and John Waters, all these great people who normally someone in my 
position wouldn't ever meet. Luck's all I can attribute it to." 
</P>
<P>
 After landing other roles in film, he adds, "I couldn't get hired for TV to 
save my soul, to tell you the truth. It took a weird show to cast me." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrows was dying to be on "Northern Exposure." Literally. The natural blond 
dyed his hair black for his audition. "I was worried it would drip down my neck 
from the sweat." Right now, he says laughing, "I have black hair, blond roots 
and a blond beard. I look pretty thrashed. But now I get paid for doing what I 
want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And the consensus is he does it well. 
</P>
<P>
 "His performance is always tremendously thought-out and subtle," says Andrew 
Schneider, who, along with Diane Frolov, is the show's executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrows, Schneider says, was able to bring the original concept of Ed to life. 
"Ed's half and half -- and walks in both worlds, straddling Western and Native 
American culture." 
</P>
<P>
 While Burrows has spent the last four years devoted to the show, he recently 
found time to host a TBS "Audubon" documentary on bears in Alaska. "It was a 
lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He's thrilled that Ed's been given more to do. "He's really growing up -- it 
makes it really fun. He's not just this big dumb kid with the same haircut." 
</P>
<P>
 His producers want to widen his range as well. "We're really broadening him," 
Frolov says. "We are doing a show where he plays a Native American in the past, 
a guide, a warrior different from Ed. Darren's just great and enthusiastic 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider adds: "That episode shows how really handsome he is. He has a lot of 
leading man qualities that we haven't really exploited from Ed." 
</P>
<P>
 And that just gives Burrows more of an opportunity to act, which he defines in 
his own individual way as, 'There's a moment of epiphany in the groove and 
you're jammin'." 
</P>
<P>
 "Northern Exposure" airs Mondays at 10 p.m. on CBS.

RETRO; FAN FARE; TNT CONTINUES TO PAIR UP FILMS WITH A HOST WHO CARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 For the last two years, actors, directors, sports figures, musicians and other 
celebs have turned cineastes as hosts of TNT's popular weekly showcase "Our 
Favorite Movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme talked about the 1959 thriller "North by 
Northwest" and the influence of its director, Alfred Hitchcock, on his career. 
"Seinfeld's" Jason Alexander wore a Roman toga to chat about the mythical 
adventure film "Jason and the Argonauts." The then-happily married Tom and 
Roseanne Arnold shared their romantic feelings for the Barbra Streisand-Robert 
Redford drama "The Way We Were." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Favorite Movies: Summer Edition" kicked off its third season on July 7 
with Phil Hartman of "Saturday Night Live" fame hosting the 1959 Billy Wilder 
classic "Some Like It Hot." ("Our Favorite Movies: Winter Edition" is scheduled 
to begin early next year.) 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Tim Burton hosts the 1953 horror film "House of Wax," which stars 
one of the "Batman" director's idols, Vincent Price. On Aug. 4, "NYPD Blue" 
Dennis Franz presents the 1972 Charles Bronson Mafia flick "The Valachi 
Papers." Country singer Randy Travis is on hand Aug. 11 for the 1960 Western 
"The Magnificent Seven." Aug. 17th will feature two surprise hosts and movie. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 25, former Chicago Bear coach Mike Ditka hosts the 1974 Burt Reynolds 
football comedy "The Longest Yard." The "Summer Edition" concludes Sept. 1 with 
Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone offering his opinions on the 1951 Hitchcock 
masterpiece "Strangers On a Train." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Favorite Movies" is the brainchild of Tom Karsch, TNT's vice president of 
sports marketing and network promotion. When it first began, the showcase 
consisted primarily of behind-the-scenes information and interviews with stars 
and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Karsch decided to revamp the movie-of-the-week franchise. And that 
something new was to get a celebrity host whose link to a particular film would 
vary "from those who had a sincere love for the movie to someone who had some 
connection to a movie. In year one, we had 'Anatomy of Murder' and we got 
Geraldo Rivera to host. What his take on it was how the murder mystery within 
the movie would play out in today's media." 
</P>
<P>
 So just how does TNT pick hosts and movies? According to Karsch, it's a 
combination of things. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy like Phil Hartman -- there was a guy whom we all liked. We think he has 
a great comedic sensibility. We gave him a call. We asked him what some of his 
favorite movies were and on his list was 'Some Like it Hot," which is a movie 
we had (in the Turner film library)." 
</P>
<P>
 With Dennis Franz and "The Valachi Papers," Karsch says, "there's a movie 
that's perfect. This guy has been in many Mafia-related movies and plenty of 
cop movies and his ("NYPD Blue") show. That was kind of an easy one for us and 
an easy one for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Karsch also wants to give viewers celebrity hosts from a variety of fields. 
Last year, Utah Jazz great Karl Malone hosted the 1948 John Wayne film "Three 
Godfathers." "I was doing some work with Karl Malone, and it turned out he was 
this huge movie fan. He loved Westerns and John Wayne. We went to him to do 
something a little different." 
</P>
<P>
 On the average, TNT tapes two hours of material with each host. "I think what 
you end up seeing on the air is an intro piece into the movie, which is about 
five-plus minutes long and we use them for 15 seconds and 30 seconds (after 
commercials). It's not an intense talking-head type stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Karsch's favorite hosts was "Seinfeld's" loopy Michael Richards, who 
presented the 1964 Peter Sellers comedy "A Shot in the Dark," in a very 
Kramer-esque manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns out he was a huge Peter Sellers fan," Karsch says. "When we got to 
his hotel to interview him, he had already concocted a whole scenario for 
filming this thing which he never bothered to tell anybody. He basically did 
the whole interview in a bathrobe. He set up this scenario so that TNT showed 
up actually a half-hour early as he was getting ready to do the interview. So 
we got him to do everything from gargling to changing to showing us what 
outfits he was thinking about wearing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Favorite Movies" airs Thursdays through Sept. 1 at 6 p.m. on TNT; it will 
air Wednesday Aug. 3 and 17 at 6 p.m.

RESTAURANT NEWS: TATOU MAY TAKE A TRIP TO CENTURY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "In the restaurant business in Los Angeles the crowd comes, they stay for six 
months and move on to the next life," Tatou founder Mark Fleischman says. 
"Luckily I caught it in time and am starting to expand the entertainment (side 
of the business)."  
</P>
<P>
 But that's not all he has in store for the 18-month-old Beverly Hills 
restaurant/nightclub. Guess? Inc. co-founder Georges Marciano recently bought 
the Beverly Drive building, and now Fleischman is planning to relocate Tatou. 
"I do have a lease," he says, "but I have been looking at larger spaces. We're 
talking about moving in nine months to a year, to Tripp's in Century City. The 
shows at Tatou are on the expensive side to produce, and I could use more 
seats." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he schedules two shows nightly, one of the biggest problems Fleischman 
faces is getting the food out quickly. To speed things up, he's hired Juan 
Mercado, who had been chef at Columbia Bar and Grill in Hollywood until its 
recent closure. "They had the same sort of Hollywood-y clientele that we have 
and I loved the food there," Fleischman says. "And he gets it out fast." 
</P>

 PASTA DAYS: When Pavarotti came to Los Angeles last week for the 
super-spectacle "Encore! The Three Tenors" at Dodger Stadium, he didn't dine at 
Rex Il Ristorante or Valentino or Drago, or even Louise's. The tenor superstar 
stayed with friends and did his own cooking. "He's afraid to eat out right 
now," says Tony May, who owns the elegant New York Italianrestaurant San 
Domenico where the hefty opera star frequently dines. "He's been on a diet and 
doesn't want to overeat. Plus he's a good cook and is very particular." 
</P>
<P>
 According to May, who was in L.A. for the concert and World Cup finals, 
Pavarotti loves simple food such as spaghetti with basil and tomato, soft 
cheeses and good risotto, "but it must be made with olive oil, not butter." The 
big guy eats regular-sized portions, too. "Maybe 100 grams (about four ounces) 
of pasta," May says. "But once it's cooked it becomes a substantial amount." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 LES ARTS OF THE DEAL: Ever since he closed Fleur de Vin a year ago, owner 
Patrick Gruest has been trying to reopen the Pasadena space. First, a huge 
banner in the window announced a new name -- Les Arts -- and the imminent 
return of former Fleur de Vin chef Ron Baker. "I did have meetings with Patrick 
and we talked about employment," confirms Baker. "But I was just playing along 
to try to get some back wages Patrick owed me. I ended up asking him to take my 
name off the window." 
</P>
<P>
 Gruest tells another story: "After the riots, business got so bad I asked all 
my employees to take a pay cut. That's the money Ron says I owe him." 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, Jean-Francois Meteigner, former chef at Cicada and, before that, 
L'Orangerie, informed Calendar that he'd been hired as chef. He lasted a month. 
"I wrote the menu, but fortunately I never gave him my recipes," Meteigner 
says. "Everybody knows how Patrick is." 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit I had a lot of problems with Fleur de Vin in the past," Gruest says. 
"I was not in the restaurant business before and I made some mistakes."  
</P>
<P>
 Gruest is intent on putting all that behind him. Within the next month, he 
plans to open Les Arts, a contemporary French restaurant with entrees in the 
$14 to $25 range. And, in the back, Cafe des Arts will feature French bistro 
dishes under $12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many Los Angeles restaurants offer very low-priced entrees and overprice 
everything else," Gruest says. "We will not do that. You won't have to pay $5 
for a cup of espresso here." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Meteigner plans to open his own place, where he will cook -- 
surprise, surprise -- French fare. Sources say he has leased the former 
Champagne Bis space on Little Santa Monica Boulevard, but Meteigner won't 
confirm. However, according to Alcohol Beverage Control, the liquor license has 
been posted by California Frog Cafe, Inc. Hmmmmm.

INSIDE THE KLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Braxton's story on Myrlie Evers, the widow of civil rights activist 
Medgar Evers, erred carelessly in describing my book "Klandestine" ("She's Kept 
Her Eyes on the Prize," July 10). 
</P>
<P>
 My book was published in 1975, not 1965.It provided crucial new evidence for 
the successful reopening of the prosecution of Byron de la Beckwith for the 
1963 murder of Medgar Evers. I quoted Beckwith's admission of the crime as 
recalled by Delmar Dennis, who was not just "a former Klan officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis was the most important FBI informant in the October, 1967, trial of the 
Klan leaders and members who killed Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James 
Chaney in 1964. His testimony about Beckwith, as reported in my book, made 
possible Beckwith's recent conviction and justice after three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, last Feb. 5, in a story on the conviction, The Times did not 
even mention Dennis' name. But after the verdict came in, Myrlie Evers hugged 
Dennis and told him she realized how important his role had been. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the reason for the poor reporting is the fact that Dennis and I were 
motivated to do what we did largely because of the understanding we gained as 
members of the anti-totalitarian and anti-racist John Birch Society. At least 
Myrlie and her family know the truth.

THE EYES HAD IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "The Man Who Shot Great Movies," by Kenneth Turan (July 3). 
</P>
<P>
 John Ford once said, "The main thing about directing is: photograph the 
people's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Those lucky enough to watch all or most of the Ford films showcased in the 
retrospective "John Ford's Century" will share in the evolution, over the 
course of half a century of filmmaking, of Ford's ever-changing ideas and 
attitudes about society and its members. However, one masterful constant 
remains throughout, and from a man with poor eyesight, we gain vision. 
</P>
<P>
 We always see the people's eyes. We see through the windows of their humanity. 
We see ourselves. 
</P>

<P>
 With the recent revival of interest in the Western film genre, the homage to 
John Ford couldn't have been more timely. 
</P>
<P>
 The excruciatingly dull Lawrence Kasdan-Kevin Costner oater "Wyatt Earp" 
merely serves as a reminder of just what a great filmmaker Ford was. Countless 
directors have vainly attempted to duplicate his concise style over years, only 
to be buried in the cinematic sagebrush. 
</P>
<P>
 What made Ford the master of American movies was his unmatched ability with 
the camera to move the story of a film along, as well as his equally superb 
skill in bringing out the best possible performance from his actors. Ford may 
not always have been a sweetheart, but he never served his performers wrong, 
judging from his finished products. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate proof of the master's abilities is showcased in the thrilling 
climax of "The Searchers," his 1956 masterpiece, as it is virtually impossible 
to avoid getting goose bumps when John Wayne swoops Natalie Wood up into his 
arms and gently intones to her, "Let's go home, Debbie." 
</P>
<P>
 Truly, this is art as sketched by a master. 
</P>

<P>
 I enjoyed Kenneth Turan's article on John Ford. Almost 60 years ago, I worked 
as assistant film editor on his "Steamboat 'Round the Bend." The film editor 
was Jack Murray, who often worked with Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 As Turan relates, Ford did not look at dailies. After viewing the previous 
day's work, Murray would go on the set to report to Ford. After shooting was 
completed, Murray continued to assemble the first cut without a visit from Ford 
until he was ready to show the film to Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 What impressed me most about Ford was his amazing memory. During the screening 
he obviously had total recall of every detail of every setup that he had staged 
weeks earlier. He asked for a close-up here, an over-the-shoulder shot there, 
etc., etc. Only after another screening or two did Ford come to our cutting 
room for the final touches. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN E. POMMER 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Ford himself once remarked -- after watching one of his 1941 films -- "I 
looked at it and threw up." Actually, there are a lot of us out here in the 
hinterlands who've looked at trash such as the loathsome "The Searchers" (1956) 
and "Cheyenne Autumn" (1964) and wanted very much to throw up but refrained 
purely out of respect for the theater owners and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's Westerns weren't the only ones filled with anti-Indian venom, but he 
was certainly in the forefront of the attack. And let's not forget the 
anti-Negro (operative term at the time) strain running through his 1930s 
non-Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone else discoursing about Ford, Turan tells us "what a masterly eye 
he had for composition," "how he painted scenes in his head." Too bad he 
couldn't have concentrated more on the words in the scripts, instead of 
virtually discarding them. 
</P>
<P>
 When a director takes this arrogant an attitude -- concentrating more time on 
placement of the camera and actors than on what the characters are saying and 
doing -- be sure we've got trouble right here in River City. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact is, Ford may have been a competent director -- and, on occasion, more 
than that -- but contrary to his own belief and the feeling of his disciples, 
he wasn't God, in front of, behind or away from the camera.

 Chris Willman's article on Adam Sandler of "Saturday Night Live" provided 
interesting insight into one of "SNL's" best character players ("Just Call Him 
Bankable Boy," July 10). 
</P>
<P>
 However, Willman neglected to mention one of Sandler's earliest forays into 
television.Sandler played Stickpin (and a few others) on MTV's initial attempt 
at a game show, "Remote Control." 
</P>
<P>
 Even this supposed rising comic actor has humble, and sometimes forgettable, 
beginnings.

 There is only one thing more embarrassing than the last couple of years of 
"SNL," and that's some journalist praising the most talentless, juvenile and 
offensive member of the current cast. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so uncomfortable to watch the guest hosts suffer through pointless 
sketches. If Adam Sandler is representative of the future of "SNL," it becomes 
clear that the demographics the show is shooting for are the 8- to 15- 
year-olds. They should air the show at 8, or change the name to "Saturday 
Morning Live."

 Adam Sandler, bankable boy? You have got to be kidding. He is the biggest 
no-talent on "SNL." His characters are all the same. I've always thought that 
Lorne Michaels must be his uncle.

ALASKANS MEASURE LOSSES IN DIVERSE WAYS -- MISSING DUCKS, DEAD SEALS, 
WORM-INFESTED SALMON, A WAY OF LIFE.

 For Eddie Lavshakoff, it's the bleak silence of a bay once clamoring with 
ducks. For John Totemoff, it's the empty ledge where he used to hunt seals. For 
Gail Evanoff, it's the ominous oddities -- herring with lesions, a 
worm-infested salmon -- that make her suspicious of the waters she once trusted 
to sustain her. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of this Aleut village say they don't need scientific studies or 
economic models to know that Prince William Sound still suffers from the Exxon 
Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 They keep their own watch, and for them the greatest losses are impossible to 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's just wrong since the oil spill," villager Mary Kompkoff said. "I 
was brought up eating food off the land and water, and we never thought twice 
about things when we ate them. Now, I'm thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Chenega Bay's 70 residents are among 14,000 Alaska Natives, commercial 
fishermen and others suing Exxon Corp. for up to $16.5 billion in the wake of 
the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been five years since the biggest oil spill in U.S. history smeared 11 
million gallons of North Slope crude across Alaska's wild southern coast. Now, 
the biggest environmental lawsuit in U.S. history is taking stock of the 
disaster's economic and ecological impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is in its third month and far from done. But already it is clear to 
Chenega Bay residents that some costs can never be tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our lifestyle, our culture," John Totemoff said, standing on his 
small fishing boat, just in from an early morning trip that netted 16 salmon 
for his family's use next winter. "How could I put a price tag on this?" 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the first to ask. Lawsuits started piling up against Exxon just four 
days after the Exxon Valdez tanker struck Bligh Reef on March 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Exxon took out full-page newspaper ads, promising to "meet 
our obligations to all those who have suffered damage from the spill." 
</P>
<P>
 That broad promise soon required qualification. As the oil spread, ultimately 
fouling 1,500 miles of coastline, the spill's economic repercussions reached 
even farther across Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some winners, such as the fishermen "spillionaires" who chartered 
out their boats to Exxon during the $2-billion cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also were many victims -- from the coastal fishermen who claimed 
they were ruined by lost fishing seasons, to the homesteader far inland who 
grumbled that his moose-hunting suffered because of cleanup-related traffic on 
the Glenn Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The homesteader was among the few who didn't sue Exxon. By last winter, the 
roster of plaintiffs included tour-boat operators and fishing guides, sea-otter 
researchers whose oiled subjects had died by the thousands, and thousands of 
net menders, boat builders, cannery workers and seafood wholesalers dependent 
on the fishing fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Many plaintiffs were dismissed in March, when U.S. District Judge H. Russel 
Holland in Anchorage ruled that onshore businesses had no legal claims if they 
hadn't suffered direct physical damage from the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question but that the Exxon Valdez grounding impacted, in one 
fashion or another, far more people than will ever recover anything in these 
proceedings," Holland wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims remaining are complex enough. Attorneys for 10,000 commercial 
fishermen and 4,000 Alaska Natives have been arguing their case before a 
federal jury in Anchorage since May 9, seeking more than $1 billion in actual 
damages and up to $15 billion in punitive damages from Exxon and tanker Capt. 
Joseph Hazelwood. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away in a state courtroom, attorneys for six coastal towns and 
six Alaska Native corporations are seeking $100 million in a trial that began 
July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon lost the first phase of the federal trial in June, when jurors decided 
that recklessness on the part of Exxon and Hazelwood led to the spill. The 
plaintiffs had argued that Hazelwood was drunk the night of the spill and that 
Exxon had known about his drinking for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the jury considered claims by commercial fishermen that not only did the 
spill ruin salmon and herring harvests by disrupting Prince William Sound's 
ecological balance, it depressed prices for fish caught by tainting the 
reputation of Alaska salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon argued that the ecological damage was not as severe as the plaintiffs 
claimed, and that world market conditions and competition from farmed salmon 
were to blame for falling fish prices. 
</P>
<P>
 For three weeks, dueling scientists, economists and other expert witnesses 
debated the spill's biological and economic fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs' attorneys drew upon state and federal studies to portray a 
marine environment torn apart by oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Government scientists estimate 300,000 to 645,000 birds were killed outright 
by the oil, and some devastated bird populations, including common murres and 
harlequin ducks, are failing to reproduce in areas that were oiled. Young sea 
otters are dying in unusual numbers in western Prince William Sound, possibly 
from feeding on mussel beds where oil remains trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important to fishermen, runs of pink salmon returning to Prince William 
Sound have plummeted for the last two summers, after strong showings in 1990 
and 1991. Likewise, springtime herring harvests, strong in 1991 and 1992, were 
cut short this year and last year when too few fish showed up. Many herring had 
organ damage and lesions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Exxon's experts say blaming all the sound's problems on a spill that 
happened five years ago is overly simplistic. Herring and salmon populations 
fluctuate naturally because of changes in ocean temperature and food supply, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contend that Exxon's cleanup efforts, combined with winter storms, 
have scoured nearly all the oil from Prince William Sound beaches. Even in 
1989, one scientist testified, the dissolved oil in most areas did not reach 
levels toxic to fish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stale air of the windowless courtroom, attorneys have struggled to keep 
the working-class jury's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me bring up another chart that will help explain this," an Exxon lawyer 
said during one tedious session on fish forecasting. Two jurors traded tight 
smiles. Another tilted her head back and yawned. The judge rubbed his eyes. It 
was 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury started deliberating the fishermen's claims July 12 with a verdict 
form that looked like a Chinese menu. Year by year, species by species, area by 
area, they had to decide whether the oil spill caused poor fish runs or reduced 
the prices paid to fishermen. Then, they had to calculate a dollar amount for 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishermen sought $895 million in compensation. Exxon suggested about $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the imponderables involved, the commercial fishermen's claims at least 
dealt with a market commodity. The trial's next phase, dealing with claims by 
Alaska Natives that the oil spill kept them from their subsistence hunting and 
fishing, plunges the jury into more nebulous territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Natives do not sell the wild foods they harvest, so how does one calculate 
their value? What price the loss of seagull eggs or seal livers, of herring roe 
on kelp? 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Holland ruled the Natives could not sue for losses to their cultural 
heritage. He limited their damage claims to the economic value of their lost 
harvests, using equivalent store-bought foods as a guide. He did not mention 
what those equivalents might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the jury will face the greatest imponderable yet: How do you punish, if 
you punish at all, one of the world's largest corporations, a company with 
sales of $111 billion and profits of $5.3 billion last year? 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon points to its efforts after the spill -- the $2 billion it spent on 
cleanup, the $900-million settlement it reached with state and federal agencies 
to compensate for damage to natural resources, the $300 million in damages it 
paid voluntarily to fishermen and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need any punishment," said Exxon attorney James Neal. "I think we've 
been punished enough." 
</P>
<P>
 In Chenega Bay, Mary Kompkoff had another view. 
</P>
<P>
 "No money in the world will change what Exxon did to us," she said. "No money 
in the world will ever make it the same."

BOSNIA FAMILIES FIGHT TO REUNITE; BALKANS: WAR LEAVES MULTITUDE OF CHILDREN 
WITHOUT PARENTS. MANY ARE AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES NOW 
LIVING IN CROATIA.

 Spring, 1992. War engulfs tranquil Bosnia-Herzegovina. Tens of thousands of 
parents, desperate to save their children, send them off on buses, trucks, even 
on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years and 200,000 dead or missing later, many of those children have no 
idea where their parents are, and parents search for their children in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the children left alone are Muslims, who suffered most when Bosnian 
Serbs launched the war in response to Muslim and Croat declarations of 
independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fighting ebbs, international aid workers are trying to help reunite 
divided families. Sometimes the search crisscrosses the globe. At home, it is 
hampered by disrupted road, rail, telephone and mail links between Bosnia and 
Croatia, where up to 300,000 Muslims and Croats from Bosnia have taken refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lost children are in Serbia, but most Serbs who fled Bosnia did so in a 
more organized fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Three agencies are trying to reunite families -- the International Committee 
of the Red Cross, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, and 
Unaccompanied Children in Exile, a Croatian group. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows just how big the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross lists 1,200 children as "unaccompanied," or separated from both 
parents and without a guardian. The U.N. agency and the Croatian organization 
so far have registered 1,100 children under 18 without at least one parent, 
including 110 who have had no contact for about two years. U.N. officials fear 
the total number of unaccompanied children could be as high as 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even many children who are safe with other relatives no longer have clear 
memories of their parents. They tend to grow up quickly, burying the emotional 
loss under a tough surface. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nejra Sprzo was 15, a year older than her brother, Mustafa, their mother 
put them and five cousins on a bus leaving Sarajevo for Zagreb, where their 
grandmother lived. Her mother promised Nejra they would all be back in a week 
and she would get a new dress. That was 27 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, when telephone lines to Sarajevo were finally restored, Nejra talked 
to her mother again for the first time. "Mummy, I'm not your little girl any 
more," she said. "Don't worry about us. We learned how to take care of 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Mirsada Omercevic, now 12, and her sister, 14-year-old Suada, last saw their 
mother in April, 1992, when they were sent by bus from Ribnica in northern 
Bosnia to an uncle in Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 "For two years, we did not know what happened to Mum or Dad," Mirsada said. 
"We only heard that our house was burned down." 
</P>
<P>
 When their mother finally called on a mobile phone a few weeks ago, "I almost 
didn't recognize her voice," Mirsada said. "She only had time to tell us they 
moved to another village and are all alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other parents cannot call because they don't know where their children 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanela Huskic, 40, asked Unaccompanied Children in Exile to help find her son, 
Almir. He was 14 in August, 1992, when Serb guards took him and his father 
separately from the prison camp in eastern Bosnia where the family was held. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then, I never heard from him," Huskic said by telephone from a refugee 
camp in Denmark, where she and her daughter, Alisa, now 14, landed after a long 
journey through Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 She keeps Almir's photograph deep in a drawer because "if I looked at it, I 
couldn't stop the tears." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesna Bosnjak, head of the Croatian agency, said it is trying to help at least 
40 parents with missing children. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were working abroad when the war began and had left their children at 
home in Bosnia, she said. Others "were in such a panic that they just gave 
their child to someone leaving a war zone, to a group or person, without asking 
anything, without papers. And now they do not know where their child is." 
</P>
<P>
 "When the war began, people were scared and the only thing they thought of was 
to try and guarantee safety for their child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandra Zivkovic, another official of the agency, said it may take months, 
even years, to track down the missing parents and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are still fighting for their lives in Bosnia," she said. 
"When the war stops, we'll maybe have more cases." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. refugee agency has announced plans to establish a computer network 
across former Yugoslavia as part of its Operation Reunite. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnjak's organization has relied on word of mouth, ham radio and newspaper 
ads to connect parents and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross offices use their unique message system: Anyone can send a message 
from any of the 112 nations where Red Cross or Red Crescent societies operate. 
Red Cross convoys carry the messages even to remote areas of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Twinch of the Red Cross said 7 million such messages had crossed the 
battle lines in former Yugoslavia.

BITTER PERSONAL LOSSES ENGULF BOSNIA TEEN

 Alma Dautovic, 16, saw both her parents consumed by war. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs drove her family from Cela, their village near Prijedor in 
northern Bosnia, late in 1992.They took refuge nearby with relatives, but her 
mother insisted on returning to see their burned home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just sitting and crying, looking at the house . . . and then she got 
a heart attack," Alma said. Her eyes welled with tears as she described 
sneaking back to Cela to bury her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father kept returning to Cela and saw everything the Serbs did, Alma said. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, they came for him at his place of refuge, as her brothers listened 
from the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to go and see everybody coming back from Serb detention camps," she 
said. "I tried to find his name on Red Cross lists, but no one has seen him or 
heard of him. I'm afraid he was just killed in the woods, like so many others. 
I almost completely abandoned hope of ever seeing him again." 
</P>
<P>
 With her two older brothers in refugee camps in Croatia and Sweden, Alma sees 
only one way out of her camp in Zagreb: go to live with her boyfriend, Boro, a 
fighter with the Bosnian Croats in Orasje, northeastern Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Boro, a Serb, was reared by a Muslim family after his parents were killed in 
an auto accident when he was 6 months old. Alma said Boro is a Serb "only by 
his genes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I have to go on living, even though I already lived through all of 
that," she said.

SERENE KASHMIR A HOTBED OF REBELLION, VIOLENCE; ASIA: NORMALITY IS AN ILLUSION; 
INSURGENCY, BRUTALITY AND FEAR ARE THE REALITIES. INDIA AND PAKISTAN DISPUTE 
THE TERRITORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a sunny Sunday, flat-bottomed punts glide through the lily ponds of Dal 
Lake, rippling the reflection of snowy mountains in the silent water. Young men 
play a raucous soccer game in a lakeside park. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, Kashmir looks like what it once was: a peaceful land of natural 
splendor, a serene retreat for the wealthy from the heat of the Indian plain. 
</P>
<P>
 But normality in Kashmir is an illusion. Insurgency, brutality and fear are 
the realities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, bloodshed erupted with the ferocity of holy war in this Himalayan 
valley of apple orchards and rice paddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim militants rebelled against four decades of what they described as 
corrupt and arrogant rule by India, a predominantly Hindu country. Islamic 
Pakistan, which bases its own claim to Kashmir on the valley's Muslim majority, 
supported the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 India, a patchwork of ethnic groups with their own aspirations, poured 
soldiers into the region, fearing the loss of its state of Jammu-Kashmir would 
be the first step toward disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, half a million Indian soldiers are in the state to defend an 
increasingly hostile frontier with Pakistan and contain a population that grows 
ever more embittered. Two of the wars India and Pakistan have fought since 
independence in 1947 were over Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the rebellion began, Jammu-Kashmir has become a drain on India's economy 
and a stain on its reputation as a democratic nation with respect for human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Javed Ahmed Lone, 16, lies in a hospital in Sopore, 30 miles north of 
Srinagar, his thighs swollen and discolored by yellow and black bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put a heavy roller across his legs and rolled it back and forth with the 
weight of two men on it," Dr. Sofi Farooq said. "When the local police brought 
him here, he was in deep shock. It was difficult to revive him. . . . He was 
almost dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Lone had been dragged out of his school three hours earlier by Indian 
paramilitary troops and accused of links with separatist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim militants show equal disrespect for human values. Grenade attacks on 
Indian patrols often kill or wound as many Kashmiris as Indians. Kashmiris 
suspected of collaboration with the Indians are murdered gangland-style. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, about 200,000 Hindus fled the Kashmir valley because of Muslim 
terrorists. That process is being repeated now in the southern part of 
Jammu-Kashmir as Muslim militants move into new areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly two-thirds of the state's 6 million people are Muslims, and most want 
either independence or union with Pakistan. But some, weary of the 
bloodletting, privately acknowledge that they feel caught between trigger-happy 
Indian soldiers and militants who demand loyalty and often money. 
</P>
<P>
 Resentment of the militants was expressed openly after a popular Muslim 
preacher, Qazi Nissar Ahmed, was killed June 20, apparently for criticizing 
them. Tens of thousands of mourners gathered in the town of Anantnag, many 
shouting slogans against Pakistan and the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under threat of sanctions from the United States, Pakistan has stopped openly 
supporting the rebellion with men and weapons. When winter thaws to spring and 
mountain passes reopen to illicit traffic with Pakistan, however, the daily 
death toll climbs to a dozen or more. 
</P>
<P>
 India says 9,300 people have been killed in the rebellion, but the true number 
may be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, 1992, more than 600 people have been executed without trial by 
security forces after being taken into custody, said Mian Abdul Qayoom, 
president of the Kashmir Bar Assn. At least 500 more are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Srinagar, an old town of wood and brick buildings beside the muddy Jhelum 
River, looks like a military garrison. Paramilitary police in flak jackets and 
helmets stand like the slats of a picket fence along the streets. Sandbagged 
bunkers obstruct busy intersections. Burned-out buildings scar Lal Chowk, the 
main square. 
</P>
<P>
 At dusk, the city dies, except for the crackle of gunfire when Muslim 
militants taunt the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "India can never win back the Kashmiris, not even after 1,000 years," said 
Khawaja Sunaulah Butt, editor of Aftab, the state's largest-circulation daily 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kashmiris may compromise with India, but not from the heart," said the 
72-year-old editor, who opposed the uprising when it began. "In their hearts, 
the Kashmiris hate India." 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of the conflict are in the division of Britain's colony on the 
subcontinent into India and Pakistan after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 India says Kashmir is inseparable from it, citing the 1947 accession by 
Kashmir's Hindu king after India rescued him from an invasion of Muslim 
tribesmen. Pakistan supports a U.N. resolution passed in 1949, after the first 
India-Pakistan war, proposing a referendum in which Kashmiris could choose 
between India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Kashmiris feel equally uncomfortable with India, where Hindu nationalism 
is becoming more strident, and Pakistan, which practices a sterner form of 
Islam than the tolerant Sufism that came to the valley in the 14th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian and Western military officers say the ground war has changed in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 India's army has flushed militants from urban strongholds and regained control 
of the cities. Guerrillas who once manned barricades in Sopore and other towns 
have retreated to safe houses and are restricted to sniping and grenade attacks 
on Indian bunkers. The Muslims have regrouped in the forests south of the 
Kashmir Valley, threatening the only road through the mountains to Srinagar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozens of militant groups have been weakened further by fighting among 
themselves. The pro-independence Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, which started 
the rebellion and remains the strongest political movement, has been virtually 
eliminated as a military factor. The pro-Pakistan Hizbul Moujahedeen accounts 
for about half of the effective fighting force. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the Kashmiri fighters were reinforced by veterans of the 10-year 
Afghan revolution against Soviet occupation, which ended in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Western military analysts estimate that up to 10% of the 4,000 to 5,000 
fighters in Kashmir are from outside -- mostly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, 
with a few from Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
 More skirmishes are being reported on the India-Pakistan frontier. The 
analysts say Indian troops direct machine-gun and mortar fire at Pakistani 
villages they feel may be sheltering Muslim guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. observers on the cease-fire line between Indian and Pakistani Kashmir 
reported 947 incidents in 1993, about 600 in the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports to U.N. headquarters this year said 25 people were killed and 103 
wounded on the Pakistani side of the frontier from February to May. India does 
not allow the observers to investigate border incidents on its side. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States tried unsuccessfully to start negotiations between India and 
Pakistan on restricting the development or use of nuclear weapons, which both 
are believed to possess. 
</P>
<P>
 Under American sponsorship, a group of intellectuals, ex-generals and former 
diplomats from both countries launched the Nimrana Initiative, named for the 
rebuilt fortress where they first met in secret two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective is to think the unthinkable and speak the unspeakable," an 
Indian participant said. "We have no inhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Four Kashmiris were invited to speak at the seventh meeting, in May.

 They killed 17, including a 6-year-old girl and her mother, and wounded 26. A 
soldier bled to death as the rebels fled and his comrades radioed for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambush in March was typical of a civil war that has taken 500 lives in 
five years on the lush tropical island 600 miles northeast of Port Moresby. 
Finally, both sides are realizing neither can win and are moving toward peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The possibility of a military solution being imposed . . . is nil," said 
Stephen Loosely, an Australian lawmaker who led a fact-finding delegation to 
Bougainville. "Secession cannot be won through military means." 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting began in 1989 after a long dispute between traditional landowners and 
an Australian company that ran a copper mine, then the world's largest, near 
the town of Panguna. 
</P>
<P>
 The national economy has survived because of new mineral projects elsewhere, 
but Bougainville's future looks bleak if the war continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign aid agencies estimate that thousands of civilians, many of them 
children and old people, have died of malnutrition and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 A government blockade intended to stop smuggled arms also has reduced 
shipments of food and medicine. About 50,000 residents have fled their homes to 
government-run camps, known euphemistically as "care centers." Dozens of 
villages and the provincial capital, Arawa, are in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Paias Wingti acknowledges serious lapses of discipline by the 
military, but says claims of human rights abuses are exaggerated by "ignorant 
international do-gooders." He insists that most Bougainvilleans support the 
government and are being terrorized by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace talks have failed twice, but there are optimistic signs this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to search for various peaceful ways to quickly resolve this 
crisis," said Wingti, who has previously demanded unconditional surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels also are sounding conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere . . . there's a shared middle ground," spokesman Mike Forster told 
the Sydney Morning Herald.

ONLY SIX DECADES AWAY FROM STONE AGE, ISLANDERS TRADE FAX NUMBERS; PAPUA NEW 
GUINEA: UNDER A FLAMING ORANGE HEADDRESS AND CLAD IN A LOINCLOTH, ONE NATIVE 
ENTREPRENEUR HANDS OUT BUSINESS CARDS TO FOREIGNERS SEEKING INVESTMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Larry Andagali's painted face smiled broadly under a spectacular headdress of 
flaming orange feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 A carved wooden club spiked with a razor-sharp claw of a flightless cassowary 
bird was tucked under his arm. He wore a loincloth of woven string and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my fax number," he said, handing out business cards to foreigners 
seeking investment opportunities in Mt. Hagen, a frontier town in the remote 
highlands of Papua New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
 Andagali is the new face of this young nation with ancient traditions, a 
warrior turned executive. He and other indigenous entrepreneurs in Papua New 
Guinea, a region little known to the world before World War II, want to play a 
part in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 29, Andagali manages a company owned by 10 indigenous clans that collect 
joint royalties for natural gas pumped from their land. The clans, traditional 
enemies who fought each other for centuries, became partners in 1990 so the 
royalties could be used to create jobs and improve living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The culture of business is a something new to the culture of my people," 
Andagali said. The clans still fight, "but not as much as they used to and 
never about business." 
</P>
<P>
 Western civilization was late in coming to Papua New Guinea. Some communities 
saw their first Europeans only a few generations ago and are only "60 years 
from the Stone Age," said Julius Chan, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 4 million people still live in traditional villages, even though 
Papua New Guinea has one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Because of a 
boom in the development of natural resources, the gross domestic product grew 
by 14.4% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists regard the island nation just north of Australia as a mother lode 
of gold, copper and petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country can be called a golden land," Chan said in an interview during a 
government-sponsored tour for foreign investors and journalists. "I know it is 
a cliche phrase, but it is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Papua New Guinea enjoys a lively parliamentary democracy with a 
thriving free press, its governments have been sensitive about foreign media 
criticism and limit access for foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two decades after gaining independence from Australia, the country seeks 
to use its potential mineral wealth as a ticket to integration with Asian 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, it was admitted to the 17-member Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC), which promotes trade among Asia, the United States, Canada, Australia, 
China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Membership of APEC is a vote of confidence by the rest of the world in our 
future," Prime Minister Paias Wingti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several huge mines already are producing and prospectors are scouring the 
jungles, mountains and outer islands. Mining executives plan strategies in new 
air-conditioned office buildings in Port Moresby, the capital, and a stock 
market is to begin trading in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambitious projects in manufacturing, tourism and services are being planned. 
There is even a proposal to build a launching site for commercial satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our businessmen now are the first generation of Papua New Guineans coming 
from a traditional village," Wingti said. "Their parents could not speak 
English or write. We are quite proud that we are slowly building a middle class 
. . . to play an important role in development." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its potential riches, Papua New Guinea has serious problems. It still 
relies on financial aid from Australia, and health and education services are 
poor in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads, bridges and other infrastructure must be built. Mountains and thick 
jungles separate cities and towns now linked only by air or sea. Many villages 
are extremely remote. 
</P>
<P>
 A 500-mile land border with Indonesia that bisects the island of New Guinea is 
almost impossible to police. Fellow Melanesians on the other side often cross 
as refugees, sometimes pursued by Indonesian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 People in some parts of the country have never seen an airplane, Wingti said, 
and "others might see one only once a month bringing supplies and letters. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, he said, "a difficult country." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that difficulty is an enormous diversity of cultures and ethnic 
groups. In a land of more than 700 languages, the common tongue has become 
Pidgin, a stew of English and various European and indigenous dialects. 
</P>
<P>
 In most villages, food comes from gardens hacked out of the rain forest, and a 
man's wealth is often measured by the number of pigs he owns. Rural people who 
grow cash crops such as coconuts, cocoa and coffee now are suffering from a 
slump in world prices for those commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid modernization has come at a high price. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime has soared as young people drift into urban areas. When they find no 
work, some form what are known in Pidgin as "rascal" crime gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Walls topped with razor wire surround tourist hotels and the homes of 
foreigners. Stores have bars on their windows. The security-guard business is 
thriving. Police have set up roadblocks outside some towns to keep potential 
troublemakers away. 
</P>
<P>
 Several disputes have arisen between the government and mining companies over 
the level of foreign ownership in mineral projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some large mines have caused major pollution and logging of the rain forest, 
one of the largest after the Amazon, has been a serious concern. 
</P>
<P>
 On Bougainville, problems between foreign companies and traditional landowners 
led to a 5-year uprising in which at least 500 people have been killed. Many 
more are believed to have died from lack of food and medicine caused by a 
government blockade of the island.

TALKS TO END NIGERIAN OIL STRIKE STALL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nigerian oil workers walked out of a meeting with government officials Friday, 
abruptly stalling an effort to end a pro-democracy strike which has crippled 
most business activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the main oil union NUPENG, which has been on strike for three 
weeks, said their representatives quit the talks when authorities failed to 
produce the union's missing general-secretary, Frank Kokori. 
</P>
<P>
 Kokori has not been seen since July 6 when his family said he was picked up by 
security agents. His release is seen as key to ending the strikes.

BOYS HOME ALONE; SHOT HALTS INTRUDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four brothers were home alone when a man burst in. The boys scattered. The 
eldest -- just 13 -- went for his stepfather's .357 Magnum and fired through 
the bedroom door, striking the man in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The intruder stumbled into the front yard and collapsed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We taught him where to aim at the door if the door rattled," said the boy's 
stepfather, Gary Miner. "He did exactly as he was instructed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. David Moss ruled it a "pretty clear-cut" justifiable shooting. He 
also ruled out charges against the parents for allowing Jarrod Barnes and his 
brothers access to the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The break-in occurred in the middle of the day Wednesday, in a quiet, 
middle-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner said the boys were coping fine so far. He said he was the one who was 
shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't describe it. You feel violated," he said. "We didn't know if the 
man would have considered hurting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Miner, who works out of the family's three-bedroom brick home, said he was 
running a business errand when the break-in occurred. His wife was at her 
office, and the boys were home from school for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the man burst in through the front door, the 7- and 9-year-olds bolted 
into the bathroom, while Jarrod and his 12-year-old brother ran to a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jarrod reached for his father's weapon, his brother dialed 911. But the 
stranger kept coming, the boys told police. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives found a 15-inch screwdriver and a pocket knife on the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Friday identified the intruder as Samuel Lee Britt Jr., 41, and said he 
had had contact with police previously. No other information on Britt was 
immediately available. Police had said earlier that there didn't appear to be a 
connection between the family and the intruder. 
</P>
<P>
 Police searched for a woman seen driving from the home; she may have been the 
getaway driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner said his two oldest sons attended gun safety classes sponsored by the 
state Wildlife Conservation Department. And all his boys enjoy fishing and 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider the older boys to be experts with firearms," Miner said.

BIOLOGISTS BROOK NO OBSTACLES TO POND STOCKING; NATURE: HATCHERY CREW HIKES 
MILES THROUGH RUGGED TERRAIN, PACKING GALLONS OF WATER, TO PUT FISH IN LAKES. 
WHY? SO ANGLERS CAN TAKE THEM OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's an arduous climb up a steep and rocky trail to Horns Pond, set between a 
pair of 3,800-foot peaks in western Maine's spectacular Bigelow Range. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-mile hike is even tougher when you're toting 33 pounds of sloshing 
water on your back. 
</P>
<P>
 For Chris Short, the trek is anything but drudgery. He looks forward to his 
chance to deliver 200 tiny brook trout. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we do this," Short said as he loosened his tank pack, wiped his 
brow and gazed at West Peak rising majestically over the verdant forest. "There 
was always something magical about this area." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the time of year when Short, who supervises fish breeding at a state 
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife hatchery, packs the custom-made tanks and heads 
for the hills to stock some of Maine's most remote ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 With the six-gallon tanks on their backs, Short and his volunteer fish-packers 
balance their way across narrow log bridges, hop along rocks to cross rushing 
mountain brooks and fend off voracious black flies on the trails to Horns Pond 
and other isolated fishing sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission is to carry the "brookies" to sites that fish-stocking trucks 
cannot reach, and where it's too risky to attempt the job with state planes 
that swoop down and drop fish from barrel-shaped tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike to the five-acre Horns Pond is the longest and most demanding of six 
treks Short and his rugged associates make to backwoods ponds in late spring 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the hiking must be done within a two-week period, when the brook trout 
raised from eggs in state hatcheries have reached a stage where they can be 
released in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to it," said Short, 41, a veteran hiker who has logged 5,900 
miles hiking the entire Appalachian and Pacific Crest trails. On his fastest 
days he covered 36 miles, and his pace en route to Horns Pond attests to his 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maine's only backpacking fish stockers, Short and his crew are performing 
more of a service to anglers seeking a great wilderness fishing experience than 
trying to replenish natural stocks of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 4,300 fries stocked by Short and his men each spring grow to 16 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fishermen like to go up there and catch fish, so we'll stock it," said 
Dave Howatt, while making one of his many hikes to Horns Pond. One of Howatt's 
jobs is to keep track of what kinds of fish anglers find most desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Also making the hike -- and carrying another 200 tiny trout -- was Chris 
Hardy, who prefers the strenuous duty to his work culturing the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The release into Maine's remote ponds culminates a process that starts the 
previous fall, when eggs are artificially spawned from brood trout and 
fertilized. The young fish are then hatched and raised until they reach optimum 
age and size for stocking -- 2 to 2.5 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the trips through the forests and up the mountainsides, 
food is withheld from trout fries for two days so they cannot produce 
potentially toxic waste in their carrying tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish are then placed in buckets of water charged with extra oxygen to 
enable them to survive the trip. The water, normally 45 degrees in the 
hatchery, is cooled with ice to 32 degrees to slow down the metabolism of the 
fish during their ride. 
</P>
<P>
 When released into Horns Pond, the 400 tiny fish scattered; none appeared to 
have died during the two-hour hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at them, just taking off," said Short. "These started at our hatchery. 
It's a big deal to us."

THE CITADEL ORDERED TO ADMIT WOMAN TO ALL-MALE CADET CORPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Friday ordered a woman admitted to the all-male corps of 
cadets at The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck's order would make Shannon Faulkner the 
first woman to take part in full military training in the school's 151-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said the state school must admit Faulkner immediately, then develop 
plans for accommodating other women who want a military education. He gave the 
state until the fall of 1995 to implement that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has suggested it might create a parallel program for women at 
another school, similar to what Virginia has done in a case challenging the 
Virginia Military Institute's all-male policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Houck's ruling followed a 10-day trial in May of Faulkner's sex-discrimination 
lawsuit against the school. The Citadel and VMI are the only two 
state-supported all-male schools in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, 19, applied to The Citadel last year after asking her high school 
guidance counselor to delete references to her sex on her transcript. The 
college accepted her, then rejected her upon learning she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner then sued.

POLICE THROW 1868 BOOK AT MAN OVER FAILURE TO AID THEM

<TEXT>
<P>
 While sheriff's deputies grappled with a 6-foot-7, 280-pound drug suspect, 
James (Boo) Sullivan stood by and watched. 
</P>
<P>
 A deputy who dropped his radio during the five-minute struggle with Johnny 
Barr ordered Sullivan to pick it up so the officer could call for backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you crazy?" Sullivan responded, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 After the deputies finally subdued Barr, they went looking for Sullivan and 
charged him with failure to aid an officer, a little-used law on the books 
since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan could get up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. He was released 
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Barr, he was charged with cocaine possession, resisting arrest and 
other offenses, and was jailed without bail.

ROMANCING THE STONE, WOOING THE CLIENT: CUTTERS TRY NEW FACET; DESIGN: THEIR

 It's against the rules for Jeff Dreisin and Bob Mira to say too much about 
their clients, so they don't. This suits the clients and frustrates the 
partners, who have come to realize that secrecy inhibits growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows that we exist," said Dreisin, Mira's partner in Renaissance 
Stoneworks Inc. "That is a problem for us. You want everybody to know what 
you're doing, but you have to keep a low profile." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers of their work tend to be wealthy on a scale that is hard to comprehend. 
But for all their flash and glitter, potentates and movie stars are private 
about what goes into their homes. This lets their agents and brokers keep 
Dreisin and Mira in the dark about where their work is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have always tried to keep us as a deep secret while they're making all 
the money on our work," Dreisin said. "We finally got fed up and are trying to 
break out of that, and we're starting to get results." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in its 11-year existence, the Albertson, N.Y., company is 
trying to reach buyers directly. "It's all the difference in the world," 
Dreisin said. "Instead of getting paid $10,000 for something, now you're 
getting $50,000 for exactly the same work. Now it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance Stoneworks makes extraordinary and expensive pieces out of 
semiprecious stone, especially the lush dark green malachite and the azure blue 
lapis lazuli. Operating in a dusty shop not open to the public, Dreisin, Mira 
and employees Jason Apostoleris and Tim Weaver slice the stone into thin strips 
and apply it veneer-style to turn countertops, tables and desks into 
showpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 These items are not to everyone's taste or wallet. Most of them end up in the 
Mideast, where the use of malachite and lapis goes back to antiquity. Their 
most expensive piece to date was a malachite-covered entertainment center that 
they sold for $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even your average millionaire is not willing to spend $100,000 on a 
countertop," Dreisin said. "It's really for your decadently wealthy clientele 
who want something that no one else is going to have." 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment center reposes in a Middle Eastern palace they won't 
identify further. They know the identity of the buyer in this case only because 
Mira was summoned on a moment's notice to repair another of their works, a 
malachite tabletop broken in transit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rare opportunity to see my work in place," said Mira, who had never 
imagined such opulence. "The sheer magnitude and size and wealth -- it's just 
beyond words. I could have put my entire house in just one room of this 
palace." 
</P>
<P>
 Mira, 38, and Dreisin, 40, have worked together for almost 20 years. Dreisin 
had been part-owner of a delivery service, where folks who could afford it paid 
to have their whatnots delivered. "I really hated it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend introduced him to a former Big Band musician who crafted jewelry in 
his basement. "It sounded interesting," said Dreisin, who visited, stayed and 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreisin brought in Mira, who was then a chemical salesman. After eight years, 
the two struck out on their own to start Renaissance Stoneworks. "We had $200 
in the bank and three jobs, small stuff," Dreisin said. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the previous shop, they turned semiprecious stones into cuff links and 
little boxes and picture frames. "The more we worked in that vein, the more we 
were made aware of what used to be done in the old days, and that made us 
hungry to go into that same vein," Mira said of the glory days of lapidary, 
stone-cutting's formal name. "We didn't stay with the jewelry and the little 
boxes, because everybody does that. We wanted to do something different. We 
wanted to make a statement." 
</P>
<P>
 "Something that someone else does," Dreisin said, "we don't want to do it 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers cooperated by asking for more elaborate works, which now are 
limited, as Dreisin said, "only by our imagination and your budget." Among 
their major works were the Jacuzzi on a billionaire's airplane and all the 
countertops in a Washington apartment, just one of which cost $100,000 (done in 
lapis for a guest bathroom). On their design table is a 15-foot-high 
malachite-and-gold fountain for a palace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be true artists in this type of work," Mira said. "Back in the 
Medici days in Italy, they used to commission small workshops like our own to 
make works of art that are still around today. We have always envisioned that 
our work will far exceed our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance Stoneworks uses two or three tons of malachite a year. It comes 
from Zaire in boulders, grapefruit-sized to 150-pounders. The more expensive 
lapis, of which they use about 200 pounds a year, comes from Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You meet some real adventurers," Dreisin said of the traders who bring the 
rock out of dangerous places. "These guys are out of the movies." 
</P>
<P>
 The Renaissance stonecutters use water-cooled, diamond-tipped blades ranging 
up to 36 inches across to slice the rock into strips several inches long and 
about one-eighth of an inch thick. These are epoxied to marble and ground and 
polished to a smooth and lustrous veneer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients often like their malachite to include a design, which the stonecutters 
produce by combining nuances in shading and pattern. "No two jobs are ever the 
same," Dreisin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard part is shaping the stone into curves. "That's a trade secret," 
Dreisin said. "It's not any one trick. It's 20 tricks. And the end result 
appears as though it's carved out of a solid piece. There's only a handful of 
people in the world that know how it's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know how to find Renaissance Stonecutters include designers and 
galleries that order work on someone else's behalf -- and get their own cut of 
the action. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase their revenue, which approached $1 million last year, Dreisin and 
Mira want to bypass some of those in the middle. To do this, they recently were 
the subject of a show in Saudi Arabia and are about to open a showroom in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have been tight for the last 10 years, very tight," Mira said. "But 
now that we've made our new contacts, now that we're doing pieces of the size 
that we're doing . . . it's starting to roll in." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my goal," Dreisin said, "to be able to afford my own stuff."

EFFORT TO BAN HOUSEBOAT ROW STIRS UP KEY WEST; FLORIDA: MAYOR WANTS TO RETURN 
THE AREA TO A PRISTINE STATE. BUT RESIDENTS SAY SOME VESSELS CAN'T MAKE THE 
TRIP TO NEW SITE. 
</P>

<P>
 On a late spring day, Captain Claudia is living the good life, but not 
necessarily an easy one. She is painting her houseboat, Aquarius, on the 
eastern shore of paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it looks like a big wedding cake," Claudia Wood says of her immaculate 
turquoise-and-white triple-decker on Key West's Houseboat Row. "I tell you, I 
had to marry it when I got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood wouldn't have it any other way. She relishes a life many only dream 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 If she is not working on her beloved houseboat or playing the tenor saxophone, 
she is fishing. If she isn't fishing, she is taking divers or snorkelers to her 
favorite spots in the ocean or Florida Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just live day to day and everything is just as beautiful as I've ever 
seen," says Wood, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 But a big part of Wood's world could be literally hauled away and dismantled 
if Key West's mayor has his way. In April, the city joined with the Florida 
Cabinet and sued in Monroe County Circuit Court to evict the 26 boat owners on 
Houseboat Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Dennis Wardlow, who has made a career out of the houseboat issue, says 
he wants the area returned to a pristine state. An old photograph of the area 
-- without houseboats -- hangs in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything about Houseboat Row that is beneficial. It's just a 
bunch of people camping out," Wardlow says. "I used to fish in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 He says the residents can tug their boats around to new slips at the Garrison 
Bight Marina on the other side of the island as part of a lease agreement 
reached in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But boats such as the Aquarius no longer have the draft to make the long and 
expensive haul, and others will just tear up the bay bottom, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite denials, they contend the mayor really wants to make way for 
development by a wealthy landowner who has property surrounding the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it's a battle for our homes and where we've lived for years," says 
George Murphy, who is marshaling the fight against the mayor. "Some people 
perceive it as a battle between what may be called the funky old charm of Key 
West and the less-than-insightful development which has gone on over the 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Houseboat Row is not even on city property -- so its residents 
cannot vote. "One has to question the mayor's motives in aggressively pursuing 
a property that is outside his city limits," Murphy says. 
</P>
<P>
 People have been "camping out" on Cow Key Channel for nearly four decades, 
ever since Morgan Dennis -- an illustrator and author of children's books -- 
petitioned for and received permission in 1956 to moor his houseboat, The Sea 
Dog, on the seawall. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the Aquarius moved next door. Today, 26 boats are on the row, with 
names like Lobster Trap, Sun Star and Sweet Aleta. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Gleason, who owns Sweet Aleta, a gray-and-pink barge, says the area is a 
landmark. "The tourists love Houseboat Row. It's a way of life that a lot of 
people dream about but never pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents contend that the real problem is not Houseboat Row, but dozens 
of smaller boats that squatters have anchored in the channel, just yards away 
from the houseboats. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ramshackle shacks; they're scarring the bottom," says Murphy, who now 
owns The Sea Dog and rents it out. "They're tearing up the sea grass." 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old local radio personality is the type of creative madman who 
seems to prosper in Key West -- Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams both 
lived here. He ran against Wardlow last year and got 43% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy contends that the city wants to turn public sentiment against Houseboat 
Row by allowing the squatter boats in the channel to perpetuate an eyesore. The 
city built dinghies in which these boats could dump their trash while Houseboat 
Row residents pay commercial rates to have their garbage hauled away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the channel bottom is owned by real estate magnates Ed and Joan 
Knight. The Knights also own more than 139 acres of land surrounding Houseboat 
Row -- including a nearby man-made island where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents fear that the Knights plan to develop their property and that a 
marina will be built where Houseboat Row is now. After all, the channel is the 
only direct waterway on the island to Key West's cash cow: the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor says he would fight any proposed development and Knight, 77, 
says he has no intention of developing his property: "We have no agenda and I 
think anybody in Key West who knows us knows that's the story." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor says Houseboat Row is notorious for its sordid past, particularly in 
the early 1970s, when the "Outlaws" motorcycle gang took up residence in a 
houseboat called "Proud Mary." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy acknowledges that "A lot of old-timers see Houseboat Row as this 
run-down neighborhood of ne'er-do-wells. But, in fact, they're carpenters, lab 
technicians, charter boat captains." 
</P>
<P>
 People like Captain Claudia. By now she is barefoot, covered in paint and just 
about done giving the Aquarius a new skin. She takes a look at her beloved boat 
and decides it really doesn't look like a wedding cake: "It's more like a 
riverboat." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah," Murphy says. "It looks more like heaven."

YOUNGSTER TUNES UP ON BEALE STREET FOR A MUSIC CAREER; MEMPHIS: FLEDGLING 
HARMONICA PLAYER SPENDS SUMMER AT B.B. KING'S NIGHTCLUB, PICKING UP TIPS AND 
OCCASIONALLY SHARING STAGE WITH THE BIG BOYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Like Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz," 9-year-old Brody Buster is definitely not 
in Kansas anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling blues harmonica player is spending the summer at what his mother 
calls "Blues Camp 101," sharing a stage whenever he can with the big boys on 
Beale Street -- and at B.B. King's nightclub, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning a lot here," he said before a recent performance. "I've learned 
licks and stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 And although he couldn't explain what a "lick" is, it was clear when he 
launched into a harmonica run with the club's house band that he has begun to 
feel what it means. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody began playing the harmonica two years ago and his family is going all 
out trying to make him a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any lessons. I just listened to records and people on the 
street," he said. "I want to become famous and get a recording contract and 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Janet, and sister, Jodie, 8, are spending the summer with him in 
Memphis where he hangs around for hours waiting for a chance to sit in with the 
King B's or other Beale Street bands. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Curtis, is back home in Paola, Kan., a stop in the road near 
Kansas City, but comes down on the weekends when he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might call me up (on stage). They might not," the sandy-haired youngster 
said as he killed time with a group of Memphis youngsters who pick up tips 
dancing for tourists on the street. One was Rarecas Bonds, 12, who was featured 
in a Beale Street scene in "The Firm." Rarecas specializes in back flips. 
</P>
<P>
 His wait to perform, which began before 8 p.m., ended shortly after midnight 
when he was called on stage for a one-song display. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Buster, waiting inside, entertained her daughter by helping her draw 
pictures on a bar napkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dedicated to seeing how far he can take this," she said. "There are 
nights I would just as soon stay home, but he wants to be on Beale Street every 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Beale Street is Brody's stop for the summer, he also has made his way 
on stage to jam with various groups in Nashville, Tenn., Branson, Mo., and the 
Kansas City area, according to a publicity packet his mother keeps on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Harding, manager of King's club, said he often gives young musicians a 
chance to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 King plays at the Memphis club several times a year. He wasn't around for 
Brody's performance, but the youngster got to meet him in June when invited to 
take part in a pre-opening party for another King club in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said Brody shows a natural feel for the harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more he plays, the better he'll get," he said. "He's got a little time 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Age isn't all that important anyway when it comes to playing the blues, 
Harding said. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline performer for the night, the one who actually got paid, was Jake 
Anderson, a 14-year-old blues guitar player from Austin, Tex.

TOWN ELATED AS BOBBY WHO SLAPPED SASSY TEEN ESCAPES FIRING

 Residents of this sleepy seaside town are elated that a bobby on their beat 
won't lose his job for slapping a sassy teen. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Constable Steve Guscott, fined 150 pounds ($225) by a magistrate's 
court last month, was reprimanded Friday for slapping the 14-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Guscott, a hero to many Britons who are disturbed about rising crime and long 
for a bit of old-fashioned discipline, will remain in a desk job at police 
headquarters in nearby Taunton, 130 miles west of London. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's got to be discipline and if the police can't do it, who can?" said 
Yvonne Shaw, a 48-year-old mother of three who works at the Tots to Teens 
children's shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Two streets off the main drag is Irnham Road where Guscott lives and where he 
caught up with the 14-year-old who had been among a group of eight or nine boys 
using sticks to bang on the door of a senior citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the boys got away but Guscott caught up with the 14-year-old and 
swatted him.

RSVP / THE SOCIAL CITY; TRIBUTE TO NIXON HAD EVERYTHING -- EXCEPT THE SALAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It was to be an elegant six-course dinner -- five glasses, four forks, four 
knives for the Colorado Mountain smoked trout with cheese pastry bow-ties, the 
velvety sorrel soup, the California pink grapefruit sorbet, the stuffed veal 
with saffron rice pilaf and artichoke nicoise, then the garden greens before 
the orange mousse with the chocolate presidential seal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The salad was tossed -- out: As the evening progressed at the black-tie 
Architect of Peace Tribute at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in honor 
of the late President, it became apparent that for keynoter Sen. Robert Dole to 
make his plane (he flew in for the event, was whisked to the library by 
helicopter and flew back to Washington in almost one smooth swoop), a course 
might have to go. Said event co-chairman George Argyros, "We're tossing the 
salad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Never at the White House: The missing salad was enough to take the starch out 
of Henry Haller's hat. The White House chef for 20 years had labored all day, 
but at dinner he sat next to Dolores Hope (with Bob, too) and that's enough to 
keep anyone happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peace in Yorba Linda: Nearly 150 had cocktails on the green, strolled past the 
graves of Pat and Richard Nixon, then sat for dinner on terrazo surrounded by 
American flags fringed with gold braid. Tributes to Nixon were nonstop: from 
library director John H. Taylor, Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook (dinner 
chairman), Gov. Pete Wilson, former Nixon henchman Maurice H. Stans (a painting 
of him was undraped to salute the $131 million he has raised for the library), 
Dole, Argyros and Nixon's personal friend Jack Drown. As Dole rose to speak, he 
joked, "The more time I spend in presidential libraries, the more I wonder how 
one would look in Russell, Kan." He joked also that Nixon's golf balls "spent 
more time in trees than most squirrels." But he turned serious in his tribute: 
"The legacy of peace Nixon left is going to be around a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne Finale: The Schramsberg bubbles arrived just as Dole left, but most 
of the prominent crowd stayed to indulge in the champagne and dessert: Judie 
Argyros with Roy and Lila Ash at the Dole table, honorary chairwoman Caroline 
Ahmanson, Nixon's brother Edward, Edward and Nadine Carson, Suzanne Cummings, 
Gene and Jackie Autry, Frank Ulf, Richard and Marjorie Stegemeier, Ed and Ruth 
Shannon, Dr. John Lungren, Walter and Speedy Beran, Gavin Herbert Jr., Dr. 
William and Rose Narva, Betsy and Ted Bartscherer, Dewey and Dee Henley, John 
and Maureen Nunn, and Steve Clemons. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Postscript: The evening raised $350,000 for the library. Elsewhere on the 
Social Circuit 
</P>
<P>
 * When autumn leaves fall, the Los Angeles Philharmonic celebrates two major 
events. On Oct. 24 it marks its 75th birthday and lays the cornerstone for the 
Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Philharmonic's new home rising at 1st Street and 
Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But, first, Music Director Esa-Pekka Salonen and the orchestra tour the 
European summer festivals. Recently, Finnish Consul General Tapio Saarela 
hosted a reception in his Bel-Air home to welcome members of the L.A. 
Philharmonic Patrons Tour.  
</P>
<P>
 From Aug. 25 to Sept. 3, Patrons will attend concerts at the Helsinki Festival 
(with a sail around Helsinki's archipelago and luncheon at historic Suomenlinna 
Fortress), London's famed Proms (at Royal Albert Hall on Sept. 1 with a 
black-tie dinner at Spencer House near Picadilly) and the Flanders Festival in 
historic Ghent Cathedral. The Helskini concert will be Salonen's first with the 
Philharmonic in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tributes were nonstop for Joanne Kozberg at her 50th birthday party, hosted 
by husband Roger, son Anthony and daughter Lindsey at Hillcrest Country Club. 
The Blue Ribbon Belles stole the show. Joanne, now secretary of the State and 
Consumer Services Agency in Sacramento, is former president of the Music Center 
Blue Ribbon.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus Nancy Livingston inveigled good pals Sandy Ausman, Ann Johnson, Doreen 
McElvany, Patti Skouras, Judi Davidson and Phyllis Hennigan to song and dance 
shenanigans that would never make the Music Center stages. But, they were 
sincere in their lyrics: "Joanne, you're such a wonder." Andrea Van de Kamp 
referred to her as sunshine, Gov. Wilson said she was "a woman guided by 
principle," and Gayle Wilson called her a mensch . 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent in the crowd were Kozberg's parents, Dr. Eliot and Marian Corday. 
Dancing late into the night to Ernie Hernandez's band: Stuart and Carrie 
Ketchum, Don and Arletta Tronstein, Joni and Clark Smith, Jean Smith and Ross 
Barrett, Janet and Bruce Karatz, Shelby and Shelley Sloan, Nancy and Dick Call, 
and Jimmy Galanos and Iris Cantor.

 * Selwa (Lucky) Roosevelt, chief of protocol under former President Ronald 
Reagan, was honored by Kacey and Peter McCoy (Nancy Reagan's White House 
administrative assistant) at a sumptuous alfresco dinner in Beverly Hills. The 
McCoy garden is adrift in masses of English lavender and fragrant with hillside 
flowers.  
</P>

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: FRENCH KITSCH-ING WITH A FLOURISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the Dresden Room in Los Feliz, the old Kelbo's was a fabulous 
anachronism. A Gargantuan Polynesian theme park-cum-rib joint, disco and -- in 
the last, waning days -- karaoke bar, Kelbo's featured the kind of trashy, 
campy glitz that so often passes for history in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Dresden, however, Kelbo's florid brand of Kon-Tiki kitsch never 
drew the steady crowd of loyal Hollywood hipsters that has kept the Dresden 
both packed and stylistically intact. Thus when the new club known as L.A. 
Tower opened recently in Kelbo's former space on Pico Boulevard in West L.A., a 
lot of people were taken by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we were remodeling, people used to stop by all the time and say, 'Oh, 
no! Don't touch it -- we love Kelbo's,' " says Charles Glen, a Frenchman and 
one of several partners in the new venture. "At first I was sympathetic, but 
after a couple of months of this, I started asking them why they didn't ever go 
to Kelbo's, if they loved it so much." 
</P>
<P>
 The new club has in fact kept most of the original decor, weeding it out a bit 
here and there, freeing up space for some French Provincial dining chairs and 
tables with pink cloths. The new brocade booths and Oriental rugs blend in with 
the original theme to create a pleasantly absurd French Polynesian effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outrageous attire welcome," the new flyers read. Lissome cocktail waitresses 
are dressed in jungle-print mini-loincloths, a kind of 
Wilma-Flintstone-meets-early-Madonna thing that is so politically retro as to 
be charming in a Wayne's World kind of way. "I've heard that a couple of women 
customers have walked out, saying that the outfits are exploitative," says a 
waitress, "but I've not heard anything negative myself." 
</P>
<P>
 In "the Cave," the disco that features a rotating schedule of DJs, the famous 
Coco Bowl domed ceiling still tops a refurbished dance floor. In the game room, 
just beyond the new oyster bar, a blackjack table has been added to the usual 
pool tables and pinball, and the VIP room promises to book reggae and jazz, 
although a recent Thursday evening's entertainment consisted, strangely, of 
Driven Steel, an all-girl heavy metal band. They were not unskilled, but the 
lead singer's lusty call of, "Any Judas Priest fans out there?" was met with 
embarrassing silence. 
</P>
<P>
 A very VIP room still under construction on the rooftop includes plans for a 
full bar, plus swimming pool and Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important element to be carried over from the old days is Javier 
Corubas, who has been concocting tropical works of drinkable art for 24 years. 
Is this the only place in Los Angeles that can boast a "Drinks Chef" in 
addition to a full complement of bartenders? 
</P>
<P>
 The most important new feature is Chef Robert Roaquin. "I'm formerly of 
Granita in Malibu, originally of the Four Seasons in New York, and I don't know 
what I'm doing here," says Roaquin, laughing maniacally amid the chaos of the 
new kitchen. The question is, would Wayne and Garth truly appreciate a good 
penne arrabbiate? 
</P>
<P>
 The response so far seems to be one of approval. "I used to come here about 
once a month," says neighborhood resident Peter Kent, who works in the movies 
as Arnold Schwarzenegger's body double, on his first visit to the redesigned 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it better now," he says. "The whole grunge thing that was happening 
here before was a little too much. They were trying too hard."

 It makes sense that the Palm was an attraction for the out-of-town soccer 
crowd -- Brazilians, Argentines, Italians, Germans. It's a quintessential 
American kind of place, famous for giant portions of beef and lobster. 
</P>
<P>
 So there we were on a Saturday night at this busy-busy place -- even with a 
reservation, we stood outside for 45 minutes waiting for our table. Then we met 
a group of Mexican visitors who told us their dinner saga. 
</P>
<P>
 They had come directly from a soccer game, but there was a problem. They were 
wearing shorts and T-shirts or tank tops.  
</P>
<P>
 The Palm happens to be one of those few places with a dress code. What's a 
hungry man to do? 
</P>
<P>
 They grudgingly crossed the street and bought trousers and sport shirts at 
International Male. We won't repeat the word they used to describe their new 
clothes.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that's an expensive steak.

 Non-Extravaganza: While our friends were off to big-ticket extravaganzas -- 
"Encore! The Three Tenors" at Dodger Stadium on one night, Barbra Streisand in 
Anaheim the next -- we thought about what movie we could rent for $1.25 (if you 
rent Tuesday through Thursday) at Tower Video on Sunset. We weren't excited 
about "Boxing Helena" and we already sat through last year's fairy tale, 
"Sleepless in Seattle."  
</P>
<P>
 We consulted Davidlee Willson, assistant manager, who suggested "Valley of the 
Dolls." "You're kidding," we exclaimed.  
</P>
<P>
 No, he said. The lurid 1967 film starring Patty Duke, Barbara Parkins and 
Sharon Tate is one of the most consistent rentals there is. "It's in the 
'drama' section, but it's funny," Wilson said. "You have to see the wig scene 
to understand."

 Vehicle Ogling: Among the vehicles on view at the 14th annual Beverly Hills 
Charity Car Show are "Cars of the Comics." They will include Tim Allen's Saleen 
Mustang and one of Jay Leno's yet-to-be identified autos. Ogling these and 
other cars will take place next Sunday at Beverly Hills High School to benefit 
several Los Angeles and Beverly Hills charities. And we think we have a germ of 
an idea for a "Seinfeld" episode.

WESTSIDE WATCH: AFTER YEARS OF CUTTING UP IN VENICE, JUGGLER TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Gruenberg, the renowned juggler of dangerous objects, is hanging up his 
chain saws. 
</P>
<P>
 A fearsome sight on the boardwalk since 1983, Gruenberg has developed a 
routine of flying machetes, bowling balls, eggs, apples, politically incorrect 
wisecracks and, of course, his noisy, gasoline-powered, slicing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely enough, he says, he began juggling chain saws to overcome stage 
fright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was such a good juggler inside my bedroom, but when I got out in front of 
people, I would drop everything," said Gruenberg, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with the chain saw, I was so afraid that I would hurt myself that I was 
able to conquer my fear of people and concentrate only on the juggling." 
</P>
<P>
 He was recently named as the second recipient of the Venice Boardwalk Assn.'s 
seafront entertainer appreciation award. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt competition for our entertainers from other boardwalks and piers, so 
we wanted to make an effort to keep them here in Venice," said Mark Ryavec, 
executive director of the association, which granted the first $200 award to a 
sidewalk artist last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruenberg said he has never suffered a major slicing. He took a few stitches 
in his upper lip in Atlantic City once, but that was from hitting himself with 
the chain saw handle at the end of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for his fans, the comedian-juggler-artist will retire in 
September. He will hand off his act to his apprentice and regular volunteer, 
Greg Wodzynski, 19, and try his hand at writing scripts for a proposed 
semi-auto-biographical TV series about the life of a single dad who juggles 
chain saws for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had enough of the streets," Gruenberg said. "Every single time I do 
this, I'm scared to death. I mean, my 4-year-old daughter thinks I trim trees 
for a living." 
</P>

 WOMEN'S PLACE: The year-old women's caucus of Santa Monicans for Renters 
Rights recently found itself embroiled in controversy when its effort to 
support female City Council candidates was branded as a move to dump incumbent 
Councilman Kelly Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Caucus founder Laurie Newman insists that the group is trying to promote 
women, not demote men. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, some group members have urged artist Bruria Finkel, a caucus 
member, to run for office. Finkel will likely get the support of the group, but 
so may Planning Commissioner Pam O'Connor, not a regular caucus-goer, who has 
asked for the group's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman concedes that Olsen's performance in office has gotten mixed reviews 
from the women in the caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the larger group, Santa Monicans for Renters Rights, has 
always endorsed the incumbents it has helped elect. There are two of them 
running this year, both men: Olsen and Councilman Tony Vazquez. 
</P>
<P>
 The caucus is set to vote on its candidates Aug. 6, the eve of SMRR'S 
nominating convention.

 O.J. UPDATE: Now drawing attention in the front window of a music store on the 
Santa Monica Promenade is a black, director-style chair with "O.J. Simpson" 
written on the backrest. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the real thing, according to a handwritten sign that says Simpson used it 
when he performed in "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult." Cost? "Make an 
offer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people say, 'Wow, look at this chair,' and they ask if it's real," said 
Varujan Kaloustian, manager of the store, Mayhem. "But there have been no 
serious offers, yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The chair has, however, drawn shoppers into the store, where for a minimum bid 
of $20,000 you can purchase the jail booking card for multiple murderer Charles 
Manson. Kaloustian said his boss picked up the odd objects at auctions.

CABLE FIRM OVERCHARGES, COUNCIL SAYS; TELEVISION: CENTURY IS ORDERED TO REBATE 
10 1/2 MONTHS OF PREMIUMS TO 20,000 CUSTOMERS. IT HAS NOT DECIDED WHETHER TO 
APPEAL.

 Call it technical difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, Century Cable viewers expecting to watch the Santa Monica 
City Council saw blank screens. The breakdown, due to a wiring problem, came on 
a night when the cable company was expecting bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours into the meeting, the cable came back on just in time to air the 
City Council's unanimous ruling that the cable company has been overcharging 
its 20,000 local customers by almost $4 a month. It ordered the company to 
rebate 10 1/2 months' worth of premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was also ordered to refund overcharges on installation fees and 
justify the way it calculates its delinquent charges. Century has until Friday 
to come up with a refund plan and to respond to the council action. The rebate 
covers the period from Sept. 1, 1993, to July 15, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Century Cable spokesman Alan Niederman said the company is working on a 
response and has not decided whether to appeal the decision to the Federal 
Communications Commission. He called the timing of the cable service 
malfunction "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 No Century official spoke at the hearing. On the same night, several Century 
Cable executives were at a Beverly Hills City Council meeting, at which service 
complaints were expected to be aired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills hearing was postponed until the fall and Santa Monica 
officials also promised to deal with the service issue, as the city 
renegotiates its contract with Century Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's action against the company follows similar rulings taken 
earlier this year by West Hollywood and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, city officials said Century Cable had tried to circumvent 
federal rules by repackaging their channel selection, so they could charge more 
to keep the same programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly created package, called Century Select, forced customers to pay 
about $8 more a month for a group of channels, including Bravo and CNN Headline 
News, that had previously been part of the basic service package. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials do not have authority to prevent Century Cable from charging 
for the new package. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica residents now pay $22.14 a month for basic cable. City officials 
figured it should cost $18.20.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; DRAMA CAMP FUELS YOUTHS' CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Standing on a makeshift stage, the two would-be actors gamely tried to 
improvise a scene under the watchful gaze of teacher Monica Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 Stifling self-conscious giggles and averting their eyes from fellow students, 
the two boys played out a situation in which both were drivers trying to decide 
who was at fault in a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
 After the pair rushed the scene to its conclusion and took their seats, 
Calhoun and the 12-member class praised the effort and just as quickly pointed 
out its weaknesses: poor articulation, not playing to the audience, unclear 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the exercise served its purpose, and soon other actors, ranging in age 
from 5 to 13, clamored to take the stage with sudden inspirations. It was the 
kind of enthusiastic response Calhoun and her mother, Lorine, hope to generate 
more of in their at-home youth drama camp launched last month in the Crenshaw 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is giving kids a creative outlet and introduce them to the 
life of acting," Lorine Calhoun said. "There are things about discipline and 
self-esteem they need to learn. We want to catch them before they get off into 
drugs or gangbanging." 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitfield, 10, a camp newcomer and one of the morning's performers, said 
he's hooked. "It's kind of scary but fun," he said. "And you can be on TV later 
on, be a star maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 The camp operates five days a week out of Calhoun's four-bedroom home on 
Brynhurst Avenue and offers basic instruction in acting, dance and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents pay $10 a day, or whatever they can afford, for classes; those who can 
afford little pitch in by bringing food for participants, shuttling them to 
class each morning and otherwise assisting Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoestring budget has meant that Calhoun is hard-pressed for rehearsal 
space. She uses her den for acting rehearsals, her mirrored dining room for 
dance classes and is casting about for rehearsal space for a group production 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But fostering a sense of an "acting family" among students and parents and 
being able to make such training accessible has made the camp worth the 
trouble, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are going through so much these days, they need something like this," 
she said. "They can get things here they can't get in Hollywood workshops. We 
teach the three R's -- respect for home, family and theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun manages the career of her 22-year-old daughter, Monica, whose acting 
credits include featured roles in the film "Baghdad Cafe" and the subsequent 
television series. Monica Calhoun got her start in a Santa Monica youth drama 
camp 10 years ago and says she wants to pass the benefit of that experience on 
to other young people in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to learn about themselves, as well as learn to observe others," 
she said of her students. "It's not just about everybody being stars. Working 
with each other through improvisations, they can learn how to deal with similar 
situations later in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Though novices at acting, many students admitted to already harboring dreams 
of making it big. "I like the camp because when I do make it as an actress, 
I'll know how to do things on stage. I'll also be making big bucks as a star," 
11-year-old Taipei Laleau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Everage, 10, said he is more intrigued by acting than he thought he 
would be. "I like to watch everybody else's scenes. I was nervous but I'm 
starting to relax and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorine Calhoun is adamant that all can excel if they put their minds to it. 
She points out that her 20-year-old son, Eric, who is blind, has also worked in 
several movie and television projects and recently completed a course on camera 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clara Weston, whose son Jason Hill participates in the camp, says she likes 
the program's personal approach. "This has a better feeling than just being in 
a class, " she said. "Jason was looking for some kind of outlet, and this has 
been fulfilling for him so far."

BRIEFLY: THEATER: COMPANY SEARCHING FOR A NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Serendipity Theatre, just named the best new children's theater in the 
United States by the American Alliance for Theatre and Education, is moving 
from its home on La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a new site is found, Serendipity, in its fifth season, will be 
presenting "mini-seasons" of four plays in various venues, including UCLA's 
Freud Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have one of the most important awards a children's theater can 
receive and no walls to hang it on," said Artistic Director Scott Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance costs at Serendipity's home, the Coronet Theatre, were over 
$100,000 annually -- too costly for the small troupe. Davidson said the theater 
company would prefer to relocate to a donated or partially subsidized space.

THEATER; L.A. STARS IN A SIZZLING 'PALM FEVER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles' morale may not be at historic highs lately, with riots, floods, 
earthquakes and other problems. But playwright Jean Colonomos is one who 
doesn't mind living here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly in the last couple of years we've been hit hard," said the writer, 
whose paean to the city, "Palm Fever," begins previews Tuesday at Playwrights' 
Arena in the Fairfax District. "But what's important is even though we're 
living in this urban environment that can be very singular, we're all 
inter-galactically connected and integrated. Basically, I love living here. And 
in this piece, I try to deal with the dark and the light, the beauty of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Colonomos described the show as a collage. "Its conceit is that it has every 
form of writing," she said. "Narrative, monologue, poems, limericks." A 
multicultural cast of six weaves its way through the piece; the characters 
include a crazy homeless woman, a man obsessed with the Dodgers, a woman who 
has sex fantasies all over the city (including at Gelson's), a gun-toting 
couple named Dick and Jane, and a narrator who tells the story of a Latina 
housekeeper who falls in love with her widowed boss, a Holocaust survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece includes at least passing references to topical subjects such as the 
Rodney G. King, Menendez brothers and O.J. Simpson cases. "But it's not about 
them," the playwright stressed. "Los Angeles is the main character." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jon Lawrence Rivera notes that issues of gun control and homelessness 
are dealt with against the backdrop of sunny imitation-David Hockney paintings, 
"which makes everything so appealing and pleasant and alive -- and yet the city 
below we know is deteriorating." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-born Colonomos originally trained as a dancer and was a member of 
the Martha Graham Dance Company. "I had a tough time in my 20s," she said. "I 
left the company and a marriage. I couldn't cope -- and I had an injury. I 
decided to try something else, and went into theater." Her piece, "Treasure 
Hunt," played at the Callboard in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also worked as a free-lance dance critic for the Village Voice and 
SoHo News in New York, resettling six years ago in Santa Monica. In 1990, as a 
member of the now-defunct Los Angeles Theatre Center's Playwrights Unit, she 
began writing "Palm Fever." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first suggested project was to write something about Los Angeles," she 
recalled. "It took me a while to find my voice, and even then I had a couple of 
false starts." The slow start was, possibly, a portent of the rocky road the 
show was to have: After successful readings at the Theatre Center and later at 
Women in Film, "Palm Fever" was scheduled to premiere at the Burbage Theatre 
during the summer of 1992, but fell apart in rehearsal when cast members 
defected for other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in February of this year, the piece was slated to open at Playwrights' 
Arena, directed by Deborah LaVine, who had been affiliated with the piece since 
early on. When LaVine fell ill, the production was jettisoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwrights' Arena artistic director Rivera has since stepped into the 
director's shoes. "He said, 'Don't worry, we're going to get it done,' " said 
Colonomos. "And now we are. But it is getting harder and harder to do theater 
out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping keep her spirits up is the fact that "Palm Fever" won first prize in a 
competition this year sponsored by Playwrights in Exile and Playwrights' Arena 
theater groups. It was one of 87 entries, Rivera said. "I like it because it 
reflects what's going on in the city," Rivera said. "I think it may offend some 
people. Some may find it true, some may find it not true." 
</P>
<P>
 "Palm Fever" previews Tuesday and Wednesday, opening Friday at Playwrights' 
Arena, 5262 W. Pico Blvd., and playing Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. 
through Sept. 3. Admission is $12. For reservations, call Theatix: (213) 
466-1767.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thrift shoppers in the Fairfax District will have a new place to visit next 
week: The Out of the Closet Thrift Store will open its doors on Tuesday with a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its sister store in Atwater Village, all proceeds go to the AIDS 
Healthcare Foundation, the largest provider of HIV medical care in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise will range from run-of-the-mill, secondhand items to

<P>
 The publisher of the Los Angeles Independent newspaper chain has begun a new 
weekly serving West Los Angeles communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad-sheet Westsider, published by National Media Inc., debuted July 13 
with a circulation of 40,000, distributed free to residences and businesses in 
Brentwood, Westwood, Cheviot Hills, Rancho Park, Beverlywood and parts of Mar 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Other newspapers in the Independent chain include the West Hollywood 
Independent, Wilshire Independent, the bilingual Edicion Bilingue and the Los 
Angeles Independent. The Westsider brings the total weekly circulation of the 
chain's papers to 240,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westsider will focus on community news and features, said Stephen 
Laxineta, chairman and chief executive officer of National Media Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Westside has its own flavor. Basically, its quite separate from the rest 
of L.A. in terms of residents' lifestyles. There is more interest in health and 
fitness, and some of (the residents') entertainment selections are different," 
Laxineta said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he promised, the Westsider will have "no O.J. Simpson news," leaving such 
breaking news to other papers. SUSAN STEINBERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; UNCOVERING A HIDDEN TREASURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Venice High School has invited the public to view two panels of a forgotten 
Depression-era mural in the school library that have become more visible after 
recent renovation of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-by-35-foot panels, located on each end of the library in the 
administration building, are titled "Early California to 1800" and "Southern 
California 1800 On." 
</P>
<P>
 They were completed in 1941 by a team of Los Angeles historians, illustrators 
and painters led by artist Helen Lundeberg. Financing was provided by the Works 
Project Administration, which gave many artists the only work they could get at 
the time: decorating public buildings. (There is another WPA mural, by Harry 
Biberman, inside the Venice Post Office.). 
</P>
<P>
 "In the opinion of the staff, the mural is the most outstanding one of its 
kind in this region," the WPA said after the Venice High School murals were 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the mural panels have not been retouched, the administration building 
has been refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The newly painted walls and ceiling visually enhance this previously 
neglected outstanding mural of the WPA era," said Venice High librarian Fay 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's pristine white walls and 18-foot-high beamed ceiling provide a 
pleasing setting for the Depression-era paintings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than library users, few are aware of the mural panels, which Griffith 
said were soon forgotten after World War II moved to the forefront of America's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 This occurred despite the reputation of supervising artist Lundeberg, now 86. 
</P>
<P>
 She is "an amazing, powerful, visionary artist who has had a significant 
impact on California artists," said Duane Chartier of ConserveArt in Culver 
City, a firm restores murals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though ConserveArt restored Lundeberg's WPA mural in Fullerton City Hall 
-- now the Police Department briefing room -- Chartier and prominent Los 
Angeles muralists such as Terry Schoonhooven and Vic Henderson have not seen 
her Venice High mural. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundeberg was born in 1908 and holds an important place in California art 
history. In 1980, she and her husband, Lorser Feitelson, were the subject of a 
San Francisco Museum of Art retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 Her collaborator on the Venice High project, Grace Clements, helped to design 
and paint the mural, as well as to gather the historical information upon which 
it is based during May, 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundeberg and Clements completed the sketch in a month. The mural's historic 
representations were developed, under Lundeberg's supervision, by artists 
Syrena Swanson, Auriel Leitner and Elizabeth Mills. Seven months later, on Jan. 
14, 1941, the painting of the mural by Lundeberg, Clements, Swanson and 
Leitner, along with Edwin Emery and Miriam Farrington, was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional style was a departure for Lundeberg, who was better known as 
a practitioner of the New Classicist style -- later called post-Surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith said she wishes the mural panels could be better displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping to find the funds to properly light these treasures or that . . 
. somebody will have the wherewithal to light them right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours of the school and library can be arranged by calling Maria Garcia at 
(310) 306-7981, Ext. 373. The school and library are operating on a summer 
schedule, open on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on view is a collection of ancient Grecian urns. THOMAS PLEASURE

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; FAMILIES & COMMUNITIES: MODEL PARTNERS 
</P>

<P>
 "It takes an entire village to educate one child."  
</P>
<P>
 -- African proverb 
</P>
<P>
 When West Hollywood city officials decided last year that the entire community 
should take a part in the education of its children, it formed a partnership 
linking the public and private schools with local businesses, civic leaders, 
the arts community and law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Families & Communities program, which has received $10,000 from 
the city, new after-school tutoring programs and additional services for the 
growing Russian immigrant population have started. Other programs such as 
parenting classes are also being developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the project was recognized as a model partnership program by the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, which serves public school students in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Abbe Land said she got the idea for the program while attending a 
National League of Cities convention last year. She said other cities around 
the country were finding ways to broaden their involvement in local education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have limited resources these days," Land said. While they found that 
the need for after-school programs and cultural activities was pressing, they 
also realized that jointly the schools and the community had abundant 
resources. The city has space that could be used for tutoring sessions, for 
instance, and senior citizens could be utilized as volunteer tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 While the programs are still in development, two schools have already embarked 
on a partnership. The Center for Early Childhood Education, a private 
elementary school in West Hollywood, has an exchange program with West 
Hollywood Elementary, a Los Angeles Unified school. 
</P>
<P>
 It started two years ago with a landscaping project. "The kids from the 
private school bought plants and flowers for the public school," said Deputy 
Mayor Deanna Stevenson. Later, the parents from the private school collected 
grocery receipts from three supermarkets, which provide funds in exchange. They 
gave the receipts to West Hollywood Elementary pupils, allowing the school to 
purchase computer equipment valued at $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the city has seen an influx of Russian immigrants, said 
Stevenson, and that has created a pressing need to extend bilingual education 
beyond the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the partnership program, city officials developed a preschool program 
for Russian children, as well as cultural programs and field trips, through the 
city's teen center, for teen-age immigrants. An after-school tutoring program 
for Russian children at Plummer Park began three months ago. They also offer 
boxing and cross-country classes for the young immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've identified what each school and agency has to offer," Stevenson said, 
"and we've identified the central issues that need to be addressed. One school 
may have an after-school program for Russian immigrants and their children, and 
another school may need that kind of program. So (the city) can provide 
transportation. We can access each others' resources." 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood's efforts, said former Los Angeles school district field 
representative Jimmy Franco, is above and beyond that of other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other cities talk, but when it comes time for deeds, they kind of fall 
short," Franco said. "And for a city (of) West Hollywood's size to give $10,000 
. . . that's a major commitment on their part." 
</P>
<P>
 Franco said he and school board member Jeff Horton were impressed by the 
"seriousness" of the city officials when they first met with school officials 
last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed to really care about children and their families, and trying to 
assist them," Franco said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 local business leaders met with city officials last week to find out 
more about the program. Thomas Crail, executive director of the West Hollywood 
Chamber of Commerce, said that the group plans to get the word out to the 3,500 
businesses in the city. Involvement "could be as simple as a landscaping 
company helping to keep the school grounds nice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September the committee will meet again to develop more school programs and 
in March, the program will be assessed, said Land, who expects to see further 
support from the community and local business. CAROL CHASTANG

<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN, A summary of selected Los Angeles City Hall actions last 
week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * CAR DONATION -- Voted to accept Kaiser Permanente's donation to the Los 
Angeles Police Department of five automobiles. The cars, 1991 and '92 four-door 
sedans, will be used as unmarked vehicles by detectives. Due to budget 
constraints in recent years, the LAPD has not purchased any unmarked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * UNLICENSED DRIVERS -- Voted to support, with one suggestion, state 
legislation that would authorize law enforcement officers to impound the 
vehicles of motorists who lack a driver's license or whose licenses have been 
suspended or revoked. The council recommended that the bill, AB 3148, be 
amended to give drivers with expired licenses a 60-day grace period before 
their vehicles are impounded (the measure currently calls for a 30-day grace 
period). Presently, drivers who are found to be without a proper license are 
ticketed. According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, there are 
about 1.7 million drivers in the state who have never obtained a license or 
whose license is suspended or revoked. Statistics show that such drivers are 
four times more likely to be involved in a fatal accident than licensed 
drivers. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * AIDS RENTAL ASSISTANCE -- Voted to extend a contract with three human 
service agencies that provide persons with AIDS a one-time rental assistance of 
$500 or $1,000. The $731,000 contract, which was originally approved in 1991, 
will require no extra funding because the agencies, to date, have given out 
only $550,000. The contractors -- Aid for A.I.D.S, El Centro Human Services and 
the Minority AIDS Project -- have had some difficulty dispensing the funds 
since eligibility is restricted to low-income people. Any money remaining at 
the conclusion of the contract on Dec. 31 will be funneled into AIDS prevention 
projects. Passed 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: John Ferraro, Marvin Braude, Zev Yaroslavsky, Ruth Galanter, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, Nate Holden, Jackie Goldberg. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

COVER STORY; AN ISSUE OF TRUST: TEENS COUNSEL TEENS; WITH ISSUES SUCH AS AIDS, 
DRUGS AND VIOLENCE TOUCHING THE LIVES OF MANY YOUTHS, SCHOOLS AND SOCIAL 
AGENCIES ARE FINDING THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOST LIKELY TO HEED WARNINGS 
FROM THEIR PEERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When he left home for the streets of Hollywood six years ago at age 12, Levi 
Brett found a labyrinth of horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the daily anxiety of seeking food and shelter, he saw other teen-agers 
shot, stabbed and gang-raped. Friends died of AIDS and drug overdoses. He 
begged, stole, numbed himself with drugs and once contemplated suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 18, Brett still roams his old Hollywood haunts about three times a week, 
but with a black pouch bulging with safe-sex and drug-needle-cleansing 
materials such as bleach kits, condoms and other paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a new life as a peer outreach counselor -- someone who advises others 
his age -- at the Los Angeles Youth Network, a shelter and services 
organization for homeless youths in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not what I say to them, but who I am -- they know me, the way I 
communicate," Brett said of the youths he counsels. "Every time I go out, I 
accomplish something. They're becoming more educated. They now ask which 
condoms are better and whether their bleach kits can be reused -- questions 
which they wouldn't ask an adult." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Youth Network is just one of a growing number of innovative 
programs on the Westside that employ teen-agers to counsel their peers on such 
issues as HIV prevention; teen pregnancy; tobacco, drug and alcohol abuse, and 
suicide prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Although formalized teen peer counseling and education -- initially employed 
against drug use -- have existed for decades, the practice has been growing in 
popularity and has spread to other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 High schools are using peer tutors for academic help in math and English. 
School administrators have set up on-campus health clinics employing peer 
educators. Social agencies are increasingly using teen-agers to counsel gang 
members and mediate disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex, a homeless 17-year-old temporarily staying at the Los Angeles Youth 
Network, prefers counseling from his peers rather than from adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In a comment typical of others his age, he said: "I feel uncomfortable around 
older people. I'd rather talk to someone my own age who understands and is 
going through what I'm going through -- someone I can trust." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent proliferation of peer education projects on the Westside mirrors a 
national trend. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40,000 peer education programs exist in schools nationwide, up from an 
estimated 20,000 five years ago, and such programs are growing in colleges, 
social agencies and church ministries, said Barbara Varenhorst, a member and 
former president of the National Peer Helpers Assn., a national network of peer 
programs based in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts believe the expansion of peer counseling is filling a void in the 
lives of today's youths. Shattered families, drug and alcohol abuse, and 
parental neglect have robbed many young people of a support network for their 
problems. Advocates say the surge in peer programs is also a compensation for 
the increasingly disparate ratio in many schools between students and adult 
counselors or mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked with young people for many years and know that adolescence is a 
lonely time," said Varenhorst, who started the country's first in-school peer 
counseling program in Palo Alto in 1970. "But never have I seen so much 
loneliness as in this particular period. There are no adults around and peers 
are raising peers. Some schools have one adult counselor per 1,000 kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics point to the gulf between teen-agers and their parents and other 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1986 Emory University Medical School survey widely cited by experts asked 
600 Atlanta-area high school seniors who they would talk to about an alcohol or 
drug problem. Seventy percent said they would tell a friend, 20% said they 
would go to their parents and 8% said they would tell siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a paucity of scientific research comparing the effectiveness of teen 
peer counseling and education programs to programs that use adults to teach 
teen-agers. But many educators believe a mountain of anecdotal evidence proves 
the value of peer education, especially regarding sexual and reproductive 
health issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teens identify with teens and get most of their information and advice from 
their friends, not their parents," said Wendy Arnold, a founder of the Peer 
Education Program of Los Angeles in West Los Angeles, which educates teen-agers 
on AIDS-related issues. "Mainstream educators are realizing that important 
information hasn't been getting through and that the vehicle of communication 
has to change. The time is ripe to bring in innovative strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 In today's world, what youths don't know can kill them. As a result, many peer 
programs concentrate on disseminating information on such topics as AIDS and 
safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has set up on-campus health centers in 
four high schools that use teen counselors to educate their classmates on a 
variety of preventive health measures. The clinics were installed about seven 
years ago and remain noteworthy for the variety of services offered, including 
counseling for sexually transmitted diseases and family planning and prevention 
of HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district also has more than 2,000 peer conflict mediators, working 
primarily in the city's elementary schools. In addition, more than 1,000 peer 
tutors work kindergarten through 12th grade to help students studying math and 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent school day at Los Angeles High School in Hancock Park, Dana 
Shellmire, 15, and Tyren McElwee, 16, instructed a 10th-grade class on drug 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the two began their seminar, the class was typically boisterous as the 
harried adult teacher tried to keep the students' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the teen-agers started the program, the students paid attention. A 
seven-minute video, using Tyren's friends as actors, showed a mock trial of 
drugs and alcohol, with both substances judged guilty of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate the pitfalls of peer pressure, Tyren and Dana then acted out a 
skit depicting a party, with one playing a drug pusher and the other declining 
the narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students were then chosen from the class to perform in an improvised 
skit that showed ways to refuse drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hourlong session, the students seemed impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a grown-up was saying all this, I'd listen but I wouldn't pay attention," 
said 15-year-old Destiny Cooks. "(Adults) just yell at you instead of talking 
to you. But these counselors talk more like our age, they're going through the 
same thing we're going through." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Sokol, a teacher at the school, says that when she has addressed a 
class on similar touchy subjects there have been lots of yawns, rustling of 
papers and note-passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When another kid comes up, they're all quiet," she said. "I remember this one 
kid counselor just walked up, whipped out this big rubber thing and started 
putting a condom on it, talking all the while. I couldn't have done that at her 
age -- it would probably be difficult for me now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sokol: "All the girls in the class then started giving the guys a hard 
time by saying, 'Yeah, you're going to be wearing this now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ursula Lewis, one of the program's coordinators, said that teen audiences are 
not the only beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teen counselors get a great boost in self-esteem and confidence. They 
know they're being looked at, and if they do something wrong they're busted. If 
they say it enough, they have to live it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Childrens Hospital Los Angeles in Hollywood recently developed a two-year peer 
education program called Project SNAPP -- Skills and Knowledge for AIDS and 
Pregnancy Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is unique because it uses youth educators who are teen-age parents 
or infected with HIV themselves, project organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides visiting six L.A. unified middle schools in the Hollywood, Wilshire 
and central Los Angeles areas, the peer counselors also fan out to local teen 
social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, peer educators Ken Benard, 23, and Connie Garay, 19, 
conducted a seminar for a small group of homeless youths at Options House, a 
teen shelter in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting started slowly with card and handshake games meant to enlighten 
the participants about the dangers of wanton sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But the atmosphere electrified when Benard blurted out that he is 
HIV-positive, explaining that he probably contracted the disease in his earlier 
years as a drug abusing and sexually promiscuous runaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions soon tumbled forth from his young audience. "How did you feel after 
the first test results?" "Do you know who you got it from?" "Do you have any 
symptoms yet?" "Can you die from HIV or AIDS?" 
</P>
<P>
 Benard painstakingly answered the questions. But his young charges were 
clearly shaken -- he looked like one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked that he could be so open to people he hardly even knows," said 
Desiree, a 13-year-old who was left homeless by two crack-addicted parents. "He 
looked just like a healthy normal person. You can't look at everyone and know." 
</P>
<P>
 After Benard finished talking, Garay told her story. Madly in love with her 
boyfriend, she became pregnant with identical twins just shy of her 15th 
birthday. Always an honor student, she left home and dropped out of high school 
to take care of her children. After one year, her boyfriend left her. 
</P>
<P>
 She related the desperation of being a teen-age mother. Constant work. 
Sleepless nights tending to the babies. Little help. Bus trips holding two 
squirming children. Dreams of college deferred. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children are without their father and we have little money," she said. "I 
regret having kids before I can really give them what they need, a house, 
career, a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Monique, a homeless teen-ager, wanted to know where the babies' father lives. 
Another participant, Mike, 15, asked if the birth was by Cesarean section. 
Desiree wondered if Garay still yearns for a career. 
</P>
<P>
 After only one hour, there were some sober reactions. "These two really 
learned the hard way -- it didn't seem like some TV show," Mike said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments hearten the counselors, many of whom draw on their experiences 
for motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Levi Brett, the Hollywood outreach counselor who lives in a shelter for 
homeless youths, makes his usual trek through the district's streets among 
pimps, pushers and perverts, he sometimes can't help thinking of all the adults 
who terrorized, abused or neglected him. The thought gives him special 
incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was homeless, I was scared, frightened and there was no peer outreach 
at the time," he said. "Adults always used to talk down to me like I was some 
worthless piece of garbage. But now we're doing so much for ourselves -- you 
start to believe in yourself again."

FOR SENIORS; THIS SENIOR CLASS ENJOYS LECTURES, DORMS AND DATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can remember the time I flunked physics and had to go to summer school. My 
18th summer was ruined. There was no way of making it into a positive 
experience. But just as youth may be wasted on the young, so may education. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that students have vacated dormitories to go home or take summer jobs, 
seniors are packing their suitcases and leaving familiar surroundings to live 
like college students. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-plus-year-old student body comes for the same reasons as younger 
generations -- education and a social life, not necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Summer School Inc., a Deerfield Beach, Fla.-based company, is in the 
business of filling privately owned dormitories with seniors for four- and 
eight-week stays including optional study programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company invited me to split a weeklong visit at San Diego State University 
and the University of Wisconsin's Madison campus. I stayed in dormitories, ate 
my meals in cafeterias and went to classes and concerts with the "students." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, where I stayed at a dormitory near the campus, the day started 
with breakfast at 7 a.m.: hot cereal, fresh fruit, fake eggs, frozen yogurt, 
gourmet coffee and omelets on the weekends. Low-fat, no-salt everything, but 
all you can eat. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an exercise room, televisions on every floor -- usually tuned to CNN 
-- marathon card games, trips, and of course, classes through a special program 
at the university's College of Extended Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many don't sign up, including a majority who come from Florida to beat the 
heat. They sit by the pool, do water aerobics, play Scrabble or just socialize. 
On my first morning there, I walked past a Scrabble game just as someone put 
down the word visage, scoring 45 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Margot Greene met a friend she had not heard from in 27 years. She put a note 
on my door the night before classes began, saying she was going to take me to 
school the next day and not to be late. "And," she kidded, "don't make any 
noise on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 They lined up 20 minutes early. The lecture was "Women Who Changed History," 
and the class was entirely made up of women, many of them widows from long 
marriages who stayed home with their children and are the mothers of ardent 
feminists. All were eager to tell their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Hear Sylvia Kopman on the subject of widowhood: "Once your mate is gone, your 
life changes. You either become an individual again -- meeting people, enjoying 
companionship in a wholly different way -- or you can become a statistic, 
living alone. I prefer to enrich my mind. You never meet men -- at least ones 
that are alive." 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where young peoples' orange-tinted 
hairdos got funny looks from some of the white-haired set, I stayed in a large 
room with a private bath, microwave oven and refrigerator, but no telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, I was privy to the latest disaster. A trip to the Amish country 
was so bad a petition was being circulated to get money back. It seems people 
spent seven hours riding on a bus and never saw one Amish person. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it dissuade some from returning? Most say no. Where else can you stay for 
two months and get three all-you-can-eat meals a day for $1,800, or less if you 
want to share bathroom facilities? 
</P>
<P>
 But at both campuses, classes are extra. The cost ranges from $20 for an opera 
class at San Diego State University to a $150 fee to cover three weeks of 
lectures on such topics as "The Devil, Women and the Salem Witch Trials" at the 
Wisconsin campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed and Dottie Williamson are not coming back. Ed says it's because there are 
not enough people his age -- mid-60s. It's not that he does not like being 
around older people, he said, but "there are too many who follow my 'more so' 
theory: Whatever your shortcomings in your youth, they become more so when you 
get older," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine, who does not want her last name used, is not coming back either. She 
thought there was too much noise at night from nearby State Street, Madison's 
main drag, and the trips were poorly organized. She liked the programs run by 
another group, Senior Ventures, which offers two-week and four-week sessions in 
six Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 But people like Judith Korn, a widow in her 70s, thrive on the program. She's 
learning how to use a computer and auditing a creative writing class. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara, 70, said she wants to meet men but she has certain standards: "No 
hearing aids, no elastic stockings and he has to live through the first night." 
She definitely did not want her last name used.

SANTA MONICA: LAND DONATION FOR AIDS HOSPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your "Outrage of the Week" section, a.k.a. Santa Monica City 
Council news. This week's travesty compels me to comment, although I despair of 
affecting yet another insidious outcome of our political machine. 
</P>
<P>
 I read that our City Council has slimed through another boondoggle on the 
residents of Santa Monica. This time, we are to donate $1.5 million of land to 
create a beach resort for the terminally ill (Westside, July 17). Of course, a 
prospective resident must have a politically correct terminal illness to be 
considered for acceptance at this seaside hospice. 
</P>
<P>
 We are informed that a less elegant location is not acceptable to the 
political cronies of our elected representatives. No doubt the persons 
operating this AIDS hospice will have penthouse offices at their new location, 
and a polling booth will be installed in the lobby for the grateful residents. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess I'll just stroll through Palisades Park and enjoy the stench of urine 
and feces wafting in the breeze from our local bum population, and watch the 
former Sand and Sea (club) rot on the beach while the council finds another 
inane project to inflict on Santa Monica. I can look forward to reading all 
about it in next week's Westside section. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM ELSWICK, Santa Monica  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It should come as no surprise that the hegemony of Santa Monica's out-of-touch 
political majority has now produced its latest pathetically inept farce, the 
placing of an affordable-housing complex for AIDS victims on some of the city's 
priciest real estate, on the bluffs overlooking the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar fiasco already underway is the construction of a multistory 
accommodation for the mentally ill homeless. Where? Square in the heart of 
Santa Monica's principal commercial tourism area, of course, on 2nd Street, 
just a block from the Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all part and parcel of what has become a deep tradition in Santa Monica. 
After all, for years now we have offered free of charge one of our city's 
premier public meeting rooms -- located right on Main Street, in our City Hall 
-- for a loosely organized group of the community's "intellectually 
challenged," euphemistically known as the Santa Monica City Council (In this 
characterization, I do not include non-SMRR council members Holbrook and 
Greenberg, who seem completely out of place on the council by persistently 
offering creative, thoughtful, intelligent approaches to the issues). 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when SMRR, the city's "powerful rent-control machine," as 
Times Staff Writer Nancy Hill-Holtzman accurately describes it, was clearly 
understood by the voters to stand for Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights. 
Increasingly it seems that a more apt elucidation of the acronym might be 
Social Machiavellians for Radical Reform. For far too long now SMRR has hid 
behind the cloak of rent control for the sole purpose of the preservation of 
their incumbency. 
</P>
<P>
 At the foundation, they care little for renters and nothing whatsoever for 
renters' rights, as their knee-jerk reaction (or was it a reaction of jerks?) 
to the Jan. 17 disaster confirmed -- when SMRR officials passed all 
earthquake-related expenses from landlords to tenants, essentially an 
acknowledgment that rent control, at least in the absence of vacancy decontrol, 
has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Once voters get that message, SMRR, instead of being "far out," will be far 
out of power . . . and Santa Monica will be a far better city for it.

YOUR MORTGAGE; 5-DAY MORTGAGES, LOWER FEES ON HORIZON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attention home buyers and refinancers who think the 30 to 60 days needed to 
fund a typical mortgage is much too long: Get ready for the five-day mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Or lickety-split two-day funding, from start to finish, if you really need the 
money fast to buy the house you want. 
</P>
<P>
 Get ready, too, for tangibly lower settlement fees along with the speed: 
Appraisal charges slashed from $400 to $30. Title search and insurance costs 
cut by 50%. Credit report fees down by 60% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no midsummer dream. It's already a reality at test locations around 
the country, and should be available nationwide through participating mortgage 
lenders within months. Here's what's happening: 
</P>
<P>
 A team of computer technology experts, statisticians and underwriters at the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) has been working for years on 
alternative methods of streamlining the entire mortgage process. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept Freddie Mac has finally come up with allows local mortgage loan 
officers with laptop computers -- sitting at your home or your real estate 
agent's office -- to transmit your basic application data to Freddie Mac and 
obtain a "yes" or "no" funding decision within two to four minutes. During that 
brief interval, an electronic underwriting system: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Accesses your merged credit files from the major data repositories like 
TRW, Equifax and Trans Union. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Screens your risk characteristics as a potential borrower, using 
sophisticated credit-score and underwriting modeling techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Accesses appraisal data on the property you want to buy or refinance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Obtains mortgage insurance approval on your loan, if the loan-to-value 
ratio exceeds 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is designed to screen out conflicting -- but ultimately irrelevant 
-- information on your credit reports or other application data, according to 
Peter Maselli, Freddie Mac's vice president for automated underwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 Say, for example, that one of your files indicated you had been late on your 
Sears department store charge account. Traditional manual underwriting 
standards might stall the application process until this derogatory information 
was cleared up. The new system, by contrast, factors the data into its 
statistical model and decides whether the information is significant enough to 
affect a mortgage loan underwriting decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the model -- based on computer analyses of "tens of thousands" 
of detailed borrower payment histories on mortgages owned by Freddie Mac, 
according to Maselli -- would dismiss the data as irrelevant and flash a "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The president of a mortgage banking firm that's been participating in field 
tests of the system describes himself as "ecstatic" about automated 
underwriting's potential. James Noack of Monument Mortgage Co. of Walnut Creek, 
Calif., says that once it becomes available nationwide, it will be recognized 
"as profoundly important as the introduction of the amortizing mortgage" during 
the Depression years of the 1930s. (Amortization schedules of principal and 
interest payments allowed lenders to extend mortgage terms for as long as 30 
years -- instead of the five-year, balloon-payment terms that had been standard 
up until then.) 
</P>
<P>
 Noack's firm has underwritten about 500 mortgages using the new system since 
April. In 40% of the applications from borrowers, he said, Monument got a clear 
go-ahead signal to fund within minutes of transmission. In another 25% of the 
applications, the system came back with additional questions for the applicants 
-- typically related to income or employment stability -- that were resolved 
within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In about 35% of the applications, the automated underwriting system turned up 
significant enough problems that the preliminary signal flashed was a "no." 
These were often related to credit scores or lack of sufficient credit on the 
applicant's part. Some of the problems were resolved later, but other 
applications were rejected for funding. Electronic underwriting doesn't mean 
everybody qualifies for a loan, Noack emphasized. "It cuts the paper and time 
and costs," he says. It doesn't transform sub-par credit risks into good ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Freddie Mac's new system, Noack has done five- and six-day fundings from 
application to settlement, and has completed two 48-hour transactions to save 
home sales where other financing fell through. On top of that, he says, he's 
been able to pass along savings on electronic credit checks ($20 for merged 
in-file checks versus $45 for traditional mortgage credit reports), electronic 
real estate valuations ($30 versus $400-$500 traditional fee), and a 50% 
reduction on title search and insurance fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic appraisal data-checks use several on-line sources in combination: 
Local property tax assessments, proprietary sale and resale records, plus 
Freddie Mac's own repeat-sale home price indexes for the market in which the 
property is located. Physical inspections of the home being financed -- 
entailing at least a "drive-by" -- are required before any loan is actually 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's this all headed? To a lender near you later this year or in early 
1995, says Freddie Mac's Maselli. Mortgage bankers and brokers who plug into 
underwriting cyberspace routinely will be able to deliver your mortgage in five 
working days, he promises.

UNDERSTANDING WHAT 'UP TO CODE' MEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You just had a physical home inspection conducted on the house you are 
purchasing and . . . guess what? Not everything is "up to code." What does that 
mean? Is it a substandard structure? Is it an unsafe house? That it's a rotten 
deal? Well, that depends on a lot of things. 
</P>
<P>
 I am in my 15th year of performing physical home inspections and I am a 
licensed general contractor and home builder. I can tell you right now that a 
home I just built and sold in the last year doesn't meet current code. Is it 
unsafe? No. Is it a rotten deal? I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 If you built or bought the home several years ago and it complied with code at 
that time, why should you, the seller, have to be responsible to alter the 
existing structure, just because the rules have changed? 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many things involved in home construction that change regularly 
and items that are certainly real improvements. The advent of pressure 
regulators, electronic ignitions, dual-glazed windows, hard-wired smoke 
detectors, ground fault interrupters, stair and railing requirements, offer us 
improved consumer's health and safety as well as comfort and economizing. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as a buyer, you think it's a good idea to improve on some or all of these 
things, then by all means go for it. But don't expect the seller to pay for 
them. I regard these up-to-code improvements as "upgrades" and not repairs. 
Up-grades should be paid for by the buyer.

APPRAISERS SPEAK OUT ON APPRAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read Robert J. Bruss' article on appraisals ("What's It Worth?" July 10) 
with great interest, being a certified real estate appraiser. There was a great 
deal of sound advice in the article, but some misinformation should be cleared 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruss writes that "All appraisers must now be licensed. . . ." In fact, a 
license or certification is only required for some appraisals used in federally 
regulated transactions. This means that portfolio lenders, who do not sell 
their loans, are not required to use licensed appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, under rules that took effect June 7, many federally regulated 
transactions no longer require licensed appraisers for transactions amounts 
under $250,000 for residential real estate and under $1 million for commercial 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Appraisers send unlicensed assistants to do the 'dirty work.' . . . 
This is illegal." This is not illegal. Appraisal regulations do not require an 
appraiser to view, measure, photograph or even drive by a property. They do 
require an appraiser to state in the appraisal whether or not the property was 
inspected, and whether or not material assistance was provided in the 
preparation of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruss writes, "Unless they have been instructed by the lender to 'low ball' 
the appraisal. . . ." If the appraisal is performed to the Uniform Standards of 
Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), the appraisal must contain a 
certification stating that the appraisal was not performed to a specific value. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruss writes, " . . . Appraisers refuse to cooperate, such as preparing an 
extra appraisal copy for the borrower." An appraiser can not ethically provide 
a copy of an appraisal to anyone except the client, which is generally the 
lender, even when the borrower pays the fee. Please do not blame appraisers for 
obstructive lender practices.

 So Bruss is at it again. Another article trying to equate appraisers with 
rejects from a used-car lot, talking about "dishonest appraisers" and those who 
have been told by a lender to "low ball" an appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 I've worked for a major lender for more than five years as a certified 
residential appraiser and have never once been instructed to "low ball" a 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is this: Homeowners think that it is written in the Constitution 
that home values only go up and can never stay even or go down. The fact that 
we've experienced several years of falling home prices pertains to somebody 
else's home. When the appraiser reports the "bad news" via his or her appraisal 
report to the borrower or lender, then of course the appraiser is either inept, 
crooked or inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
 Please, Bruss, wake up and smell the coffee. The appraiser is the only one 
involved that does not have a vested interest in the outcome of the appraisal.

<P>
 Realtors and most homeowners demand that the appraisal profession be called 
art and label the values derived as opinions. The primary reason for this is to 
damage and call into question the credibility of the profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is subjective and open to interpretation by the viewer. The difference 
between an appraisal report and a work of art is that the appraisal has a 
definite conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 That conclusion is arrived at by carefully following the requirements of USPAP 
(Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) to which all licensed 
appraisers are bound. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraisers final conclusion of value is defined as an opinion. The 
definition of opinion is: an unsubstantiated, uncorroborated, unproven belief 
or feeling. If a conclusion is substantiated, corroborated and proven with 
adequate information, is that an opinion? 
</P>
<P>
 The New York State Supreme Court has stated, "When a belief is held by a 
person and that belief is supported by three or more articles of evidence, that 
belief can no longer be called opinion but instead must be called fact." 
Frequently, appraisals have three or more articles of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Licensed appraisers are bound by USPAP, which includes a competency provision. 
While many appraisers will violate this provision, it is a guarantee under law. 
If an appraiser is shown to have violated this provision, he or she is subject 
to disciplinary action by the Office of Real Estate Appraisers.  
</P>
<P>
 Just because an appraiser does not arrive at the needed value is not an 
indication of incompetence. If two appraisers, with similar qualifications, 
following the same USPAP requirements, are given the same assignment, they 
should be within 5% plus or minus of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are some unscrupulous appraisers out there who will go along with 
what Bruss says today, many are quite ethical and provide good service with 
complete reports. There will soon be a day that comes when it is rare to run 
into an unethical/unscrupulous appraiser.

 Bruss enjoys writing negatively about appraisers. He does not seem to 
understand that values have declined in many regions. Many appraisers, 
including myself, consistently use listings to set an upper limit of value. It 
would be wise for Bruss to recommend checking all of the available listings in 
a neighborhood prior to blaming the appraiser for a "low ball" appraisal.

<P>
 While appraising is not an exact science, it is hardly a "best guess." 
Appraisals are performed using factual market data, which is then evaluated 
based on exterior inspection of comparable properties, interviews with selling 
agents, personal experience and other resources to derive a most likely selling 
price as of the date of the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I have also never known an appraiser to turn down information provided 
by a homeowner, as Bruss suggests some do. It is then the appraiser's job to 
determine what is relevant from what is not. This is no more doing the 
appraiser's job than keeping a clean and attractive home is doing the listing 
agent's job when selling a home. Due diligence is always in the best interests 
of the homeowner.

HOMEWISE: CLOTHES DRYER VENT CAN KEEP OUT THE COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I read about some device I can attach to the outside of my house 
where my clothes dryer would exhaust -- which will keep cold air from coming 
back inside when the dryer is not operating. Does this work? Will lint build up 
and plug the vent? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: A back-draft damper is a device designed to help keep cold air, birds 
and rodents out of your dryer's exhaust duct. The duct opening should never be 
covered with a screen because the screen would get clogged with lint. The 
Uniform Mechanical Code requires clothes dryer exhaust ducts terminate outside 
the building and have back-draft dampers. Check with your local code official 
to learn of specific requirements in your area. The ability of back-draft 
dampers to prevent cold air infiltration varies with design and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Most back-draft dampers have a flapper that hangs on a hinge over the exhaust 
vent opening when the dryer is off. The flapper covers the opening. When the 
dryer is on, the exhaust airflow forces the flapper to hinge open. Usually 
flapper dampers don't close completely airtight. They may not close as designed 
if damaged. Lint can collect on the flapper hinges and prevent proper closing. 
You should periodically clean the hinges and adjust the damper so it closes 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a dryer vent hood product designed to seal very tightly when the 
dryer is not on. The one we are aware of is made by Heartland Products in North 
Dakota. It's made of ABS plastic that can be painted. It can endure outside 
temperature extremes. Before dropping by your local hardware store, it's worth 
a phone call to make see if they carry the product. 
</P>
<P>
 In this design, the very end of the exhaust duct turns upward. An inverted cup 
sits upon the end of the duct, keeping it closed to bugs, rodents and air. When 
the dryer turns on, the exhaust airflow pushes the cup up, allowing the mixture 
of hot moist air and lint to escape. A guide keeps the cup aligned so it drops 
back down onto the opening when the dryer turns off. This whole assembly is 
enclosed under a hood. The hood keeps the rain out and protects the cup. You 
can easily remove the hood's cover to clean out the lint. You should check for 
lint buildup periodically throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 This design is more effective at sealing, and appears to be more durable. It 
eliminates the possibility of a sticky hinge caused by lint buildup. It may 
cost about $15 to $20 more than a typical flapper damper. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important to install a dryer's exhaust ductwork correctly. The 
dryer's exhaust fan may not be strong enough to expel the lint if the ductwork 
is too long or too narrow. Lint buildup in the ductwork can reduce drying 
efficiency and create a fire hazard. The Uniform Mechanical Code limits the 
duct length, location and configuration for both metal and vinyl ducts.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT; WOOD-PELLET BARBECUES ARE EFFICIENT, 
CLEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I heard that new natural wood-pellet barbecue grills make foods 
taste better and burn cleanly. Do they cost more to operate than gas or 
electric models and what else is new in efficient barbecues? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: New wood-pellet barbecues are convenient and efficient to use. By 
cooking over 100% real wood (renewable energy), you get that authentic "camp 
fire" flavor. The pellets are available in mesquite, cherry, hickory, alder and 
maple for unique flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pellet barbecues incorporate a small built-in auger and blower, but they look 
like typical gas barbecues. They use very little electricity and a small 
10-pound bag of pellets should last for five cookouts. 
</P>
<P>
 A small hopper holds several pounds of wood pellets. The auger slowly feeds 
the pellets to the grill burner area. The auger speed is adjustable to control 
the barbecue temperature and smoke flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The blower circulates air through the pellets for a hot pollution-free fire. 
This also circulates air around the food for true smoked flavor. You only have 
to preheat it for about five minutes before grilling food. 
</P>
<P>
 There are new super-efficient futuristic-looking domed electric barbecues. 
These full-sized barbecues have a double wall insulated cover and use 
corrosion-resistant aluminized steel to retain heat. They use less electricity 
than a typical hair dryer. 
</P>
<P>
 Heating elements are built into the non-stick grill surface so there is less 
than a 25-degree temperature variation across it. This allows you to use the 
entire grill surface and reduce total cooking time. The circular domed top also 
creates natural air circulation inside to enhance flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other features to consider are an adjustable top vent that provides precise 
control over the temperature and flavor. Smokers, with a water pan/steam heat 
feature, keep meat tender with added smoked flavor. An aluminized steel shell 
is also efficient when used on gas barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 A built-in drip vaporizer over the burners reduces flare-ups and improves the 
taste of the foods. A new "behind heat" (instead of under) rotisserie burner 
design roasts foods with less burnt taste and half as much gas. 
</P>
<P>
 There are new charcoal briquettes filled with real wood chunks. This provides 
the intense heat of charcoal with the flavor of real wood barbecuing. Keep in 
mind that burning charcoal produces more air pollution (100 times more CO gas) 
than using gas or electric barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 642 showing 17 manufacturers of new real 
wood-pellet, electric and gas barbecues listing maximum heat outputs, cooking 
area size, easy-clean grill finishes and new features, and wood/charcoal 
briquettes suppliers. Please include $2 and a self-addressed envelope.

Make an Old House More Airtight 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am trying to make my old house more airtight by installing draft sealing 
foam gaskets in my wall electric outlets. The package says that I should put 
them in all the wall outlets. Is this correct? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You should only put them behind the outlet faceplates on outdoor walls. 
Most builders do not seal around the conduit boxes during construction and this 
is one of the major areas for air leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Little outdoor air, if any, should get into the interior walls of your home, 
so the draft sealers are not needed behind those outlet faceplates. Even though 
installing gaskets is a simple job, anytime you remove a electrical outlet 
faceplate, switch off the circuit breaker first. Why Do Windows Have a Bluish 
Tint? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I just bought a 5-year-old house and the windows have a very slight bluish 
tint on sunny days. The seller told me that they were high-efficiency windows. 
Should they be bluish? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The sellers probably were telling you the truth. A bluish tint, when viewed 
from outdoors, is not uncommon with low-e (low-emissivity) glass. The low-e 
windows in my own home look this way on a sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
 A low-e coating, on the inside surface of double-pane windows, lets visible 
light through, but blocks heat loss. This type of glass is quickly becoming the 
standard replacement window glass. 
</P>

HOME IMPROVEMENT; HANDLE, USE EXTENSION CORDS WITH EXTRA CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By READER'S DIGEST BOOKS, FOR AP SPECIAL FEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Extension cords seem simple to use -- but if the cord is the wrong size or 
type for a job, or if it's improperly used, it can cause a fire. Some local 
codes forbid extension cord use because they're considered a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 An extension cord is intended only for temporary duty -- unplug and store it 
after each use. Don't run one where it may be tripped over. To avoid a severe 
or fatal shock, never use one near water. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some dos and don'ts about choosing and using an extension cord: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be careful when buying an extension cord. Just because it has several 
receptacle ends doesn't mean that it can carry more current than the outlet 
into which it's plugged. As a general rule, don't plug more than one item into 
an extension cord. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most extension cords are marked with a rating in amperes (also called amps 
or simply abbreviated "A"). Look at the nameplate. If not listed and you know 
the wattage, divide by 110 (household voltage) to obtain amperage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never exceed the ampere rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Also be aware that the longer the cord, the greater the drop in current. That 
can reduce an appliance's efficiency. A 25-foot cord, for example, has to be 
heavier than a 6-foot cord performing the same task. 
</P>
<P>
 An extension cord contains a pair of wires, each covered with heat-resistant 
plastic insulation and wrapped in a plastic or rubber sheath. The cord is 
equipped with a male and female plug. If there is a three-prong plug, the cord 
also contains a third, ground wire. Plug this type of cord into a grounded 
(three-hole) plug. Use only three-wire extensions for tools and appliances that 
have three-wire cords. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you must use an extension cord for a refrigerator, freezer or some other 
electrical unit that draws substantial amounts of current, make sure it's a 
heavy-duty, three-wire type. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The thinner the cord, the lower its capacity for conducting electricity. 
Wiring in electrical cords is rated by numbers. The lower the number, the 
larger the wire and the greater amount of current it can safely carry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A lamp-type cord usually contains a number wire. Don't use it for any 
device that draws more than 7 amps. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heavier-duty numbers 16, 14 or even 12 should be used for devices that draw 
higher amounts of current. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If an extension cord feels warm to the touch, replace it with a heavier 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If at all possible, avoid using extension cords in a workshop. If using one 
is unavoidable, make sure that the cord has a three-prong plug and is at least 
a number 14 or heavier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hook the cord slack on a long spring screwed into the ceiling above your 
workbench to keep extension or power cords out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the cord has frayed insulation or a bare wire, replace the entire cord. 
If the plug is damaged, replace it with a new plug that has the same or greater 
current-carrying capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remove an extension cord from an outlet by grasping the plug body. 
Otherwise, wires may tear loose and result in a shock or a short circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Store folded cords in napkin rings or toilet paper tubes, or hang on an old 
tie rack wrapped with masking tape.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage bushy growth and increased flower production on geraniums and 
fuchsias by pinching out tip growth regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 * For larger blooms from chrysanthemums this fall, dis-bud them now. Also 
stake and tie the plants to prevent drooping and breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant early flowering sweet peas for an abundance of flowers during the 
holidays.

APARTMENT LIFE: CAN OWNER BAN TERRACE PLANTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an 
apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in Los Angeles and I have a question for you about plants on 
the terrace of my apartment. The problem is that the landlord does not want any 
plants there. 
</P>
<P>
 At first I had them hanging up. He objected so I moved them to a shelf located 
about four inches below the railing. There is a solid concrete wall beneath the 
railing. The manager initially approved of that location, but now he says they 
do not want any plants there at all. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a city view of roof tops and want to soften it with plants. Do we have 
the right to place plants on the terrace? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Unless your lease or rental agreement specifically prohibits them, you 
can probably soften the city view with leafy matter without worrying about 
having to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Trevor Grimm, general counsel, the Apartment Assn. of 
Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA), if the owner changes the rental agreement to 
prohibit plants on the terrace, your feet are probably still planted on firm 
ground if you keep the plants and he tries to evict you and you decide to fight 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 While he couldn't guarantee that you won't be evicted, Grimm said, "A court in 
such a case would likely find that such a breach of the agreement is so 
insignificant that eviction is not warranted." How Can Owner Protect Self From 
Deadbeats? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We own a five-unit apartment building in San Pedro. We just got through 
evicting a woman who, after paying a few month's rent, stopped paying and told 
me, "Ha, ha. Just try and get me out. I know how long I can stay." 
</P>
<P>
 When we went to court, we met another owner who had just lost about $6,000 
from a similar scenario. This shocked us until we went through the mill 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 After the court hearings for eviction were all done, the renter filed for 
bankruptcy. That required a hearing in federal court and, of course, added 
attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, we lost about eight months' rent and had to spend $5,000 for legal 
fees and refurbishing the unit. Such is the state of business in the State of 
California. Is there any relief in sight? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Maybe, if the state Senate passes SB 690, AAGLA's pretrial rent deposit 
bill. Among other things, the bill would require the marshal to evict a renter 
notwithstanding a bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 The theory is that once the state court terminates the tenant's right to 
possession, there are no rights left for the bankruptcy court to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a federal bill proposed by California Rep. Elton Gallegly 
(R-Simi Valley) that would stop such bankruptcy abuses. However, since there 
are relatively few other states with the problem most congressmen don't 
understand it. Therefore, that bill is not likely to pass in the near future. 
Tenant Wonders If New Late Charges Are Legal 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in Burbank and I'm having some problems with the new management 
company. I just received a notice of changes in the terms of my lease from the 
new company and I'm wondering how legal these changes are. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent is due on the first of the month with no grace period. Among these 
proposed changes is to raise the late charge from $10 to $50, plus the current 
$2 a day for each late payment. They also want to raise the returned check 
charge from $25 to $75. Are these high rates of increase legal? 
</P>
<P>
 I have also been told that the rents will soon be increased. Is there any 
limit on the rate of increase they can charge? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The reasonableness of the late charge depends on the amount of the rent. 
According to the law, an "unreasonable" late fee is an illegal penalty and, 
therefore, unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 A good rule of thumb is that a late fee should be no more than 6% of the rent, 
or $50 for a rent of $833.50. If your rent is $833 or more, the fee is probably 
legal. Otherwise, it's probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 A $2 daily late fee, since it's unlimited, is probably not legal. A daily fee 
can be charged, but it, too, should be capped so as not to exceed to 6% of the 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the returned check charge must bear some relationship to the cost 
(damages) incurred by the owner. If the charge is too high, it, too, is an 
unenforceable illegal penalty; $75 sounds too high. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as getting a big rent increase, I wouldn't worry unless your rent is 
substantially below market rate. There is an extremely high vacancy rate in 
L.A. County, particularly in the San Fernando Valley, making the competition 
stiff for good renters.

 The purchase of a condominium that has been converted from an apartment can be 
a serious headache if the right questions are not asked. First and foremost the 
condominium is not new construction, but a used building. With that use comes 
costly wear and tear that may not be obvious. Unforeseen repair expenses will 
always be a nasty surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying a condominium is unique. The only thing you will own is what's inside 
the four walls of your unit. All of the other building's structures such as the 
swimming pool, roof and entrance hallways are owned jointly with the other unit 
owners. These jointly owned portions are called the common areas. Each unit 
owner has a shared responsibility to pay money to maintain and repair the 
common areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not let the excitement of the sale overcome the need for information about 
the condominium. Make no assumptions when buying a converted condominium, 
except that like a shiny apple it may be rotten inside. Ask questions to be 
sure your investment will be a happy home free from problems. You can avoid 
most problems by getting answers to these questions: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- What work has been done on the building? 
</P>
<P>
 The developer may not have to do any work to sell the building as 
condominiums. Often the owner of an apartment building defers the more 
expensive maintenance, then turns around and converts to condos, hoping to pass 
the cost of maintenance onto the new purchaser. It is easy to do cosmetic work. 
A fresh coat of paint and new floor is cheap and makes the building look nice, 
but does nothing to fix any real problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Get details on what work was done on the building before units were sold as 
condos. Do not be satisfied with hearing that everything has been refurbished 
or brought up to legal standards. These explanations mean nothing without the 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Is the budget adequate? 
</P>
<P>
 By law you must be given a copy of the homeowner association's budget before 
buying. The budget will show the cost to operate the building. Operating costs 
will range from electricity for the common areas to monthly service on an 
elevator and will depend upon the particulars of the individual building you 
are buying. You will pay for these operating expenses through your monthly 
dues. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, part of your dues should go into the reserves each month. 
Reserves are a fund set aside for long-term maintenance and replacement of the 
building's components. For example, a roof will not last forever and will need 
to be replaced. The money eventually needed to pay for the new roof should come 
out of the reserves, so that in 10 years when $80,000 is needed for the new 
roof the money will be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserves are calculated by various formulas put out by the Department of Real 
Estate. Typically, the remaining useful life of the building's components will 
be calculated. The projected cost of replacement is then factored over the 
number of years of remaining useful life. 
</P>
<P>
 Find out how remaining useful life was determined. Was the building inspected 
by someone with the right expertise? Does the reserve budget include everything 
it should, or are there blank lines and missing information? Get an explanation 
for any information that is missing. Do not be trapped by hidden costs that are 
not in the budget. As an owner you will be responsible to pay whatever costs 
are reasonably necessary to maintain the common areas, whether or not 
originally budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Do I need it in writing? 
</P>
<P>
 A legitimate developer will not shy away from answering your questions with 
detailed written information. Moreover, the law requires that contracts, plans 
and other similar information about the condominium be given to the homeowner 
association. Getting it in writing is your best assurance that the project is 
not riddled with problems. Even if you do not understand construction, the 
developer's willingness to answer questions in writing is a sign that there is 
nothing to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Was there an inspection? 
</P>
<P>
 The law in California requires the developer to give each purchaser a form 
that says the condominium has been inspected. The inspection must include both 
the unit offered for sale and the common area. Any defect found during the 
inspection must be disclosed. If no defects were found by the inspection, the 
form should say so. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Who did the inspection? 
</P>
<P>
 Find out who did the inspection. Do not assume that an inspection was 
performed by a neutral professional like a qualified engineer or architect. No 
law says who must do the inspection. Ask to see the inspection report. Find out 
how thorough a job was done. Get your own inspection if you have any doubts. 
Beware of inspections done only by the seller, even if they are technically 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- Is the building up to code? 
</P>
<P>
 Building codes set a minimum standard for construction to protect the public. 
Code requirements mean little in the conversion of an apartment to condominium. 
The developer may not have to bring the building up to current code standards, 
and in many cases, the cost to do so would prohibit converting from apartments 
to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements by the developer that the building is up to code should be a 
warning that something is being glossed over. Again, get details of what was 
done. Get them in writing from the person who did the actual work. Ask to look 
at contracts for the work claimed to have been done if you have a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Have there been any plumbing leaks? 
</P>
<P>
 Pipes are usually made of copper. Copper pipes should last for the life of the 
building. Older buildings may contain galvanized pipes that typically last only 
20 to 30 years; meaning that galvanized pipe may start to leak with age and 
become an additional expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipes leak for a reason. Find out why to rule out any serious problems. Get 
details about what caused the leaks, how were they fixed, by whom and how often 
have leaks occurred. It may be wise to have an experienced plumber see if there 
are any problems. Remember you cannot see into the walls where most of the 
plumbing and the problems are likely to be hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Has there been a termite inspection? 
</P>
<P>
 A termite inspection does not guarantee that there are no problems. Termites 
and dry rot can lead to costly repairs. Dry rot is caused when wood gets wet. 
As dry rot eats into the wood openings are formed that let termites in to cause 
even more deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the termite report to see exactly what was inspected. Make sure it 
covers the entire condominium, not just the unit you are buying. If necessary 
get one done yourself. It's cheap to patch cracks, but they may cover termite 
and dry rot problems. 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- What kind of soils inspection has been done? 
</P>
<P>
 The soils upon which the condominium sits provide support for the building. 
Any problems with the soils will affect the whole building. For example, as the 
soils move so does the building. Too much movement can cause cracks in the 
walls, floors, ceilings, prevent windows from opening properly or cause pipe 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Find out what type of soil is under the condominium. Expansive soils expand 
like a sponge when exposed to water and contract as they dry causing the 
building to move. Landslides or fill that is not properly compacted are other 
common problems found in southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Find out what has been done to make sure there will be no problems with the 
soils. Ask to look at the soils report. If no report was done, find out why. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Who can I consult with for my own protection? 
</P>
<P>
 There are several inspection services that will walk through the building and 
report on its condition. Be aware that they are generalists and may not be 
expert enough in particular areas to spot hidden problems. For the most part 
they will put you in the right direction. Make sure to give your inspector any 
information obtained from the developer for a more thorough analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Most problems can be avoided by asking detailed questions. Do not fall into 
the trap of relying on the seller or real estate broker to protect you. Find 
out for yourself!

TERRA-COTTA POTS ARE GARDENERS' FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her tiny Hancock Park back yard, Stephanie Jonas grows an entire kitchen 
garden in pots, everything from tomatoes to basil. There are pots large enough 
for a fruit tree, wide enough for a crop of lettuce or small enough for a 
single herb. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the pots are in vertical wrought-iron racks so she can fit more garden 
into less square feet, others hang on the walls. There are even pots inside of 
pots -- she keeps pots of small plants inside larger pots, at least until the 
plant in the bigger container demands more space. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere you look, there are pots, pots and more pots, and every single one 
is terra cotta. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners have been growing things in terra-cotta pots ever since the 
Egyptians first came up with the basic flaring shape (so plants could be easily 
removed). 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Romans who coined the name terra cocta , which means "baked earth," 
or terra cotta in modern Italian, although the clay doesn't start out that 
wonderful dusty mineral color.  
</P>
<P>
 It's an ordinary clay gray, but once fired at fairly low heat, it turns that 
distinctive terra-cotta color, the perfect foil for a plant's foliage, flowers 
or fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason it remains the gardeners' container of choice, despite 
challenges from glazed pots, concrete, plaster of Paris and, most recently, 
plastic (which, in homage, is often molded in a terra-cotta color). The earthy 
color looks good, even natural in the vicinity of the roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is cost. Even with her interior designer discount, Jonas finds 
that terra cotta purchased at a nursery is cheaper than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 A handsome 24-inch Italian-styled pot, big enough for a hydrangea or a young 
fruit tree, only costs about $25. Some new Chinese pots, meant to look like 
fashionably old and weathered terra cotta, can be found for about $10. Plainer 
pots are even cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are lots of factory seconds stores in Southern California where you 
can find bargain pots, if you'll willing to put up with a few defects. Just 
stay away from pots with long, thin, hairline cracks; these will probably break 
in time. Short, open cracks are likely OK. They're caused by the clay cooling 
too quickly, and that blemish is enough to cut the price in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the designs at Southland nurseries are as old as the process itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The garlands, clusters of fruit and other raised designs found on many pots 
date back to the patterns used on Roman sarcophagi, that they then copied onto 
pots. 
</P>
<P>
 The elegant pots with the bulging "rolled rims" are copies of 600-year-old 
Italian Renaissance pots. It's a distinctive, sturdy shape and the thick rim 
makes it an easy pot to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
 A few terra-cotta pots are still made by hand. Look inside and you can see the 
coils that make up the pots, or the spirals indicating it was thrown on a 
wheel, often even a few of the potter's thumb prints, where they pinched or 
teased the clay. Naturally, these are quite expensive -- the 15-inch Willow 
Pottery pot on K1 costs about $65. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the newest pots at nurseries are meant to look old. They appear to 
have weathered many a season in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 That's another thing gardeners like about terra cotta -- it gracefully ages. 
Minerals in our water soon frost the sides, and in particularly moist places, 
moss may even grow, though the harder and denser the pot, the less this is 
likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who do not like the caked-on minerals (which do not seem to harm 
plants), they can be lessened with a scrubbing of white vinegar or scrapped off 
with a putty knife. But som e gardeners think this white blush an essential 
part of the pot and actually speed up the process by painting on a mix of lime 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for longevity, stay away from the very inexpensive pots that 
feel grainy and are an especially deep shade of mineral red. These are fired at 
low temperatures (often inside a pile of old tires) and they age a little too 
quickly, dissolving away as you water. There are coatings (available at some 
nurseries) that prolong their lives in the garden but darken the shade of red 
so it is less earthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Terra cotta hasn't stayed popular through the centuries on looks alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants like growing in the unglazed clay because it is porous and, like a 
swamp cooler, keeps the roots cool by evaporation, even on ferociously hot 
days. It also lets the roots breath and they need oxygen just like the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The porous clay wicks away excess moisture, so potting soils seldom become 
waterlogged in terra-cotta pots, which helps prevent root rot, another plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are taller than they are wide so there is plenty of room for the roots. 
Low pots are meant for shallow-rooted plants. The squat versions of the common 
flower pot were once called "begonia pots" or, in larger sizes, "azalea pots," 
because those plants don't need much root room. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortest, squattest pots, often quite wide with near vertical sides, are 
called "bulb pans." They were designed to grow bulbs for a season (bulbs need 
almost no soil if you toss them out after flowering). Today, gardeners usually 
plant bulbs in taller pots and keep them for more than one season, but bulbs 
pans are just right for small annual flowers or vegetables, such as pansies or 
lettuce, that you want to cluster together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Color bowls," often shaped like salad bowls, are also low and designed for 
massing bedding plants so they look almost like they were growing in the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A few flaring pots are actually meant to act like pot stands. Turn them upside 
down and put another on top for added elevation. 
</P>
<P>
 When shopping for a pot, remember that it is possible to "overpot" a plant, 
that is, give it more pot than it needs, so the soil tends to get too soggy and 
the roots rot. The rule of thumb is never move a plant into a pot more than 
twice the size of the plant's previous home. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravel in the bottom of the pot also encourages rot and leaves less soil for 
the roots to grow in. Modern potting mixes are so porous that they require no 
additional measures to speed drainage. 
</P>
<P>
 A better idea is to cover the drainage hole with a patch of window screening, 
to keep the soil in and sowbugs out.

GIVE HOUSE A QUICK FACE LIFT WITH PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to give your house a quick face lift? Bring in some lush houseplants. 
</P>
<P>
 The full greenery of wandering jew or the delicate fronds of a Boston fern 
help create an indoor oasis from summer heat spells. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to remember that tropical vacation you took this year, bring some 
brightly colored coleus into your home. Their bright contrasting leaves and 
unusual leaf shapes will provide a lift during the mid summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Other favorites might include a pot of hot house grown hibiscus, fragrant 
gardenia or blue flowering exacum. Check with your California Certified Nursery 
Professional for other suggestions.

REAL ANSWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Q.: My neighbor, a mechanic, always has cars parked in the driveway or street. 
I'm trying to sell my house and am concerned this will decrease the value of my 
property.What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 A.: While it may not reduce the actual value, a cluttered landscape can 
detract from the positive aspects of your home. Take action by reviewing your 
local laws, which should be on file at the public library, county law library 
or City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a typical "junk vehicle" ordinance requires any disabled car to 
either be enclosed or placed behind a fence. And most cities prohibit parking 
any vehicle on a city street too long -- usually no more than 72 hours, 
according to attorney Cora Jordan in "Neighbor Law: Fences, Trees, Boundaries & 
Noise," Nolo Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 It also may be worthwhile to check into local zoning ordinances. An operator 
of a home-based business usually is required to obtain a variance or permanent 
zoning change. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, if the neighbor's repair work produces loud noises, he may be 
breaking local noise control ordinances, which are enforced by the police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you have a copy of an ordinance that addresses the problem, your 
troubles may be almost over," Jordan writes. "The neighbor probably has no idea 
that what he is doing is actually against the law. In most cases, just 
presenting a copy to him will resolve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 If the neighbor does not respond, report the violation to the appropriate 
authority.

BRITISH COLUMBIA'S EMERALD ISLES; BEYOND THE SAN JUANS, SUMMERING IN CANADA'S 
LESS-TRAVELED GULF ISLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENA ZUKOWSKI, Zukowski is a free-lance writer who lives in Abbotsford, 
British Columbia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If point scores were awarded for understatement, our captain on the Queen of 
Nanaimo ferry would have earned a 9.9. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, anyone who happens to be standing on the starboard side may notice a 
couple of whales," he droned in his best monotone. (In keeping with their 
supposed national character, Canadians feel they have an obligation to convey 
an aura of quiet calm.) 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately the ferry tilted to starboard as the boat's complement of 
passengers rushed to the rail. There, just yards away, as we plied between 
Mayne and Galiano islands in the Strait of Georgia, four huge killer whales 
were either having a whale of a lot of fun or engaged in an immodest display of 
courtship. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the "couples" leaped into the air and then flopped down, spraying water 
in all directions in a backward belly flop. A few minutes later, another of the 
orcas made a shallow dive only to remain perpendicular, waving its tail fins at 
the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 The lady from Munich next to me at the rail looked as if her lottery number 
had just been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "These whales, they are trained, yes?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 I assured her that no, they were indeed wild orcas and that we didn't allow 
Disney-fabricated mammals north of the 49th Parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I live in British Columbia, I don't get over to the splendid Gulf 
Islands too often -- nor do I often see spontaneous whale performances. But it 
was June when I related the whale incident to my B&B hostess on Galiano Island, 
and already my third visit for the year. "That's nothing," she said. "Last 
August, there were not one, but two pods of killer whales with 35 or 40 whales 
each that played around in Active Pass for almost an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 If sights like this give you goose bumps, they're only a taste of what awaits 
in Canada's exquisite Gulf Islands. Riding the ferries between the islands, one 
is likely to see porpoise, otters, sea lions and birds of every color. Bald 
eagles are so abundant in places that they are considered a nuisance because 
they edge out resident cormorants. On all the islands there are miles of 
shoreline without a single cottage. Mountain peaks and mountain trails. 
Deserted beaches. The finest cruising and sailing anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Vancouver and Victoria are both kissed by the Japanese current, 
bringing a mild climate (and less rain than Seattle), the Gulf Islands go one 
better. Tucked into the rain-shadow of Vancouver Island, they are remarkably 
dry, and have a climate that at times and in places feels almost Mediterranean 
-- with much more sunshine and warmer temperatures year round than any other 
place in British Columbia. Cactus can be found on some of the islands along 
with tropical palms and flourishing artichokes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 islands lie in the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver on the 
mainland and Vancouver Island, but only five have regular ferry service, a 
substantial resident population and services for visitors: Salt Spring, 
Galiano, Mayne, North and South Pender and Saturna. These five form the 
northern or Canadian extension of Washington state's San Juan Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 B.C. Ferries have numerous sailings every day from Swartz Bay on Vancouver 
Island and from the harbor at Tsawwassen, about 25 miles south of the city of 
Vancouver, to the various islands. You can see the islands in a day trip from 
Vancouver, but that would be missing the whole point of going there. 
</P>
<P>
 All the islands are mountainous in appearance with rugged shorelines, immense 
bluffs and sheer cliffs that plunge into the sea. There are wide, dazzlingly 
white beaches layered with crushed shells that have accumulated over the 
centuries. The roads are draped with gnarled Garry oaks and twisted red arbutus 
trees. Wildflowers and berries grow in abundance. 
</P>
<P>
 Each has a distinct personality, but what they all offer in abundance is 
tranquillity and decompression from the stresses of contemporary life. You 
won't find a Hilton or a Sheraton anywhere, but there are quiet guest houses, 
small elite hotels that seem to have been plucked out of the English 
countryside and a few discreet motels. The unspoken law everywhere seems to be 
come, enjoy, but don't start a stampede. Salt Spring 
</P>
<P>
 On a hot Sunday afternoon, a small group of Vesuvius Bay residents are sitting 
around in lawn chairs at the Arbutus Court Motel for the first meeting of a 
committee with a very serious purpose. The ferry from Vesuvius Bay to Crofton 
has, because of a bureaucratic whim, all of a sudden started to toot on arrival 
and departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the damn thing goes, I practically have to peel myself off the ceiling," 
says one angry homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter campaign is quickly organized, government representatives to be 
contacted identified, tactics and counter-tactics discussed. A dozen citizens 
have put on their armor and are girded for battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its small population of 9,500, a good percentage of these islanders 
are people who know how to get things done. Among its residents, the island has 
a strong core of Canadian and U.S. celebrities, such as actor/director Goldie 
Hawn and painter Robert Bateman, retired lawyers, judges, industrialists and a 
strong core of activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Spring is the largest, most developed and most visited of the islands -- 
which simply means that it has an actual village, Ganges, on the east side, 
with such services as a bookstore, bank, soap factory, a couple of specialty 
stores and the like. The island even has a movie theater in an old community 
hall that shows relatively recent films. 
</P>
<P>
 Every weekend, you can still catch a glimpse of the island's other face during 
the Saturday market in downtown Ganges. Salt Spring used to be called the 
"hippie island" but now the alternative lifestyle crowd has become specialist. 
Crafts of every description are displayed next to fresh-squeezed-orange-juice 
stands, jars of sugarless pure-fruit jams, herb plants for sale, hair-beading 
street salons and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Spring has 400 miles of roads, mountain peaks reaching 2,310 feet, 
streams and lakes filled with cutthroat and bass. If you drive to the top of 
Mt. Maxwell Provincial Park, mid-island on the west side, there's an outlook 
that takes in rolling valley farmland stretching for miles and a 
lump-in-the-throat sweep of most of the other islands. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has one of the Pacific Northwest's most famous small inns, Hastings 
House, a Relais & Chateaux accommodation near Ganges; excellent restaurants; 
top quality B&B's and the highest-priced real estate in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Classy Hastings House is the island's best-known inn (and with rates starting 
at $220, by far the most expensive on any of the islands). Once the family home 
of British immigrants, the house is a replica of a 14th-Century Sussex country 
home with log beams, bedrooms with cozy comforters, stone fireplaces and 
mullioned windows overlooking the bay and rolling gardens. The last time I 
visited, the aroma of garlic and rosemary floated out of the kitchen, a teasing 
precursor of the Salt Spring lamb on that night's menu. ( Prix fixe meals are 
about $40 without wine.) 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Spring has more than 100 B&B's, some very basic, others done to a 
world-class standard. One of the latter is the lovingly restored Old Farm 
House, in the northern part of the island, run by Karl and Gertie Fuss with 
rooms that start at $125. I had dinner (a delicate prawn salad) with Gertie 
last year. For breakfast I tried one of her specialties: poached egg on polenta 
with fresh sorrel and bearnaise sauce. The Farm House's rooms have old country 
charm, but with fine hotel service such as the steaming coffee on a silver tray 
that waited outside our room every morning so that we could lounge in handmade 
robes before dressing for breakfast. The Penders 
</P>
<P>
 North and South Pender were originally one island until a canal was cut 
through its isthmus, saving boats and canoes a lot of rowing miles. They're now 
joined by a one-lane wooden bridge. The Penders are second in size to Salt 
Spring and lie closest to the U.S. border. For the population of 1,800, island 
life is still pretty rural; there are no villages. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 30-minute ferry ride from Salt Spring to Otter Bay on North Pender one 
early morning, I drove over to what had looked on the map to be a village to 
find breakfast. "Port Washington" turned out to be one 1903 general store and a 
marina, both closed. The nearest thing to a village on Pender turned out to be 
the Driftwood Centre, which consisted of a bank, post boxes, bakery, 
coin-operated laundry, hair salon, general store and a cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 I finally found Diane Dryer at the Inn on Pender, who unlike everyone else on 
the island, seemed to be awake at 7:30 a.m. She runs her clean, motel-style 
inn, and the Memories restaurant (one of the three places on the Penders to 
eat), plus manages to keep tabs on everything happening on the island. (She was 
one of two people who told me Goldie Hawn had a place on North Pender.) 
</P>
<P>
 As I left, a delicate blacktailed deer standing a few feet from the restaurant 
door was unperturbed by us humans. Anyone whose childhood years were forever 
changed by Bambi will be ecstatic in the Gulf Islands. Deer are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The best vista on Pender is from Mt. Norman, which has trails to its 858-foot 
summit and views all over the San Juans. The Penders main claim to fame are 
their many bays and beaches, which are accessible by public rights of way. The 
beaches are gravelly and secluded, great for quiet picnics and ideal for easy 
boat launching. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on Pender Island that the specter of overdevelopment in the Gulf 
Islands first appeared. In the late 1960's, a Vancouver businessman subdivided 
an area around Pender's Magic Lake for a mainland-style housing. The bitter 
controversy that followed quickly spread to the other Gulf Islands. In their 
zeal to preserve the pristine nature of the islands, residents set up the 
Islands Trust, a body empowered to "preserve and protect" the islands through 
zoning bylaws. It has proved highly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penders have a full-scale resort, Bedwell Harbour, a number of lodges and 
inns and some charming B&Bs. I particularly liked Eatenton B&B, just off Scarff 
Road, with its huge sun deck that looks over the entire bay, and 
Cliffside-Inn-on-the-Sea, which was the first B&B on the island and has the 
reputation for being as efficient as a Swiss watch. Galiano 
</P>
<P>
 Ask anyone what the defining personality of Galiano is and you get almost 100% 
agreement: It's the home of the environmental activist. If there's a protest 
going on somewhere in B.C., you can be darn sure some of the picketers are 
Galianoites. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-time resident Tom Hennessy and his wife, Ann, are typical of the kind of 
islanders who came vowing to escape the rat race -- and then found themselves 
busier than they ever were at home. Tom, a former gallery- and museum-designer 
in Washington, D.C., came upon Galiano during a vacation and never went home. 
</P>
<P>
 Their large property right on Montague Harbour is home to Sutil Lodge, a B&B 
with 1930's fishing lodge decor, plus umpteen dozen other enterprises they now 
run -- including a majestic 46-foot catamaran that takes people on four-hour 
picnic cruises to one of the best swimming beaches in the Gulf Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Club-shaped Galiano is 15 miles long and one mile wide, reaches further north 
than the other islands and has 900 residents. Although there's no real village, 
there are more than 20 B&B's, several inns and lodges and the elegant Woodstone 
Country Inn, which is situated inland and features rooms with wood-burning 
fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled on a sheer gem of a place to stay on my last visit -- Lion's Gate 
Guest House, a private home with only one bedroom. The house is about as "B.C." 
as they come -- a log house at the end of a garden-lined drive with a huge open 
living room and kitchen. The guest room (with its own bathroom) felt like a 
little log cabin and at night I sank into the most comfortable bed in the 
Western world. Owners Debbie and John Stewart are great conversationalists and 
even after I'd polished off a mean herb omelet, it was hard ripping myself 
away. Mayne 
</P>
<P>
 Mayne is the smallest of the Gulf Islands (8.4 square miles) but it has a 
whopping population of 835, due partly to its position closest to Vancouver, 
but also to its great community spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good selection of charming B&B's, one of the most elegant inns 
anywhere in B.C., Oceanwood, and several good restaurants such as Perry's 
Place, where we sampled a huge feed of freshly caught prawns (for about $8.50) 
that I still dream about. On weekends, Perry's has jazz concerts over dinner as 
well as a beer garden out back. 
</P>
<P>
 (For anyone who has cooking facilities, fresh prawns can be bought off a 
fishing boat on the government dock at Horton Bay on weekends from 4 to 6 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Miner's Bay is the heart of Mayne, with craft shops, general stores and the 
popular Springwater Lodge pub. The pub has the best fish and chips on the 
islands ($4.94) and despite my now-elevated cholesterol count, I suggest you 
not miss it. The ling cod was done just right, covered with a crispy light, 
thin batter shell. 
</P>
<P>
 A cozy B&B in Miner's Bay, the Root Seller, has down-home rooms, a hostess who 
invites guests to "just help yourself" and, the two nights I stayed there, 
interesting fellow guests. (I shared digs with a group of physiotherapists and 
doctors from South Africa and a teaching psychiatrist from Colorado.) 
</P>
<P>
 The top-of-the-line inn is Oceanwood, run by Marilyn and Jonathon Chilvers 
with the grace and style of a fine English country hotel. Their dining room is 
unquestionably the best on Mayne (and probably in the islands), thanks to their 
dynamic young chef Chris Johnson. Oceanwood is known also for its extensive 
wine cellar of internationally praised B.C. wines. Menus change daily and a 
four-course meal will cost about $25 per person. The place is packed with 
sybaritic treats: You can sit in the Jacuzzi with a glass of that B.C. wine and 
watch the boats come by, or take a pre-dinner stroll in the herb garden, or sit 
by your own fireplace sipping more of that wine before slipping into your 
whirlpool bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things to do, Active Pass Lighthouse on a peninsula southwest of 
Miner's Bay is a good photo op and picnic spot, and there's a two-hour walk 
from Miner's Bay to Helen Point. Mayne seems to have fewer hills than the other 
islands, so cycling is a big pastime, and there are numerous places to rent 
bikes. Kayaks can be rented from Mayne Island Kayak & Canoe Rentals in Miners 
Bay. Saturna 
</P>
<P>
 The minute the ferry docks at Lyall Harbour, you know this is an island not 
like the others. Soaring cedar and fir trees descend right down to the water, 
compelling you to explore along the island's only major road. East Point Road 
winds along the 10-mile-long coast through tunnels of red arbutus beside a 
"beach" of unbroken sandstone that looks over the Strait of Georgia and Tumbo 
Island to the northeast. There were moments when I felt I was touching the last 
pristine beach in North America. Only rarely was there a piece of cleared 
property or a house. It was love at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Saturna is the largest of the "outer islands" (all are "outer," 
except Salt Spring), it has the least development and the smallest population 
(only 280 full-time residents). There are no villages, no coin-laundries, no 
garbage pickup or dump, no tourist shops selling "Welcome to Saturna" banners. 
There is, however, a good lodge, several fine B&B's, bike rental, a superb 
bakery, a pub, marina, two general stores and an Avon lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reasons why the island has not been densely settled -- despite, in 
my opinion, being the most beautiful of the lot -- is a chronic shortage of 
water in some places. 
</P>
<P>
 Among some of the long-timers are the residents of the Breezy Bay community on 
the island's southwest side, who run the Breezy Bay Bed & Breakfast. Betty 
Spears, who has lived on Saturna for 15 years, runs the "more than 
100-year-old" house and whips up farm-style breakfasts of eggs, pancakes, 
granola and Haggis Farm bread on the wood stove in the kitchen. Everything is 
period: the wrought iron beds, Amos 'n Andy radio, overstuffed sofas and 
tongue-and-groove walls. The atmosphere is warm and friendly and guests have 
the run of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 One absolute must: the Haggis Farm Bakery, which I heard about on several of 
the other islands. Owners Jon Guy and Priscilla Ewbank started the bakery eight 
years ago when they were overwhelmed by demand for the sourdough bread they 
baked each Sunday in their home kitchen. They now have a proper bakery 
mid-island on Narvaez Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming over on the ferry to Saturna, a young man pointed to the top of Mt. 
Warburton Pike, the highest point on the island, and told me not to miss it. 
"If you're lucky, you'll see some of the brown or honey-colored feral goats 
with their twisty horns. There's a grassy plateau and from there you can see 
all of the islands and as far as Mt. Baker. It's the most beautiful spot on 
earth." 
</P>

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; OLD WATERWAY REOPENS IN IRELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Travelers in Ireland can now cruise up the River Shannon in the south to the 
River Erne in Northern Ireland thanks to the restoration and reopening of the 
Shannon-Erne Waterway linking the two rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-mile waterway, also called the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, was 
built more than a century ago but was used for only nine years before being 
abandoned in favor of rail travel. 
</P>
<P>
 When the $45-million refurbishing project was undertaken in 1991, years of 
neglect had reduced the waterway to a weed-choked channel of broken bridges and 
locks; now the original sites and stonework have been restored. Locks are now 
operated by a push-button electro-hydraulic system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shannon, the longest river in Great Britain or Ireland, is considered one 
of Ireland's great natural resources and is a popular cruising site. The River 
Erne widens into the Upper Lough Erne and the Lower Lough Erne, which are known 
for their fishing.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; GUARDING AGAINST CRIME IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN GUTTERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new generation of rich Russians is replacing foreigners as a favorite target 
of criminals in Russia, and the nation's Interior Ministry says crime against 
foreigners has dropped this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But 65 foreigners have been murdered so far in 1994, and when Russia's main 
crime-fighting body last month issued a 12-page booklet offering visitors 
advice on how to avoid becoming victims of the country's growing crime 
phenomenon, it acknowledged that outsiders are still in more danger than they 
were before the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 What the overworked Interior Ministry did not acknowledge is any 
responsibility to protect citizens and visitors. Ministry specialist Igor 
Khromov said almost half of the 5,000 crimes against foreigners in the past 
year resulted from the victim's carelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The guide says foreigners tended to make the wrong acquaintances and accept 
drinks and other seemingly harmless offers from strangers. It advises visitors 
to deal only with officials and reputable businessmen, but gives no tips on how 
to spot disreputable ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It says visitors should stay in hotels rather than potentially dangerous 
rented apartments, although Russian hotel rooms are far from impervious to 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 It also urges foreigners to change money at official banks, which offer poor 
exchange rates and are difficult to tell from the hundreds of unofficial 
exchange points guarded by submachine gun-toting youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The guide's major drawback is that it is in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if you can read the language, you may not be able to get your hands 
on the booklet. The Interior Ministry promised it would be delivered to foreign 
embassies for distribution, but an official at the U.S. Embassy said they had 
not received any copies and were not really expecting any. STEVEN GUTTERMAN

WEEKEND ESCAPE: ARIZONA; A POOL! COOL!; HIGH HEAT, LOW RATES: SWIMMERS AND 
NAPPERS TAKE TO A SUMMERTIME DESERT RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER. Klein is a former Times' Metro writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our house is on the market, which means we have to keep it unnaturally clean. 
Our children are on the loose for the summer, which means the search for 
constant merriment is beginning to wear. And my husband and I are leaving our 
jobs to start something new, which means our moods swing from exhilaration to 
somewhere near mental collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 We needed a tonic fast, preferably something that did not involve driving or 
any other forced group dynamics, and we also wanted cheap -- cheap being a 
relative term. I was particularly interested in sloth; naps also would be nice. 
Richard, my husband, stressed that whatever it was, it should not involve 
pitching a tent. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there were the kids to think about. Nap, for example, is now a word I 
must spell out in conversations with my husband so as to avoid sending 
3-year-old, Hannah, over the edge. ("I am NOT tired!") 
</P>
<P>
 It came together for us during the opening weekend of the summer cheap season 
at the lavish, wonderfully artificial Hyatt Regency resort in Scottsdale's 
Gainey Ranch -- that patch of desert with not only a real beach (sort of), but 
pretend Venetian canals too. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I can tell, the main difference between Hyatt's virtual reality and 
the authentic one is that the resort version is clean. And hot, really hot. 
Walking in the Arizona sunshine in June is not unlike walking into a kiln. If 
you offer no resistance, you will be turned into earthenware fast. 
</P>
<P>
 But, hey, Richard and I figured such was a small price to pay for a vacation 
where happiness seemed in reach of us all, especially since our room for four, 
with two double beds, went for $125 a night instead of the usual $305 minimum 
during the high season (Jan. 1 to mid-June). And after flying in from Burbank 
on Southwest Airlines' two-fer deal -- four unrestricted round-trip tickets to 
Phoenix for $248 -- my husband and I felt downright proud. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the Hyatt lobby alone is enough to put you in a good mood. The 
minute you step up a few stairs from the circular driveway through the 
always-open glass doors, the eye takes in the expanse, resting finally on the 
huge saguaro cactus at the head of the majestic walkway leading to the 
spectacular complex of pools, just in front of the lake, with mountains in the 
back. Arizona's take on Versailles? 
</P>
<P>
 We were staying in a standard, no-smoking room. Standard here means very 
comfortable, though not overly luxurious. There are nice touches: a blow dryer 
and scale in the bathroom, a table and chairs on the balcony, and for people 
who can never quite relax, an ironing board and iron in the closet. (There also 
are seven two-bedroom, lakeside casitas with kitchenettes and outdoor barbecue 
grills.) As you'd expect, the hotel's decorating scheme is Southwestern, with a 
very open feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first order of business after arriving Friday afternoon was to have lunch 
at the Squash Blossom, which is more or less the equivalent of the hotel's 
coffee shop. It's fancier than that, of course, but certainly not as upscale as 
the hotel's more gourmet, and expensive, Golden Swan. There is also a third 
restaurant, Sandolo, an Italian cafe with wonderful water misters on its patio. 
It could be 115 degrees out, but with the misters sprinkling the air with tiny 
water drops, you'd never know it. We had a good meal of spicy Buffalo wings, a 
chef's salad for my husband, a smoked salmon quesadilla for me and two huge 
frankfurters with curly fries for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, the kids, Hannah and our 7-year-old, Lauren, raced to our room to 
get into their bathing suits. This, after all, is why they had so wanted to 
come. The POOL! Only pool is not quite enough to describe the water thing here. 
It's actually a half-acre of pools, 10 of them in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect for little non-swimmers is "the beach" with sand on the shore suited 
to castle building and sand on the bottom. This segues into a more conventional 
pool for older kids and is next to the three-story, five-spiral water slide 
that also serves as a clock tower. The small pool that catches the sliders is 
the only one with a lifeguard, and one is definitely needed here. You lie on 
that slide, your arms tight by your side, head back -- just like the 
first-graders in line instruct you to -- and you think you're an aquatic luge 
champion. Only I doubt true Olympians scream as they go down the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 While the kids were swimming -- and after my in-laws, who live in Scottsdale, 
arrived for a visit poolside -- I followed their suggestion to go back to the 
room for a nap instead of lying on a chaise lounge nodding off in front of 
everybody. With the sun-impermeable drapes drawn, the air conditioner cranked 
up to icy, I got under the covers and fell immediately to sleep. This was 
vacation bliss. Ah, but a couple hours later I was awakened with the command: 
Let's eat! For the sake of convenience, we hit the Squash Blossom again. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for us, Saturday was the really big day. In the true spirit of a 
successful family vacation, we each did our own thing. The kids were off to the 
morning session of Camp Hyatt Kachina, which they loved. (Hyatt claims to have 
pioneered the concept of special chain-wide kids' programs when it started Camp 
Hyatt five years ago.) On the agenda this morning were sessions making bolo 
ties, mini-pie baking, game playing and some sort of scavenger hunt. From my 
vantage point behind the one-way glass in the exercise room at the Regency Spa, 
I saw the troop marching happily off, our 3-year-old leading the way. I was 
near the end of a step aerobics class, which like the other exercise sessions, 
was free to hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, meantime, had taken off on his own hour-long walk through the 
surrounding neighborhood of Gainey Ranch, an immaculate planned community where 
everything is just so. He and I regrouped a little while later at the 
adults-only pool, complete with a steel drum marimba band. While the kids ate 
lunch at camp, I ordered a fruit salad from one of the forever roving 
waitresses, while Richard made do with margaritas and some peanuts from the 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we made a tactical mistake. We both went to pick up the girls from camp, 
thereby forsaking any chance of getting a choice chaise lounge under an 
umbrella, or at least in the shade of palms. Once we were settled, however, the 
scene was idyllic. Children teamed up with whomever looked friendly (everybody 
did). Mothers and fathers helped build sandcastles. Assorted adults made fools 
of themselves on the slide. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, there were a few details that I would have liked to have known, 
but was not told, when we made reservations and checked in. The kids were 
supposed to get a welcome check-in package that includes a frequent-stay 
passport (four stays and they get free Camp Hyatt merchandise) and a Camp Hyatt 
cap. They didn't. We also would liked to have known about the half-off deal on 
a second room for the kids. Nobody mentioned it. Likewise, we weren't told that 
if children want to venture beyond the kids' menu, they can order half-price 
portions from the regular one. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, our last morning at the hotel, my in-laws joined us for Father's Day 
brunch in the Squash Blossom (there's a fancier, champagne brunch at the Golden 
Swan), which was abundant and good. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was this: After we requested the bill, our waiter sized up our 
party of six and said he would not count the kids. "That way it makes it more 
affordable for you folks," he said. How did he know? Did we look that cheap? 
Could he tell we were staying in a $125 room? No matter. We accepted, said 
thanks, and gave him a nice tip. 
</P>
<P>
 So everybody ended our visit with a smile. Budget for Four Airline tickets, 
Burbank-Phoenix: $248.00 Hotel, two nights: $275.62 Camp Hyatt, two children, 
half-day: $48.00 Lunch, Squash Blossom: $33.24 Dinner, Squash Blossom: $73.50 
Breakfast: $19.54 Father's Day brunch: $70.89 Airport-hotel shuttle: $23.00 
Drinks at hotel: $20.00 FINAL TAB: $811.79 Hyatt reservations: tel. (800) 
233-1234.

HIKING: COASTAL WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Carmel River, on the eastern slopes of the Santa Lucia Mountains, is a river 
of many moods. Some of its forks, swollen by winter and spring rains, can be 
capricious, frothy waterways as they course through the Ventana Wilderness 
before emptying into the sea just south of Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the northern end of Carmel River State Beach is a brackish lagoon called 
Carmel River Lagoon and Wetlands Natural Reserve. This walk travels the length 
of Carmel River State Beach to a point just north of Point Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: During the summer and autumn months, the sand berm 
at the Carmel River mouth provides a fine path between river and sea. Start 
this walk at the northern end of Carmel River State Beach. From California 1, 
just south of Carmel, turn west on Rio Road. When you reach Santa Lucia Street, 
turn left, then proceed five more blocks to Carmelo Street. Turn left and 
follow this road to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also start at the south end of Carmel River State Beach, easily 
accessible from California 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Follow the shoreline over the sandy berm. After rounding a minor 
point and passing some Monterey cypress, you'll arrive at Monastery Beach. 
Carmel River Beach Trail 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2 miles, round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Sandbar, river mouth, lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Wild ocean side of quaint Carmel, bird sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy.

</P>
<P>
 If you plan to enter Italy by traveling through the Brennero Pass from 
Austria, here are some interesting stops you can make en route where you'll be 
able to find inexpensive hostel accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth hostel in Rovereto, known for its war museum, is in a modern 
building at Via Della Scuola 16/18. It's open all year and can accommodate 90 
travelers, some in small rooms. Bed and breakfast costs $9.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Verona is the famous city of Romeo and Juliet. Verona's youth hostel, Villa 
Francescatti, is at Salita Fontana del Ferro 15. The villa, which dates to 
1400, is in a park. This hostel is not used for groups, is open year-round and 
can hold up to 100 travelers in multi-bedded rooms. Bed and breakfast costs 
$8.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety minutes from Verona by train is Venice. It was completely restored in 
1992 and offers accommodations in small dormitory rooms. The hostel is located 
at Fondamenta Zitelle 86, on the Giudecca Island, which can be reached from the 
rail station by taking boat No. 5 and getting off at the Zitelle stop. Bed and 
breakfast costs $11.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours by train from Venice, at the eastern end of Italy, is Trieste. Its 
hostel is located in a 19th-Century villa on the seashore near Miramare Castle, 
at Viale Miramare 331. The hostel provides dormitory accommodations for $10.50 
per night. 
</P>
<P>
 From Trieste it's 3 1/2 hours by train (with one change) to Montagnana, a town 
still surrounded by its original walls. Rocca degli Alberi Youth Hostel is 
housed in one of the wall's towers. Dormitory and small family rooms are 
available. Beds are $7.45 per night. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence's hostel, at Viale Augusto Righi 2-4, is a villa from the 1400s, 
which is set in a park and was once home to noble families. The hostel 
organizes classical music concerts for guests in cooperation with the local 
Academy of Music. You can reach the hostel from the Central Rail Station (S. 
Maria Novella) in 20 minutes by taking bus 17b. Accommodations are available in 
dormitory or small family rooms. Bed and breakfast is $11.15. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-members of Hostelling International are accommodated at many affiliated 
facilities, but they are usually charged a higher rate, about $3 more per 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 For further information on Hostelling International, contact American Youth 
Hostels, Los Angeles Council, 1434 2nd St., Santa Monica 90401; tel. (310)

DESTINATION: NEW YORK; FLASHBACK TO WOODSTOCK; TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER, 
EXPLORING THE AREA THAT HOSTED A GENERATION-DEFINING EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SCHNEDLER, Schnedler is travel editor of the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can still buy a ticket to the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair at a 
couple of downtown Saugerties shops -- but the price has risen just a bit in 25 
years. Framed behind glass in one store window, an $8 one-day ticket to that 
legendary "Aquarian exposition" sells for a cool $49.95. Think of it as 
nostalgia markup. 
</P>
<P>
 And figure it's still a lot cheaper than the $135 ticket price for Woodstock 
'94, next month's 25th-anniversary spin-off of the generation-defining 
original. The 1969 counterculture festival promised "three days of peace and 
music" and delivered a mind-blowing communal romp for 500,000 flower children, 
few of whom had bothered to purchase a ticket. Can next month's possibly top 
that? Stay tuned for results of it and Bethel '94, another festival scheduled 
for the same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock '94 -- featuring a potpourri of acts aimed more at the Grunge 
Generation than aging Aquarians -- is scheduled for Aug. 12-14 on yet another 
Upstate New York dairy farm, with a projected audience of 250,000. The 740-acre 
Winston Farm adjoins Interstate 87 on the outskirts of Saugerties, a Hudson 
Valley community of 4,000 a dozen miles east of Woodstock itself -- and 75 
miles northeast of the 1969 festival site near Bethel. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. Neither the genuine article 25 years ago nor next month's 
well-financed flashback can claim a Woodstock address. There will also be a 
second 25th-anniversary festival in Aug. 13-14 at the original location -- but 
it has to settle for the name Bethel '94. That's because rights to the 
Woodstock label belong to the 2 1/2-day Saugerties event, which is being 
organized by '69 festival guru Michael Lang. 
</P>
<P>
 If your head is spinning over all that cross-pollination, stay tuned for a 
combined history-geography primer to sort out the jumble of fests and 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 And if flower-power nostalgia -- or a passion for outdoor mega-concerts -- is 
whetting your appetite for Woodstock '94 (or the geezer-oriented Bethel '94, 
which has booked Richie Havens, Canned Heat, Iron Butterfly, Judy Collins, 
Fleetwood Mac, Melanie, John Sebastian and Blood, Sweat & Tears), the allure of 
those extravaganzas could trigger an August pilgrimage to a swatch of the U.S. 
East that has been a leisure-time magnet for at least a century. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if you would eagerly detour 500 miles to avoid any mass 
gathering that features deafening music, September or October would be a better 
time to orbit Planet Woodstock. What you'll discover is a region somewhat down 
at the heels economically but rich in history and scenery, stretching from the 
Catskills "Borscht Belt" in the west to Gilded Age mansions and dozing Rip Van 
Winkle hamlets along the Hudson in the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Distances are short by California standards -- roughly 125 miles on meandering 
highways from Bethel at the southwestern extremity of the Woodstock Zone to the 
superb Shaker Museum near Old Chatham at the northeastern limits of the 
three-day circuit I drove last month. Another 50 miles north from the Shaker 
site lies the stylish Victorian spa resort of Saratoga Springs, and no more 
than 100 miles to the west is quaint Cooperstown with its National Baseball 
Hall of Fame and Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The center of Planet Woodstock is the Ulster County village, population 2,300, 
that gave its name to the 1969 festival as well as the hippie subculture 
spotlighted by the powerful 1970 "Woodstock" documentary movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock has been an artists' colony since 1902, when Englishman Ralph R. 
Whitehead set up a handicraft community, Byrdcliffe -- which still functions 
under the umbrella of the Woodstock Guild. Over the decades, the community 
developed a reputation as the Greenwich Village of the Catskills. 
</P>
<P>
 A local tradition of summer performing-arts programs, beginning with the 
Maverick Festivals held from 1915 to 1931, inspired popular-music fests in 1967 
and '68 at the Pansy Copeland farm near Woodstock. Meanwhile, powerful music 
manager Albert Grossman had moved to town in the '60s and brought along such 
big-name clients as Bob Dylan and The Band. So the Woodstock name carried the 
proper cachet when Michael Lang and his partners began mapping out the 1969 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no outdoor settings around Woodstock itself were suitable for a mass 
musical camp-out. Lang wanted to use the Winston Farm site at Saugerties (the 
same one that has become the Woodstock '94 venue), but local authorities 
wouldn't issue a permit. So the '69 festival wound up near Bethel, bringing the 
Woodstock name with it. The rest is pop-culture history. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're too young to remember hippies, or if you slept like a latter-day Rip 
Van Winkle through the '60s and '70s, Woodstock amounts to a living-history 
village showcasing that nearly vanished social species. Hippiedom still hums 
along Tinker Street, the main drag, although it plays a sometimes dispiriting 
commercial tune -- currently keyed to making some bucks from the upcoming 
Woodstock '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock retail outlets preserve Aquarian names like Crystal Clothing 
Collection, Candlestock, Vedantic Light, Dharmaware, Talisman, the Flying 
Watermelon and Stoned Pieces. Bordering the village green next to Stoned 
Pieces, the sign over Woodstock Pizzeria's doorway turns a guitar into a pizza 
pan, while the pizza itself is sliced to make the ubiquitous peace emblem of 
the Vietnam War era. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinker Street shops are amply stocked with Woodstock '94 T-shirts and other 
festival souvenirs -- all marked "Official Licensee of Woodstock Ventures." 
Typical prices: $10 for a reprint of the original 1969 poster, picturing a dove 
perched on a guitar neck; $15 for a black and white T-shirt imprinted with the 
poster motif; $25 for a tie-dyed T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hustling entrepreneur even made a pitch to Tinker Street's Book Mart 
outlet to stock small bags of "Woodstock soil" from Max Yasgur's farm -- where 
the original Woodstock festival was held -- according to a cheerful clerk who 
sold me a copy of the "Woodstock Festival Remembered" photo book marked up to 
$19.95 from the 1979 cover price of $8.95. 
</P>
<P>
 The local radio station, WDST, styles itself "Radio Woodstock" and operates as 
a promotional vehicle what must be one of the last psychedelically painted 
buses on the planet. One mildly amusing set of postcards sold in Tinker Street 
shops pictures such scenarios as Woodstock Career Counseling: a bearded gent in 
sandals sitting for a Tarot-card reading at a folding table under a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway between Woodstock and Saugerties to the east, the astonishing Opus 40 
environmental sculpture rises from an abandoned bluestone quarry. Covering six 
acres, the monumental project represents 37 years of work by sculptor Harvey 
Fite, who was fatally crushed by his own truck at the site in 1974. Visitors 
can hike across the sculpture, admiring Fite's stone carvings, and imagine 
themselves part of an ongoing creative work. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugerties, the dateline for Woodstock '94, was a 19th-Century riverboat port 
where Exopus Creek flows into the Hudson. Once renowned for building racing 
sloops, it is a bit tattered around the edges but looks well endowed with 
Victorian-gingerbread houses and antiques shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-five miles southwest, the sprawling hamlet of Bethel -- home to 
Woodstock '69 and the Bethel '94 reprise -- looks much in need of an economic 
jump start. That's why businesses like the Bethel Country Store hope for the 
financial success of the festival being planned by old-time New York City 
promoter Sid Bernstein and backed financially by a wealthy local 
insurance-company family. 
</P>
<P>
 "God only knows we sure need something down here," said store owner Ron 
Hendrickson. "Lots of people will be coming anyway in August. That's why it's 
important that we have something orderly and organized for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel Country Store sells festival T-shirts, while a bus dry-docked on a lawn 
off New York 178 is marketing an array of Woodstock memorabilia and gewgaws. 
The collectibles range from framed color photographs of the original festival 
to $3 cans of 25th-anniversary Woodstock Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors who make their way on country roads outside town to the old Yasgur 
property, now owned by another family, find an expanse of green farmland 
naturally contoured to serve as an amphitheater. A monument erected at one 
corner of the farm in 1984 proclaims: "This is the original site of the 
Woodstock Music and Arts Fair, held on Aug. 15, 16, 17, 1969." 
</P>
<P>
 The motifs of dove and guitar neck are sculpted on the monument, above two 
plaques that bear the names of the festival's onstage performers including: 
Richie Havens, Arlo Guthrie, Joan Baez, Joe Cocker, Ravi Shankar, Janis Joplin, 
Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Winter, Creedence Clearwater, Mountain, Santana, John 
Sebastian, The Who, Canned Heat, Grateful Dead, Sly & the Family Stone, 
Jefferson Airplane, The Band, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Blood, Sweat and 
Tears, Melanie and Sweetwater. If you peruse the names and can remember all 
their acts, you will probably feel older than you'd like to feel. And on a hot 
summer afternoon, you'll be grateful for a cooling slug of Woodstock Cola.

in Saugerties, N.Y. Its organizers include Michael Lang, a prime mover in the 
1969 Woodstock Music and Arts Fair, with major financial backing provided by 
the entertainment conglomerate PolyGram. 
</P>
<P>
 The announced lineup of performers ranges from heavy-metal rockers Metallica 
and rap group Cypress Hill to the perennial Johnny Cash and folk icon Bob Dylan 
(who did not appear at the original festival). The only 1969 alumni on the 
program are Joe Cocker, Santana and the first three-fourths of Crosby, Stills, 
Nash & Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets, available through Ticketmaster in New York at $135 per person for the 
2 1/2-day event, must be purchased in blocks of four and come with one parking 
pass. Ticket-holders will be shuttled to the concert site by bus; rail and air 
packages are also available. (Ticketmaster: 212-307-7171.) 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Woodstock '94 hot line, (212) 765-1994, although the number is 
often busy or does not answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel '94, Aug. 13-14 on the same spot as the 1969 festival, will include 
such veterans of the '69 festival as Richie Havens, Melanie and John Sebastian. 
For information, Sullivan County Office of Public Information, (800) 882-2287. 
Tickets cost $95, can be purchased through Ticketmaster in New York and include 
camping and parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Although tickets are still available for both festivals, many 
hotels and B&Bs in the area have already been booked, either by festival 
promoters or as part of tour packages, and many have substantially raised 
prices -- in some cases doubling them during the festival weekend -- according 
to local sources. Since area roads will be closed and parking will be limited, 
as will entry and exit access to the festival, package trips and on-site 
camping will be the best idea for many travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Sullivan County resorts that still had rooms, as of press time, are the 
1,225-room Concord and the 400-room Kutsher's -- famous as survivors from the 
"Borscht Belt" era, when the Catskills prospered as one of the centers of East 
Coast vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kutsher's Country Club, Montecello, N.Y. 12701; rates start at about $90 per 
person, per night, including meals; (914) 794-6000. 
</P>

 Concord Resort Hotel, Kiamesha Lake, N.Y. 12751; $240-300 per person, per 
night, including meals; (800) 431-3850 or (914) 794-4000. 
</P>
<P>

DESTINATION: HAWAII; NO CRYING OVER SPILLED SPAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE PAGET and SUSAN PAGET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dinner we've been dreading all day is on the boil. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of camping we've hit the bottom of our food supply and it's time 
to -- drum roll please -- crack the Spam. 
</P>
<P>
 We've mixed Spam, Hawaii's favorite mystery meat (for whatever reason, Hawaii 
is the No. 1 consumer in the United States) with two cans of tomato paste and a 
bag of pasta in the hope of making something that resembles spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a pretty sight. In fact, it's downright scary: pale pink chunks and 
limp white noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 The meal might be hard to swallow, but who cares. The kitchen is superb. 
</P>
<P>
 On the south coast of Hawaii's private island, Lanai, we've pitched our tents 
on the manicured lawn at Hulopoe Beach Park. Our "front yard" is a showpiece 
beach with soft white sand, palm trees and a blue bay that teems with spinner 
dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever made this place did a good job," Henri, 7, concludes staring out 
across the cove. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanai is in the middle of a make-over. Shedding its image as the world's No. 1 
pineapple producer, the tiny speck of an island is making a name for itself as 
a chic getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 When we landed at the small but modern Lanai Airport, we were the only 
backpackers among a dozen tourists bound for the island's two resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 While they step onto a white resort shuttle bus, we hitch a $20 ride with cab 
driver Helene Ozua. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pick you up in an hour," Helene offers, dropping us off to buy supplies in 
the only town on the island, Lanai City. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall Norfolk pine trees tower above the streets, which are lined with small 
timber homes. At Richard's Market, across from Dole Park, we buy delicious 
bread made with pineapple cider. 
</P>
<P>
 Just up the street is the local cop shop and jail -- a rundown wooden shack 
with big padlocks on the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This jail is embarrassing; tourists want to take pictures," says former LAPD 
officer Dick Millar, who now works the less stressful beat of the LPD (Lanai 
Police Department). "But we haven't had any escapes from here," he says 
grinning. "Where are they gonna go?" 
</P>
<P>
 The resort shuttles are continually running through town and our cab follows 
one south to our campsite at Hulopoe Beach Park, right next to the Manele Bay 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 At dusk, a trail of flaming torches shine above a path from the beach to an 
expansive swimming pool below the resort's main lobby. Inside, there is a rich 
collection of Asian artifacts and paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get really jealous when we stay next to places like this," Henri says 
candidly, as we walk back to our tents. So do we. 
</P>
<P>
 While resort rooms start at more than $200, the good life comes cheap for 
campers -- just $5 a person, per night through the Lanai Co. (There are only a 
few camping sites, so we took no chances and booked two weeks in advance.) 
</P>
<P>
 With no rental car we're stuck at the beach, which suits us fine until 
Presley, 1, runs out of diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, campers aren't supposed to use the hotel shuttles, but it's the 
most obvious way to get into town. Wearing our cleanest shirts and shorts, we 
hop on board. Can we make it to town without being revealed? How long before 
Henri and Matilda blow our cover? 
</P>
<P>
 A mile into the bus ride a woman across the aisle starts up a conversation 
with fateful words: "Are you staying at the Manele Bay?" 
</P>
<P>
 To lie or not to lie? 
</P>
<P>
 "Er, uh . . . no we're camping," we splutter. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowded bus's chatter stops in mid-sentence. Everyone is listening to this 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is your tent the blue one?" a man yells from the front row. "That's us," we 
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired couple in the back smile knowingly. "We camped all over Europe with 
our children when they were little," the lady says, "and now that they're 
through with college we can go to nice places like this and enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 With or without a resort room key, Hulopoe Beach is a treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 One of our favorite spots is a tide pool the size of a swimming pool, blasted 
out of lava rock in the '50s so that the local keiki (children) would have a 
place to swim without waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Our 5-year-old, Matilda, has a fear of getting in over her head in the ocean 
but in this little grotto she finally gathers up enough courage to try on a 
pair of goggles and a snorkel. 
</P>
<P>
 A school of inch-long yellow-and-black-striped fish, convict tangs, dart into 
a palace of coral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahhh . . . ooohhh . . . fishies," Matilda gasps with unbridled excitement, 
peering into a whole new world. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the campsite our pot of Spam-etti looks like something from another 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie and Harvey Miller, a couple of resort guests from Los Angeles, who we 
met a week ago on the beach, walk over to our "kitchen" to see what's for 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 We wave hi, taking our eyes off the meal for a split second. The pot wobbles 
and then tips and crashes at the Millers' feet. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come eat at the hotel," Leslie says, cringing at the mess on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a second thought we throw our resort attire over swimsuits, and race 
up the trail for a Jacuzzi and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing by the pool we split two $12 burgers and fries between the five of 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahhh . . . paradise on a budget.

 Mexico: An American Mormon missionary and five Mexican friends were kidnaped 
and held for 10 hours near the city of Puebla, southeast of Mexico City, U.S. 
diplomats report. Their four armed captors apparently intended at first to hold 
them for $15,000 ransom but released them unharmed early the next morning. In 
Guadalajara, a powerful car bomb exploded in front of the upscale Camino Real 
Hotel on June 11, killing at least two people and injuring several others, 
according to the U.S. Consulate. The bomb may have been set by a drug gang 
targeting its rivals at a hotel party. In troubled southeastern Chiapas state, 
U.S. officials report an increase in roadblocks set up by both guerrillas and 
the military in recent weeks. Some travelers, including British and American 
tourists, have been stopped by guerrillas who demand a "donation" from each.

 Greece: Travelers flying to Greece this summer are in for long airport delays, 
the Greek Transport Ministry warns. The ministry blames the delays on heavy 
seasonal traffic; an average of 10,000 passengers have crowded the Athens 
airport each day, with many of the 600 or so incoming and outgoing flights 
backed up for two to four hours. Other factors, according to the Reuters news 
service, are labor problems and outmoded equipment. Air traffic controllers are 
refusing to work overtime during the peak season, when Athens air traffic jumps 
30%. The controllers attribute some of the delay to what they call an 
inadequate, 20-year-old control tower radar system. Anyone planning a flight to 
Athens should obtain up-to-date information on conditions at the airport. Asia

 South Korea: With recent tension on the Korean peninsula and uncertainty 
following the death of North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung, some employees of 
American companies in South Korea have sent their families home. But the State 
Department has issued a statement saying it sees no need to warn Americans 
against traveling or staying there. "Taking all available information into 
account, we do not believe that conditions . . . warrant any special travel 
precautions at present," the department said. If it becomes necessary, the 
statement added, Washington will add South Korea to its list of places where 
Americans might be at risk. Anyone considering travel to South Korea should 
monitor news events closely. Briefly . . .

 Britain: Street crime, including muggings and purse-snatchings, rose by 41% in

Reuters. The report said that the figure is "clearly out of step" with other 
crimes such as burglary, which have decreased dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa: While political violence has lessened in recent months, violent 
crime is unabated, Reuters reports. In Johannesburg, murders rose from 144 in 
April of last year to 251 this past April, according to police officials, who 
indicate that there are 14,000 too few police on the beat in the Johannesburg 
area.

TAKING THE KIDS: WINGING IT WITH CHILD SAFETY SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran United Airlines flight attendant Jan Brown-Lohr doesn't pull punches 
anymore. When she encounters a parent holding a baby who could be strapped into 
a car seat on a nearby empty seat, she matter-of-factly tells the parent her 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown-Lohr was a flight attendant aboard United Flight 232 when it crashed in 
an Iowa cornfield in Sioux City five years ago this month. Among the survivors 
was 11-month-old Sabrina Nicholson who flew out of her mother's grasp, landing 
in an overhead bin 15 rows away. Sabrina only lived because a passenger, 
fleeing the plane, heard her cries and rescued her. Another baby was among 111 
passengers who died. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't think it's going to happen to them," said Brown-Lohr, 
herself a mother of three. "That's what we're up against. And we're not doing 
our best for the little people who can't protect themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since that horrible summer day, the issue of restraining young children 
on planes -- which means parents must purchase tickets for them -- has been 
hotly debated. Brown-Lohr and her union, the Flight Attendants Assn., have been 
tireless crusaders for legislation that would require children under 2, who 
ride free on U.S. airlines, to have their own airline seat and to be buckled up 
in a car seat approved for aircraft use. 
</P>
<P>
 Airline officials say as many as 10,000 babies and toddlers are flying every 
day -- more than 36 million a year, most without tickets and, therefore, 
without their own seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But legislation to restrain them, thus far opposed by the Federal Aviation 
Administration, remains bogged down in Congress, despite support from the 
National Transportation Safety Board, the Aviation Consumer Action Project, the 
Air Transport Assn. and the Airline Pilots Assn. An FAA spokesman said a new 
policy statement on the issue will come later this summer with the conclusion 
of more research. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA recommends that infants be secured during takeoff and landings, but 
the agency has been unwilling to mandate the policy, arguing that the cost of 
purchasing tickets for young children would drive parents away from air travel 
and onto statistically more dangerous highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters scoff at the logic and speculate that such a measure would likely 
spur airlines to create more discounted fares for families. Parents don't quit 
flying once children are too old to fly free, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If parents knew the risk they were taking, they wouldn't tolerate this for 
five minutes," said Washington Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, co-sponsor of the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it just the remote chance of being in a plane crash. "We have kids 
injured every day when turbulence hits," said Jo Deutsch, chief lobbyist for 
the 33,000-member Association of Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have the option right now of purchasing a ticket for a young child and 
carrying the car seat on board. Make sure it is stamped with a label specifying 
that it is "certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives Unsoeld and Lightfoot urge parents to use car seats and to 
voice their opinion on the issue to the FAA and to their U.S. representatives 
and senators (call the FAA at 800-FAA-SURE or the House and Senate at 
202-224-3121). 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA is expected to release a study later this summer that questions the 
safety of using many standard car seats on aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 First the good news that is of no surprise: After simulating crash conditions, 
the study clearly shows that children 20 pounds or less are far safer secured 
in a rear-facing infant car seat than on a parent's lap. "Absolutely infants 
are better off in a seat," said Van Gowdy, who conducted the research at the 
FAA's Oklahoma City-based Civil Aeromedical Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 But standard front-facing car seats appeared problematical in this study. 
"Their performance in airplane seats is not the same as in cars," he said. 
Gowdy explained that forward-facing seats for toddlers and preschoolers 
weighing 20 to 40 pounds caused injuries because they couldn't be anchored 
tightly enough to the seats to prevent the child's head from hitting the seat 
in front of him. Booster seats, which are backless, cannot protect a child from 
a seat that collapses forward. He suggested that car seat design be modified 
for effective airline use.

 "Bear Country," by Nancy Thompson (June 19), painted a faithful picture of a 
beautiful part of Southern England where my wife and I spent the first years of 
our married life -- an area we frequently revisit. There is so much else close 
by that one could write pages on the subject.However, as she mentions the 
restored steam railway, the famous Blue Bell Line, she should also mention the 
superb National Trust Garden almost opposite, Sheffield Park. The town of 
Haywards Heath, on the main rail line to Brighton, is an equally good starting 
point for excursions, although Tunbridge Wells is more interesting.

 I read the story about "Bear Country," about the Forest of Winnie-the-Pooh and 
how you can visit Poohsticks Bridge, Owl's house, Hundred Acre Wood and other 
enchanted places in East Sussex. 
</P>
<P>
 I am 13, and I considered "Winnie-the-Pooh" as a childhood memory (it's still 
my favorite book, although I'd rather not tell my whole school), but when I 
read the article, I could just imagine myself playing Poohsticks! My mother 
said we might go there someday (we are originally from Russia, lived in France, 
and that's where my grandmother lives, so we often go to Europe). With your 
description, I can't wait to go.

 Regarding "Norway's Magnetic North" (June 12): I do not know why the Los 
Angeles Times touts Norway as a travel destination when, for the second year in 
a row, Norway is whaling on minke whales (smallest baleen whale), in violation 
of the 1986 moratorium on whaling and despite universal censure. Lofoten should 
not be a tourist destination until Norway ceases whaling.

 Regarding "Hidden Gems on the Italian Riviera" (June 26): The 15-minute walk 
from Riomaggiore to Manorola on the Via dell'Amore, a narrow path cut right 
into the rock cliff, is as glorious as one can imagine. And by the way, your 
map was wrong. According to my journal (and Michelin's Tourist Guide), from the 
south it is Riomaggiore, Manorola and then Corniglia.

RETHINKING IMMIGRATION: INTENT MUST SHAPE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In many ways, the debate over the "Save Our State" initiative could better be 
described as the "Same Old Stuff." Although the share of foreigners in the 
total U.S. population is only half of what it was at the turn of the century, 
the Draconian initiative demonstrates that, in times of economic stress, 
immigrants still serve as convenient scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, advocates of legal immigration should not neglect the legitimate issues 
raised by SOS. To that end, they need to determine the intent of new immigrants 
and how that affects their adopted communities. Short of that, the immigration 
debate will continue to be waged in a rhetorical fog. 
</P>
<P>
 From a policy point of view, the question of intent divides immigrants into 
two classes. The first, and probably the vast majority, seeks to become 
citizens and integrate into the mainstream of American society. The second, 
mostly illegal, consists of temporary sojourners whose interest is to make 
enough money here to return home in improved circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of intent transcends the current, virtually actuarial debate over 
the economic effects of illegal immigration. After all, studies on both sides 
can argue, with varying degrees of persuasiveness, the relative 
dollars-and-cents merits of this generation of illegal immigrants. Instead, the 
focus should be on the probable long-term consequences of large numbers of 
undocumented, unassimilated people in the midst of an already highly charged 
multiracial society. 
</P>
<P>
 This means addressing forthrightly the issue of legality. Most immigration 
advocates seem reluctant to do this. To a large extent, their reticence is a 
response to the broad-brush attacks of nativists. Not surprisingly, a New York 
Times/CBS News poll last summer revealed that 68% of all Americans thought most 
immigrants were here illegally. In truth, there is only about one illegal 
immigrant for every three permanent legal newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally disappointing is the immigration activists' failure to acknowledge the 
critical differences between potential citizens and sojourners. Accepting 
illegality as a quasi-permanent and legitimate condition is tantamount to 
tolerating the creation of a "parallel society," in which immigrants stay, 
usually for economic reasons, for a prolonged period without ever being 
expected to become full-fledged members of the larger society. 
</P>
<P>
 The embryo of such a "parallel society" exists in Europe, where large numbers 
of immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East live in a kind of 
non-citizen nether world. Considered virtually unassimilable by many Europeans, 
they are a source of growing urban unrest as well as easy targets for far-right 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Americans, large populations of illegal immigrants and growing 
separatist tendencies among ethnic minorities presage a similar scenario here. 
Their anxieties are stoked when the legitimacy of citizenship is challenged by 
immigrant advocates who suggest that states such as California are little more 
than "stolen" provinces from Mexico and thus have no moral claim to control 
their borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressing cultural separateness rather than the traditional integrationist 
model also contributes to the rise of an parallel society. This is most evident 
in attempts to institutionalize publicly funded bilingual education. Initially 
designed to accelerate the learning of English, bilingual education is 
increasingly used as an agent of "reinforcing ethnic identity," according to 
one education official in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The final step toward creation of a parallel society is the contention that 
voting rights should be extended to immigrants on issues that most directly 
affect them, such as who runs the school board. This approach dramatically 
departs from a tradition that has worked remarkably well over the generations: 
Most private ethnic, cultural and religious organizations have defined their 
primary mission not as promoting "group rights" but as easing the entry of 
newcomers into the broader linguistic, political and economic mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly important in this regard is public education. In the past, public 
schools were not expected to serve as incubators of ethnic identity but as 
training grounds to prepare youngsters for a successful life within the 
predominant, English-speaking society. During the last great wave of 
immigration, public education did yeoman's work in helping the children and 
grandchildren of Calabrian paisanos or refugees from Eastern European shtetls 
match and then overcome students whose families had been resident here for 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although today's realities are different in many respects, most available 
evidence suggests that the bulk of immigrants are willing and eager to become 
assimilated. This is especially true of children. More than two-thirds of 
immigrant children living in San Diego, and greater than four-fifths of them in 
South Florida, prefer English to their parental or any other foreign language, 
according to a recent study of census data by sociologists Ruben Rumbaut and 
Alejandro Portes. More than 90% of them possess "very high" knowledge of 
English. Generally speaking, their survey revealed that most immigrant children 
want to succeed in mainstream society, with three-quarters aspiring to careers 
as professionals or business people. 
</P>
<P>
 When intent is factored in, the differences in academic performance can be 
startling. Asian immigrants, including Indochinese, have an extraordinarily 
high propensity to become citizens and integrate into the mainstream society. 
Their children routinely outperform native-born students, often by wide 
margins, and spend more time on homework. By contrast, many Latinos, whether 
from Central America, the Caribbean or Mexico, often see themselves more as 
sojourners than future Americans and look forward to returning to their 
countries of origin. Their children's academic records tend to be average to 
below average. 
</P>
<P>
 These kinds of differences underscore the need for the immigration debate to 
become more sensitive to the intentions of immigrants as a key factor in 
shaping policy. In short, newcomers who ultimately seek to become citizens 
should be treated differently from those who plan to eventually return to their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, perhaps the most vexing and difficult changes in policy would 
involve access to public services. Expansion of welfare benefits to newly 
naturalized Americans represents one of the most potent issues in the quiver of 
nativists, who seek to parley newcomer dependency on welfare into closed 
borders, even to legal migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Tightening legal immigrants' eligibility for welfare and social benefits is 
one way to deal with this problem. Or, to take another case, the citizen 
sponsors of parents and relatives who wish to come here would have to agree to 
assume some responsibility for their care. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of sojourners, restrictions on access to public services should be 
more severe. As essentially "guest workers," their residency should be 
exclusively tied to their employment status and their employers made 
responsible for their medical as well as education needs. This would encourage 
the migration of younger workers -- if there is a demonstrated need -- and 
discourage that of workers whose contributions are minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such reforms, the picture of the border would change. For one thing, 
strict enforcement, such as is now in place in El Paso, would be a 
prerequisite. But, more important, the expansion of a kind of "guest worker" 
program would leave prospective illegal migrants a legal, and respectable, 
alternative in finding work inside the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Making such distinctions between sojourners and long-term immigrants with 
ambitions to become citizens will not be easy or particularly pleasant. But if 
those who believe in immigration do not soon gain the courage to make such 
distinctions, we can expect an ever less sympathetic public response to the 
addition of newcomers to our society.*

THE TRAUMATIC BIRTH OF HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Phillips, Kevin Phillips, publisher of American Political Report, is 
the author of The Politics of Rich and Poor. His new book, Arrogant Capital: 
Washington, Wall Street and the Frustration of American Politics, will be 
published in September. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The collapse of Bill Clinton's far-reaching blueprint for a 
government-orchestrated national health program into much lesser legislation 
can be described best as: a) a historic achievement, nonetheless; b) a tragedy 
for the middle class; c) so much of a political face-saver that we'd be better 
off starting over, or d) all the above? 
</P>
<P>
 Take your time, because economists and historians will be debating this for 
years. But "all the above" does have a certain resonance. Important legislation 
may still be enacted. But, even so, Clinton's initial commitment to 
comprehensive health-care reform will go down as a major strategic 
miscalculation -- perhaps the biggest since Jimmy Carter declared the energy 
challenge was the moral equivalent of war (only to learn it wasn't, and that 
the acronym was "MEOW"); and since George Bush told voters, "Read my lips, no 
new taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 As for whether this presidency, too, is failing, there are reasons to worry 
about fundamental flaws in Clinton's style of governing: his press-the-flesh, 
eager-to-please, people-oriented style is not suited to effective U.S. or world 
leadership; and his co-presidency with wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, which has 
so much staked on health reform, may already be crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 While potential face-saving compromises are still in the offing, few observers 
still believe that Clinton has a major historic or political triumph on the 
horizon. The real question -- reinforced by the nation's deepening 
disillusionment with the original Clinton plan -- is whether Congress wouldn't 
be better off starting over next year instead of passing a patchwork mishmash 
that may still contain critical flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider how five major circumstances explain why the Clinton blueprint was 
flawed from the start and why any patchwork compromise is also risky: 
</P>
<P>
 * Biting Off Too Big a Chunk of the Economy. As his reforms unfolded last 
year, Clinton paid too little attention to economic history. Between 1980 and 
1992, the health sector's share of U.S. gross national product mushroomed from 
8% to 15%. The only parallels to this were the growth of railroads in the 
decades after the Civil War and the rise of the huge U.S. aerospace and defense 
complex during and after World War II. And no Washington whiz-bang ever tried 
to reshape those two with grand national legislation at the peak of their 
power. The U.S. economy is too complex.  
</P>
<P>
 So huge was the health sector's rise in the early 1990s that health was 
frequently providing 10% to 40% of quarterly GNP growth. In Pittsburgh, health 
replaced steel as the biggest employer; and in economically crippled Southern 
California, health was one of the few sectors adding jobs. Trying to stop 
ballooning health-sector inflation was important, but Clinton simply tried to 
reform too big a chunk of the economy by government fiat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expanding Social-Welfare Programs in an Era of Welfare State Decline. Here's 
a second strategic flaw. By 1993, the health component of the welfare state was 
in retreat from Australia to Canada to Western Europe. Weak economies could no 
longer afford their existing health-care burdens, and new benefits could only 
be added at the cost of curbing others. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, health was turning into a zero-sum game. Somehow, the President 
failed to grasp two essential points: first, that with the welfare state 
shrinking in most Western nations, the health-care proposal involved the 
equivalent of going up a down staircase; and second, in virtually none of these 
nations were health-care issues helping the incumbent government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fallibilities of Clinton's Own Leadership. The new President also brought a 
crippling personal predilection to the health debate. In the past, his method 
for success was a high-octane mixture of high intelligence and expert people 
skills -- his warm and personal touch in "retail politics." This allowed him to 
be a successful big fish in the little pond of Little Rock, despite a tendency 
for disorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton didn't know grand strategy, because he didn't have to -- in small 
Southern states, politics is a matter of personality and networking. His 
success had always been in thinking tactically -- short-term, quick deal-making 
as opposed to long-term strategy in pursuit of far-ranging goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a U.S. President must be a big fish in a big pond, voters had 
previously declined to elect anyone from one of the nation's smallest states -- 
not since Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire in 1852. Unfortunately, Clinton's 
Little Rock little pondsmanship gave him an arrogant belief in his own skills 
and charm that turned out to be misleading when it came to national affairs and 
issues. Miscalculations have flourished. 
</P>
<P>
 A second unfortunate Arkansas hangover is that Clinton also thought he could 
re-establish in Washington the sort of co-rulership with his wife that they 
carried out in their Arkansas web of governing and politicking. Health care was 
to be the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deepening Middle-Class Frustration. Clinton's July insistence that his broad 
health-care reform package was the last, best hope of the middle class was 
destined not to be believed. When he first announced his plan, polls showed a 
majority of the middle class supported it -- but not a large majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had played up to the middle class at every rhetorical opportunity 
during the 1992 campaign, but his broken tax commitments -- no middle-class tax 
cut as promised, combined with a major energy-tax proposal and hints of payroll 
and consumption levies to come -- cost him credibility by mid-1993. When 
Clinton held back financial details in announcing his health-reform plan, 
skeptical middle-class voters, already burned once, withheld support. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the man from Arkansas didn't fully understand what he himself had 
argued in his campaign. The middle class was hurting so much -- and in most of 
the other Western nations, not just the United States -- that it distrusted 
politicians' blandishments that a new social-welfare program would ease burdens 
rather than add to them. Moreover, Clinton's own image was eroding on moral as 
well as legislative grounds. By the end of June, a national survey by the Times 
Mirror Corp. found only 32% of Americans supported Clinton's blueprint. The 
middle class didn't believe his program would pass without major revision -- 
and didn't want it to. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intensifying Interest-Group Politics. The final flaw in Clinton's plan to 
enact a sweeping national health-insurance program lay in the way he himself 
encouraged the role of interest groups in Washington. Clinton had railed 
against interest groups in 1992, but almost as soon as he arrived in the 
nation's Capital, he started hobnobbing with prominent lobbyists, cutting 
legislative deals and soliciting contributions -- just as he had back in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House cut deal after deal with big corporations -- tailoring 
portions of the 1993 budget and tax bill to their liking in order to get it 
enacted. More bargains were made to enact the North American Free Trade 
Agreement in November. The message to Gucci Gulch -- the half-mile concrete 
canyon of lawyers and lobbyists offices along Washington's K Street -- was 
simple: This President deals, he wants your campaign contributions for the 
Democratic Party and he has already lost his clean hands and moral ability to 
declare war on interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Such perceptions were crippling in the battle for a national health-reform 
program: Health-related groups with representatives in Washington had ballooned 
from 150 in the late 1970s to almost 800 by 1992 -- the medical equivalent of 
the Maginot Line. Interest-group clout would help stymie Clinton's proposal, 
especially once public opinion began to shift away from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the five converging circumstances took Clinton's quest for a 
sweeping national health program and chopped it down to size for the 
disillusioned, low-budget '90s. He can now claim an achievement if reform is 
passed this year that forces the insurance companies to make health insurance 
available to everyone and consolidates some recent gains in bringing 
health-care costs under greater control. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton has lost his chance for what his strategists talked about last 
autumn: health-care overhaul and creation of a new citizen entitlement to stand 
with Social Security of the mid-1930s in legislative and political 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 New political eras are not built on miscalculations and waffles. But in the 
meantime, there is another possible problem: that Washington politicians -- out 
to save face, save health reform or some of each -- will cobble together a 
compromise that is worse than nothing because it includes gimmicks and 
deceptions for which we will all pay by the year 1998, 2000 or 2006. In this 
summer of shrinking expectations, guarding against that kind of compromise may 
be the political system's foremost responsibility.*

MEXICAN FOOD: FILLING LONELINESS OF AMERICAN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Rodriguez, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at the Pacific News Service, 
is the author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beware the burrito! Consider the cheese oozing from the chile relleno! Last 
week, the Center for Science in the Public Interest warned Americans away from 
Mexican food. Devouring that chile relleno is "the equivalent of eating a full 
stick of butter." 
</P>
<P>
 That peasant food can be fattening, that Mexican food is highly caloric, 
should not surprise us. But in America, where 68 million people are on diets, 
in a nation where the Puritan obsession with sex has been replaced with guilt 
about food, it is front-page news that tacos are fattening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Science in the Public Interest is a consumer-advocacy group. 
The CSPI man, on the phone, said there was no intent to pick on Mexico. After 
all, this is the same organization that, earlier this summer, told us about the 
dangers of movie-theater popcorn. And, before that, the CSPI determined that 
Chinese and Italian food are fattening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem is not with Mexican food," the CSPI man says. "The problem is 
what Americans do with Mexican food." The problem, in other words, is with 
Tex-Mex. Or, should I say, LAX-Mex? 
</P>
<P>
 Octavio Paz, the Mexican poet-essayist, wrote about the differing cultural 
assumptions represented by New England pot roast (cooked in its own clear 
juices) and Mexican mole (a topping with the consistency of peanut butter that 
Mexicans like to smear all over their food). Americans have a taste for the 
clean and pure. Mexicans are more easy with all that is messy in life. Mexican 
food is meant to be consumed by a whole table of people. Americans regard food 
as something to feed their individual bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, after the Mexican-American War, Texans concluded that the 
reason Mexico was so quickly defeated was that Mexicans were a "mongrel" race, 
mixed. The Mexican soldier had diluted the strength of his Indian and Spaniard 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a more enduring slur against Mexico than "dirty"? In the recent 
debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, environmentalists were 
always reminding us about Mexican pollution. (Do you want to be married to 
that?) For a longer time, U.S. tourists have warned one another: Be careful of 
the salads in Mexican restaurants and stay away from the water! Do not sing in 
the shower! 
</P>
<P>
 Dirty Mexico, of course, is also Catholic, tolerant of human failure and, 
therefore, cynical. ("Ah, senor, every man needs his whore.") On the U.S-Mexico 
border, there long ago developed a paradoxical marriage of cultures: Protestant 
hypocrisy met Catholic cynicism in dusty towns such as Tijuana. Whatever was 
illegal in San Diego (gambling, booze, sex) was available for dollars in 
Mexico. Both sides denied it in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, on weekends, U.S. teen-agers drive into Mexico. From El Cajon and 
La Jolla they come. At a time when it's possible to get cocaine in San Diego, 
get an abortion or a six-pack, Americans still flock south. As one teen-ager 
from San Diego said to me: "It's cool to get drunk in Mexico!" 
</P>
<P>
 The CSPI report on Mexican food was not concerned with moral questions. It was 
only prompted by the fact that Americans are eating in more and more Chinese, 
Italian and Mexican restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 The American appetite is moving down the great European continent, drifting 
south from Germany and France to Italy. And Americans are venturing toward 
non-European climes -- learning chop sticks and Latin spices. In California, 
where our borders are not holding, there is an even more interesting 
development, mixed-race cuisine. Down the block is a restaurant that features 
Chinese-Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 A skinhead I know hates Mexicans -- but loves tacos. While blue-rinsed 
grannies and inept politicians are marching under the SOS (Save Our State) 
banner, demanding firmer borders, Americans are switching from ketchup to 
salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, all around Los Angeles, people started noticing that the famous 
blond city was becoming noticeably Asian and overwhelmingly Latino. Suddenly, 
Angelenos were collecting Santos . Everyone had a cactus in their front room 
and people in the chic canyons were painting their bedrooms in garish Mexican 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are also becoming travelers. Like the ancient travelers along the 
spice routes, they are tasting new foods even before they know the words to 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 At the forefront of the craze for Mexican food in the last two decades have 
been yuppies. Trained to pursue individual success from birth, they are also 
the Americans who have taught the rest of us in this Puritan country about 
leisure. If yuppies are solitary and Calvinist in their work habits, they also 
seek out the crowded singles bar at night. 
</P>
<P>
 All over America, the college-educated -- the buffed and the pretty -- sit 
drinking the coffees of Italy. Oddly enough, Seattle, that gray-white city, 
gets credit for the new coffee houses and the dark Colombian blends. In fact, 
all that the bland Northwest did was to give Americans bright, clean rooms in 
which to savor the dark brew of the Cappucine monks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cross Over the Border" urges the ad for Taco Bell. Before middle-class 
Americans ventured to the border, yuppies transformed gritty Tex-Mex and made 
it upper-middle-class LAX-Mex. All over the world, in "Mexican" restaurants 
from Tokyo to Calgary, the look of the place, the amiable noisiness, the chic 
of the place, is not Mexican but LAX-Mex. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Puritans at the Center for Science in the Public Interest are 
concerned about none of this. Nutritionists, consumer advocates -- they are 
obsessed with counting calories. They cannot describe the hunger in the 
American soul for foods that violate borders and lead us far from American 
loneliness.*

THE WORLD; FOR NORTH KOREA'S RULING ELITE, ALL ROADS MAY LEAD TO DOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert A. Manning, Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Progressive 
Policy Institute, is a former State Department adviser on Asian policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the two weeks since the death of North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung, it 
seems we have swung from fears of nuclear Armageddon to "All My Children." 
Speculation on what really makes Kim Jong Il tick, and gossip about reputed 
palace intrigue between him and his stepmother, half-brother and uncle, have 
dominated assessments of North Korea. It is great fun -- and mostly beside the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not Kim Jong Il is a Scotch-swilling playboy hooked on Daffy Duck 
cartoons, a ruthless terrorist or a cool technocrat -- or all the above -- 
there are certain political and economic imperatives driving North Korean 
behavior that offer a more useful framework for understanding what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 It is these larger issues, the interplay between North Korean political 
dynamics and efforts to resolve the nuclear issue that will shape the answer to 
the $64,000 question: Is North Korea now more or less likely to agree to a deal 
ending its nuclear-weapons program? Will the new regime in Pyongyang reprocess 
the fuel rods sitting in cooling ponds and obtain enough plutonium to make four 
or five nuclear bombs? Or will it cooperate in the disposal of the rods? 
</P>
<P>
 So far, events have not been revealing. The funeral and transition have 
seemingly gone according to script. A socialist family dynasty may seem odd, 
but Kim Jong Il is the designated successor to the only leader North Korea has 
known since 1945. Although he lacks the nationalist credibility of his father, 
Kim Jong Il is the principal source of what shreds of political legitimacy 
remain in North Korea. Any clique seeking power would almost certainly have to 
operate in his name, at least in the first months following the transition. 
Indeed, the range of possibilities runs from Kim Jong Il being a mere 
figurehead of a coalition of party-bureaucratic-military forces to being its 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The dictator's death has not altered Pyongyang's basic problems: a failing 
political system; an economy that has grown roughly 5% in the last four years; 
a population asked to eat only two meals a day; desertion of its longstanding 
allies, Moscow and Beijing, and isolation from the information age and East 
Asian economic miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nuclear issue remains the determining factor. The powers-that-be in 
North Korea face the same grim choices: They can continue their nuclear-weapons 
program and face even greater isolation, U.N. sanctions and almost certain 
collapse; or they can trade their nuclear ambitions in for a package of 
political and economic engagement with the United States and the broader 
international community. The latter course would require the most totalitarian, 
hermetically sealed society on Earth to open up, thus jeopardizing the 
political futures of the leaders who would take that road. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite its frequent characterization as a "crazy state," North Korea may 
be more rational than commonly thought. The elite of Kim Jong Il's generation 
appear perplexed about which course to follow. Diplomatically, they play a 
terrible hand quite brilliantly. After all, for two years, they have danced 
diplomatic circles around Washington, defying the non-proliferation regime with 
impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, in moves associated with Kim Jong Il, even as the nuclear drama 
unfolded, Pyongyang devised new foreign-investment, tax and foreign-currency 
laws and established Chinese-style special economic zones. Their objective is 
to lure foreign capital and technology to revive the moribund economy without 
risking political control. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, efforts to attract outside investment have had few takers. But that 
Pyongyang is toying with reform, however haltingly, suggests two things: they 
are listening to advice from Beijing, and some segments of the elite are aware 
of their system's failings.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the regime has not adopted internal market incentives or 
loosened control over the economy, as have China and Vietnam. Pyongyang has 
been equally unwilling to relax its hold on information: Although South Korean 
companies would be prime candidates to invest in the North, there are no direct 
commercial-phone or mail services between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 It is certainly arguable that improving the living conditions of the 22 
million North Koreans will be a factor in whatever legitimacy a post-Kim Il 
Sung regime attains. But therein lies the central dilemma confronting 
Pyongyang: If it doesn't open up, it is doomed; if it does open up, it may lose 
political control and suffer an ignominious fate like that of Kim Il Sung's old 
friend Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 What does all this have to do with the nuclear issue? Plenty. If the North is 
unwilling, or unable, to reform and open up, even in a limited way, and begin a 
course of economic interaction with the West, then neither the Clinton 
Administration nor South Korea nor Japan, nor all combined, can ever muster 
enough incentives to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear-weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 The hypotheses swirling around Kim Jong Il will soon be tested by the momentum 
of events: Will he reprocess the fuel rods? How will he respond to a U.S. 
package deal and when U.S.-North Korea negotiators meet Aug. 5 in Geneva? Will 
he hold the North-South summit his father proposed? Until we have answers, do 
what Ronald Reagan once said of the Soviet Union: Trust, but verify.*

THE NATION; DISNEY SHAPES CULTURAL ID THROUGH PARKS AND MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, the headlines about the Walt Disney Co. focused on Chairman Michael 
D. Eisner's recovery from emergency quadruple-heart- bypass surgery and a 
possible fight over who might become president. This business news, however, is 
obscuring a more fundamental cultural point about Disney that affects us all. 
When it comes to the productions of this company, there is this odd dichotomy 
in American culture: The movies can't win enough praise, while the theme parks 
often arouse so much antagonism they can become a source of congressional 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 It's happened again this summer as "The Lion King" -- riding the usual wave of 
adulation -- is dominating the box office. But Disney's planned Civil War-era 
theme park near Bull Run in Virginia has seemingly aroused the ire of half the 
nation's professional critics and many historians. The problem, of course, is 
that the two aren't really distinguishable in the way the critics suggest. In 
fact, the theme park is only a pale reflection of the process of 
transfiguration that Disney performs in its films. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, what Disney does to history is pretty much what it does to myth -- 
or thinly disguised Shakespeare in the case of "The Lion King" -- and the two 
are inextricably linked as "an image in the public mind," as Walt Disney 
himself once said. 
</P>
<P>
 All these issues about the "Disneyfication" of America we were hearing before 
Eisner's illness, and will hear again, make for nice Op-Ed columns, but were 
really decided decades ago -- as anyone who ever owned a coonskin cap must 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 All writers and producers plunder their mythic and historical sources -- 
Shakespeare had Plutarch and the War of the Roses -- and the Disney assemblage 
is no exception. It's just that Disney's writers have often been so successful 
that they've virtually wiped out the collective memory of the originals. Thanks 
to Disney, there probably isn't a child in America who realizes that in the 
"fairy tale" version of "Snow White," the dwarfs had no names or little 
personality; that nothing like Jiminy Cricket appeared in Collodi's 
"Pinocchio;" that there are no helpful mice in the original "Cinderella," or 
that the Mary Poppins of literary fame wasn't such a softie. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago, a few critics had a field day pointing out that the real Davy 
Crockett "would bear any hardship to escape a routine day's work;" couldn't 
have shot 105 bears in nine months because he "couldn't count that high," and 
"was never king of anything except maybe the Tennessee Tall Tales and Bourbon 
Samplers' Assn." These criticisms so hit the mark that Disney shied away from 
further plundering the past -- so future generations never learned how Johnny 
Tremain, the Swamp Fox, Texas John Slaughter and Zorro were four of the more 
pivotal figures in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite a few dissenting voices, the objections to Disney's cinematic 
permutations have almost always been muted in a chorus of praise. Not so the 
theme parks -- and the Virginia proposal is no exception. Historian David 
McCullough, for example, joined by colleagues such as Shelby Foote and Arthur 
J. Schlesinger Jr., branded the project "an attempt to create synthetic history 
by destroying real history." 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies that what Disney movies do to myth or history, the theme parks 
try to accomplish in more tangible ways. Thus a walking, talking Abraham 
Lincoln greets you in the Disney Hall of Presidents, just as a utopian "Main 
Street" supposedly transports visitors back to the turn of the century of 
Walt's youth. To do that to the issues surrounding the Civil War -- in close 
proximity to the actual battlefields -- is what so disturbs many of the 
project's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt theme parks are proliferating. Led by Disney World, the revenue for 
such parks domestically is now higher than movie box-office figures. The irony, 
of course, is that theme parks do a far less successful job of paving over the 
past than the films do. An air of commercial fantasy pervades these places. 
Because one is always reminded that these are amusement parks, it's impossible 
to suspend a sense of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented without the benefit of much narrative, these attractions are selling 
a physical experience -- which means they inevitably stumble over their own 
technology to deliver a version of history or myth that never quite manages to 
stick with the visitor. After all, what changed the way children thought about 
the winning of the West was the Davy Crockett TV series, not the Mike Fink boat 
ride in Frontierland. And no congressional committee ever dared lay a glove on 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 So the historians and critics have picked the wrong target. As Hollywood has 
always known, film is far more powerful than other media. Because movies and TV 
shows seem so real, screen audiences have always had trouble distinguishing 
what's true from what's fiction -- no matter how hard they try to retain their 
equilibrium. It's a testament to the power of these cinematic images that even 
a cartoon can seem so authentic that it reshapes our impressions of Africa, 
animals or, if it chooses, the War Between the States. Do more people remember 
actual accounts of the Battle of Antietam or Scarlett's escape from Atlanta? 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are tangible and seem somewhat plebeian, theme parks are easier 
targets than movies. Yet, the real threats to a collective memory grounded in 
truth are lurking indoors, projected in the dark. In the long run, the Davy 
Crocketts of the world -- and, yes, even the Simbas -- have far greater power 
to skew that common reality than any ride at Disneyland. Even if they do build 
the next park a few miles from Bull Run.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; DAVID ELLWOOD; THE HARVARD ACADEMIC AT THE CENTER 
OF CLINTON'S WELFARE REFORM PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gayle Pollard Terry, Gayle Pollard Terry is an editorial writer based in 
Washington for The Times. She interviewed the assistant secretary in his office 
at the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton and just about everybody else in Washington want poor 
mothers to get off welfare, stop having babies and go to work. The agreement 
stops there. Republicans and Democrats fight each other and themselves over the 
best way to move people from welfare check to paycheck -- but the fiercest 
battles will rage over who gets the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 David T. Ellwood, a leading architect of the Administration's ambitious remake 
of welfare, is in the eye of this partisan storm. His background -- raised in 
Minneapolis, educated at Harvard, where he stayed on to become a professor and 
academic dean at the John F. Kennedy School of Government -- signals liberal. 
But when he links welfare to work and responsibility, he sounds more like 
Ronald Reagan than Franklin D. Roosevelt, who created Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children in 1935 to help keep widows and their children out of the 
poorhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellwood's passion for welfare reform stems from an examination of teen-age 
unemployment he did in graduate school. He concluded that the problem was more 
than teen-agers without jobs -- it included family structure and poverty. A 
labor economist by academic discipline, he's written much on the subject, 
including the highly respected, "Poor Support: Poverty in the American Family." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington, his theories are not academic. Officially, Ellwood is the 
assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the Department of Health and 
Human Services. He's better known, however, as one of the powerful triumvirate 
that runs the Administration's welfare-reform task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimistic, animated and riveting, Ellwood, 40, lives in a suburb of 
Washington with his wife, Marilyn, also an expert on social policy, and their 
two daughters, Maranda and Andrea. In spite of his proximity to power, or 
perhaps because of it, he has no political ambitions beyond encouraging 
Congress to pass welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Ellwood's deadline on the dole become the law of the land? Only time -- 
and politics -- will tell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How did you get interested in welfare reform?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I grew up in a family where public service was a fundamental part of 
what we did . . . . I believe it's absolutely critical to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems that the country faces in terms of our children, and our future, 
are just terrifying. If we don't find a better way for our families than the 
current welfare system, we're going to lose not only a generation; we're going 
to lose our soul, our country. We've ultimately got to find a better way. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Lose our soul?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We're sending the wrong messages to people about how to create a vital 
future and real hope. The welfare system doesn't reinforce the things that we 
all treasure. It doesn't help people help themselves. Instead, it stigmatizes 
and isolates. It doesn't reward work. It doesn't encourage responsibility. It 
has all the worst kind of messages. We've fundamentally got to find a way where 
we turn that around, and we start reinforcing work and responsibility and 
family and opportunity. That's what's this plan is ultimately all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you change the expectations of a teen-age girl who grew up on 
welfare? Perhaps her mother was on welfare and her grandmother and even her 
great-grandmother?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You start by making very clear that this system is not about permanence. 
It's about a transition. It's about a future. But it's about a future where 
there is work and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 You find ways to send a signal that you shouldn't have children until you're 
in position to nurture and support those children. But if you do have a child, 
then you make very, very clear we're willing to help you. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are very serious responsibilities associated with that not only for 
you but for the father of that child as well. Both parents are going to know, 
if you are a teen-ager, you are going to stay in school. Both parents are going 
to be expected to provide support. And, ultimately, you are going to have to go 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you send that message to a boy who doesn't know who his father is?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You start by trying to make sure that everyone knows that when a child is 
born, we will identify both the mother and the father at birth in the hospital. 
It is a message of hope. It is also a message of responsibility . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For the boys, to the extent they have money, they are going to be expected to 
share it with their children. And, to the extent they don't, we have in the 
plan opportunities for both training and work for young men to help support 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you the father of time limits?  
</P>
<P>
 A: . . . In some ways, the notion that welfare should be transitional is as 
old as recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason time limits are important is that we are in the wrong business. We 
have a welfare system that is basically in the check-writing business. The 
culture of welfare offices is entirely focused on getting people in, asking 
them lots of difficult, painful questions . . . then they write them out a 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 Time limits say to the people in the system, the workers as well as the 
recipients, that this will ultimately come to an end. This is transitional. At 
some point, the expectation is you are going to have to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do deadlines work?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Deadlines are one tool . . . . In addition, what we've done is make sure, 
if you go to work, you can support your family . . . through tax credits, child 
care, health coverage. Health reform is absolutely vital for this whole 
enterprise. Deadlines are one of many things that will make it very clear that 
this system is now about transition, about changing the future from one of 
welfare checks to one of paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do all those jobs come from?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Very large numbers of people now on welfare do go to work but often don't 
stay there. Seventy percent of the people who come on welfare leave within the 
first two years; 90% within the first five. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is a large fraction end up coming back on welfare. That's why 
doing some things outside of the welfare system, like health reform, child care 
and tax credits, are so important to helping people stay off . . . . We're 
providing training and other sorts of supports. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if at the end of two years, someone has done everything they can and 
still can't find a job, then we're committed -- and we have the money in the 
bill to do it -- to providing short-term, temporary, government-subsidized 
jobs, preferably in the private sector, perhaps in the nonprofit or the 
government sector. Jobs so that people can count on some ways to go to work to 
get a paycheck instead of a welfare check. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens at the end of two years to the woman who doesn't cooperate, 
who doesn't follow the rules, who gets thrown off welfare? What happens to her 
kids?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I've talked to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people on welfare. I 
haven't met one who hasn't said, "I really want to go to work. I want to do the 
right thing. I want to move forward. I want to give my children a real future." 
This is not going to be a serious problem so long as we really do provide the 
opportunities for people. 
</P>
<P>
 But if somebody is really unwilling to do anything to support their children, 
and we've given them a job opportunity, that is a family we ought to ask what's 
going on, and what's the proper support for those children. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you optimistic?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm optimistic, partly because the system that we're replacing is so bad. 
It is so hard on people. Everyone dislikes it. The people who hate it the most 
are the people in the welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can Washington deliver?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm very hopeful. Here in Washington, and throughout the country, there is 
a general recognition that the current system has not worked. This 
Administration and members of Congress are committed to doing something that 
isn't just some small piece. It's putting the pieces together, so when people 
go to work, they can make it. And the system is designed to help that happen -- 
and to ensure people really do take responsibility for their lives and get the 
dignity that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Won't politics get in the way?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Politics is always tough, and certainly when you deal with low-income 
issues . . . . But a remarkable consensus is emerging when you look at the 
bills ranging from Rep. (Robert T.) Matsui's through the mainstream Republican 
bills -- they all are trying to change the focus to work. They are all saying 
that both parents ought to have responsibility. They all talk about the notion 
of beginning to really change the system. They all talk about the problems of 
young people and teen-agers. So the gulf between the parties isn't so wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a gap between what you learned at Harvard and what you have 
learned in Washington about welfare reform?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure. Clearly, there are lots of different people involved, lots of points 
of view and lots of things that have to be reconciled. But, in both cases, the 
real issue is people need to spend some time talking to welfare recipients and 
workers, and they'll find they are the ones who are urging welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can Washington translate theory into law?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's a critical question. In Washington, people get very preoccupied with 
passing a bill and getting a law in place when, in fact, the critical thing is 
what will have to happen at the street level, what will happen in every city, 
in every county, in every local office. 
</P>
<P>
 How do we take a system that has, for 60 years, been in the check-writing 
business, that doesn't really try at all to help people help themselves -- and 
turn it around and focus it on really helping people get a paycheck? That's 
going to be extraordinarily tough. The real hard work won't be passing the bill 
-- although that will be plenty hard; it will be then making something really 
work. So that, in the end, this system really is about helping people go to 
work and really encouraging and expecting responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you really believe government can change behavior?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Government can send the right signals. When everyone involved in a system 
is angry and frustrated with it, it's time to change. Government can be part of 
the solution. Right now, it's part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will California be punished because GAIN has already placed people in jobs? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A: California will actually have an easier time than most, because they do 
have a lot of successful programs in place and are moving forward. Indeed, 
we've used the lessons from California. Part of what we want to do is reproduce 
some of the best aspects of the California system nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Washington or Harvard -- which do you prefer?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think you'll have to wait and see, but they're very different 
environments. One place, you think, but you don't get out very much. The other 
place, people are very anxious to act. In the end, what's really important is 
what's going to happen on Main Street.*

BERLUSCONI TRIES TO PULL A FAST ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By a crushing 418-33 vote, the Italian Parliament has nullified a decree by 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi that sought to shield corrupt politicians from 
prosecution. Americans should applaud this vote even if, as we shall explain, 
American applause is constitutionally awkward. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that over the past three years Italy has undergone a 
political cleansing the likes of which no one believed possible and indeed 
scarcely any other democratic country has ever seen. As a result of a 
protracted legal war on bribery, the corrupt Christian Democratic party, which 
had dominated Italian politics since the end of World War II, is in ruins; 
Bettino Craxi, a former prime minister, is a fugitive from justice in North 
Africa, and Berlusconi, a conservative media magnate billing himself as an 
untainted outsider, is his country's unlikely chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent bad news was that Berlusconi seemed more old politics than new 
politics after all. Italy permits the pretrial detention of those charged with 
crime, and the judges most admired for cleaning Italy's political house have 
used this tactic freely. It seems that the experience of detention among common 
criminals induces many a political fat cat to sing like a canary. Berlusconi's 
edict sought to eliminate pretrial detention for a long list of white-collar 
offenses, including, to Italy's dismay, bribery and corruption charges. The 
decree freed some 1,100 detainees overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 To become law permanently, however, Berlusconi's decree required confirmation 
by a Parliament in which his own party does not command a majority. When his 
coalition partners turned against him, he had no alternative but to announce 
the withdrawal of the decree later this week. But Parliament, in a stunning 
rebuke, refused to wait that long. Italy's is a parliamentary form of 
government, and the revolt in Berlusconi's ranks may yet jeopardize his very 
continuation in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The freed detainees may not go immediately back into detention, but Italians 
are clearly relieved that the basic law is back on the books. What makes the 
moment slightly awkward for Americans is that what Berlusconi extended as a 
privilege to some Italians is, for all Americans, a constitutional right. 
Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution guarantees every detained American the right 
to petition for an early hearing at which the government may be compelled to 
show cause for the detention. This "Great Writ" of habeas corpus has been 
called "the most important human right in the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 How then can Americans criticize Berlusconi? They can do so on the ground that 
whatever protections a democratic system offers against unlawful detention must 
be offered to all equally. By extending an "American" right selectively, 
Berlusconi bade fair to wreck Italy's system of justice without going nearly 
far enough to create an Italian version of America's. The Italians had every 
reason to stop him, and we are glad they did.

CAN WOOLSEY PULL IT OFF?; THE CIA: THE AGENCY THAT LIMPED IN FROM THE COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Central Intelligence Agency, concedes its director, R. James Woolsey, 
stands in need of major reform. Its internal culture, especially in the 
Directorate of Operations, its spying arm, too much resembles a kind of 
"fraternity" in which "once you're initiated, you're considered a trusted 
member for life." Such faith in the implicit integrity of those working within 
the same system, as students of modern espionage history will well remember, 
was precisely what allowed Britain's intelligence services to be so deeply 
infiltrated and tragically compromised by the Soviet Union in the 1940s and 
beyond. With the CIA, it was the Aldrich Ames case earlier this year that made 
inevitable the intensive review of how it runs its affairs that, Woolsey now 
promises, will bring about sweeping changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. The skeptics have strong doubts. Among them are Sens. Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.) and John W. Warner (R-Va.), respectively the chairman and ranking 
minority member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Both, no longer having 
confidence in the readiness or the ability of the agency to reform itself from 
within, believe the President should appoint a commission that would evaluate 
the CIA from top to bottom and propose whatever changes it feels are required. 
</P>
<P>
 Commending such an approach is the expected objectivity and absence of 
institutional bias that a panel of presumably experienced and respected 
outsiders could bring to their work. But where there might be an opportunity 
for unbiased scrutiny, there could also surely be risk. The CIA is not, after 
all, the Agriculture Department or the Social Security Administration. It's an 
agency intimately involved in the nation's security and for that reason 
chartered to operate largely in the dark. Would it be in the country's best 
interests if the CIA's most intimate methods were exposed to an investigative 
body whose very appointment would suggest a mandate to find fault? Faults there 
certainly are. But for now at any rate, continued and continually intensified 
oversight by the intelligence committees of Congress seems to us to be 
preferable to a presidential commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey, of course, isn't eager for more intrusive congressional examination. 
Perhaps in hopes of heading off that possibility he has announced that a 
special review board of outsiders would be named to constantly monitor the 
Directorate of Operations and report directly to him. Additionally, he pledges 
to introduce new standards of ethics and accountability, tougher promotion 
standards, tightened access to secrets and greater computer security. 
</P>
<P>
 Are these correctives enough in the wake of the Ames scandal, which saw a 
30-year veteran of the CIA -- from subsequent accounts, a heavy-drinking 
mediocrity -- escape detection as a Soviet spy for more than a decade, 
meanwhile literally flaunting the material fruits of his betrayal? Whether they 
will be enough pretty clearly isn't something the public will be in a position 
to judge independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the adequacy of the reforms something that the CIA alone can be left to 
decide. For that determination, we'll have to trust the congressional 
intelligence committees. If they conclude that the CIA is doing too little to 
clean up its act, it will be time to consider the presidential commission idea.

MTA FARE HIKE, LABOR DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I want to thank the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for buying me a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Word that the MTA will more than double the cost of a one-way ride on the Blue 
Line to $2.35 (July 14) makes the economics of this unavoidably simple. Include 
the 25-cent DASH shuttle bus ride from the Blue Line stop to my office. My 
environmentally and traffic-friendly commute on mass transit under the new fare 
structure will soon cost $2.60 each way: $1,352 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let's see. There is a 1985 Chrysler LeBaron listed in the classified 
section for $975. I could pay for that in under 10 months. Or perhaps I want to 
invest the money saved by avoiding the Blue Line for 18 months. I could buy an 
'82 Buick Regal w/cass. Amortize my cost savings over three or four years . . . 
and the MTA could buy me something really cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there are gasoline, insurance and maintenance to worry about. But think 
of my newfound freedom: to pump my fair share of smog into Southland skies 
while adding to the bottlenecks as yet another lone freeway commuter.

 * The tack that the MTA is taking in solving its present labor dispute with 
bus and trolley drivers is tragic for those passengers that can ill afford the 
already-approved fare increases, and laughable in view of the projected losses 
in ridership.  
</P>
<P>
 If these increases in fares and reductions in ridership and services continue, 
I estimate that by the year 2094 there will be four buses and two trolley cars 
left on the streets of Los Angeles, and the average one-way fare will be 
roughly $768! 
</P>
<P>
 As ridiculous as this may seem, I think I have come up with a solution that 
may be even more ridiculous. Why not slash fares in half, which will result not 
in doubling the ridership but quadrupling it? The only problem that may be 
encountered is what the MTA will do with all the money it will make.

 * Rude behavior does not make for a civilized society, particularly when it is 
displayed from the public officials of the MTA, as chastised by Bill Boyarsky 
in his column (July 17). I ride the bus nearly every day, and rude behavior 
from any bus rider is never accepted. But, I do not believe that the MTA board 
members or their staff would be aware of the code of polite behavior. Their 
rudeness confirms their disrespect of the public, who pay their salaries and 
passed the bond measures for the mass transit bonds which the lobbyists have 
taken full draught of at the open tap of construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
 I seriously doubt they ride the bus with any frequency; perhaps weekly bus 
riding should be a duty of MTA board members and their aides. If they did ride 
the bus they would, hopefully, show more reverence to us bus riders, and also 
see the bus system for its good qualities and faults. Perhaps they would stop 
calling the two uncovered bus benches in the parking lot of Fox Hills mall a 
"Transit Center" and erect stops which show respect for riders, some who can 
afford no other transportation, or others, like myself, who are so concerned 
about the city and air pollution that we leave our cars at home.

 * I wish to respond to Boyarsky's column regarding the conduct of the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board of Directors at a meeting when the 
board voted to raise bus and train fares. Boyarsky was critical of the board's 
public decorum, but it is apparent that the columnist did not attend either of 
the previous two lengthy public hearings the MTA held in April and May on 
possible fare hikes and service cuts in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had, he would have known that the board heard from hundreds of concerned 
citizens, many of whom spoke again at the meeting he did attend. He also would 
have known that the board was attempting, to the best of its ability, to craft 
a fare structure that would impact our riders with as little pain as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot raise fares and expect the public to be happy about it. But the 
public expects the board to come up with a balanced budget -- to resolve a $126 
million shortfall that has been the subject of public debate for nearly one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is far more in touch with our riders than Boyarsky thinks. None of 
us wanted a fare hike. Several board members spent many hours over the last six 
months in committee meetings looking for ways to avoid raising fares. Also, 
over the last year, the authority has cut more than 500 positions, affecting 
the lives of hundreds of our employees and their families during a troublesome 
time of economic uncertainty. We also have slashed spending on many projects, 
actions that reduce opportunities for the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 We have not raised fares in six years -- a feat rarely duplicated by any other 
major carrier. And our fare structure provides a discount mechanism -- the use 
of lower-cost tokens -- which will allow the regular rider to save $4.50 a 
week, or $18 a month over the base cash price, if that patron makes one 
round-trip a day.

DON'T FIRE INDISCRIMINATELY; THE PROBLEM WITH A SIMPLE-MINDED 
BRING-A-GUN-AND-YOU'RE-OUT SCHOOL POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fatal shooting of Demetrius L. Rice in a crowded Los Angeles High School 
classroom last year prompted the Los Angeles Board of Education to take the 
appropriate and necessary step of adopting a strict policy toward guns in 
public schools. Generally students caught with a firearm on campus are kicked 
out for the remainder of a semester and the following semester before being 
allowed to apply for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the new standards went into effect in 1993, more than 500 students have 
been removed from L.A. public schools for carrying firearms ranging from cheap 
handguns to sawed-off shotguns and semiautomatic weapons. California lawmakers, 
alarmed by those numbers, and by the proliferation of guns in school districts 
across the state, recently adopted a similar, but less strict, policy that is 
now law. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has also caught on in Washington, where Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.) plans to introduce a "zero tolerance" policy as an amendment to the 
$12-billion Elementary and Secondary Reauthorization Act. The measure would 
require that any school district receiving federal education funds to expel for 
a year a student who carries a gun to school.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a federal ban on aid in the name of safer schools is, in 
principle, a fine one that no one could argue with. But critics of measure 
legitimately point out that "zero tolerance" allows for zero flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to students after they are expelled from schools? Where do they 
go, and who pays for whatever they receive? That's not addressed in the 
gun-free schools amendment. But you can bet local jurisdictions will have to 
figure how to address the problem -- and a way to pay for it, otherwise they'll 
risk losing desperately needed federal funds.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you bring a gun to school, you're probably not going to learn anything 
anyway," Sen Feinstein says. That may be true in most cases, but that also 
lumps young criminals in with children who foolishly, but without malice, carry 
weapons because they live in fear. Those kids need suitable alternatives, 
whether it be continuance schools or some other form of education. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, sponsors of the safe-schools act should keep in mind that 
the policy will be implemented in areas with different needs and different 
resources.  
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's amendment should get broad-based support if it can provide some 
measure of flexibility at the local level.

COUNTY POOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The pools in our community have traditionally been a safe haven during the 
hot summer months for youngsters to cool off and learn to swim. It is 
unfortunate that one incident at the Will Rogers Park pool (June 30) has cast a 
negative light in the community which is keeping children away from the pools 
at Will Rogers Park and in the surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to note that the incident was not solely in response to the 
fees imposed by the county for recreational swimming, but was definitely gang 
related.  
</P>
<P>
 Security is in place and the pools are open and ready to serve the needs of 
all members of the community. Through the efforts of Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, and organizations such as the Southern California Gas Co. and 
Shell Oil and the Save Our Pools campaign, we will be able to meet our 
commitment to make sure that everyone, but especially the children, once again 
find the neighborhood pool a safe and fun haven.  
</P>
<P>
 We invite everyone back, especially the youngsters who wish to learn to swim. 
The Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, as it has done in the last 
eight years, also continues to provide the county with more than $30,000 to 
help youngsters learn how to swim.

HIGH-PROFILE CIRCUMLOCUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A Times editorial (July 11) cites 601 uses of the meaningless term high 
profile to date this year in just one major newspaper. Why stop there? Other 
high-profile circumlocutions abound both on paper and in speech. Have you 
noticed that every change has now become a sea change ? How many sea changers 
even recognize the origin of this phrase in "The Tempest"? 
</P>
<P>
 While hooked on watching the O.J. Simpson preliminary hearing, I noticed that 
a jarringly high number of questions, from both the defense and prosecution, 
began with the useless phrase with respect to . "With respect to the second 
glove, where was it found?" Just jump in and ask, "Where was the second glove 
found?" 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors no longer ask us if it hurts but want to know if we're experiencing 
discomfort. Used cars have turned into previously utilized vehicles. In fact 
nothing is used any more but instead is utilized . Does utilized tell us 
anything that used can't convey? When we fly, we no longer take planes but 
rather utilize aircraft and sit on a flotation device (which we're supposed to 
utilize "in the unlikely event of a water landing" -- especially unlikely when 
we're flying over Kansas). 
</P>
<P>
 As a corporate writing consultant I may be more attuned to these annoyances 
than most, but I have to agree with George Orwell's thesis in his timeless 
essay, "Politics and the English Language": The more our language deviates from 
clarity and conciseness, the fuzzier our thinking becomes -- and our 
civilization is the poorer for it.

 * I enjoyed your editorial. Perhaps you should also examine the ubiquitous use 
of area . Newscasters, weathermen and even The Times precede all geographic 
locations with "the" and follow with "area." Is Downtown Los Angeles different 
from the downtown Los Angeles area? I am sure you have also heard and seen in 
print metropolitan Los Angeles referred to as the metropolitan Los Angeles 
area. I have also heard the freeway right shoulder called the right-hand 
shoulder area (two extraneous words). Are local schools, hospitals and 
residents now area schools, hospitals and residents? What happened to 
neighborhoods, communities and locales? 
</P>
<P>
 Enough said. Perhaps The Times could also do some syntax editing.

TAIWAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial ("Giving Taiwan an Even Break," July 10) hits right on the 
mark in naming the root cause of the United States' see-no-Taiwan, 
speak-no-Taiwan policy of the last 15 years -- fear of upsetting Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. officials said, upgrading the modest changes in U.S. relations with 
Taiwan doesn't affect Washington's "one China" policy.And these modest changes 
help give more space for Taiwan in dealing with the United States more 
efficiently. This is absolutely in the U.S. interest. As Beijing's objection is 
foreseeable, Washington's stance can be construed as a commitment to a standing 
friendship between the United States and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 With a population of about 21 million, Taiwan is a small island with no 
significant reserve of natural resources. Through the hardship of the past 40 
years or so Taiwan is now the sixth biggest market for American products. It is 
the 14th largest trader and the seventh biggest investor in the world. Also 
Taiwan has accumulated a foreign exchange reserve of around $80 billion, second 
only to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of political liberalization programs in the recent years, today 
we can proudly tell the world: Our people enjoy the same freedom as any people 
in the Western democratic countries do. 
</P>
<P>
 To wish a turnaround in U.S. policy toward Taiwan would be unrealistic at this 
point of time. As a valuable trading partner of the United States, Taiwan is 
entitled to an even break in Washington's weighing of foreign policies.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE SIMPSON CASE; RACISM PLOY CAN ONLY HURT BLACKS; REVEALING 
THE DETECTIVE'S HISTORY WILL STRENGTHEN SUSPICIONS ABOUT LAPD; IT'S CYNICAL AND 
HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH A DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIMBERLE CRENSHAW, Kimberle Crenshaw is a professor of law at UCLA School of 
Law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case that until recently mainstream pundits regarded as "race-free," race 
is now emerging as the hidden, potentially explosive subtext. Perhaps the true 
irony is that the trial of a man regarded by the media as being "race neutral" 
is beginning to reveal in painful clarity the polarizing and ultimately 
bankrupt discourse on race and racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the black community, race figured significantly in discussions about 
the Simpson case from the beginning. The widespread belief that O. J. Simpson 
was another in a long list of African American men targeted for public 
destruction initially played no role in mainstream discussions of the case. 
Yet, with the abundance of conspiracy theories that have circulated within the 
African American community, it was only a matter of time before such suspicions 
surfaced as a sensationalized media story, and most important, a possible 
defense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Revelations regarding Detective Mark Fuhrman's unsuccessful 1983 disability 
petition provide for many the smoking gun that heretofore existed only as an 
unsubstantiated but passionately held belief that Simpson is the target of a 
racially motivated frame-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of this potential defense strategy have been harsh: Some commentators 
have decried the possible injury to Fuhrman, who told Newsweek that his career 
was now ruined; others have excoriated the defense for introducing the volatile 
issue of race in a manner that may compromise the integrity of the criminal 
process and contribute to continuing racial tension in Los Angeles. Yet the 
real threat of such a ploy -- if in fact it turns out to be one -- is not to an 
officer who essentially claimed that blacks and Latinos drove him crazy, nor to 
the criminal justice system that frequently blinks at the racism that infects 
its processes. One can rest easy in the belief that the Police Department and 
the criminal justice system can and should take the heat. The real loser in all 
this may be the African American community whose legitimate complaints against 
police abuse stand to be dwarfed and discredited not only through the defense's 
possibly cynical manipulation of the community's concerns and fears, but also 
by the way the system's treatment of Fuhrman denies the realities about race 
and policing that many African Americans feel they know. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of Fuhrman's unsuccessful bid to win a disability pension for 
stress says much more about the cavalier attitude of public officials toward 
African American concerns regarding abusive police behavior than it reveals 
about the Simpson case. At best, the Police Department permitted a disgruntled 
officer who admitted a propensity for violence to remain on active duty. At 
worst, it determined that a man who expressed hostility toward blacks and 
Latinos was fit to carry a badge -- and the power of life or death that comes 
with it. Despite these deeply troubling characterizations, neither the LAPD nor 
the District Attorney averred to the significant risk of relying on the 
credibility of Fuhrman and others like him to provide testimony that directly 
affects the lives of people that officers devalue and disrespect. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is a fateful stroke of poetic justice that with the eye of the 
nation now trained on Los Angeles, the District Attorney's office has to 
grapple with its past insensitivity to racism in a case that arguably has 
little to do with it. These embarrassing revelations suggest that the real 
threat to the integrity of the criminal justice system is not the raising of 
the race issue, but rather the failure of government public officials to take 
racism seriously in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this is a lesson likely to be lost on the authorities. Rather than 
honestly acknowledging the difficulty presented by Fuhrman, they are poised to 
take the route guaranteed to anger many African Americans and to strengthen 
defense attorney Robert Shapiro's hand. Any attempt to defend Fuhrman's 
credibility will imply that he is an exemplary police officer, thus relegating 
his self-proclaimed bigotry to the past. In so doing, the prosecution becomes 
identified as condoning racism within the Police Department, while Shapiro is 
seen as championing the truth, namely, that there are some bigoted officers in 
the LAPD who are quite capable of violating the rights of black citizens. In 
short, the Fuhrman story opens up the black community to potential manipulation 
for the benefit of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the defense is, within bounds, obligated to offer any possible 
argument that might acquit the defendant. It is important that the African 
American community not be misled into believing that Simpson's defense team is 
taking up the banner to fight abusive police practices. They are acting on 
behalf of only one African American, O.J. Simpson. That is why the Fuhrman 
theory, having been floated into the public consciousness, is likely to be 
dropped; there are numerous hurdles to be scaled in substantiating its 
relevance to the case, and, given the willingness of some jurors to acquit 
officers who were videotaped beating a suspect, it is unlikely that speculation 
about Fuhrman's off-camera activities would find support in a broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst and unfortunately most likely scenario is that the defense simply 
floated the theory to consolidate beliefs within the African American community 
that there is a conspiracy. Should the forensic evidence weigh against Simpson, 
other segments of the population may be persuaded, while many African 
Americans, taunted by a scenario that was never intended to be fully pursued, 
hold onto beliefs that, unfortunately, will be dismissed as irrational and 
paranoid. The real tragedy in this turn to race may be its ultimate erasure as 
authorities and media alike, anxious to breathe a sigh of relief, scramble to 
shelve the issue without resolving it. 
</P>
<P>
 The realities of race are too important to be simplistically played and 
subsequently marginalized. Just as African Americans will be challenged to see 
beyond race, so must the legal and media community undertake to see and speak 
race. Race should not be overplayed, nor should the legal and political 
community seek to underplay it. Of course, while the burden to avoid the 
worst-case scenario should be shared by all communities, it will most likely be 
borne by African Americans. The task, then, is to weigh and consider all the 
evidence -- including the work of Fuhrman -- in light of the competing 
objectives pursued by the prosecution and the defense. Just as this requires 
African Americans to keep sight of the interests of the prosecution, so must 
African Americans keep sight of the limited objectives of the defense, which is 
to free Simpson, by all means possible.

COLUMN RIGHT / JONATHAN CLARKE: ONCE AGAIN, THE HELPING HAND IS ALL THUMBS; THE 
U.S. MUST BACK OFF ITS PLEDGE TO SUPPORT UKRAINE'S 'TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN CLARKE, Jonathan Clarke, a member of the British diplomatic service 
for 20 years, is now at the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the nation girding itself for a possible invasion of Haiti, it may seem 
somewhat distracting to direct attention across the Atlantic to the small 
territory of Crimea on the Black Sea. In fact, the inauguration of Leonid 
Kuchma as president of Ukraine last week brings the Administration an 
opportunity to extricate itself from a disaster of its own making. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Bosnian tragedy unfolded in 1991, many mistakes were made. One of the 
most serious was Western insistence on the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia 
at a time when the country was irretrievably falling apart. Underlying this 
approach was concern that disintegration in the Balkans would unleash an 
uncontrollable implosion in the Soviet Union. But its effect was to encourage 
the federal Yugoslav army, essentially the Serbs, to roll back the secession of 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it too much to expect that their unhappy experience in Yugoslavia would 
caution American policy-makers from maladroit interventions in other, equally 
poisonous ethnic brews? Apparently it is. This Administration's incurable habit 
of wading into complex situations on the basis of facile analysis is setting 
the stage for a second Bosnia in Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimea contains 2.5 million people, 70% of whom are ethnic Russians. For 200 
years after its liberation from Ottoman domination, it was part of Russia. In 
1954, in a gesture of friendship to mark the 300th anniversary of Ukrainian 
union with Russia, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine. 
This year, the Crimean people, after having initially voted for separation from 
Russia, have in a series of plebiscites changed their minds -- mainly because 
of the disastrous performance of the Ukrainian economy -- and now wish to 
reaffiliate with Russia. In Kiev, the Ukrainian parliament fiercely opposes 
these aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 After their Balkan misadventures, American policy-makers would have been well 
advised to stay in the background, offering their good offices as mediators if 
required, but studiously avoiding taking sides. This would have recognized that 
the core U.S. interest in Crimea is not whether it forms part of Ukraine or 
Russia, but that it does not cause war between them -- a war that Russia would 
win unless the West massively supported Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the temptation to meddle was not resisted. In May, Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher sent a letter to Leonid Kravchuk, then president of Ukraine, 
stating that "the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its present borders 
is something that the U.S. has consistently affirmed." How ominously 
Christopher's statement recalls the June, 1991, words of his predecessor, James 
A. Baker III: "We support the territorial integrity and preservation of the 
unity of Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
 A stable and independent Ukraine certainly constitutes a strong American 
interest. Unfortunately, like so many other areas of the Clinton foreign 
policy, this interest has fallen victim to policy by sound bite -- in this 
case, a pronouncement from former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski 
that Russia can be "either an empire or a democracy; it cannot be both." Like 
other mellifluous catch phrases about Russia ("shock versus therapy" comes to 
mind from the economic debate), this remark sounds good, but it reduces the 
complex issue of Russia's future orientation to false alternatives.  
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma's election changes the political equilibrium in Ukraine. Unlike his 
predecessor, he will emphasize economic regeneration, which in turn depends on 
close economic ties with Russia. This may lead him into conflict with Ukrainian 
nationalist elements who put strict sovereignty above economic welfare. This is 
where American policy needs to stand back and resist the urge of rhetorical 
meddling. At present, believing that the United States is on their side, 
Ukrainian nationalists may seek to court popularity by putting pressure on 
Crimea, for example by withholding foodstuffs; this in turn would inflame 
pro-Russian passions in Crimea, leading perhaps to an appeal for Russian 
intervention, as is happening in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 If this materialized, the United States would face a fearful dilemma between 
supporting Ukraine and confronting Russia. At some stage, this confrontation 
may be necessary, but Crimea is not the right issue. If Christopher is wise, he 
will see America's contribution being to cool passions. Rather than taking 
sides, he should signal to the Ukrainians, Russians and Crimeans that he will 
be content with any solution -- including territorial transfer -- that they 
devise, so long as it is peaceful.

THE REAL U.S. SENATE RACE: ADVERTISING MAN VS. ADVERTISING MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Californians vote in November for their next U.S. senator, will they 
choose Bill Carrick or Larry McCarthy? 
</P>
<P>
 Who? 
</P>
<P>
 Carrick and McCarthy are the advertising consultants for Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
and Rep. Michael Huffington, respectively. They represent the front-line 
contingent in what is shaping up to be an unprecedented battle for the hearts, 
if not the minds, of voters. Their advertising war will probably set new 
spending records. It may also establish new marks for duration and intensity of 
mud-slinging. Disturbingly, it is a campaign in which in the candidates have 
been overshadowed by their media spots. Feinstein and Huffington have become 
little more than high-priced TV images manufactured by their political 
handlers, or by their opponent's handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Money and media, to be sure, have always driven political messages. But never 
so quickly and deeply into the mire. Or with so few alternative sources of 
information available to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the bull-horn effect. The candidate who blares the loudest, the most 
often and whose message grabs the voters will be heard above the din. So far, 
it has boosted Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 That's due partly to Huffington's willingness to tap his personal fortune to 
fund his race. He has reportedly spent more than $9 million on his campaign -- 
all but $300,000 out of his own pocket. Feinstein, by comparison, has used only 
about $4,000 of her own money, according to her most recent disclosure 
statement, along with nearly $6 million in contributions, of which she has 
spent $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when voters were skeptical, when not scornful, of candidates who 
spent their own money? Today's anti-politician electorate views personal funds 
as the only really "clean" campaign money. Which is why Huffington's handlers 
can use paid media to turn his wealth into a political asset. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 Touting her assistance to Raytheon, a Santa Barbara County-based corporation, 
Feinstein took to the airwaves to attack Huffington for not helping business 
interests in his own congressional district. But he counter-attacked. Noting 
Raytheon's contributions to Feinstein, the ad voice-over crowed: "Mike 
Huffington doesn't take special-interest money. Feinstein's taken over $6 
million. Feinstein's a special-interest jukebox -- put in your money and get 
what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 In less than two years, Feinstein, who won election as the ultimate outsider, 
has become the consummate insider. By doing what senators are supposed to do -- 
legislate and protect the interests of their state -- she is tarred as part of 
the problem of business-as-usual in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has used his money and media to drive this point home, attacking 
Feinstein for supporting President Bill Clinton's health plan ("The government 
that gave us the welfare mess now wants to screw up health care"), and then for 
deserting it when she and Clinton appeared to be dropping in public-opinion 
polls ("It's the only principle of a career politician -- save your own skin"). 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign has ratcheted-up its responses to Huffington's media 
barrage ("He'll say anything to get elected"). She now relentlessly spotlights 
"CONGRESSMAN Huffington," while portraying herself as merely a recent visitor 
("In my short time in the Senate . . . ") unsullied by that tainted institution 
(" . . . I've just begun to fight for California"). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this marathon of slime wouldn't be so reprehensible if voters could 
weigh the fairy tales spun by media gurus against reality. But fragmentation, 
niche programming, viewer non-interest and the economics of television news 
have combined to shrink political coverage. And what happens if a major media 
event -- say, the murder trial of O.J. Simpson -- dominates the news? 
</P>
<P>
 When media interest and public attention become fixated on something as 
sensational as the Simpson case, political news virtually disappears. The 
California senator stands to lose from such a lack of press attention. News 
reports tend to influence voters much more than campaign ads, and Feinstein, 
already a high-profile senator, has worked hard to generate coverage for her 
legislative accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a world almost devoid of election coverage, paid media will define the 
debate. The more manufactured the campaign becomes, the more it will help 
Huffington, who is, by and large, a manufactured candidate. From the beginning, 
his handlers have controlled access to him and limited his unscripted public 
appearances. As a result, Huffington's paid TV and radio spots, not press 
scrutiny, have framed voters' perceptions of his positions on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In a politics-free news environment, Huffington can buy "bundled" media -- a 
package of advertising that uses targeted television, radio, voter slates, 
direct mail and even tailored videocassettes to supplement or replace both paid 
and unpaid mass media. Feinstein's going to have to come a lot closer to him in 
fund-raising to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 What do candidates do to interest a distracted press and public in the fall 
election? How can voters acquire the information necessary to make reasoned 
choices in November? 
</P>
<P>
 It says a lot about California -- its politics and media -- that to guarantee 
coverage of the fall campaign, it might become necessary for candidates to hold 
their events on the front steps of the Criminal Courts Building during recesses 
in the Simpson trial.*

 SEXUAL WHAT? Vietnamese emigres have had to adapt in many ways to their new 
homeland, including adding phrases to the Vietnamese language for Western 
situations. One of the more recent ones is quay nhieu tinh duc , meaning sexual 
harassment. . . . "In Vietnam, people can be charged with rape or molestation, 
but sexual harassment has not become an issue yet," says Dinh Viet Nguyen, a 
lawyer based in Westminster. "We had to translate the English term when we came 
over here."

 RON'S DEMOCRATS? Dana Point City Atty. Jerry Patterson boasts that, while the 
new federal courthouse coming soon may bear Ronald Reagan's name, Democrats got 
the project moving. . . . The former Democratic congressman, based in Santa 
Ana, points out that he sponsored the courthouse bill, signed by President 
Jimmy Carter in 1980. And the money was finally appropriated last January 
during Bill Clinton's term. Says Patterson: "There's not a Ronald Reagan 
fingerprint on that facility."

 BRICK TRICKS: Leo Martinez, 29, of Placentia found out something when he 
learned masonry at the North Orange County Regional Occupational Program: He 
was good at it. How good? He not only won the Outstanding Student in 
Construction Trades award there last year, he recently won a contractors' 
contest in San Mateo for being the best apprentice bricklayer in the western 
United States. Says a modest Martinez: "The secret is in the way you position 
your body, the way you stand and do the work."

 OLYMPIC MADNESS? With the World Cup over, next comes "Barrio Olympics" to be 
held in September at Anaheim High School for youths under 18. The sponsor is 
Solevar, a Latino solidarity group based in Anaheim. Says Seferino Garcia, its 
director: "We're doing this to stop the madness in the streets and to gear 
youngsters in the right direction, away from gangs, drugs and violence." It 
will include softball, basketball and track.

SQUATTERS' CAMP OFFERS HARDSCRABBLE LIFE, BUT THICK CARDBOARD; SAN DIEGO: THEY 
CALL THE PLACE RANCHO DE LOS DIABLOS, RANCH OF THE DEVILS. AUTHORITIES CALL IT 
A HEALTH HAZARD; MIGRANTS CALL IT HOME. BUT THE LAST 350 RESIDENTS ARE SUPPOSED 
TO BE OUT BY OCTOBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They call the place where the Diaz family lives Rancho de los Diablos -- Ranch 
of the Devils. Visit them, and you'll understand why. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-room shack is cobbled together with salvaged cardboard and plywood, 
the roof thatched with green trash bags to repel rain. Carpet pieces cover dirt 
floors. Small windows in two rooms allow the only natural light. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this migrant camp represents an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, this house is better," said Rogelio Diaz Torrez, 25. "The cardboard 
is thicker. In Mexico, the cardboard is very thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a mile away, the rich have multimillion dollar homes -- among them, 
singer Janet Jackson. But Rancho de los Diablos is for the immigrants hired at 
low wages to harvest fields, clean homes or watch children. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is nestled in a ravine along a quiet but polluted stream. Its homes, 
city inspectors say, are fire hazards. Its bumpy dirt roads flood during 
rainstorms, and portable toilets promote infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Started by a few migrant workers as a squatters' settlement in the 1970s, the 
camp ballooned to 700 men, women and children. And the squalor grew. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby homeowners pressed the city to condemn the shacks; some have already 
been torn down. The last 350 residents must be out by October. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is private property, substandard and illegal," said Tony Khalil, senior 
city engineer. "The conditions they're living in now, I don't think anyone 
should be living in those conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, the Diazes don't want to live here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here for necessity, to save some money so we can go back to Mexico, go 
back to rent in San Diego or save enough for a down payment on a house," said 
Diaz's 27-year-old wife, Juana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diazes came to the camp two years ago when Rogelio lost his job in a 
produce warehouse, and they could no longer afford their one-bedroom apartment 
in south San Diego. Now, Rogelio earns $6 an hour packing frozen pizza and 
lasagna. Juana can make $30 a week selling tamales to farm workers headed home. 
</P>
<P>
 They have two children -- Maribel, 1, and Rogelio Jr., 3. Juana's mother, 
Concepcion Alarcon, also lives in the shack. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogelio is a legal alien; Juana is not, though her papers are in the works. 
She tells stories of her visits to Mexico, and the dangerous and difficult 
return trips. 
</P>
<P>
 She originally came north six years ago, enlisting a smuggler for $150 after 
her brother was shot and killed in Santa Ana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 His body was shipped home but the family couldn't afford even the cheapest 
burial service or tombstone, so Juana came to the United States to baby-sit and 
clean houses. Eight months later, her brother had his gravestone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all immigrants come and try to abuse the system," Juana said, wiping a 
forearm across her brow as she scrubbed a pair of jeans on a slab of concrete. 
"I feel that if it wasn't for Mexicans, no one would be picking the fruit and 
vegetables. No one else would be out in the fields." 
</P>
<P>
 The Diaz home has some comforts -- a small TV-radio charged with a car battery 
and a larger television and VCR run by an electric generator. The Diazes watch 
Mexican soap operas and listen to Spanish-language news. 
</P>
<P>
 The generator also provides light at night and powers Juana's blender, in 
which she grinds hot green and red chiles for her eye-watering salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Just past the clothesline is her garden of chiles, pumpkins, cucumbers, 
tomatoes, cilantro, mint, strawberries and a bright stand of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is a microcosm of life in Mexico. Families from the Mexican state of 
Oaxaca, many who speak Indian dialects, live in shanties on one side of the 
stream. Families from Guerrero and nearby states, who speak mostly Spanish, 
live on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the unmarked dirt road that leads to camp, boys kick around a soccer 
ball, and mothers stroll babies amid cackling chickens and wandering dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men huddle against an abandoned car, playing poker. Smoke from cooking 
fires floats by. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad times come on Fridays -- payday -- when outsiders visit the secluded 
canyon and some of the younger men let loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go and get drunk," Juana said, cradling a nursing Maribel. "That's when 
you have the shootings." She fears a bullet will puncture the flimsy walls of 
her home and hit a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, church and social service groups and immigrants rights 
advocates have tried to improve the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 They set up a solar power system, brought in portable toilets and garbage bins 
with weekly trash pickup, arranged for a pipeline that brings in clean water 
and established a church, a general store and several open-air "restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 The store even stocks cellular phones that residents pay to use -- a call to 
Mexico costs a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But conditions never improved enough, and the camp will soon close. A 
nonprofit agency, Esperanza, won a $518,000 federal grant to help families pay 
rent for up to a year and provide rent and utility deposits for single men. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Goodall, co-owner of the property, said he and partner Robert Scarcia 
wanted the camp shut down much sooner. But church, social-service and city 
officials asked them to wait until they figured out what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, nearby homeowners sued Goodall and Scarcia to close the camp. 
"They said they didn't like all these people walking through their back yards 
and in front of their homes," Goodall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The migrants, Goodall insists, are "tough workers and just wonderful people. 
The devastation comes when they're encouraged to bring their families. They 
can't support their families on the wages they're earning."

<P>
 A sheriff's deputy shot and killed a man in a ski mask who was walking around 
a campground wielding a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two deputies were called to KOA Kampgrounds on Thursday because residents 
complained that the man was acting strangely and scaring them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deputies attempted to talk him into putting the hammer down," said San 
Joaquin County Sheriff's spokesman Mike Esau. "He walked toward them, holding 
the hammer above his head in an attack manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies squirted pepper spray at the man, then shot him after he hit one 
of them on the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who was identified as Roddney M. Briles, 37, died at the scene. The 
injured deputy, who was not identified, was treated and released.

WOMEN IN VANGUARD OF A DIVERSE FOREST SERVICE; EQUALITY: ABOUT 45% OF THE 
AGENCY'S EMPLOYEES ARE FEMALE, INCLUDING SEVERAL SUPERVISORS AND DISTRICT 
RANGERS. THE CALIFORNIA REGION HAS DONE THE MOST TO PROMOTE WOMEN TO POSITIONS 
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

 As the U.S. Forest Service finds its way between the clear-cuts and the 
spotted owls, more of the pathfinders are women. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would say that Smokey the Bear is female, but as the agency embraces 
the idea of biological diversity in the forest and drops the emphasis on 
producing timber, it is doing so with a work force that is more diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a recognition that we can no longer continue to be a militaristic 
type of organization of white men making all the decisions. Our organization 
needs to look more like the public we serve," said Gloria Brown, the Ashland 
District ranger on the Rogue River National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a critical mass there now" of women in leadership jobs, said Liz 
Agpaoa, Galice District ranger on the Siskiyou National Forest and a member of 
a task force that is reinventing the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are starting to look at it not as something we have to manage, that we 
have to deal with, but as something we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Women weren't always something the Forest Service wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1931 "Forest Ranger's Catechism" for the national forests in California 
includes a picture of the ranger on horseback, wearing his Smokey Bear hat, 
gazing up a rugged, rocky slope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can a woman become a forest ranger? No. Women are not appointed by the Forest 
Service as members of the field force even if they pass the civil-service 
examination," the catechism says. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, a civil rights report showed that 40% of the Forest Service's 32,000 
employees nationwide were women, including 10 of the 122 national forest 
supervisors and 100 of the 671 district rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers continue to increase. This year, 23 women are heads of national 
forests and 112 are district rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The region that has done the most to promote women, by far, has been 
California, where a 1973 discrimination lawsuit filed by a female scientist 
produced an affirmative action program. Now women make up 45% of the work 
force, and six of the 18 national forest supervisors are women. 
</P>
<P>
 Women have made the fastest gains in fire management, where they hold 55% of 
the professional positions, according to Vicki Jackson, who monitors the 
affirmative action program in California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easier to recruit women for firefighting jobs, because they didn't need 
as much schooling as they would for forestry or engineering, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Forest Service is developing more professional diversity 
in management, Jackson said. District rangers once came almost exclusively from 
the ranks of foresters and engineers. Now biologists and recreation specialists 
are common. 
</P>
<P>
 That helps to broaden the agency's mission, which was heavily focused on 
producing timber before lawsuits over the northern spotted owl forced the 
Forest Service to recognize it had to do a better job protecting wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Schnoes was with a group of Forest Service biologists last year who 
met with Jack Ward Thomas. Appointed chief of the agency last fall, Thomas is 
the first biologist to hold the top job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked us how many of us aspired to be district rangers," said Schnoes, who 
works on the Galice Ranger District. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many hands went up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'How do you expect to change this agency unless you take it by the 
horns? That is exactly how the agency will change, through a change in 
personnel,' " Schnoes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Belsky, an ecologist for the Oregon Natural Resources Council, criticized 
the agency for failing to invite more than a few women to present their 
research at a recent conference on ecosystem management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where men are already dominating a field, there is no way for women to get 
into it," said Belsky. "They become leaders in new fields." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Olson, spokeswoman for the Siskiyou National Forest, said she wished women 
in the Forest Service did a better job of serving as mentors to other women, so 
they wouldn't have to break the same ground over again. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict between logging and the northern spotted owl in the Northwest 
illustrates that the Forest Service is facing more complex questions than the 
ranger on horseback in the 1931 catechism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think having less testosterone in the Forest Service is going to improve 
our outlook," said Joel Pagel, a biologist in the Rogue River National Forest. 
"I think our aggressiveness in trying to please people made us rush through 
things. Women might bring us to actually slow down and look where we're going a 
lot more than we have in the past."

CELEBRATING DIVORCE WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER HAS A RING OF FREEDOM; CEREMONY: ONE 
ENTREPRENEUR IS TURNING WEDDING BANDS INTO A CATHARTIC FASHION STATEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDDIE PELLS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do you take this divorce? 
</P>
<P>
 I do. 
</P>
<P>
 With this ring I -- SMASH! -- celebrate my freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 With a whack of a four-pound sledgehammer and Tammy Wynette's "D-I-V-O-R-C-E" 
twanging in the background, Linda Howell reduced her wedding ring to an 
unrecognizable mess of gold, silver and cubic zirconia. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell swigged champagne and thought about her plans. Make the mess into a 
pendant? Earrings? Yes, a pendant. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 For Howell, a 38-year-old nurse, the ceremony was a cathartic way to start 
over after her divorce. And it brought jeweler Lynn Peters some business. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters is the founder of Freedom Rings: Jewelry for the Divorced, which makes 
custom jewelry out of wedding rings. Women often select earrings, pendants and 
bracelets. Men like golf ball markers.  
</P>
<P>
 Peters calls the venture her "artistic contribution to the recycling effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Others call it a refreshing way to handle a painful situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the re-formed jewelry, smashers get a signed divorce 
certificate and a mini-reception with champagne and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' friends serve as ring and hammer bearers. The hammer is placed in a 
music box of sorts. When opened, the faint twinkling of "The Wedding March" 
cascades out of the silk-lined container, which is quickly shut so the smashing 
can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a release," said Howell, who split with her husband after a 14-year 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 She said receiving the divorce papers in the mail didn't feel like the real 
thing. "You have a ceremony when you get married, but when you get divorced 
it's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters felt the same way after she and her husband divorced in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt like there was closure," Peters said. "So I threw a party, sort 
of like a wedding celebration in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 But what to do with the ring? Peters said she thought about going to a pawn 
shop or giving it away, but her experience as a jeweler gave her a better idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, I've never really made a custom piece of jewelry for myself," she 
said. "So I took the diamond out, took a sledgehammer to the band and 
transformed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' old band is now a pendant emblazoned with her company's logo -- a 
wedding ring with a slash through it. She wears that on her collar, along with 
a button that reads, "I miss my ex-husband, but my aim is improving." The 
Divorce Ceremony 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts from divorce ceremony developed by Lynn Peters:  
</P>
<P>
 You are to be charged with the following duties: 
</P>
<P>
 1. To have and to hold anyone you damn well please. 
</P>
<P>
 2. To enjoy life to its fullest. 
</P>
<P>
 3. To experience the pleasures you've heretofore only dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 4. To recover emotionally, financially and sexually. 
</P>
<P>
 5. To regain your rightful place among the serene and satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 And 
</P>
<P>
 6. To remember that being naked does not mean being alone. 
</P>
<P>
 To symbolize this transition we will release any remaining ties to your past 
by transforming your ring -- which represents that past -- into a token of your 
new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, take the hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop for a moment to consider the transformation that is about to begin your 
new life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready? 
</P>
<P>
 With this swing let freedom ring!

REPORTS ON RECORDER ISSUE OVERLOOKED THE TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Since when does the Los Angeles Times care about the truth? If it did, it 
would look for the truth in the Orange County recorder matter. For many years, 
the powers that be have had it in for County Recorder Lee Branch because he 
wouldn't play their games (they said that he was "uncooperative").The following 
is just a small sampling of the punishment heaped upon him and which ultimately 
included me. The powers that be: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Stymied the recorder's every attempt to move to larger quarters and 
repeatedly blamed him for costs when he did not spend more taxpayers' money to 
renovate a building that did not provide adequate space.  
</P>
<P>
 2. Gave lip service to the recorder in his attempts to remove an infamous 
troublemaker from the office. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Refused the recorder's requests to have the assistant recorder serve "at 
his pleasure," as most assistant department heads (of elected officials) do.  
</P>
<P>
 4. Repeatedly denied well-deserved reclassification attempts for his 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Falsely "convicted" him of showing favoritism to me, as well as sexual 
harassment that could not be substantiated by a grand jury investigation, 
conducted by no less than the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Slandered our names, with the help of the Orange County Affirmative Action 
Office (which has been advised to contact the Orange County district attorney 
regarding its investigative methods).  
</P>
<P>
 Only when you print the truth about that whole situation can you afford to 
throw stones at the Mexican government. Remember the one about people in glass 
houses? 
</P>
<P>
 Mark B. Lifland said it best when he displaced the quintessential oxymoron 
"politically correct" with "responsible journalism."

ENSURING RIGHTS FOR GAYS AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding your editorial "The Right to Have a Job" (July 7): Thank you for 
taking a stand on this very basic but important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 As an openly gay person, I have known discrimination.I am proud to live in a 
city where there is a law against discrimination based on sexual orientation. I 
am also fortunate to work for an employer, the University of California, who 
prohibits such job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 I know many gay and lesbian people whose job performance and morale are higher 
because they are protected from arbitrary job discrimination. I can only 
imagine the increase in the productivity level of hundreds of thousands of 
American workers if the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is passed this summer.

TWO WRINKLES TO THE POSSIBLE BAN ON LINE-DRYING CLOTHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * One pleasure of my life has been to hang clothes to dry on a clothesline. I 
feel productive. I have time to reflect. I am useful. I have a goal to go 
through life leaving few physical tracks. This minor rejection of technology 
pleases me. I like to see clothes hanging on a line; to me it is pure 
domesticity, rather like a cat on the windowsill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheets line-dried feel great. Towels tend to be hard and wrinkled, but they 
still absorb. I am not a purist though. I do put clothes in the dryer if 
otherwise they would have to be ironed or, God forbid, someone leaves tissues 
in a pocket and litters the whole load of wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I read ("Law Would Limit Hanging Laundry," July 12) that the city of La 
Habra is considering a ban on drying clothes on a clothesline if it is visible 
from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 What next? In their push for a correct environment will they decide to dictate 
the color of houses, ban basketball hoops, insist that garage doors remain 
closed? 
</P>
<P>
 Tell them to move to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 AMERICA BUCHANAN

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I agree with the La Habra City Council -- laundry should not be hung on 
chain-link fences, from trees, or in complete public view. If this has become a 
citywide problem, the City Council should set up standards. For instance, 
clothes would have to be hung in the back yard (not a side yard) and people 
would have to use an apparatus which was made to hang clothes. Most people 
would be receptive to these standards, as opposed to an all-out ban on hanging 
clothes outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, by choice, I hang my clothes outdoors. I work at a computer most 
of the day at a high-stress job. For me it's therapy to be able perform a 
simple task such as hanging clothes on a clothesline. I enjoy watching them 
blow in the wind. Everyone knows how wonderful sun-dried clothes smell. Of 
course, I should mention the savings of natural resources by sun-drying 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council of La Habra should look at meeting everyone halfway by 
allowing anyone to hang their clothes outside while keeping them as invisible 
from the street as possible.

DORNAN'S POLICY OF HONESTY WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your recent hit piece (" 'Shut Up' Not In Dornan's Vocabulary," July 15) on 
Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Garden Grove) ignored relevant facts and important contexts 
in which many of the Dornanisms cited were first uttered. One particularly 
offensive one was your omission with regard to Dornan's criticisms of longtime 
Soviet mouthpiece Vladimir Posner. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do you get off referring to Posner as a "TV commentator"? Posner may be 
nothing more than a second-rate TV commentator now, but he had a life before 
his partnership with Phil Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 As a witness to the Dornan-Posner exchanges, let me set the record straight. I 
remember watching Posner live on network television when he called President 
Reagan a liar immediately after the President delivered a televised speech on 
SDI. At that time, Posner was a paid-propagandist and apologist in the employ 
of the Soviet Union. Dornan was one of many across this country deeply offended 
by the remark and outraged that one of our television networks would give a 
Soviet paid propagandist the opportunity to attack an American president. 
</P>
<P>
 During the late 1980s, on radio and television stations across this nation, 
Posner spread some of the most contemptible and outrageous lies in defense of 
the brutally corrupt Soviet regime. Posner was especially notorious for 
excusing Soviet anti-Semitism -- even more incredible, when you consider his 
own father was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressman Dornan, one of Israel's leading supporters and champion in the 
fight to end the persecution of Soviet Jews, was absolutely right to call 
Posner a traitor to his religion. And the fact is that, in an election year, 
two leading congressional liberal Democrats, Tom Lantos of California and 
Stephen Solarz of New York, along with a host of Jewish organizations, publicly 
supported Dornan the next day. They all knew then what you did not tell now: 
that Vladimir Posner was no TV commentator but an electronic menace to the 
truth about Soviet repression. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is through this same sleazy journalistic prism of distortion and 
omission that the Orange County Democratic Party has woven together its book of 
Dornanisms in a shallow attempt to mock and discredit Dornan's considerable 
record of political courage and public service. But it won't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Election after election the voters in the Democratic 46th District return 
Republican Bob Dornan to Congress, above all, because they recognize his 
forthrightness, passion, honesty and commitment. In this age of the 
play-it-safe professional politician, I wish we had more Bob Dornans who 
believe in what they say and have the guts to say it.

$650,000 FLIES AWAY IN BATTLE OVER AIRPORT; IN TIGHT ECONOMIC TIMES, FOUR 
CITIES SHOULD RETHINK HOW BEST TO MAKE THEIR CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question of what to do with the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station after the 
Marines leave has become one of the county's biggest political footballs. This 
month, there was another fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest disturbing sign of the distrust of county government felt by 
some communities, four cities in South County have pledged $650,000 to fight 
against a commercial airport at the base. Coalition leaders said the money 
would pay for an independent study of an airport's impact on the local 
environment and economy. The consultant conducting the study will also look at 
alternative uses for the base after it closes. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when cities are short on funds and considering if services must be 
cut or taxes raised, this is a poor expenditure of money. It will duplicate 
studies already planned. Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest and Laguna 
Hills should consult on the environmental and economic impact studies that the 
county will carry out. Make suggestions. Offer constructive criticism. If they 
think the county study will be biased against their cities and in favor of an 
airport, they should be able to see that few outside their own cities will view 
their consultant's study as unbiased. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of business leaders mistrustful of the government they elected already 
has sponsored a campaign that forced a referendum on an El Toro commercial 
airport onto the November ballot. The business people and the South County 
cities both are trying to institute planning by special interests, not planning 
that takes account of concerns of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors devised an El Toro Reuse Planning Authority to gather 
information and opinions on the future of the 4,700-acre base and study 
possible uses. Lake Forest is a member of the authority, which makes its 
presence on the four-city coalition even more troubling. Do city officials 
intend to work with the reuse group or just erect roadblocks? Lining up on the 
anti-airport side damaged the city's credibility. Lake Forest either should 
quit the coalition or the nine-member reuse authority, whose other members 
include the five county supervisors and three Irvine council members. Given a 
choice between these two, it would be much better off working with the 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of the coalition angered at least two county supervisors and 
revived the poisonous atmosphere that has pitted North County, where many favor 
an airport, against South County, where many oppose one. The cities should let 
the reuse authority do its work, getting help, not obstructions, from all 
cities.

UNDUE GIFTS TO ATTORNEY SPARKED REFORM; CASE POINTS TO NEED FOR LAWYERS TO 
MONITOR OWN TO ENSURE WISHES OF ELDERLY CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 30 years ago the California Supreme Court said that lawyers should 
receive no more than "modest" gifts from the estates of their clients. Yet 
Laguna Hills attorney James D. Gunderson received $3.5 million from the 
$18-million estate of Merrill A. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 This month Orange County Superior Court Judge Byron K. McMillan rightly ruled 
that Gunderson should repay the money, plus $500,000 in interest, to Miller's 
heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was 98 when he signed the final version of the 1992 will that left the 
money to Gunderson. Court documents said Miller was also "blind and failing in 
his mental and physical capacities."  
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson, who engaged a former law partner to act as the attorney of record 
to prepare the final version of Miller's will, denied any wrongdoing and said 
Miller was a longtime friend who wanted the lawyer to share in his estate. 
</P>
<P>
 But as articles in the Times Orange County edition showed, Miller was not the 
only client of Gunderson's to have left money, stocks and real estate to the 
attorney. In one case, the lawyer inherited nearly $250,000 in stock from the 
estate of a woman declared senile five months before he prepared her last will. 
</P>
<P>
 Media disclosure of these outrageous cases did spur reform. Gunderson 
surrendered his law license, saying he did so because of failing health. The 
Orange County Sheriff's Department monitored the civil trial as part of its 
probe of Gunderson. In addition, the Legislature passed a law that essentially 
barred lawyers from accepting money from the estates of their clients. That 
codified the Supreme Court's ruling and should help deter lawyers from 
imitating Gunderson's actions. Judge McMillan's decision should also make 
attorneys think twice before writing themselves into their clients' wills. 
</P>
<P>
 The case also exposed the vicious preying upon the elderly, who may already be 
subject to physical and emotional abuse and also deprived even of having the 
last wishes carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 The former president of the Orange County Bar Assn. told a legislative 
committee that "many, many attorneys engage in predatory practices around our 
elderly communities." That is some strong evidence that lawyers must pay closer 
attention to the conduct of some of their colleagues.

NIMBY IS NO ONE'S EXCLUSIVE DOMAIN; NOT-IN-MY-BACK-YARD PHILOSOPHY IS SPREADING 
IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pull-up-the-drawbridge mentality that so often goes by the acronym NIMBY 
("not in my back yard") is objectionable in any season. But is there something 
in the summer air this year that has made the affliction seem almost contagious 
in Orange County?  
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, in San Clemente, in Anaheim Hills -- surely a diverse 
geographical cross-section of the county -- residents are appealing to 
narrow-mindedness with gusto, embracing exclusivity as if their lives and 
neighborhoods depended on keeping others at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, it was an astonishing development.  
</P>
<P>
 After sinking $600,000 into a new pedestrian bridge in progress over the Santa 
Ana Freeway, the state Department of Transportation acceded to a request by the 
Sana Ana School Board. Having looked at the numbers, the agency decided that it 
was preferable in tight budgetary times to spend at least $60,000 for 
demolition rather than find hundreds of thousands for completion. The reason 
was that hundreds of residents on the northeast side of the bridge actively 
opposed the bridge, suggesting that it would be a passageway for imagined 
criminals who lived on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board, without the estimated $80,000 needed as an alternative to 
bus children living on the northeast side of the freeway, must reckon with the 
likelihood that Caltrans will phase out the agency's current subsidy for busing 
during the construction in the area. Never mind that plans for the bridge were 
discussed earlier, and that state and city officials had talked with the school 
district about locking gates at night to address crime concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, some provision for any legitimate concerns of residents could have 
been made. But here was a case where neighborhood fears found an alliance of 
convenience with budgetary concerns. It produced a marriage of regrettable 
policy reversal, a cave-in. It was the first time, according to Caltrans, that 
something that it actually had built would be torn down. What a collapse of 
purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 At a time when people are trying to build bridges, in the infrastructure and 
between people, here in effect was an attempt to reinforce the barrier in the 
heart of a multicultural city that already was imposed by the presence of a 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Ana is not alone. In Anaheim Hills, as we noted the other day, some 
residents have tried to keep out a successful facility for abused children, 
even though work to improve the site actually would constitute a marked 
improvement in the appearance of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 And in San Clemente, residents have petitioned to oppose the building of 
duplexes for 128 Marine officer families on San Mateo Point, which is a scenic 
bluff top. The argument of those living in the exclusive gated community in the 
south end of town in effect was "don't spoil the view." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the proverbial fears of plummeting home values and increased traffic, 
the petitioners apparently believe that the Marines are welcome neighbors, but 
only so long as they keep out of sight and out of mind on the sprawling land of 
nearby Camp Pendleton.  
</P>
<P>
 The Marines, to their credit, had asked the city and adjacent homeowners 
association for comment, and made plans to build in a way that was compatible 
with surrounding architecture. For their trouble, they have learned that there 
are times when no good deed goes unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the NIMBY syndrome appears to be in full bloom across Orange 
County this summer. Here's to neighborliness in all our cities as an 
alternative, in the current season and all year long.

COUNTY FAIR'S CATTLE DRIVE IS SOMETHING TO BEEF ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Please come back to the present, organizers of the Orange County Fair. An 
old-fashioned cattle drive for the fun of it? 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when 1.28 billion cattle populate the Earth, threatening our global 
environment through pollution, deforestation, desertification and species 
extinction (where cattle graze, wildlife cannot live -- either through loss of 
habitat or through extermination by governments as "nuisance animals"), we 
certainly cannot afford to continue to glamorize this unglamorous relic.  
</P>
<P>
 As the cattle are herded down the street, take out your calculators and count. 
While recognizing that we are not obligate carnivores, note that one of every 
two people you see will die of diet-related heart disease. Every pound of 
hamburger on the hoof counts for 16 pounds of grain that could have been used 
to feed the hungry and 2,500 gallons of water to drink in our desert state. The 
lists go on and on. The total numbers are devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 And after the crowds disperse, what will happen to the gentle creatures who 
are so often used as symbols of maternal love that we have affectionately named 
Elsie or Bessie? They will be shocked with electric cattle prods, beaten and 
kicked, and packed onto trucks for transport to slaughterhouses, where -- 
terrorized -- they will meet a primitive, painful and violent death, like 
100,000 of them do every day in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Some relics are better off left in the past. Let's change to a more 
Earth-friendly, people-friendly and compassionate agricultural system so that 
our children and the planet have a future. The Orange County Fair would have 
been a great place to start. Maybe next year?

SUPERVISORS AREN'T ACKNOWLEDGING THOSE OPPOSED TO AIRPORT AT EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding "City Assailed for Base-Panel Tactics" (July 15), I find it ironic 
that two Orange County supervisors criticize Lake Forest for joining a 
coalition opposed to a commercial airport at El Toro, yet support those who 
promote it. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors support a ballot measure promoting the airport, yet refuse to 
recognize their responsibilities to those communities opposed. (Supervisor) 
Harriett M. Wieder is quoted: "I don't generally believe in initiatives as a 
way of making public policy. I call it shopping-mall government. However, in 
this case the people need to be heard." How about the people most directly 
affected, like those living in Lake Forest and the other three communities 
opposed to it? Do they deserve to be heard? 
</P>
<P>
 Only one South County member was permitted to join with the nine-member Reuse 
Planning Authority -- that one is Lake Forest. (Supervisor) William G. Steiner 
is quoted: "It was a rather significant act to include Lake Forest . . . in the 
planning process for what is essentially land that is in the authority of the 
Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious that those who are promoting a round-the-clock passenger and 
cargo-air facility at El Toro are Newport Beach residents, who are also 
investors and developers, and their lackey politicians. They see financial 
opportunities and the chance to rid themselves of some bothersome noise from 
John Wayne. Should the rest of Orange County suffer a sharp drop in living 
standards and property values to support this small minority? 
</P>
<P>
 Have the supervisors visited Inglewood/Lennox or Playa del Rey/El Segundo 
lately? Is this the future they envision for Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 IRVING E. FRIEDMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 * (In) a recent Times article County Supervisors William G. Steiner and 
Harriett M. Wieder accuse Lake Forest officials of "playing both sides of the 
street" regarding the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station reuse issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, how about Steiner and Wieder? They supposedly support the official and 
"open-to-study" El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, while at the same time back 
the airport ballot initiative which mandates (no discussions or studies 
allowed) a commercial airport to be built at El Toro!

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON LIBRARIES; CITIZENRY MUST BE MOBILIZED TO 
SAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CALIFORNIA APPEARS TO BE HEADING TOWARD THE DUBIOUS 
DISTINCTION OF HAVING THE NATION'S WORST PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LaDONNA KIENITZ, LaDonna Kienitz is the community services director and city 
librarian for Newport Beach and the vice president and president-elect of the 
Public Library Assn., the national professional organization of more than 8,000 
public librarians and public library administrators. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The residents of Orange County are increasingly becoming aware of both the 
sorry plight of their public libraries and the importance of the libraries in 
providing access to information to the free society we all cherish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Public Library, with its 27 branches serving both cities and 
unincorporated areas in the county, has been drastically hit by diminished 
funding allocations. Twenty-four branches are open only four days each week, 
averaging 32 hours of service. City libraries located within the county have 
also undergone budget cuts in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is not alone in facing these drastic losses of critical public 
services -- public libraries throughout the state are closing or slashing 
hours, canceling magazine subscriptions and eliminating book budgets. The 
problem is magnified by the fact that expenditures for school libraries in 
California already rank 50th in the nation. California's future leaders and 
citizens are growing up in a society that states, by its funding decisions, 
that information, culture and the heritage of those who preceded us has little 
or no importance in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In like manner, communities and businesses are deprived of critical current 
information to fuel the economic development of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 California appears to be headed toward the dubious distinction of having the 
worst public library service in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Diametrically opposed to the current status of California libraries are the 
results of an independent 1994 California Voters Opinion Poll, conducted by 
David Bender Research, San Francisco, which showed that: 
</P>
<P>
 * 95% of California voters believe that libraries play an essential role in 
the education of children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 91% agree that public libraries are essential to the quality of life in 
their community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 81% agree that the state should ensure adequate funding for local libraries 
(80% agreeing that funding should come from both local and state governments). 
</P>
<P>
 * 59% stated that government spends too little on libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the good news that concerned community leaders and citizens must use 
as a call to action to save California libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also pockets of successful community actions around the state where 
concerned citizens have found methods to provide public support for important 
library service. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, Pasadena voters overwhelmingly approved additional fees for the 
support of their public library. Last month, five California communities -- 
Albany, Altadena, Oakland, San Francisco and South Pasadena -- passed measures 
by large margins in support of libraries; the lowest level of support of any of 
the measures was 69%. 
</P>
<P>
 The County of Los Angeles Public Library has just announced the submission of 
a proposal for a community facilities district, a funding mechanism under the 
Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act that would levy annual charges on 
properties within the district, based on the estimated benefit to the property 
from library services. Pending in the State Legislature is Senate Bill 1448, 
providing for establishment by local jurisdictions of library benefit 
assessment districts, a revision of a similar bill approved in 1993, but vetoed 
by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, concerns for quality library services have been voiced in a 
variety of manners. Two cities serviced by the Orange County Public Library 
have taken action to evaluate alternate methods of providing library service to 
their residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo has negotiated to formally withdraw from the county system, but 
contracted for service from the county library until a new city library can be 
built. The new library will be partially funded by a recently founded Mission 
Viejo Library Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills has recently commissioned an independent municipal consultant to 
study library services to its city residents. And Huntington Beach recently 
dedicated an addition to the main library, developed with residents' support. 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach, which has a city library system funded by the city's general 
fund, a new Central Library facility has just been opened, financed in part by 
$2 million raised by a citizens' group, the Newport Beach Public Library 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the successful cases noted, citizen support has coalesced to improve the 
quality of library services provided in the respective cities. Such sites of 
strong active support for public libraries in California are exemplary and 
commendable, but tend to be solitary lights on a dreary horizon. These 
particular success stories impact direct library service to less than 2 million 
people in a state of 30 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pockets of library excellence cannot meet the information needs of 
California's diverse, immense and geographically dispersed population. Citizen 
action is urgently needed on a statewide basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the issue is not whether cities within the county system 
should seek to remove themselves from the Orange County Public Library system, 
but rather how to mobilize all the citizenry to action to save all the public 
libraries of the county and the state.

JAZZY NEEDS LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am pleased to read that the collie, Jazzy, is doing well after being 
abused by her owner ("Man Pleads Not Guilty in Assault on Dog," June 4).I do 
not believe that giving Jazzy to a breeder is in her best interest.  
</P>
<P>
 I have been to a few breeders, and although the dogs get good physical care, I 
don't think she will get the individual emotional support and love that she 
will need. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope Jazzy will have a family who will give her lots of attention and gentle 
touches. She needs to be a member of a loving family, not an asset in a 
business.

GOING FROM RAMBO TO DIRTY BARRY; PRO FOOTBALL: SWITZER EASING INTO HIS JOB AS 
COACH OF THE COWBOYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PRESTON, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's traveled from the Oklahoma plains into this Texas town to do a job. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one tough hombre. 
</P>
<P>
 The name is Barry Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boss calls him Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comparing Jimmy Johnson to Barry Switzer is like comparing Rambo to Clint 
Eastwood," said Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys owner. "Rambo came in with a 
lot of fire and smoke, explosions and gunfire. That was Jimmy. Barry is more 
relaxed, laid back. He comes into a town real quiet and then lights it up. Both 
are big-bang guys." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cowboys' first week of camp, Switzer hasn't had the presence of a Bear 
Bryant, peering down out of the tower. In fact, his motto seems to be walk 
lightly and carry a little stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer, 57, doesn't scream. He doesn't teach. The Cowboys run the same 
offense, the same defense, have the same techniques and use the same practice 
schedule. Switzer occasionally steps into various player stations, picks up a 
few tidbits, and then moves on to the next group. The only time he gets 
involved is to congratulate a player on an outstanding play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Way to go Troy, way to go Emmitt." 
</P>
<P>
 He slaps them on the butt. 
</P>
<P>
 That's it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Coach Switzer can be effective like Coach Johnson," said Dallas 
quarterback Troy Aikman. "Coach Johnson wasn't a big X and O guy. He let his 
assistants do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But make no doubt, Coach Johnson put his stamp on the team. He got the team 
motivated. Right now Barry is observing. Eventually, he has to put his stamp on 
the team. It will be tough." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because there are so many questions. Do the Cowboys have enough talent 
left to win an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl? Can a new offensive 
coordinator be as effective as the last one? Can Switzer coach on this level? 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer could get into another no-win situation like George Seifert, who had 
to replace Bill Walsh in San Francisco. In five years, Seifert has been to the 
playoffs, including the National Football Conference Championship Game, four 
times, and won a Super Bowl in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seifert is never mentioned in the same breath with The Genius. And Switzer 
has a double whammy. 
</P>
<P>
 He coached at Oklahoma for 16 years (three national championships) and had the 
Red River rivalry with the University of Texas. Texans are known to hold a 
grudge even against Texans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, a fan spotted Mississippi State Coach Jackie Sherrill on the 
sidelines at practice. Sherrill was disliked in Austin when he coached at Texas 
A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad enough having to put up with Switzer," shouted the fan. "Get out of 
here, Sherrill. Get off the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Switzer banners at practice are taken down by security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, the reception here has been great," said Switzer, who has 
been out of coaching since he left Oklahoma in 1988. "Now to stay in public 
favor, we've just got to win some games." 
</P>
<P>
 Anything short of a three-peat could cause problems in Big D, and a lot of the 
talent from the previous two teams is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 On the departed list are linebacker Ken Norton, guards Kevin Gogan and John 
Gesek, kicker Eddie Murray, defensive tackle Tony Casillas, tight end Jimmie 
Jones and quarterback Bernie Kosar. All but Kosar played vital roles for the 
Cowboys the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the list is offensive coordinator Norv Turner, now head coach of the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we keep Emmitt and Troy healthy, we still have the nucleus to make the 
road to the NFL championship come through Dallas," said Switzer. "I'm excited, 
it's like I'm a kid again. I'm pumped up like it was my first day at Oklahoma. 
I look at those rings the players have, and I'm committed to getting one. I 
look at this as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to rock the boat, and I don't care who gets the credit. I've 
always considered myself a man of reasonable intelligence, and I'm not going to 
interfere with something that's been successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer seems to have won over the veteran players. A trademark of his at 
Oklahoma was to call a player by number instead of his name. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game is still the same, a halfback is still a halfback and you still have 
to block and tackle to win," said Switzer. "But you can't say, hey 22 (Emmitt 
Smith) get over here. You say, 'Mr. Smith, would you please join us in our 
little huddle because I want you to carry the football.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Jones who provides the most pressure, as Johnson can attest. After 
two Super Bowls, their strained relationship finally snapped last winter. After 
an incident at a cocktail party -- Jones said Johnson snubbed him after a toast 
-- the owner started talking about a coaching change. Johnson took him up on it 
in March, agreeing to a cash settlement of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner hasn't changed, apparently. Jones, who was coached by Switzer as a 
freshman at the University of Arkansas, has attended every practice, looking 
like one of Switzer's assistants. Johnson would not have allowed this. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones wears coach's shorts and molded athletic shoes. He talks with other 
assistants, sometimes "breaking down" to show a technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Every shirt of Jones' has a Super Bowl logo on it, and he loves to flash the 
ring. Always. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer is aware of Jones' presence on the field, and he stops occasionally to 
chat with his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shirt, the ring, it's a reminder to Barry," said Jones, always the last 
off the field after doing countless interviews. "Yes, I wear them intentionally 
because I know Barry wants one of these bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer also wants to please Jones. Last Monday, Switzer was reluctant to 
attend a golf tournament. Jones insisted. Switzer was there. Even posed for a 
picture with former University of Texas football Coach Darrell Royal, a person 
he never liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our last coach got burned out, so we're giving this one relaxation every 
other day," Jones said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer smiled. "He's the boss. I'm thankful he gave me the job," said 
Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want to rock the boat.

ANOTHER STIR; IN A FRESH START WITH THE GIANTS, DARRYL STRAWBERRY'S FORMIDABLE 
SKILLS AGAIN ARE SETTING HIM APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTY NOBLE, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "If Darryl does his work, if he comes to the park every day ready to play and 
keeps himself in shape, if he does everything he's supposed to do, he can be 
one of the five greatest players of all time. But if he dogs it and just 
doesn't do what's necessary, if he lays down and tries to get by with just his 
talent, he might be one of the 10 best of all time."  
</P>
<P>
 John Stearns, 1983 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He hardly knew Darryl Strawberry back then, and what we did know about him 
focused almost exclusively on his magnificent baseball skills, the feats he 
already had accomplished with them and the future they appear to be building. 
</P>
<P>
 It was mid-May of his rookie season. Strawberry had been promoted to the major 
leagues some two weeks earlier when Stearns, awed by what he had witnessed, 
offered an evaluation that was prophetic in one regard: Strawberry too often 
relied only on talent. But he had so much, sometimes talent alone was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Skills, talent, tools. Darryl Strawberry was about playing the game then, 
nothing else. No mention of guns, alcohol, paternity suits, substance abuse, 
swings at a teammate, divorces, threats against a teammate, a book, a back, a 
baby. Skills, talent and tools. He became prominent because of them. The other 
stuff followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Skills, talent and tools. Those are the words scouts use. And even with all 
the superlatives that normally preceded them back then, they seemed 
insufficient in Strawberry's case. When Joe McIlvaine said, "I can't say enough 
about him," he meant precisely that. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 11 summers, two uniforms, two rehabs, one surgery and untold broken 
promises later, it's all about skills once again. And Strawberry's skills 
remain remarkable: remarkable for what they are, stunning because they exist 
after all he's endured and all he has caused himself to endure. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons that have little to do with his innate talents, he never has been 
and never will be the player Stearns, McIlvaine, Frank Cashen, et al., 
envisioned back then. But the 32-year-old San Francisco Giants right fielder 
still comes equipped with tools that few current players have. 
</P>
<P>
 He still hits a baseball with extraordinary power. It always was his prowess 
as a powerhitter and run-producer that most distinguished him from his peers. 
But even now, he runs with diminished, but above-average, speed and throws with 
power, albeit without accuracy and sometimes without purpose. Indeed, 
Strawberry still can turn a game with his skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed and I'm not amazed," said Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics' 
assistant general manager who began his professional career with Strawberry and 
the Mets in 1980. "I'm amazed because it's been a long time now and he's been 
through a lot. But I'm not at all surprised because it's Darryl. I've known him 
since we were both 18, and he was the best all-around athlete I ever saw. He's 
not much less than that now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen (on television) most of the games he's played since he's come back, 
not wire to wire, but most of most of the games. And he doesn't look much 
different. He hasn't lost anything in his swing." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Phillies Manager Jim Fregosi has seen Strawberry in five of the 
10 games Strawberry has played since his July 7 debut with the Giants, and he 
sees diminished skills in two related areas: speed and his ability to get to 
balls in the outfield. "But it's not a difference," Fregosi said Tuesday night. 
"And I don't think they brought Darryl in over there to upgrade their outfield 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're talking just about his offense ... no difference. His swing looks 
the same to me. Great bat speed." 
</P>
<P>
 It is that bat speed, always the focal point of any evaluation of Strawberry's 
skills, that is responsible for the .324 average, two home runs and nine RBI he 
has produced in 34 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed at which the bat moves through the hitting zone won't increase, but 
other elements of Strawberry's hitting may improve. At least he thinks so. "I'm 
not there yet," Strawberry said Tuesday after the Giants' 5-2 loss to the 
Phillies, their first defeat since Strawberry joined the team and one night 
after he left a game in the second inning with a tight left hamstring. 
"Everything needs polish. I have to refine every part of my game. Right now, 
I'm about where I'd be in March, if this was spring training." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi disagrees somewhat. "With him there behind (Barry) Bonds and (Matt) 
Williams ... it gives me a lot to think about. He might think he can get 
better. But he's pretty damn good right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Montague was the plate umpire Monday night in Philadelphia when Strawberry 
drove in two runs in the first inning against Shawn Boskie. Montague was 
impressed not only by the hit -- a line drive struck with such force that it 
caromed so far off the right-field wall that Strawberry was held to a single -- 
but also that Strawberry delayed his swing long enough to hit Boskie's changeup 
fair. "His timing seemed fine," Montague said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry said: "It can get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he expects significant improvement, enough that next season will yield 
numbers comparable to those he produced with the Mets: 30-35 home runs and 
90-100 RBI a season. And he's convinced his career is seven years from its 
ending; a happy ending at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost time -- about two years when you think about everything," 
Strawberry said. "That's 50 or 60 home runs and maybe 200 RBI. I can say that 
now because my skills are still there. So if I didn't get hurt and if I didn't 
mess up my life, I could have done a lot more by now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can figure out how much I cost myself. I can't get that time back. But I 
can take care of myself now and try to extend my career longer than it was 
going to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I thought about retiring. I thought about a lot of things. Now I've 
got my career back. I can still produce. I probably won't have a year like 
everybody always said I should have. But the way I'm thinking right now, I can 
be as good as my talent lets me be. ... I don't think it's been that way for me 
for a long time."

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; FOR AZINGER, BIRDIES AREN'T EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those professional athletes who feel invincible, who think it will never 
end, listen to Paul Azinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all think we're in control of our lives, but we're not," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months after learning he had a cancerous tumor, it may be that Azinger, 
at 34, has a better understanding of his own life now. 
</P>
<P>
 He has completed radiation treatments and an unexpected out-patient surgical 
procedure to remove a fatty tumor in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged, I'm cured," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful when I wake up and can see the ceiling. A lot of people take 
sight for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger is planning on resuming his career at the PGA Championship Aug. 11-14 
at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa. He is the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably wouldn't have targeted the PGA for my return if I wasn't the 
defending champ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation that Azinger might start his comeback this week at 
the New England Classic, which he also won last year, but the surgery set him 
back three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger did stop by Pleasant Valley Country Club in Sutton, Mass., to say 
hello. For the rest of his life, he said, he will know how fortunate he has 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm eternally grateful to those who went before me," Azinger said. "Lymphoma 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've realized how easy it is to lift someone's spirits by just writing or 
saying something. I've got a new calling -- I need to be an inspiration to 
people. I have a chance to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his golf game, Azinger says he has been spending a lot of time at work 
with clubs in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't chip good, it's not because of lack of practice," he said. "My 
swing isn't pretty, but it repeats." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger said he hit his first three-irons, three-woods and drivers last 
Tuesday. He said he didn't hit them very well, but he hit them hard and felt no 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no pain in my shoulder whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for what he expects to do on the course, Azinger said he has learned a lot 
about expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'll be as competitive as ever," he said. "I know initially it 
will be tough to concentrate with all the attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but for inspiration, all Azinger has to do is look at himself. 
</P>

 High Price: How confident was Nick Price in his putting at the British Open? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently a lot more than he was at the U.S. Open when he put five putters in 
his bag. At Turnberry, Price had only one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Price: For what it's worth, in his two previous majors, Price finished 
35th at the Masters and missed the cut at the U.S. Open.

<P>
 It's mental, right? What percentage of golf is physical and what percentage is 
mental? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the million-dollar question, isn't it?" said Patrick J. Cohn, a sports 
psychologist in Naples, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask any player, if you've got a good swing, it's 80% mental," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn is part of an expanding breed of golf helpers in the clinical field, even 
if his clinic is the golf course. He works with PGA Tour golfers Trevor Dodds, 
Grant Waite and Kelly Gibson and consults with players on the LPGA, Nike and 
Asian tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn earned a doctorate in sports psychology at the University of Virginia and 
taught the subject at Miami of Ohio and North Texas and is the author of two 
books -- "The Mental Game of Golf" and "Mind Power Putting." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to staying on top of your golf game is to maintain your confidence, 
Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players need to learn to accept mistakes and be a little more kind to 
themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To golfers who doubt the value of a sports psychologist, Cohn said they may be 
confused by his job label. 
</P>
<P>
 "When some people hear psychologist, they think we are shrinks and analysts," 
he said. "I'm just another person on the support team. I'm the mental coach."

FAMILIAR PROBLEM AT RUIDOSO DOWNS; GAMBLING: LIKE AT HOLLYWOOD PARK, HORSEMEN 
ARE WARY OF ON-TRACK VIDEO GAMING, BUT MANAGEMENT SAYS IT IS THE KEY TO 
SURVIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Wells got his first look at New Mexico on one of those days when some of 
the real estate is headed for the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
 It was spring of 1960, and the 10-year-old from Pawhuska, Okla., and his 
father had arrived at a race track where a good trainer and a fast quarterhorse 
could win a fortune in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget my first drive into this place," says Wells. "The wind was 
blowing and the dust was flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited because it was so much grander than anything I had seen up 
to that time. I knew it was a special place." 
</P>
<P>
 What has always made Ruidoso Downs special is the All American Futurity, the 
richest event in quarterhorse racing. It began as a 400-yard sprint in 1959 
with a purse of $129,000 and has grown to where the winner earns $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after their first trip to Ruidoso, Wells and his father Ted Wells 
Jr. shared an All American victory. The elder Wells was the trainer of Savannah 
Jr., winner of the 1965 futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells' affection for the little New Mexico track has never wavered -- not 
during his college days at Texas Christian, not during the years he worked with 
some of the nation's best trainers from Kentucky to California and not now as 
the track's new general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've raced from France to San Francisco and every place in between," says 
Wells, former assistant general manager at Hollywood Park who was named general 
manager at Ruidoso Downs last month. "I still feel that this place has an 
excitement, a beauty about it and a closeness to the sport you don't find 
anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruidoso Downs is still the place to race quarterhorses, but unlike three 
decades ago, it is not the only game in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Video gaming machines by the hundreds operate daily on a nearly 24-hour basis 
on the neighboring Mescalero Apache Indian reservation. And like the other New 
Mexico racetracks, Ruidoso Downs is feeling the pinch from losing to slot 
machines the dollars that used to end up at pari-mutuel windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of pari-mutuel wagering at tracks in Texas and Oklahoma also has 
cut into Ruidoso's business, but horsemen in New Mexico are convinced most of 
the danger is much closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition from the Texas tracks doesn't worry me nearly as much as 
what's happening right down the street," says Wells. "That's the real threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first 2 1/2 months of racing this summer, Ruidoso Downs' handle 
was down more than 8% from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state considers video gambling illegal, tribes in New Mexico 
operate casino-like gaming under the auspices of the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
Act approved by Congress in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 A constitutional amendment on the November general election ballot would 
legalize a state lottery and wagering on video machine games of chance. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be up to the legislature to decide where the gaming machines would 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 If the amendment is approved by the voters, the horse racing industry is 
expected to lobby for legislation that would allow tracks to open up 
video-gaming rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been a racetrack survive anywhere that's had to operate in 
competition with nearby casinos, unless they're (tracks) allowed to have some 
kind of participation," Wells says. 
</P>
<P>
 Video-gaming machines at racetracks is not a new idea. 
</P>
<P>
 They are used in Louisiana to help the struggling horse racing industry there. 
Under a new law, 0.5% of the tax on video draw poker machines will go into a 
fund to increase purse money for horse races. The fund is expected to generate 
$2.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a great deal of reluctance among the purists about accepting video 
gaming machines at Louisiana Downs, but it was a matter of survival," Wells 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first the horsemen resisted, but what has happened in the last three years 
is they have kept racing alive at Louisiana Downs and The Fairgrounds (in New 
Orleans)." 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico political leaders say that until the voters decide on the 
constitutional amendment, it's premature to speculate how the legislature will 
deal with video gaming machines. But at least one powerful lawmaker says he 
would support putting the machines at tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the race tracks will get some strong consideration to get the 
machines," says state Sen. Manny Aragon, the Senate's president pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon and House Speaker Ray Sanchez agree horse racing in New Mexico needs 
help, but Sanchez points out approval of video gaming statewide will create 
intense lobbying by other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells says he left Hollywood Park, one of the nation's top tracks, because 
he's convinced Ruidoso still has the potential he saw 34 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like a challenge I think I can win," he says. "We've got to remind people 
that they have a very historic and interesting place here, that the horse 
racing industry in New Mexico is still viable and capable of growth and new 
vitality. But first we've got to get back on a level playing field."

IMPROBABLE DREAMS STILL PART OF THE PICTURE FOR DOUGLAS; BOXING: DESPITE 
NEAR-FATAL BOUT WITH DIABETES THREE WEEKS AGO, FORMER CHAMPION GOES SO FAR AS 
TO THINK OF REMATCH WITH TYSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 11, 1990, James "Buster" Douglas realized the improbable dream of 
becoming the heavyweight champion of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 His knockout of Mike Tyson -- in a fight held in Tokyo because there were no 
takers for the expected mismatch in the United States -- was perhaps the 
biggest upset in boxing history. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheers quickly faded after his disgraceful loss to Evander Holyfield eight 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Douglas is at peace and satisfied with his life, despite a near-fatal 
bout with diabetes three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He's even thinking about a rematch with Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Nallie, Douglas' business manager and friend, has been approached by a 
Tyson lawyer who has proposed a rematch when Tyson is released next year from 
prison, where he serving a sentence for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the end of next year, beginning of the following year," Douglas said. 
"It's something I've thought about considerably." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, his major concern is his fight against diabetes. Weighing 310 pounds 
and wearing dreadlocks, the 34-year-old concentrates on following his doctor's 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times a day, Douglas sticks a pin in his finger to draw and test his own 
blood. Twice a day, he administers his own insulin shots. Before spending eight 
days in a hospital, he said he was a zombie because of the chemical imbalance 
inside him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank God every day when I get up," said Douglas, relaxing recently in a 
Harley-Davidson T-shirt. "I asked for one thing and it's like my cup runneth 
over. I made a few mistakes along the way, but I still thank him for the 
blessings he bestowed upon me." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, who splits his time between a home in his native Colubmus and a 
mansion on Marco Island, Fla., says he still has a large chunk of the $24.1 
million he was paid for getting knocked out by Holyfield in the third round of 
his only title defense on Oct. 25, 1990. That was his last fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss heaped scorn on Douglas, roundly criticized for not trying harder to 
get up. 
</P>
<P>
 More devastating to him than all that criticism, however, was the death of his 
mother. Lula Pearl Douglas died two weeks before he stunned Tyson with a 
10th-round knockout. He said he was depressed for a year over her death. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Douglas prefers to count his blessings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the problems I have now could be worse. But I wouldn't trade them for 
anything in the world," he said. "I have three beautiful sons and a beautiful 
wife. I'm doing some things I like and changing some things I don't. And 
believe it or not, I face challenges every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas keeps busy. He manages two fighters, looks over his business 
interests, coaches in a midnight basketball league, gives time and money to 
charity, makes personal appearances, and answers his mail. 
</P>
<P>
 He also oversees the foundation he founded and named for his mother. He has 
named a community center in Columbus in her honor, and is planning other 
development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 His best times, he says, are spent with his sons: LaMar, 16, who lives with 
his mother; 3-year-old Cardae; and Arthur, who just had his first birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing remains a part of him. He still watches bouts on TV and measures 
himself against the fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 He still believes he might have at least one fight left. He walks 3 1/2 miles 
a day and -- partly because of the diabetes -- has begun carefully watching his 
diet. He works out in the gym with the fighters he manages with his father, 
Bill, a former professional boxer himself. 
</P>
<P>
 With the proper training, he said, he could get down to 235 or 245 pounds. 
After all, he said he weighed 300 pounds before beginning training for the 
Holyfield fight. He was at 280 when he went to Las Vegas a month before the 
fight and said he trained hard to get to the 247 he weighed for the fight. He 
weighed 232 against Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas blamed those in his own camp for what he called his "miserable" 
conditioning. He said everyone told him what he wanted to hear and no one made 
him get in shape. He since has cut all ties with his former manager, John 
Johnson, and trainer, J.D. McAuley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember (Holyfield manager) Lou Duva saying, 'How could they bring him in 
here like that? They should have canceled the fight!' He was right. We should 
have," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would a man who is financially secure and surrounded by comfort and loved 
ones return to the ring? 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, he said, he envisioned a career that would put him in the 
ranks of Frazier, Ali, Marciano and Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he would go back to boxing because of his regret over what might have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a beautiful situation. We had the championship of the world and we 
didn't owe anybody," he said. "And we lost it. We could have had it as long as 
we wanted it. Instead, we said, 'Here, you can have it back."'

GIVING HMOS THE CHECKUP THEY DESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a 40-year-old physician in my own private medical practice for 16 years 
(yes, I was young and idealistic when I started), I see idealism is still alive 
but maybe in need of reality testing. What Dr. Alan Zwerner fails to mention in 
his article ("The Corporate Physician Has Much More to Offer the Patient," July 
17) is that in virtually all HMOs, physicians are financially penalized (or as 
he states "at risk") or may be terminated from a plan, for referring the "frail 
and catastrophically ill patients" for more advanced care. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are ill, do you want your physician (or "provider" as most HMOs refer 
to physicians) to choose between your health and his/her paycheck? You only 
need to look at several recent judgments against HMOs, including the infamous 
Health Net case, to see that it does occur with catastrophic results to the 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
 One must also remember that most HMOs are for profit corporations with 
executives who are ultimately responsible to the shareholders. How can you 
promise the utmost in care (even with "volume discounts") when you must deliver 
ever-larger profits to the shareholders to justify the ever-increasing stock 
prices? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally and unfortunately, "quality" is increasingly being measured in terms 
of cost with reduction in cost being equated (in the corporate setting) with 
increasing "quality." In a traditional doctor-patient relationship, if you feel 
you are not receiving quality care, you can easily "fire" your physician and 
find another. It's not so easy to "fire" your HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical care is like any other commodity in this world -- there is no free 
lunch. But maybe with some reform we can at least afford a "diet plate" that 
affords the preservation of the traditional doctor-patient relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL D. MYERS, M.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Times printed several articles on health care that advocate managed 
care and HMOs as the solution to the health care cost problem and dismiss 
concerns about quality in a managed care system. 
</P>
<P>
 One article, by Alan Zwerner who apparently is a medical director/employee of 
an HMO group in Orange County, states that prepaid HMO doctors are superior in 
quality to private practice, fee for service doctors. He supports this premise 
by endorsing "practice guidelines," which are rules for the treatment of 
various diseases derived from what is called "outcomes research." He may be 
correct but the use of guidelines and outcomes research is in its infancy. 
Those of us who have been studying this subject for years know that outcomes 
research is just coming into use and is not yet a practical tool for monitoring 
quality of care on a large scale. It is a fact that the early use of this 
technique, back as far as 1977, showed that private practice, fee-for-service 
doctors responded rapidly to change their practices when outcomes research 
demonstrated a better way to do things. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a fact that most HMOs do not have any systematic guidelines to 
standardize care of their patients. The most disturbing fact is that the Group 
Health Assn. of America, an HMO lobby, is fiercely opposed to any outside 
monitoring of quality in HMOs under health reform. The state of California is 
similarly opposed to outside quality monitoring in the Medi-Cal program. As a 
proponent, in spite of my independent private practice, of managed care and a 
board member of one of the Medicare Peer Review Organizations, which has spent 
years learning to monitor quality in the health care system we have, I am 
worried about the battle going on in Congress over the quality issue in the 
health reform debate. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent serious errors, many who are concerned about health care quality 
(as opposed to cost) believe that only outside monitoring of HMOs will protect 
the public and the HMOs themselves from the pressure of economics on decisions 
about rationing. Every competitive sport I know of has some form of referee. 
The HMO industry, through the GHAA, fiercely opposes any outside review, but I 
believe that they are mistaken. We should not have to rely on the malpractice 
bar to monitor quality in health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Plan is behind the curve of what is happening now in California 
with groups like Dr. Zwerner's. They may, indeed, be as good as he says, but 
someone has to be the referee as the rules change in the health care business. 
Please make it someone other than the lawyers.

AN OASIS IN THE DESERT; EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE BUILDS TOWARD A SOLID FUTURE IN 
CALIFORNIA'S SHAKY ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. military base closings were inevitable after the bipolar military 
standoff with the old Soviet Union came to an end. Few, however, anticipated 
the extent of the hit that our state would take in these matters, especially 
after our voters had helped elect the current administration in Washington. A 
federal commission called for the jettisoning of 35 bases nationwide, but a 
staggering 20% of them were right here in California. It served notice of 
another monumental blow to the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But we're pleased to note that there has been one bright star in an otherwise 
overcast evening of closings and quarrels over what to do with the land when 
the military departs. The high desert's Edwards Air Force Base was on the 
cutting edge of aerospace technology back when pilots were merely struggling to 
break the sound barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in an era of painful, but necessary Armed Forces downsizing, Edwards is 
flourishing. Heck, it's undergoing a construction boom. So far, it has also 
fared well in a politically charged rivalry with the Navy's Patuxent River 
flight test center in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 In the biggest single addition to Edwards AFB in decades, for example, a 
950-person air wing was transferred here from Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. 
Another $11.9 million is pouring in to construct a new office building for 
Edwards' own 412th Test Wing Staff. Edwards' budget has also grown steadily in 
recent years, from $363 million in fiscal year 1992 to $457 million in the 
current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The base also expects another $50 million to computerize a high-tech chamber 
where aircraft electronic warfare systems can be tested without outside 
electrical interference or fear of satellite surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 Its ideal flight conditions and the enormous dry-lake runways that are 
frequently used for space shuttle landings also figure to be key points in the 
next round of base closings and consolidations. Edwards may yet face daunting 
competition from its Navy counterpart in Maryland. For now, however, its 
welcome boost to the California economy is a success story to be savored.

WHY NOT HOLD THE CRIMINALS RESPONSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial "How Many Guns Are Enough?" (June 19) is yet another example 
of the illogical and fuzzy thinking typical of those who seek to reduce crime 
by restricting non-criminals' access to firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial initially related an anecdote regarding an unnamed judge whose 
house was burglarized and firearms stolen. The Times then blamed the 
unfortunate judge (who was after all the victim), for ". . . arming the 
neighborhood crooks to the teeth." This absurd suggestion is akin to blaming 
the victim of a carjacking when his car is later used in a bank robbery! What 
ever happened to holding the criminal wrongdoer responsible? 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial then related five incidents in which the perpetrator used a 
firearm. It is always a tragedy when an innocent person is injured during the 
commission of a crime, whether a gun is used or not. However, the facts The 
Times conveniently ignored tell the real story. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, you mention research that indicates an armed public actually 
reduces crime. Indeed, it is well documented that firearms in the hands of 
law-abiding citizens thwart several million crimes nationwide each year. The 
Times further ignored the fact that just .02% of the firearms in America are 
involved in fatalities each year. The Times also ignored the fact that courts 
have routinely held that police do not have a legal obligation to protect 
citizens from criminal activity. And it should certainly be obvious to 
everyone, even The Times, that the police are not protecting citizens from 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, The Times suggests some 70 million law-abiding Americans voluntarily 
disarm themselves and remain completely defenseless, all because a small number 
of criminals use guns to commit crimes. Somehow I think most readers will see 
through this faulty logic. I know for certain 70 million of us will.

AT PIERCE COLLEGE, BIGGER ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Four times recently, articles have appeared in the Valley section about 
Pierce College and its president, Mary Lee. Each one emphasized the college's 
need for money. They described cutting courses to save money, adding needed 
courses to attract more students, commercial enterprises such as a golf range. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lee, judging by past performance at Valley College, is the best college 
administrator in the L.A. Community College District, so she will probably pull 
Pierce out of the financial mess it's in. But even she ignores certain facts 
that influence Pierce and other community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 1. The Woodland Hills Homeowners Assn. is not concerned with Pierce College 
students, their education or their well-being. It is concerned with property 
values. And if closing the college would double these values, it would advocate 
closing the college tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 2. There is no such thing as the Pierce College Farm. Rather, one of the major 
contributors to the fiscal difficulties of Pierce College is the misuse made of 
about two-thirds of the 427 acres mislabeled "the farm." It is land devoted to 
nine disparate programs offering 60 courses (in spring, 1994), from floristry 
(is that flower arranging?) to equitation, or horseback riding. These programs 
attract a few hundred students, most part time, of the 15,000 enrolled at 
Pierce. While taking up more than 50% of the land, these "agricultural" 
programs account for less than 4% of the enrollment. And the college is 
allocated money on the basis of enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 A million dollars could probably be saved each year by just doing away with 
these programs, reassigning or dismissing the agriculture faculty and getting 
rid of the small herds of cattle, swine, sheep and horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, college administrators everywhere should face the fact that bigger 
is not necessarily better. In all California community colleges, the grade W, 
for "withdrew," is the most common. At Los Angeles community colleges, 
including Pierce, Valley and Mission colleges, thousands of Ws are assigned 
every semester. Could that not be interpreted as a sign that the colleges are 
doing something wrong in course offerings, advising or teaching? Let's not 
worry about getting more students. Let us be concerned with satisfying the 
needs of the students we already have.

PROSECUTORS GETTING TOUGH WITH BATTERERS; WHEN VICTIM RECANTS, A 911 TAPE HELPS 
WIN CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States surgeon general says that battering is the nation's single 
largest cause of injury to women. That makes it a problem of immense 
proportions, and prosecutors here in California have finally begun to respond 
by seeking harsher penalties for domestic violence. They are also trying out 
several new approaches to obtain convictions. A local case points out the 
importance of this emphasis, especially when the victim does not appear to be a 
victim at all. 
</P>
<P>
 To the casual observer at the Van Nuys Municipal Court, for example, a 
particular couple might have appeared to be very much in love. In fact, the 
defendant, Koeppel Hall of North Hollywood, was so engrossed in hugging and 
kissing his girlfriend that Judge Gregg Marcus had to tell them both to cool 
off. It was an example of an aspect of domestic violence that is almost as 
chilling as the violence itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months earlier, the same 22-year-old girlfriend had dialed the emergency 
number of the Los Angeles Police Department. In a frightening, three-minute 
call, she cried, pleaded for paramedics, and described a violent attack. "My 
boyfriend of mine just jumped on me," she told a 911 dispatcher. "My back is 
bruised bad. My face is bruised." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, an unemployed laborer and an ex-convict who had served a five-year 
prison stint for manslaughter, was arrested shortly afterward. Among other 
things, police also made note of long scratches on the girlfriend's back and 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 But as is too often the case in domestic violence situations, the girlfriend 
recanted and claimed that nothing had happened even though the physical 
evidence, and that 911 call, suggested otherwise. This kind of denial from an 
abused woman or man can come either from fear or misplaced optimism. In this 
case, the girlfriend claimed that she suffered from flashbacks, and that Hall 
had only been trying to calm her down. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors tried the case anyway, with the 911 tape as their best 
evidence. The victim had become a reluctant -- if not hostile -- witness, but 
justice prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury deliberated two days before finding Hall guilty of battery. Judge 
Marcus recently showed his sympathy with the jury's verdict by leveling the 
maximum sentence allowed under the law: one year of incarceration. "If it 
warrants it (the maximum), I give it," Judge Marcus said later in chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an example of the kind of case that can -- and should -- be brought 
against the perpetrators of domestic violence, even if the victim has decided 
not to press charges or to deny that the incident ever occurred. The city 
attorney's office, which prosecuted the case, did the right thing here. In one 
very sad respect, however, this case is not yet finished, nor should it be. 
</P>
<P>
 More people are now willing to report domestic violence. More victimized women 
are seeking help by calling hot lines in record numbers, and the San Fernando 
Valley's only shelter for battered women, Haven Hills, is making progress in 
trying to open the county's first long-term housing complex for battered women. 
But the girlfriend in that Van Nuys courtroom case is an example of a 
frightening need that must be addressed. It's the need for some victims to 
realize that they are victims.

AN OPEN DOOR TO ANOTHER DISASTER; ENTERING QUAKE-DAMAGED BUILDINGS WITHOUT 
CONTACTING SAFETY EXPERTS INVITES TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few could blame photographer Joel Greenberg for wanting to retrieve the bulk 
of his work from his quake-damaged North Hollywood studio. Well, that's exactly 
what Greenberg did at the Laurel Plaza Mall last Monday, despite the not 
inconsiderable risk of possible exposure to asbestos, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that particular mall is the subject of a dispute between its tenants 
-- who at least want to follow Greenberg's lead -- and the property's 
Cleveland, Ohio-based owners. The tenants have accused the owners of delaying 
repairs while they focus instead on plans for a brand-new mall. 
</P>
<P>
 We are concerned with another matter entirely, however: the impact Greenberg's 
daring rush might have on the thousands of other Los Angeles merchants and 
residents who are equally desperate to retrieve beloved belongings from damaged 
structures. It would be dangerous in the extreme to enter badly damaged 
buildings without advice or supervision. Some may be too dangerous to enter 
under any circumstances. Simply put, there is a right way and a wrong way to go 
about this. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a merchant, tenant or owner of one of the remaining 870 red-tagged 
structures that have been off-limits since the quake, or of one of the 4,386 
structures where only limited entry is allowed, you should first call the 
city's Possession Retrieval Team. That number is 818-786-7393, and it operates 
on weekdays, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Takaki, chief of the Bureau of Community Safety of the city's Department 
of Building and Safety, says that the team will assess the dangers involved in 
your building, shore up walls if necessary, and perhaps even call in the Fire 
Department to help move the goods out of the structure. That's the safe way to 
proceed. Taking chances and entering quake-damaged buildings entirely on one's 
own will only to add to the tragedies that have already been tallied.

LET'S AGGRESSIVELY FIGHT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Illegal immigration will be a deciding issue for many voters in November. 
One of the candidates for Congress, Rich Sybert, has a reasoned and non-bigoted 
plan (Valley Commentary June 26).His opponent, incumbent Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills), talks a good game but falls short in action. Mr. Beilenson 
introduced five good bills in Congress at the beginning of the term and is 
politely waiting for them to die in the Judiciary Committee at the end of his 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen years of Mr. Beilenson's non-actions is enough. When 10% of the 
population of another country is encouraged (by both our policies and theirs) 
to illegally emigrate, it is prudent for society to exercise some control. We 
need to reduce the incentives and to enforce the laws of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States welcomes more immigrants legally each year than the rest of 
the world's countries combined. Our hospitality should be respected, not 
abused. Mr. Sybert has a good plan.

IT'S UNREALISTIC FOR PARENTS TO INTERVIEW TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * With all due respect to my colleague Adrienne Mack (Valley Commentary, July 
10), her proposal that parents interview their child's prospective teachers is 
extremely unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have some validity for elementary school teachers, but middle and high 
school teachers have five periods with a class load of as many as 40 per class 
-- that's 200 students.Where would a teacher find the time to hold such 
interviews? 
</P>
<P>
 Mack also contradicts herself in one sentence: "Pupils can request specific 
teachers, but whether the request is honored depends on the counselor and 
whatever rules the principal may have laid down." Few principals would be so 
foolish as to allow students to pick individual teachers. Schools have enough 
problems just getting the programming done without the incredible complexity 
that would result from students requests. And if a pupil wants a particular 
teacher, it may be that a "popular" teacher isn't necessarily the one with the 
most demanding standards and expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking a teacher about the college degree, experience, professional reading 
and convention attendance sounds interesting. Perhaps parents can also extend 
this idea when meeting with their doctors, bankers, accountants, dentists and 
attorneys. Pharmacists put their diplomas on the wall. So do barbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the best way for parents to meet teachers and to get to know them is 
by attending open house and back-to-school nights. Too bad so many parents 
don't bother to show up for these events.

VOLUNTEERS ARE FINE, BUT WE NEED VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * No doubt I would not write this letter had our agency been mentioned in your 
recent series of articles on homelessness in the Valley (July 5). 
</P>
<P>
 I have no quarrel with the articles. Most of the professionals quoted and the 
agencies identified are friends of ours, with whom we regularly share clients 
and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Here let me blow our horn: A generalist office, we see about 35,000 people 
annually. We provide food, clothing, emergency shelter, transitional housing, 
employment assistance, counseling and case management. The last on the list is 
becoming increasingly important as we work more and more with families on the 
verge of homelessness, or just fallen into it. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not enough transitional housing, as you noted, or affordable permanent 
housing. As of the 1990 census, there were 396,160 households in the Valley 
(leaving out Burbank and points east), and 61,805 receiving $15,000 or less per 
year. Median rent is $706, which means that a lot of people are paying 50% to 
70% of income on housing and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 To boot, there aren't enough jobs that provide the money for housing -- and 
Aid to Families with Dependent Children doesn't do it either, never mind 
general relief, some $200 a month with food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an aggregate and systemic problem. At this point comes my criticism of 
your work: "How Can I help?" No, not by sending food or volunteering for a 
couple of hours a week. Instead, the answer is political advocacy and job 
creation -- more macro-level stuff. If we had to depend on donated time or 
food, we'd serve maybe 10% of the people we actually reach. What we need much 
more of are voters who'll say: This has got to stop, this homelessness, this 
joblessness!

THANKS FOR COVERING OPERATION IMMUNIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was pleased that you took time to recognize Operation Immunization in your 
recent editorial "The Drive to Save Lives" (June 26). I am delighted that the 
Los Angeles Unified School District has joined with UniHealth America and many 
others to make our schools available for the provision of immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the advances of modern medicine and the availability of free or 
low-cost immunizations in many clinics, too many children in our community are 
not obtaining this essential protection against disease. Schools are a logical 
place to offer this basic health service, in light of their accessible 
locations and familiarity to families. The delivery of health services at 
schools is a key component of the LEARN plan now under way in our district. 
This is public/private partnership at its best.

NATURE'S SILVER LINING; FOLLOWING THE QUAKE AND A 'WINTER OF DISCONTENT,' 
SPRING BROUGHT SOLACE TO A NORTHRIDGE YARD THROUGH THE SWEET SOUNDS OF A 
MOCKINGBIRD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SALPER, Don Salper of Northridge is a professor emeritus at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was "the winter of our discontent" in Los Angeles, and I for one have 
felt some depression after the earthquake, even though I personally suffered 
little loss. I believe it is partly from the initial shock, partly from 
aftershock "reminders," and partly from seeing that the city around me is going 
to be a long time recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, it was reassuring this spring to find that nature is also capable 
of offering up one of its cheeriest satisfactions right in my own yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Every spring since we moved into our house in Northridge 22 years ago, a 
mockingbird has sung all night in a bottlebrush tree. It is doing so again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The stream of musical utterance is unending and unrepetitive. There are no 
other sounds in the air save distant traffic. Such is the splendor of this 
singing that the first year I heard it I recorded it to send back to my mother 
in Minnesota where mockingbirds, alas, do not bless the day or evening air with 
their voices. 
</P>
<P>
 My bird handbook shows that mockingbirds make permanent residence across the 
entire southern United States. There are related species south of us in the 
Americas, but none elsewhere. These irrepressible musicians create an 
exclusively New World symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an uncanny display, and I have concentrated for 20 minutes and more at a 
time without hearing a single musical phrase reprised. The other night I 
thought, "Oh, there's another bird answering," because the pitch level of the 
notes went way down, but then I realized no, it's just a part of my bird's 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 I know the mockingbird mimics other birds and other sounds, but its "computer 
storage" must be enormous, for none of those sounds is immediately present to 
its hearing or has been heard in our cul-de-sac for hours. I have tried my own 
whistle with its own rhythmic beat and found the mockingbird picking it up for 
a phrase or two. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some additional reading I've done, mockingbirds ( Mimus 
polyglottos , the "many-tongued mimic") have been known to imitate as many as 
150 different species, including the storied nightingale brought over in cages 
from England -- sound spectrographic recordings showed the mockingbirds sang 
exact reproductions of every liquid, lyric nightingale note, even to pitches 
beyond human hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 And other birds aren't the only things they mock, one throwing a high school 
football game into confusion by imitating the referee's whistle, another 
joining in an outdoor Washington symphony concert to mimic the flute imitating 
the bird calls in "Peter and the Wolf"! 
</P>
<P>
 Why does this bird sing at night? Maybe to have the whole sound stage to 
itself. No other bird competes. But I can imagine other birds up, as I am, 
their beaks open, like my mouth, in head-shaking awe at this scintillating, 
exuberant, never-stop performance. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Kimball Garrett, ornithologist at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Natural History, about this, and he says the nighttime singing of an expanded 
repertoire may reflect the quality of my bird's territory. It is the male that 
sings, and such virtuosity could proclaim his prowess in possessing a good 
perch in a good tree in a good open area which he commands. The operatic 
auditioning of multiple "roles" probably serves also to attract and hold a mate 
as well as to intimidate rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 And why does the bird continue for weeks and months through spring and early 
summer? Garrett suggests elevated hormonal levels that call forth song even 
beyond territorial and mating functions. Until the hormone fades, he simply 
must sing. 
</P>
<P>
 I know from Garrett that in 22 years, at least three or four generations of 
mockingbirds have inhabited the tree with the melodious outpouring. But that is 
not the way it seems to me. It seems like one bird, the same bird, through all 
the years, on the same branch in the same dark hours; as unchanging and 
entrancing as earthquakes seem to be unpredictable and wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to think it is the same bird, returned each year to cheer my 
spirits, astonish my ear, dumbfound the whole neighborhood. So that even if 
earthquakes come, mysterious, sudden and potent, we know that there are other 
natural events, more regular, more frequent, more welcome, if no less 
mysterious, to help heal our shaken souls. The Mockingbird: A Master Mimic 
</P>
<P>
 Sonograms show the amazing ability of mockingbirds to imitate other species' 
bird songs. This mockingbird was recorded in 1975. The vertical axis shows the 
pitch of the sounds, the horizontal axis the elapsed time. The mockingbird 
matched each note closely but delivered them at a faster rate. "The mockingbird 
was in a very excited state and delivered about 12 different mimics all in very 
rapid succession," a researcher reported.

CANADIAN TAKES A HARD LOOK AT U.S. CITIZENSHIP; AFTER 20 YEARS, HE DECIDED TO 
TAKE THE PLUNGE. THAT MEANT STUDYING FOR THE TEST AND GRAPPLING WITH THE 
PROSPECT OF A NEW IDENTITY. IN THE END, THOUGH, TIMING WAS THE REAL ISSUE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 You'd think as an adult, you'd know your own mind. But sometimes your mind 
knows things that you don't find out till later. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, I decided to become an American citizen. It was a surprising 
decision. For 20 years, I'd been very happy being a Canadian citizen who 
happened to work, pay taxes, marry, buy a house and raise a family in the 
United States. But in my heart, I was still 100% Canadian, even though I did 
nothing there but visit once a year in the week that wasn't cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The impulse hit me the way motherhood hits childless women in their 30s. 
Suddenly, I wanted to vote, have a say in things, help decide the future of the 
place my daughter would grow up in. I also had the sense that, for the first 
time in years, we had a President who wasn't totally from another planet, 
someone who inspired the hope that things that weren't right could actually be 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, me? An American? I'm not knocking the place, it's just that you have to 
understand what being an American means to Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
 To Canadians, Americans are the neighbors whose parties are too loud. They're 
the rich uncle you have to be nice to, so he'll give you a nickel. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans behave like there was a contest for Best Country and they retired 
the award in 1945. "Hey," they ask, "can you imagine all those Cubans and 
Haitians and Mexicans risking their lives trying to sneak into Portugal? " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe America does rate the overall crown. But in the lesser categories, 
I'd vote for Holland for Best Tulips, Italy for Best Shoes and India for Best 
Treatment of a Cow. I'd vote for anywhere but here for Best Place Not to be 
Randomly Slain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if you want to take whatever talents you have and try to make the most 
of them, you come to the United States. No question. And if the work is in 
California, they throw in a bonus. Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, but turn my back on Canada? My daughter says, "They'll never run you 
over in Canada." That's her way of saying Canadians are nice guys. And clean. 
Every American who's ever been there always says how clean Canada is. The only 
thing here that's comparable are the bathrooms in Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 As I struggled with these conflicts, I started to study for the test I'd be 
given at my interview, exploring the history and government of America. I love 
to study and I found the material very interesting. "Who succeeds the President 
if he can't perform his duties?" (The vice president.) "Who succeeds him ?" 
(The speaker of the House of Representatives.) 
</P>
<P>
 I learned the duties of the Supreme Court (to interpret laws), what the Bill 
of Rights is (the first 10 amendments to the Constitution) and who elects the 
President (the Electoral College). Helping my daughter with her fifth-grade 
homework, I even memorized the beginning of the Declaration of Independence. It 
wouldn't be on the test, but maybe I could recite it for extra credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then months after I'd applied, a letter came notifying me of the date of my 
appointment. It was 10 days away. I was very excited. I was also upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days left. Ten more days and I become one of the Noisy People. How could I 
do it? How could I be . . . them? And in 10 days, it wouldn't be Them anymore. 
It would be Us. Slavery? That's me. Wiped out the Native Americans? Yo. 
Vietnam, that's me too. Pollution, poverty, crime . . . hey, come on. Nobody's 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 And what am I giving up? Did becoming an American mean I couldn't root for the 
Blue Jays anymore? Was I barred from singing, "O, Canada" at ballgames? How far 
did it go? Did switching sides permanently deny me the right to say, "Eh?" 
</P>
<P>
 "How long is the term of office of a senator?" (Six years.) "Which ship 
brought the Pilgrims to America?" (The Mayflower.) "In what year was the 
Constitution written?" (1787.) 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, early one Wednesday morning I walked into a large room in the 
basement of the Federal Building. It felt like a milestone in my life. I was 
wearing my best sports jacket, shirt, tie and very serious shoes. I could be 
married in these clothes. In a way, I was going to be. I was marrying a 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 I handed a woman my notice of appointment and took a seat near the back of the 
room. Too pumped up to read the book I'd brought, I looked around, noticing 
people of various backgrounds, many speaking languages very different from 
English. I wondered how they'd do on the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes into my wait, my name was called. This was it. I got up with all 
the self-assurance I could muster and headed to the front of the room. But 
instead of directing me to an interview stall, the woman handed me back my 
notice of appointment. There was a small problem, she said. I'd come on the 
wrong day. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked at the letter. She was right. My appointment was for Monday. So how 
come I showed up on Wednesday? 
</P>
<P>
 Trying not to look too jerky in front of the non-English-speaking applicants, 
all of whom knew the difference between Monday and Wednesday, I went off to 
another office to reschedule my appointment. They said it could take months. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, maybe by then I'll be ready.

TRANSIT AGENCY IS MOVING IN REVERSE; ROUTE 786 WAS FIRST COMMUTER BUS FROM 
ANTELOPE VALLEY TO THE WEST LOS ANGELES BUSINESS DISTRICTS. NOW, WITH QUAKE 
DAMAGE REPAIRED, SERVICE IS CANCELED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILLIE J. DICKEY, Billie J. Dickey of Pearblossom has commuted to Century 
City since 1978. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Transit Authority has ended Route 786, the first-ever 
commuter bus to the West Los Angeles business districts. Unless the decision is 
reversed, the last bus ran on July 15. The reason: The interchange at 
Interstate 5 and California 14 is repaired, and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency is no longer subsidizing the route. 
</P>
<P>
 What is wrong with this picture? The fact is that the main road to the 
Westside, the San Diego Freeway, has been the scene of gridlock and congestion 
for 20 years. Many of the drivers stuck in that congestion are from the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The question should not be why is Route 786 being canceled at this time. The 
question should be why haven't the county Board of Supervisors, the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Antelope Valley Transit Authority 
acted prior to 1994 to provide commuter service to West Los Angeles? The answer 
is obvious: Because they did not have to -- until the earthquake mandated 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the earthquake damage repaired, these entities want to put the genie 
back in the bottle and have all of us pretend that it is not possible to solve 
the problems of expensive commuter travel, unmeasurable stress and maddening, 
unnecessary hours, beginning at 5 a.m., sitting dead still among the rocks of 
Agua Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is simply that these agencies did not have to act. The single event 
capable of motivating anything governmental to move is an election. Short of 
the threat of losing one's spot at the public trough, there is no need for 
government to bother trying to improve the quality of day-to-day life for the 
citizenry. The citizens know there is no money to spend on their needs, and 
they just do not ask anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until, that is, when Mother Nature creates such an emergency that government 
is forced to reveal that it is not the sluggish, penniless, inept government 
its citizens had grown accustomed to. To the contrary, this government is 
actually creative and talented -- and has some money stashed away. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of American citizens is to move forward, to progress beyond where 
they were last year. That is why the commuters who have learned to enjoy the 
trip down the 14 and 405 in a bus, marveling in appreciation, safe from 
accidents and breakdowns, at a cost no greater than the monthly automobile fuel 
bill, now find it impossible to accept that they must revert to the old way of 
getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 One agency of government pleads with commuters to leave their cars for public 
transportation and will impose fines on employers of a certain size that fail 
to accommodate van-pooling. On the other hand, we have the Antelope Valley 
Transit Authority sending out press releases announcing that there is no longer 
a need for commuter lines to West Los Angeles and Van Nuys because the freeway 
reopened! 
</P>
<P>
 On what basis is the transit authority requiring commuters to get out of the 
bus and back into their cars? A lack of money of course. Without FEMA money 
there is no money. Forget that the voters recently passed a half-cent sales tax 
to fund transit activity. The transit authority has indicated that the half 
cent is not enough to fund such extravagances as one or two buses to Century 
City. It requires a full cent to afford transit to the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot put the genie back in the bottle. The transit decision-makers must 
take a clear look at the need to move the public from the Antelope Valley to 
its business in West Los Angeles and, with courage, take the necessary action 
to solve this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next year will see federal mandates imposed on L.A. County to meet clean-air 
requirements. If the county of Los Angeles intends to continue receiving 
federal funds, it will have no choice except to provide Antelope Valley 
commuters with an attractive and affordable alternative to their automobiles. 
Route 786 from Lancaster-Palmdale to Century City-Beverly Hills was such an 
alternative. But inexplicably, in the absence of a 6.8 shock, the county cannot 
see the importance of doing everything possible to continue an efficient, 
convenient, affordable service that makes everyone happy. 
</P>
<P>
 As many commuters as possible plan to take off work to attend the transit 
authority board of directors meeting Monday at its headquarters in Lancaster 
and exhort it to restore at least one scheduled bus to the West Los Angeles 
business districts. The outcome of the meeting may be predictable. We must, 
however, do all we can to succeed in this quest.

PARENTS CELEBRATE AT HOAG'S FAMILY REUNION; FAMILY: NEWPORT HOSPITAL'S 
PICNIC-STYLE RECEPTION GIVES COUPLES A CHANCE TO REACQUAINT THEMSELVES WITH 
FERTILITY SPECIALISTS WHO HELPED THEM HAVE BABIES. 
</P>

 Cheryl and Hal Henderson were about to give up their dream of starting a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, they were bumped from doctor to doctor, subjected to dozens of 
tests and given numerous medications. Cheryl underwent intrauterine 
insemination several times. Nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried everything and they just kept telling us there was nothing wrong," 
Cheryl Henderson said. "And since there was nothing medically wrong with either 
one of us, there was no real solution." 
</P>
<P>
 In their last-ditch effort to have a child, the San Clemente couple went to 
fertility services at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach and 
18 months later, Cheryl became pregnant. Matthew was born in the spring of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matt means gift from God," Cheryl, 42, said Saturday as she and her husband 
and their son celebrated with about 100 other families who attended Hoag's 
annual family reunion. "We really think of him as a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 The picnic-style reception -- with clowns, games and other family activities 
-- gave parents a chance to reacquaint themselves with those who helped them. 
They lined up to have their children pose for a picture with Dr. Larry Werlin, 
the fertility specialist who treats all the patients at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is kind of like Santa Claus around here," hospital spokeswoman Maureen 
Mazzatenta said as the growing line of parents wrapped around the hospital 
parking lot where the picnic was held. 
</P>
<P>
 About 320 new couples each year attempt to get pregnant with the help of 
Werlin, hospital officials said. But Werlin said there is no way to determine 
the success rate of those patients. Once they're pregnant, the mothers-to-be go 
to their own doctors and don't return to Hoag. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach resident Candice Schnapp said she and her husband tried for a 
year to have a baby before going to Hoag in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never found out what the problem was," she said. "Even though I only had 
one Fallopian tube and one ovary, they kept saying that shouldn't stop me from 
conceiving." 
</P>
<P>
 She went through the usual dose of medication, attempts at insemination and 
numerous tests. Schnapp quickly became pregnant, but Werlin soon discovered the 
baby didn't develop a heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget it," she said. "When I went in for surgery, he just rubbed 
my feet telling me in a soft voice exactly what was going to happen. And as 
they wheeled me in, he held my hand." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, in 1991, Schnapp was pregnant again. This time there were 
no complications, and her daughter, Monica, was born in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just keep waiting for our big break," she said. "I saw each month as a new 
opportunity, not as failure."

DANA PARSONS: TOUGHER LAW GIVES HOPE STALKING CASE MAY BE CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the depressing aspects of writing a column is seeing the same subjects 
coming around again and again. There are some that you wish you could write 
about once and then they'd just go away. Very high on that list would be 
stalking. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote my first column on it a little more than three years ago and in 
re-reading it, I'm struck by how futile I sounded when trying to think of a way 
to combat it. All crime is unsavory, but stalking seems particularly loathsome 
because it submits the victim to an around-the-clock threat of terror. No 
matter where you live, your address is Cape Fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalking hasn't gone away, but the futility has eased a bit, thanks to an 
amendment to a state law that beefed up penalties and offered possible 
remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone doubts the urgency, they would only have needed to watch the 
sentencing Friday of Jon David Van Demark, who was given the maximum of four 
years for his stalking of former girlfriend Kendra Brown. Van Demark delivered 
a long, rambling statement in court that still had court officers talking hours 
later but that also gave observers a hint of what Ms. Brown has been going 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the court record wasn't already replete. Here's a sampling of Van 
Demark's correspondence with Ms. Brown: 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . And to the remark in the paper about women not wanting the attention of 
their ex-boyfriends, well, it's their own fault. Too many women come into a 
relationship and get what they can and split. Money-hungry bitches, and now I 
wonder to if you used me. Why did you accept my gifts? When I get out, I'm 
going to want some answers and if you have moved, I'll find you." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that that was written while Van Demark was already in custody, you get 
some idea of the holy terror that Brown's life must have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Demark was convicted in June on two counts of stalking. On Friday, Judge 
William Froeberg gave him the maximum -- and tacked on a 10-year restraining 
order -- but even so, Van Demark will only serve about another year-and-a-half 
behind bars, based on time in custody already and state sentencing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 That time will fly for Kendra Brown, and it's critical that Van Demark get 
treatment while in prison, which Froeberg recommended. A judge's discretion to 
recommend state hospital treatment was one of the things added to previous 
stalking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements to the stalking laws give Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade, who 
prosecuted Van Demark, at least some hope that this case may be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only that he's going away that's good, but the fact that there's a 
process where he can be evaluated and hopefully be given treatment, so he's 
both punished and off the street but getting some focused treatment on this," 
she said. Shade said Van Demark's behavior, right up to his sentencing on 
Friday, suggests he is "irrational and volatile." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides sending letters and making phone calls, which authorities said 
numbered in the hundreds, Van Demark also vandalized Brown's car -- slashing 
its tires and throwing paint on it. He also threatened her, her relatives and 
friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show he has written more than 40 letters to her since his 
conviction in June. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes stalking a potentially vexing area of law is that physical harm 
usually has not occurred, although the prospect of it is ever-present. For 
example, when investigators asked Van Demark, who told them he had never hit 
Brown, if he thought his actions could ever escalate to violence, he replied 
only that he wasn't sure but that he would "never intend to hurt her." 
</P>
<P>
 Shade said she thinks sentencing laws against stalkers should be toughened 
again. "I think the law should take into account the damage done to the victims 
in what amounts to in some cases, psychological torture. In some cases, we have 
victims say, 'I wish he'd hit me or shoot at me and get it over with.' Messing 
with someone's mind is very serious. That can be really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Van Demark's letters from jail began as follows: "Brown: Hey, what 
are you gonna do when I show up on your door? Could be next month, it could be 
a few years, whenever I get out. I know you think my love is just obsession and 
means nothing to you." 
</P>
<P>
 The public can feel a little better because of the stalking law. But a huge 
burden now shifts to the state to provide treatment for Van Demark, if needed. 
This is not a case where we should be reading a couple years down the road that 
he somehow slipped through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 As Shade pointed out: "It's not like it's some stranger that randomly 
burglarized your house today and maybe he'll still be a burglar when he gets 
out, but there's no personal grudge against you. What was particularly creepy 
also was the way he (Van Demark) responded in court (on Friday). It was pretty 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
 A footnote: Somewhere in the sheaves of paperwork that document Kendra Brown's 
ordeal is a request from her to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked that they inform her whenever Van Demark is scheduled to be 
released.

REVEREND REVS UP AVOCATION; MILITARY MINISTER'S FAITH IS FUELED BY DRAG-RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seated behind the wheel of his fire-engine-red Ford Mustang, the Rev. Robert 
Ray revs his pride and joy, a 600-horsepower, eardrum-blasting racing machine. 
With the smell of burning rubber fouling the night air, the rear tires stir up 
a cloud of dust, grease and smoke thick enough to choke a mule. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is about to begin, and Ray's Mustang -- with "Racers for Christ" 
emblazoned on the side -- is in the No. 1 lane, wheels spinning in 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a deafening roar, the car lurches forward. Its front end raises up as if 
trying to fly, looking more like an F-18 than a '68 Mustang. Spitting dirt 
behind him, the reverend bolts down the track, taking the checkered flag in 
11.3 seconds and pulling cheers from the crowd at Brotherhood Raceway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 His top speed: 117 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Ray, 30, is sitting in a booth at Burrell's, his favorite 
grits-and-gravy coffee shop, within walking distance of the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, where the soft-spoken preacher has come to be known fondly 
as "the drag-racing minister." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years in uniform, Ray is a Religious Program Specialist 2nd Class. He 
assists the Rev. Robert Purser, the base chaplain, by doing everything called 
for in a military ministry -- addressing the spiritual needs of servicemen and 
women and playing a preacherly role at hospitals, funerals and weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 He also serves as a track chaplain with Racers for Christ, which provides 
worship services at speedways from Talladega, Ala., to Indianapolis, to the 
Inland Empire. Unlike his ministerial colleagues, though, Ray is often behind 
the wheel -- and doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished second at the Buick Nationals in Bakersfield in May, his most 
successful of 14 races. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial launch, the takeoff, the G forces, the pull of the car . . . " he 
said, talking about the part that thrills him most -- the start. "Going 120 
miles an hour in a quarter-mile, from zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds . . . you can't 
beat it." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, at a race in Palmdale, Ray saw a sign for Racers for Christ 
and immediately volunteered to be a chaplain. But in the past two years, he has 
poured $15,000 of his own money into racing, beefing up the Mustang. The spirit 
of such racing heavies as the late Mickey Thompson and Louie Unser help keep 
his car going. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's company provides free tires, and Unser's Fullerton shops built the 
state-of-the-art 351 Windsor engine. Otherwise, Ray would have spent even more. 
Racing has hardly been profitable -- he's won only $400. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, "it's been like a leap of faith," he said, especially before the race 
in Bakersfield. "I said, 'Lord, I'm trusting you now. Don't drain my pocketbook 
forever. Let me at least win something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He lost 13 straight races and then, at his lowest point, finished second in 
the Buick Nationals. Ray saw it as a sign from God that he ought to keep going 
-- a kind of checkered flag from heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 An earnest man with a boyish face and a pencil-thin mustache, he grew up in 
Portland, Ore., where one of six stepfathers turned him on to racing. As a boy 
whose family life was hard-scrabble, the passion often took him astray and got 
him into trouble. As a teen-ager, Oregon cops arrested him twice for racing on 
city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But winning the Oregon State High School Drag-Racing Championships gave him a 
raison d'etre and added fuel to an avocation already in overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same endorphins or adrenaline you would get from sky diving or 
running in a marathon," he said. "By the end of a race, you're literally 
shaking from the rush, the thrill of competition. But you have to be a true 
motor head, as I am, to enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 He scoffs at the notion that he might have a death wish or a longing to tempt 
fate like some Bible-toting version of James Dean from "Rebel Without a Cause." 
He sees drag-racing as a natural extension of a life with God, making him the 
minister with a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sky diving is just a stupid thing to me," he said by way of comparison. 
"There's no competition involved. What reason would anyone have for jumping out 
of a plane that's flying? There's so much more involved in drag-racing. Why, 
it's one of the fastest-growing sports in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Purser, his El Toro base boss, says his colleague defies the 
drag-racing stereotype, and by being a drag-racer, defies people's attitudes 
about ministers as well. Both Purser and Ray say the young recruits, from East 
Texas, rural Alabama and the South Bronx, are immediately intrigued by the 
racing preacher and thus more inclined to listen to the word of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not out there just talking the talk," Purser said. "He's walking the 
walk." 
</P>
<P>
 John Ewing, who works at Louie Unser Engines in Fullerton and who helped build 
Ray's racing engine, says Ray "has a real big heart" and has helped other 
racers see that "ministers, they're people too. They're in touch with God, but 
they're allowed to have hobbies like anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing calls Ray's '68 Mustang "clean, well put together. . . . He bought it as 
a junker and brought it back to life. Hey, you might say he resurrected it." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Ray resurrected his own life, which he admits was marred, on 
occasion, by drinking and other foolishness. His mother, a former bartender and 
palm reader known to her Oregon community as "the good witch" for her powers as 
a psychic, suffered a near-fatal car crash six years ago while coming home from 
a Bob Dylan concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray said the incident changed her life and had a profound impact on the lives 
of her five children. It drew the fragmented family closer together and "more 
important," he said, "drew us all closer to God." 
</P>
<P>
 He came from the kind of household "where you had to lock your stuff up -- my 
little sister was a thief. I was arrested for shoplifting when I was 5, 6 years 
old. I stole a lock to bolt my bedroom door down at night. The lady asked why I 
stole it and I said, 'To keep my sister out!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ray lives in Laguna Niguel with his fiancee, Kim, and her two children. Asked 
if the kids are his, he said, "They are in my heart." He says he has no 
ambition to be a professional drag-racer, only to raise a Christian family and 
"serve the Lord any way I can. If that means the track, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach, Bakersfield, Pomona -- wherever the ordained minister races on 
the Winston Drag Racing, National Hot Rod Assn. circuit -- he hears the 
announcer boom to the crowd: "Here's Robert Ray of Racers for Christ!" 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the cheers from drag-racing enthusiasts who just love the novelty of 
rooting on a speedway preacher, Ray has only one thing in mind. You might call 
it his little secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very competitive person," he said. "When that flag drops, I'm not 
praying for anybody any more. I just want to win!" Profile: The Rev. Robert Ray

HEART FAILURE AT DISNEYLAND CITED IN DEATH; TRAGEDY: 19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IS 
STRICKEN WHILE RIDING SPLASH MOUNTAIN. CORONER'S OFFICE SAYS SHE DIED OF 
NATURAL CAUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 19-year-old Nevada woman apparently suffered heart failure late Thursday 
while riding Disneyland's high-thrill Splash Mountain -- featuring a five-story 
plunge -- and died shortly afterward, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county coroner's office said Saturday it appears the woman, Jessica 
Erickson of Fernley, Nev., had a heart condition and died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several other high-speed rides such as Big Thunder and Space Mountain, 
Disneyland alerts guests to their possible hazards before boarding. A sign at 
the entrance to the "turbulent flume ride" warns: "Guests must be in good 
health, free from back, heart or neck problems, motion sickness or any other 
condition that could be aggravated by this attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson was visiting relatives in the Riverside area, according to the 
coroner's office. About 10:45 p.m., Erickson raced down the ride's finale -- a 
five-story plunge where patrons get their pictures snapped, often while raising 
their arms over their heads and screaming, Disneyland officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the log pulled into the load/unload area, cast members noticed she 
appeared ill," said Lindsey Schnebly, publicity manager at Disneyland. "They 
stopped the attraction and she was removed from the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 The death marks the first such incident on the popular attraction since it 
opened in July, 1989, Disneyland officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time anything like this has happened" at Splash Mountain, 
Schnebly said. "This is obviously extremely rare." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson was pronounced dead at 11:32 p.m. at Western Medical Center-Anaheim, 
according to the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was on the ride, but it was a natural death," a coroner's spokeswoman 
said. "It had nothing to do with the ride and she didn't fall out of the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Added deputy coroner Kurt Murine: "She had some things wrong with her 
physically, which could very well explain the death. But just to rule out any 
other factors, we're doing a toxicology screen and some other microscopic 
tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people were lined up for the ride Thursday night when park 
officials announced they were experiencing technical difficulties and cleared 
everyone out, said park visitor 37-year-old Timothy Lazuka, of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A distraught friend of Erickson's was escorted out by paramedics and Lazuka 
said he heard her say her friend "was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland officials inspected the ride and found it was "operating normally" 
and reopened the attraction within 30 minutes, Schnebly said.

MAN ADMITS ROLE IN GIRL'S KIDNAPING; CRIME: HE TELLS POLICE HE STAGED A 
BREAK-IN TO MAKE IT APPEAR SOMEONE ELSE ABDUCTED HIS FIANCEE'S DAUGHTER, 8, WHO 
TOLD AUTHORITIES HE RAPED HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A handyman, arrested in the rape and kidnaping of his fiancee's 8-year-old 
daughter, admitted that he took the girl to a motel and then concocted a phony 
story about a break-in and abduction from the family's apartment, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Leroy Granger, 34, was being held in the Fullerton City Jail on $50,000 
bail on suspicion of kidnaping, sexual assault and rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was found safe late Friday in the Silver Moon Motel in Anaheim after 
a frantic daylong search. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God she's alive," said the child's 29-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police said that Granger admitted that he staged the break-in at the 
two-bedroom apartment he shared with the child, her mother and her brother to 
make it appear that someone else had abducted her. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Kevin Hamilton would not say if Granger had confessed to raping the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to cover his tracks," Hamilton said. "Even though his story 
about the break-in sounded really far-fetched, we approached it as real because 
you can't rule out anything. His story really unraveled when we found the 
little girl." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, about 20 police officers using bloodhounds searched the 
neighborhood surrounding the 88-unit apartment complex in the 2400 block of 
West Orangethorpe Avenue where the girl lives. But they couldn't find her. 
</P>
<P>
 The child told police that she was raped at her apartment and then taken, 
taped and gagged, to the motel. She was told not to leave the room. But after 
seeing her picture on television during a late-night broadcast, she told police 
she ran to the room next door for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said that Granger admitted tying the child's arms, legs and mouth 
with duct tape, putting her inside a laundry basket, covering her with clothes 
and a blanket and smuggling her out of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to believe any of this until I heard it from my daughter," her 
exhausted mother said Saturday morning. "I'm shocked and devastated. I haven't 
slept all night. I want to be there when he goes to court. I want to see him 
sentenced. I'd like to see justice." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that when Granger drove her to her job in Los Angeles on Friday 
morning, "everything seemed normal." 
</P>
<P>
 "He must have just kind of snapped," she said. "It's like he had a second 
personality or something. I don't know. I don't think he knows." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Granger had been caring for her daughter and 10-year-old son all 
summer during the times she was at work. She said she and Granger met through a 
mutual friend in Whittier about seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got engaged two months ago and were planning to get married," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who is expecting another child in two weeks, said Granger had been 
acting as her delivery coach. She said he is not the father of the unborn 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair had been platonic roommates for three years, she said, but moved 
apart 2 1/2 years ago. She said they then became romantically involved and had 
been living together for the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman described Granger as a "Jack-of-all-trades" who worked sporadically 
as a handyman but was prevented from holding a full-time job because of a "rare 
liver disease he's had since he was 16." 
</P>
<P>
 Granger originally told police that he last saw the girl asleep about 10 a.m. 
in her mother's bedroom. He told police that when he checked the bedroom again 
about 11:30 a.m., he saw that she was missing and found signs of a break-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment manager Barbara Rawlings said Granger told her that he had been 
across the street doing laundry and had noticed the child missing when he 
returned. He told the woman that the bedroom window screen had been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, jewelry, a handgun and a portable safe were missing from the 
apartment. Hamilton said that Granger had taken the items to a local pawnshop 
sometime Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Granger told police that he searched in vain for the child around the complex 
until 1:30 p.m., when he called the child's mother. She arrived home an hour 
later, and they called police at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was angry with him that he hadn't called me right away when he noticed her 
missing," the mother said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were skeptical of Granger's version of events after 
interviewing the girl's brother, who was inside of the apartment at the time of 
the abduction and alleged rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what keyed us that something was wrong," Hamilton said. "The brother 
is a very smart 10-year-old, and he told us that there were a lot of things 
that Granger was doing that were not a part of his daily routine, such as 
leaving the apartment to do laundry. He told us a lot of small things that 
added up to some big suspicions." 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 p.m. Friday, police asked Granger to come to the station for 
questioning. He was still being questioned when the child was found.

L.A. ZOO SEEKS TO TAKE THE STING OUT OF TRADITIONAL SUMMER PEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the yellow-footed rock wallaby, the red river hogs and golden-headed 
tamarin, the Los Angeles Zoo is home to another, less appealing creation of 
Mother Nature -- the wasp. 
</P>
<P>
 The stinging creatures descend on the zoo in hordes during the summer, 
attracted by the ample supply of food -- raw meat for the lions, cheeseburgers 
for the children and many meals in between. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, though, the zookeepers have struck back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging throughout the zoo are 200 wasp traps designed to catch the annoying 
insects before they strike. Part-time summer workers have been hired to empty 
trash cans up to five times a day and steam-clean them regularly. When stings 
occur, zoo staffers have medication swabs to tend to the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo has not wiped out the pesky wasps -- which come in many varieties and 
can be identified by the number of black lines on their abdomens -- but zoo 
officials say the population has dropped so significantly this summer that it 
may have become, at least at the zoo, an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've beaten the problem as far as we can tell," zoo Director Mark Goldstein 
said. "You can come to the zoo now and you will have trouble finding a wasp." 
</P>
<P>
 Well maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration. A visitor purchased a cola, sat at 
an outdoor table near Adventure Island and waited about 10 minutes before one 
member of the wasp family -- a lone yellow jacket -- descended onto the rim of 
the cup. Still, statistics gathered so far this summer show that the problem is 
greatly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, there were 84 wasp stings reported at the zoo in the first 20 days 
of July. Thanks to the wasp crackdown, the number of reported stings has 
dropped to two. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo had been bracing for another flare-up of wasps this summer. It 
prepared a special "bee-ware" brochure for visitors, purchased skin cream that 
repels the pests and stocked up on sting medication. Most of it remains in 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for zoos to attract unwanted animal life. Wasps prey on many 
of the nation's zoos. San Francisco has had problems with aggressive sea gulls. 
And pigeons descend on many urban zoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp counselors who lead swarms of children to the Los Angeles Zoo on summer 
days deliver lectures about the wasp problem at the entrance and the zoo map 
handed out to all visitors contains a special wasp warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Swarming throughout the zoo's 77 acres, the wasps have scared away people and 
stung a significant number of visitors in the past.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zoo executives believe the wasps were formerly so omnipresent that they 
affected ticket revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty bad in the past," general curator Les Schobert said. 
"There's a lot of them. They nest in the park and attack people who are 
drinking cold drinks." 
</P>
<P>
 By its very nature, the zoo makes an ideal habitat for wasps. 
</P>
<P>
 It is adjacent to lush Griffith Park, an ideal breeding location, and there is 
an ample supply of food in the animal exhibits and at the outdoor picnic 
tables. This makes the zoo, which opened in its present location in 1966, a 
smorgasbord for the hungry wasps, which mix in with the more than 1,500 other 
animals at the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the wasps are at their worst, Adventures in Food, the zoo's Mexican 
eatery, takes on a whole new meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is complicated by the fact that the zoo is limited in how it can 
combat the pests. 
</P>
<P>
 It cannot use insecticides because the chemicals would affect the animals. And 
it cannot use plastic lids to cover cups of soda because some youngsters launch 
them into animal exhibits like Frisbees, endangering animals. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the zoo has been experimenting with ways to keep wasps away from 
sugary soft drinks. It has tried paper lids and domed lids that do not fly as 
far. But the main emphasis has been on traps designed to catch the reproducing 
queens. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoo volunteer Corki Dada, an entomology graduate student at Cal Poly Pomona, 
helped design the traps. Consultant Frank Job, a Catalina Island beekeeper and 
yellow jacket control specialist, has also been hired to tend the traps. 
</P>
<P>
 In past summers, the zoo concentrated its traps in food areas. This year, 
however, the traps went up in March -- far earlier than usual -- and were hung 
at critical locations around the perimeter of the zoo to catch the wasps as 
they entered the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the traps are catching as many as 5,000 wasps a week, zoo officials 
report. That kind of recovery shows that wasps are still in the air and zoo 
officials acknowledge that the park will never be completely wasp-less. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is control -- not eradication," Goldstein said. "Wasps are 
definitely pests, but they are part of the environment. They are wildlife and 
we're a zoo."

ADVERSITY IS MOTHER OF INVENTION FOR JOBLESS MEN; EMPLOYMENT: LAID-OFF

SHARE THEIR PLIGHT. ONE GROUP HAS BEGUN TO DESIGN A CLEANER-FUELED CAR.

 Mike Williams and the boys called it the Suicide Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a bit of black humor from a bunch of laid-off engineers and designers who 
lost their jobs in the lingering economic doldrums smothering Southern 
California like brownish-gray smog. 
</P>
<P>
 Two winters ago, Williams recalls, they would gather at some local coffee shop 
to compare notes on how bad things had gotten, applying their analytical minds 
to things such as paying the mortgage and sending their children to private 
school -- without an income. 
</P>
<P>
 The half a dozen engineers and auto designers prided themselves on being men 
who knew how things worked. Now they were confounded by hard times that had 
cost all of them their jobs -- and some their homes and even marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to bring each other up," says Williams, a Canyon Country resident 
who in December, 1992, lost his $60,000-a-year aerospace engineering job with 
Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there were so many debts and family crises, it was hard to say anything 
that didn't sound like one big cliche. Pretty soon, we began joking that our 
pep talks were more like a suicide club." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists say there are many Suicide Clubs throughout Los Angeles and 
Southern California -- perhaps called by other names -- essentially, people who 
have teamed up to help one another emotionally through hard economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misery loves company," Pasadena career counselor Judith Grutter said. "And 
economic misery also loves constructive criticism. That's what people are 
giving one another. It doesn't have to come from a professional." 
</P>
<P>
 From Mike Williams' Suicide Club came a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Big business had told them their services were no longer required: They were 
just too old or too expensive or too inexperienced. As the waitress poured yet 
another jolt of morning coffee, they hatched a strategy to earn a living: 
building the electric car of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of them formed Specialized Power Systems with the goal of producing a 
"hybrid, alternative-fuel electric vehicle" that in the coming century would 
become the main transportation of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 While they continued to look for full-time work, the new partners holed up in 
their home offices to labor on the prototypes of their ESC -- or environmental 
sports commuter -- vehicle, a car they say will run on a clean-burning fuel 
such as propane gas. They contacted possible investors, and sold motorcycles 
and second cars to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other Suicide Club members assumed lesser investment roles -- one 
delivering pizzas part time to bring in extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Northridge earthquake set them back a bit: A wall collapsed on 
their newly built test car chassis, forcing them to redesign the entire front 
end. Still, the project has breathed new life into the emotional psyches of 
formerly resigned, out-of-work professionals who might otherwise have called it 
quits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Williams knows there are no easy routes out of a recession. As he struggles to 
keep his home life together and fights the occasional depression, he works 
feverishly to market his electric car. 
</P>
<P>
 And get his life back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "This recession brought out the inventor within me," Williams said. "But this 
time, it's for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Such independent strategies, experts say, exemplify the fierce entrepreneurial 
spirit often required to dig out of a financial hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some, these terrible economic times are a gift horse, a kick in the pants 
-- the thing that jolts them into looking at more creative ways of earning a 
living they would never before have considered," Grutter said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a white-collar professional such as Williams, becoming his own boss has 
meant traveling a new road. 
</P>
<P>
 He had always been the company man since he began designing cars in Detroit in 
the 1950s. At the age of 56 he had assembled a design resume ranging from cars 
to console TVs for companies such as Montgomery Ward, Chrysler and Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The ugly end came as Williams and 2,000 other workers helped design a space 
station for Rockwell's space systems division: 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, they were all laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, this corporate ladder-climber was negotiating a footstool in his 
suburban kitchen. He had become a disregarded statistic of the working world, 
one of 100,000 aerospace and defense workers to lose their jobs since 1987 -- 
one of the walking wounded in a faltering job field that experts predict will 
lose another 100,000 to 200,000 jobs before 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff launched Williams on an emotional carnival ride. He has sought 
numerous engineering jobs and piecemeal consulting work to supplement his 
wife's teaching salary -- all the while staggering from the gut-wrenching blow 
of losing his place as the family breadwinner. 
</P>
<P>
 And he never knows when the dark feelings will come. He could be in his car, 
on the telephone or even in bed when seized by a powerful reality: He's in a 
personal and professional drought with no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I start yelling at myself," said the father of two college-age 
daughters. "In the car, I'll look at myself in the mirror and say, 'Mike, shape 
up! Hey, lousy things happen and you just have to deal with them the best you 
know how. Feeling sorry for Michael Williams isn't going to help.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't give up. He has sent out hundreds of resumes to engineering firms. 
He has landed only five interviews -- all of them informal, look-see meetings 
with companies who had no real openings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the last year his home life had become stressful. He was cranky, 
believing that no one in his family appreciated how hard he was looking for 
work -- just because he was at home most of the time now. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, his once-commanding salary had been, for the most part, reduced to 
a $10 weekly allowance from Jean, his wife of 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, I was Mr. Mom. No matter what I did to land a job, it didn't seem I 
was working hard enough. I wasn't bringing in any money." 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff has forced Jean Williams to make her own sacrifices. "My big 
complaint is that Mike is not Mr. Mom. He doesn't do the things around the 
house I would do if I were laid off -- the vacuuming and dishwashing," the 
junior high school history teacher says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was home with the kids, I waited on him. But now that I'm working and 
he's home, I don't get the same treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mike Williams has done what he can. 
</P>
<P>
 To help pay the mortgage, he slashed unnecessary expenses. He discontinued 
magazine subscriptions. The family rarely went to restaurants and cut down on 
social phone calls -- even local ones. To save on gas, if a trip wasn't 
necessary, Williams didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trips deemed necessary: the meetings of the Suicide Club.

BILL BOYARSKY: FORGETTING THE FINANCIAL LESSONS OF NEW YORK CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The main topic at the reporters' weekly meeting with Los Angeles County 
Administrative Officer Sally Reed last Monday was the state's financial mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The state finances almost 40% of county operations and the word that Wall 
Street had lowered California's credit rating was bad news in the County Hall 
of Administration. The word from two big credit rating firms was a follow-up to 
an earlier bombshell. The banks had told the state it must impose strict fiscal 
controls before it could borrow to finance daily operations. 
</P>
<P>
 As I listened to Reed, I wondered whether California hadn't sunk to the level 
of New York City when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of lessons to be learned from New York," Reed said when I 
asked her about it. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems nobody has learned them. Under Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and a 
Democratic Legislature, state spending has exceeded revenues. To balance the 
budget this year, the Wilson Administration, with the Democrats' assent, 
borrowed $4 billion from group of banks headed by Bank of America. The banks 
insisted that the state make budget cuts if it can't repay the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to sound simplistic, but it looks as though the banks are taking 
over state government, the way they took over New York City when it was in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank-ordered cuts would reach directly into L.A. County, the state's 
biggest and the one with the most severe and insoluble urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll know about the impact of these cuts when contagious disease rates rise 
because of reduced public health facilities, or when more criminals are granted 
early release from overcrowded jails. For it's the county, not the state, that 
runs all the unglamorous services we can't do without -- jails, courts, county 
hospitals, clinics for the mentally ill, parks, flood and fire control, beach 
lifeguards, and several others. 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as March, Moody's, one of the credit rating services that came 
down hard on the state, warned that California's fiscal course was damaging the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Before deciding to borrow $4 billion this year, Wilson and the Legislature 
balanced the state budget to a great extent by raiding the treasuries of 
counties, which lacked the smarts and clout to compete in Sacramento's 
fast-paced political market place. 
</P>
<P>
 They did this by shifting the cost of several expensive health and social 
welfare programs to the counties. State officials grandly promised the counties 
more sales tax revenue and money from motor vehicle license fees to cover the 
additional costs. But during the recession, sales of cars, trucks and almost 
everything else declined. So the revenue was much less than promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County was hurt even more when the state shifted a substantial 
amount of property tax revenue from the counties to the schools, which were in 
deep financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 All these state actions, Moody's said, "substantially increases the economic 
vulnerability of the county's revenue structure." 
</P>
<P>
 This combination of huge borrowing, rolling over debts and raiding county 
income is something new to California. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be an unshakable rule -- a law, actually -- that the state budget 
had to be balanced. At least, when I worked in Sacramento, I thought it was a 
law, and so did everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 But I should have known. Even in the hands of lawmakers, a law is something to 
be bent or broken. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the recession struck California. Revenues from the sales, income, 
bank and corporation and other taxes declined precipitously. Property tax 
income was already down, the result of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson pushed through a tax increase the first year, but took so much 
heat from Republicans that he vowed never to do that again. The Democrats gave 
up on tax increases too. What was left of Republican and Democratic political 
will was drained by special interest lobbyists who opposed closing loopholes 
that protected their business clients. 
</P>
<P>
 All this added up to stalemate, which ushered in the era of borrowing and 
debt, New York style. 
</P>
<P>
 The old balanced budget law was put aside. Wilson's Finance Department armed 
itself with an opinion from Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren "indicating that 
this financing and budget strategy satisfies the requirements of the California 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think someone would be irate. But I think the public is skeptical of 
budget crisis stories. Ever since the voters approved Proposition 13, 
government officials have been crying wolf, and then getting by each year with 
temporary fixes. The deterioration of public schools, universities, community 
colleges and other state facilities have been well documented, but they've been 
undramatically slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic nominee for governor, is trying to 
make red-ink financing an issue in her campaign against Wilson. I watched her 
hold a news conference in Santa Monica the day the credit rating services gave 
California a bad grade. "Pete Wilson's fiscal mismanagement has turned the 
triple-A (rated) state into the IOU state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But only two newspaper reporters and one TV crew were there. The rest of the 
cameras were somewhere else, probably following an angle of the O.J. Simpson 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration, meanwhile, is putting a happy face on the mess. I 
talked to Russell Gould, Wilson's finance director, and he said, "California is 
living within its means." Tax revenue is up and there will be enough money in 
the state treasury to pay off the debt without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 His optimism fits in with the history of these crises. Only when government 
can no longer write checks, when it's bankrupt, will anyone admit there's 
anything wrong. Then, as was the case in New York, everyone will try to figure 
out what happened.

SCOTT HARRIS: SELLING SPACE, THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say you are in the market for a dog to herd your cattle. The San Fernando 
Valley Fair is one place to shop. Here, you will find all sorts of things for 
sale. People will sell you a look at a miniature horse or a giant pig. They 
will sell you cotton candy or a bungee jump or a game of Whac-a-Mole and a 
chance to win a prize. Here, at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank, 
there are booths that sell telephone services, newspaper subscriptions and real 
estate. Foot soldiers of the Democratic and Republican parties will try to sell 
you on their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 And at another booth, people are selling space, the final frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena are the Trekkers of 
fact, not fiction. They are scientists, engineers and technicians, mostly, but 
they also work in marketing. We are their customers, and we always want to be 
reminded that the billions and billions of dollars invested in space 
exploration are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 At any fair, and this one ends today, showmanship is a necessity. And that's 
why Kathleen Spellman, an uplink system engineer for the Mars Pathfinder, 
wanted to show children how to make a comet. It's sort of like a cosmic mud 
pie. The ingredients call for several small chunks of frozen carbon dioxide, 
one cup of dirt, a dash of vinegar for the acetic acid, and a few drops of 
Worcestershire sauce to provide carbon. Wearing thick gloves to guard against 
frostbite, Spellman places the ingredients in a plastic sack, squeezes them 
together and . . . 
</P>
<P>
 BOOM!  
</P>
<P>
 Well, now, that wasn't supposed to happened. "Don't touch it!" she warns 
children curious about something that resembles snow but is much colder. 
Spellman herself had been sprayed with bits of frozen carbon dioxide and 
Worcestershire. This bag, she concludes, had been used once too often. Gas 
rising from the comet stew produced the effect. 
</P>
<P>
 She tries again. This time, there is no explosion. This time, the children are 
shown a dirty white clump that smells funny. "It looks like cauliflower," 
someone says. "It looks like a brain," says someone else.  
</P>
<P>
 Now just imagine frozen clumps that are the size of mountains, hurtling 
through space and smashing into Jupiter. Now those are serious booms. 
</P>
<P>
 The people at JPL are thrilled with the drama of the comet known as 
Shoemaker-Levy 9. Such amazing fireworks, plus the 25th anniversary of the 
lunar landing, are enough to make grown-ups look to the sky with the awe and 
wonder natural to children. The sales pitch is easier when the cosmos and 
history are pitching in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is perfect," Spellman says.  
</P>
<P>
 It's perfect because, beginning with the Challenger tragedy, the space program 
has had to answer for so much failure. NASA, the government agency for which 
JPL does much of its work, has had to explain such troubles as the malfunction 
of a major antenna on the $1.5-billion Galileo space probe, the defective lens 
on the $2-billion Hubble space telescope (later repaired in a shuttle mission) 
and, most dramatically, the disappearance of the $1-billion Mars Observor. NASA 
lost contact with it 450 million miles from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 At the fair, the folks from JPL prefer to dwell on the successes. There are, 
Spellman explains, tangible benefits that far exceed Tang. The technology 
developed for space exploration, she says, has resulted in many medical 
advancements, in robotics that benefit industry and optics that help the 
near-blind to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find so much about our own planet when we study others," adds Taguhi 
Arakelian, who works as a support scientist on the Galileo space probe. A study 
of Venus provided us with a better understanding of the "greenhouse effect," 
which is warming the Earth's atmosphere, she points out. "From a selfish point 
of view, we can take better care of our own planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the intangible benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always looking forward," Spellman says. "Space exploration gives you 
hope for the future -- the hope than we can influence the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are always skeptics. One elderly man who visited the JPL exhibit 
pointed out that "some people" wonder whether Neil Armstrong really did make 
that giant step. Then he muttered something about conspiracies and the ability 
of "Hollywood studios." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you don't believe that, sir," Arakelian said, as polite as could be. 
</P>
<P>
 And now there's talk that we've thrown so much debris into orbit that a space 
station may be too risky. The question that is asked is: Why bother? 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Actually, the cosmic version of that question -- the ultimate "Why?" -- 
is precisely the reason we're out there. A quest for understanding, for 
discovery, is deep in the species. 
</P>
<P>
 Taryn Wolfe, a 9-year-old fifth-grader from Tarzana with plans to be "an 
actress, singer, veterinarian and doctor," was rapt as JPL worker Rick Shope 
described efforts under way to send two space probes toward Pluto. The launch 
is set for the year 2001. The probes will reach Pluto and its moon, Charon, in 
2008. 
</P>
<P>
 The fountain of youth, by all best evidence, is a myth. But regular doses of 
wonder and awe aren't a bad substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 A child's fascination with space, Shope said, usually ends in the teen-age 
years, when other subjects come to the fore. Taryn's 14-year-old brother, 
Brandon, and his pal Michael Fox, also 14, proved Shope's point.  
</P>
<P>
 They could stand only a few minutes of this Pluto stuff. You don't come to the 
fair to learn about Pluto, they explained. And you don't come for the rides and 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 You come to look for girls. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all a matter of discovery

SIMI-L.A. GAME SCORES AGAIN FOR HARMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The coach of South Los Angeles' Foshay Junior High School softball team 
surveyed his 20 players seated in the middle of Simi Valley's Santa Susana Park 
on Saturday. And then, he laid down the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "No leadoffs, no stealing, no sliding," he said sternly, as a chorus of moans 
went up. "No fun!" responded a player from the middle of the antsy group, 
evoking laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the first pitch was thrown, participants said the third America's 
Games softball tournament was a fun day in the park that demonstrated again how 
residents of South Los Angeles and Simi Valley can embrace each other in a show 
of racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament began in 1992 when two Inglewood co-workers -- one from Simi, 
one from South Los Angeles -- decided that a goodwill game between their 
communities could help ease tensions and dispel racial stereotypes in the wake 
of the Rodney G. King beating trial verdict and Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley was the site of the first King beating trial that ended with 
verdicts acquitting four white Los Angeles police officers. South Los Angeles 
was the flash-point for the riots that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally due to the trial and so forth there were hard feelings," said 
Foshay Dean Stephen Moore on Saturday. "(But) after being here the first time 
we were welcomed warmly and the second time, it was like, 'Hey, we're just here 
to have a ballgame.' 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the other stuff, as far as I'm concerned, is behind us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although organizers were disappointed at this year's turnout, the daylong 
tournament has broadened to include dance performances, karate demonstrations 
and an exhibit on an old Wells Fargo stagecoach. 
</P>
<P>
 And the various activities, in turn, spawned new friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Littleton of South Los Angeles and Elaine Parker struck up a 
conversation while watching Littleton's 4-year-old daughter practice her modern 
dance routine that became part of the featured entertainment between the 
children and adult softball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "She explained to me that she has a love for dance and she took dance lessons 
for ballet and jazz," Littleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And that common interest helped form a bond that both women said would likely 
last, adding they planned to exchange phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandra Backstrom of Hawthorne said she was a bit nervous about bringing her 
young dance students to Simi Valley. "I wanted to make sure it would be all 
right for my girls," she said. "Now that I'm here, I think it's nice to see 
everybody from different cultures coming together to just have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Beppu, 14, of Simi Valley said she and classmate Breeanne Hodges had 
befriended some South Los Angeles teen-agers at the last game for young players 
in October. Lori and Breeanne called on Friday to make sure their friends were 
coming. "They're really nice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters' softball contest came off without a hitch, as did the whole 
day. The final scores saw Foshay Junior High beat the Simi Valley team 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
 In the adult game, the Simi Valley All Stars defeated the Los Angeles 
Community All Stars 10-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-organizer Susan Davenport of Simi Valley said the hometown turnout was 
disappointingly low -- about 30 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 425 residents came from South Los Angeles to Simi Valley in six 
chartered buses, said co-organizer Jan Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport and Hardy were co-workers and friends at an Inglewood computer 
company when they originated the idea for a softball game. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the turnout has declined from the first year when media attention 
was more intense. "Everyone came to support us, because they didn't believe it 
could happen after what happened on April 29, 1992," Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the second year's game between the adult teams, held in South-Central, only 
about 100 or so people turned up, with only about 15 from Simi Valley, 
Davenport said. "We didn't get the publicity out far enough ahead," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Caldwell, 41, of Simi Valley brought a hand-held video recorder to film 
her 13-year-old daughter Kristi play center field. She said if it weren't for 
her daughter playing in the game she would not have come. But now, she said, 
she plans to make the America's Games an annual outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people from South-Central, they don't seem any different than we are, 
they're friendly," she said.

CURTAIN CALL; ARTS PLAZA DESIGNER SEES COPPER PANELS AS CITY SYMBOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a rubble-strewn ledge high above the Ventura Freeway sit 2,880 skinny 
copper strips designed to transform the Civic Arts Plaza into a regional symbol 
of culture, flair and vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The bright, narrow panels will soon hang on cables that cascade down the 
eastern wall of Thousand Oaks' vaunted auditorium. With each breeze, they 
should flutter slightly, to suggest a rippling stage curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Antoine Predock predicts his one-of-a-kind copper sculpture could 
become a sort of city mascot, inviting visitors to stop in Thousand Oaks and 
check out the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the building from the Ventura Freeway, there's a great 
temptation to put graphic signage there," Predock said. "But that seemed too 
obvious, so we came up with the curtain, as a symbol of the celebratory concept 
of this building." 
</P>
<P>
 In case the shimmering curtain doesn't do the trick, Predock has designed 
other eye-catching features on the Civic Arts Plaza's blocky beige walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some embellishments have already emerged as workers begin to dismantle the 
heavy scaffolding. Others will become visible only when the theater opens in 
October, and audience members can roam past oddities like a rooftop reflecting 
pool or a concrete-and-green-glass zebra-striped window. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is truly a unique building," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said. "I was 
astounded when I visited (last week) because there are so many features that 
aren't apparent in the drawings." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a harsh critic of the building's design, Zukowski still says she's 
"awe-struck because it's so immense." But she concedes that "it is improving as 
it settles in" and people get used to its looming silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Civic Arts Plaza's profile has become familiar, however, the many funky 
design features promise to add an element of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 On the western face, for example, workers recently unveiled a metal 
ladder-like structure and a series of protruding pipes that are designed to 
look like abstractions of Chumash pictographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Visible from the eastbound Ventura Freeway, the unusual sculpture is designed 
as a "timeless, abstract reference to earlier times . . . a mythical evocation" 
of the Conejo Valley's history, Predock said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "pictograph wall," done in zinc and Lucite, is intended to 
allude to a Condor Man wing, a starry sky and a writhing serpent, with a few 
geometrical shapes thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone gets it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks more like mounting for some other construction they're going to do," 
said sculptor Craig Leese, who teaches art at Cal Lutheran University and lives 
in the Civic Arts Plaza's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he realized that the protruding metalwork is permanent, Leese said he 
concluded that the design resembles two worms attacking a comb in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if that's very complimentary," he added, "but that's what it 
looks like to me. It serves the purpose of decorating the building, but I think 
they could have come up with something a little more eye-catching." 
</P>
<P>
 The pictographs and copper curtain were added to the original design after 
construction began to soften the building and add more visual interest. The 
embellishments depart from Predock's usual style, which relies on "very strong, 
geometric forms . . . very simple, very austere," according to architectural 
critic Morris Newman, a Los Angeles-based writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He represents a tendency in architecture that's being debated right now -- 
the idea of a building as a heroic object against the world," Newman said. 
"Buildings like his are very masculine, very commanding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a counterpoint to the Civic Arts Plaza's harsh outlines, Predock designed a 
series of gentle, even romantic, flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-stair towers are topped with dainty steel cages that look sharp-edged 
from the freeway but more whimsical up close. The beige-painted cages, 
officially dubbed trellises, are intended to balance the heavy mass of the 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying the same motif into the outdoor plazas, Predock envisions potted 
vines climbing up zinc-wrapped columns and forming a green trellis. The garden 
theme will continue with a small reflecting pool on a nearby terrace roof. And 
in the park below, ceramic tiles decorated by local schoolchildren will wind 
through a meandering path. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Predock's buildings are often more barren, Newman said he was not 
surprised at the many offbeat decorations. "I consider (Predock) a poet among 
architects," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most poetic element in the $64-million Civic Arts Plaza is 
Predock's dramatic pictograph wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The plexiglass tubes representing celestial sparks will let light into the 
complex. On bright days, sparkling sun rays should shoot through the rods, 
dappling the floor outside the 1,800-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall arts patrons can peek through the windows to catch glimpses of distant 
mountains -- or the nearby parking garage, which partially blocks the 
pictographs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At night, the lighting scheme should work in reverse. Theater illumination 
will beam outward, penetrating the 2-foot-thick walls. The pinpricks of light 
will be visible from outside the auditorium, and will act as welcoming beacons 
as visitors enter the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at all bashful, Predock said he was thrilled with the concept. "It's 
really marvelous," he said in a telephone interview from his New Mexico office. 
</P>
<P>
 Because his designs are so unusual, Predock has at times stumped the 
structural engineers and acoustics whizzes who must bring his sketches to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun -- up to a point," project manager Ed Johnduff said of the 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of testing, engineers still have not puzzled out the copper 
curtain. They have hung the cables and tested a mock-up, but they must tinker 
with the final design before installing the panels. 
</P>
<P>
 They expect the copper's new-penny brightness to fade to a dull brown within 
weeks, so they do not think the curtain will distract passing motorists. "Even 
if you took a flashlight and stuck it up real close, you'd be hard-pressed to 
get a glare out of it," said Bill Huston, another project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 But while they've conquered the reflection problem, they're still working on 
other issues -- like keeping the curtain quiet in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly," acoustics expert Dave Conant said, "during a performance we don't 
want to hear rattle, rattle, scratch, scratch, bang, bang." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conant expects to have a solution soon, and the copper panels should go up by 
the end of the month. The City Hall portion of the complex will open in 
mid-September, and the auditorium will welcome its first audience in late 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, residents are trickling by the site to take organized tours or just 
to gawk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all holding our breath" during the construction period, Councilwoman 
Zukowski said. "Certainly it's a departure from what we're used to in our 
little valley. (But) it makes more sense to me now."

WARNINGS ON GUN SAFETY HIT HOME AFTER 3 SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guns and children can be a lethal mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Shootings by three Ventura County young people this summer -- two in the past 
10 days -- emphasize the need for parents to be vigilant about weapons at home, 
police say. 
</P>
<P>
 While some authorities say good trigger locks and safe boxes should keep 
children and the family firearms apart, others warn that the only way to keep 
your teen-ager away from your gun is by never allowing a weapon in your home. 
</P>
<P>
 The inherent danger is evident in these recent cases: 
</P>
<P>
 * Three-year-old David Cook of Ventura was wounded June 15 when his 6-year-old 
brother accidentally shot him in the back with a shotgun left in the family's 
motel room. The boy recovered, but Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace said she will 
decide within two weeks whether to prosecute the parents under a 1991 law that 
makes it a crime to leave a loaded gun where a child reaches it and uses it. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 17-year-old Thousand Oaks boy is facing murder charges after he took his 
father's pistol and shot his girlfriend point-blank in the eye while 
brandishing the gun. Jacqueline Ann Reay, 16, died shortly she was shot July 
13. Sheriff's Lt. Craig Husband said the boy's father had left the gun locked 
up before the boy took it. He declined to say how the boy gained access to the 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 * And a 16-year-old Moorpark boy was shot through the upper arm in Moorpark on 
Tuesday when the gun he and a 19-year-old friend were playing with went off. 
The two had been drinking, and the 16-year-old may have accidentally shot 
himself with a gun believed to be his, detectives say. The boy was treated for 
his wounds and released, and no charges have been filed in that case, said 
Sheriff's Detective Ed Wyand. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Thousand Oaks and Ventura cases, the children who allegedly did the 
shooting got the guns at home. In the Moorpark case, police said the gun was 
not a family weapon and the boy had no legal right to own it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finding loaded, unlocked guns in homes with children occurs "alarmingly 
frequently," Ventura Police Sgt. Gary McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what inspires people to keep loaded guns in the house," 
McCaskill said. "They talk about (personal) safety, but in reality that just 
doesn't end up being the case. I really struggle with that philosophy. We see 
more people shot in family fights than we would where they're shooting at an 
unknown person committing a crime (in their home)." 
</P>
<P>
 Children are accustomed to seeing guns waved carelessly about in television 
shows and movies, and sometimes even seeing them around the house, Husband 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People become overly familiar with firearms and tend to lose respect for the 
damage they can do," said Husband, whose major crimes unit is investigating 
Reay's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state law that took effect in January, 1992, parents can be held 
liable if children under the age of 14 gain access to and improperly use loaded 
guns left within easy reach. Penalties include up to three years in prison and 
a fine of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they did not know of a Ventura County case in which a parent 
had been prosecuted under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be difficult to hold parents responsible for a 17-year-old," Husband 
said. "The only way to prevent a 17-year-old from getting your gun is not to 
possess it at all. If they're intent on obtaining the weapon, there's a good 
chance they'll get it . . . unless it's locked in a floor safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if guns are kept locked up in the house, safety education is still vital, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid growing up and I learned how to use a firearm, safety was 
the most important thing ever stressed," Husband said. "I remember the lesson I 
received: The weapon is never pointed at anybody. You always assume the weapon 
is loaded. And you never point the muzzle at anything you're not willing to 
destroy." 
</P>
<P>
 Gun shops around Ventura County sell a variety of deterrent devices ranging 
from $14 trigger locks to thick-walled safes costing more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard gun shop manager Andy Dickson said he always warns gun buyers of the 
lock law every time they make a purchase -- even requiring them to read and 
sign a photocopy of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson, manager of Shooter's Paradise, demonstrated a simple $99 gun safe 
that looks like an extra-tough cash box fitted with a five-button, changeable 
combination lock. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun owners who arm themselves for protection from intruders sometimes worry 
they will not be able to unlock a gun in time to use it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the quickest and easiest way to get to a gun," he said, swiftly 
punching the buttons and opening the safe. "We recommend this if they have any 
kids in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 But education is equally important, he said, particularly after a state law 
went into effect April 1 requiring all gun owners to prove they have received 
training in the safe use of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching youths about guns can reduce their desire to play with them, he said, 
explaining, "Basically if you take all the mystery out of it, it's no big 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson added: "I often tell people that the best safety you have is between 
your ears."

LOCAL COLLEGE TRANSFERS LAG BEHIND STATE, U.S. AVERAGES; EDUCATION: ONLY THREE 
IN 20 STUDENTS GO ON TO CAL STATE OR UC CAMPUSES, DESPITE THE $60 MILLION SPENT 
YEARLY TO FUND MOORPARK, VENTURA AND OXNARD COLLEGES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only three in 20 students enrolled in Ventura County's community colleges will 
move on to Cal State or University of California classes in a typical year, a 
transfer rate that lags behind both state and national averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Some drop out, some go to private school. Many junior college students never 
intend to earn a four-year degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators who keep track of such numbers say Moorpark, Ventura and Oxnard 
college administrators are doing their best to prepare students for the 
university experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But a host of factors conspire to keep the number of transfer students 
relatively low, despite the $60 million or more taxpayers spend each year to 
fund the three campuses, students and education officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dropped out because I had to work to pay my rent," said 18-year-old Jill 
Marx, a former Ventura College student who now mixes cappuccino and espresso 
drinks at a coffeehouse across the street from her old school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't give me financial aid because my parents make too much, but I 
live on my own," said Marx, who still hopes one day to practice child 
psychology. "I'd probably have to move home to go back to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, about one in five community college students make their way to a 
four-year school in an average year. The ratio jumps to 22% nationally, but in 
Ventura County, the numbers are lower.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a study by the Center for the Study of Community Colleges, a Los 
Angeles-based research group, only 14.3% of students starting at Ventura 
College in the fall of 1988 with no college experience completed 12 credits at 
that campus and enrolled in a UC or CSU class by 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College fared slightly better, with 16.6% of its 1988 freshmen 
enrolling in a UC or CSU course within four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest of the three Ventura County campuses, Oxnard College launched 
just 10.1% of its 1988 freshmen into baccalaureate programs at UC or CSU 
campuses by 1992, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers give us a little more information than we had, but it's not the 
final word and it doesn't tell the whole story," said Carolyn Inouye, director 
of institutional research for the Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even within our own district, we have different types of students with 
different backgrounds coming to school for different reasons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Percentages of transfer students during the past decade are not available, but 
specific numbers are. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1984-85 academic year, Moorpark College transferred 442 students to UC, 
CSU or private schools and jumped to 566 this past school year, according to 
profiles from the California Postsecondary Education Commission released last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Oxnard College rose from 57 such transfers in 1984-85 to 108 
students in 1993-94. Ventura College, however, dropped from 487 transfers 10 
years ago to just 414 this past year. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the decrease may be a shift in the focus of community colleges, 
a change mandated by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The state Legislature passed a bill in 1988 restructuring the mission of 
California's community colleges and directing the schools to offer a wider 
variety of classes to residents not intending to transfer to universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the majority of students attend California's 107 junior colleges for 
other purposes: vocational programs such as nursing or paramedic training; 
remedial classes such as math or English; and self-improvement courses such as 
foreign languages or parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1.1 million students in community colleges are not all pursuing a 
university program," said Vivian Franco of the CSU chancellor's office. "Many 
students are simply pursuing personal skills or vocational goals." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Ventura County students who do want a four-year degree, there are 
other stumbling blocks that inhibit their prospects for transferring, said 
Arthur M. Cohen, director of the Center for the Study of Community Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to transfer you've got to have somewhere to go," said Cohen, 
noting that Ventura County is the state's most populated county lacking a 
public university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most community college students live at home, so when they transfer to CSU 
it's a major move," he said. "If there's a CSU campus across town or up the 
street, it makes transferring very handy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Cohen said, UC and CSU campuses tend to attract transfers based on how 
aggressively they market themselves and tailor course work toward junior 
college students. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes it a lot easier because the student knows if he takes his classes 
at a community college, he's going to get credit and there's going to be a spot 
for him in the university," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica College, for example, which leads the state in UC transfers with 
more than 500 this year, dedicates the bulk of its resources to students intent 
on earning a four-year degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a controversial issue on campus, but it's very clearly our college 
president's desire that transfers be our primary goal," Assistant Dean Brenda 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargain prices for community college courses in California also account for 
more frequent dropouts, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pay your $50, you're a student and there's no penalty for dropping out," 
he said. "It's quite different if you're in a state like Pennsylvania or 
Massachusetts, where tuition is $1,000 a term. That sort of depresses the 
flow-through because many of the students coming in haven't committed to a 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-year-old Dana McBride of Fillmore has committed to a program. She knows 
it will be a long and arduous effort before she is able to teach high school 
history. Yet she remains undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives at home and studies American history full time at Ventura College, 
but works for $5 an hour as a library clerk to pay her bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking my general (education) so I don't have to take them in the 
four-year school," said McBride, who plans to transfer to Cal State Bakersfield 
when she gets her associate of arts in history. "Their requirements to get in 
are easier, they accept more people and it's cheaper to live there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McBride said many of her classmates are unable to focus on the goal of 
reaching a university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the students who go to community college say they want to transfer, 
but very few do," the aspiring educator said. "Either they don't have the money 
or they don't have the motivation to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Nelson, transfer coordinator at the California Community Colleges' 
chancellor's office in Sacramento, also said the transfer rates at Ventura, 
Oxnard and Moorpark colleges are deceptively low. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't tell you what the goals are, and many colleges aren't necessarily 
geared to transfer students," she said. "The transfer rate is a good starting 
point, but it doesn't paint a realistic picture." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to get a better idea of where community college students are headed, 
a panel of educators from Cal State, UC, community colleges and private schools 
in 1990 began tracking nearly 70,000 junior college freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know in raw numbers how many students enter community colleges and we know 
in raw numbers how many transfer," said Philip Garcia, an analyst for the CSU 
chancellor's office. "But we never knew what proportion of students eventually 
transfer." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an ongoing study, however, that researchers say will take several years 
to complete because students often take five, six or more years to earn a 
bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cajiuat, 25, doesn't worry about how long it might take him to finish. He 
has another two years at Ventura College, and then he hopes to transfer to 
Stanford or UCLA. After that, he said, medical school awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end result is what I'm striving for, not how long it takes me to get 
there," the physical science student said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like his classmate McBride, Cajiuat said many of his peers are unmotivated or 
unfocused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the students I've seen are here because it's the logical step after 
high school," he said. "Either that, or they're just here because mom and dad 
want them to go to college. So they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Kennedy, director of the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge, said 
Ventura County ranks second-lowest of 10 Southern California counties in the 
number of CSU students -- a statistic she attributes to the lack of a public 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 Only rural Imperial County is lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing one of our best resources: our young bright students," said 
Kennedy, adding that the majority of her 1,400 students transfer from local 
junior colleges. "By and large, most of our students are going elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment figures from the U.S. Department of Education indicate that there 
are only 1.8 CSU students per 1,000 Ventura County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, San Luis Obispo County has almost 80 CSU students per 1,000 
residents. Santa Barbara County reports 49.5 CSU students per 1,000 residents 
and Los Angeles County, with five CSU campuses, averages 16.5 Cal State 
enrollees per 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County has shot itself in the foot several times by being less than 
hospitable toward the establishment of a university," Kennedy said, referring 
to a series of setbacks that have delayed a local CSU campus. "It's a great 
disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 CSU officials have targeted hundreds of acres of lemon groves west of 
Camarillo for the long-planned Cal State Ventura campus, but construction still 
is years away while the government seeks to acquire all of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the 21st-Century Cal State Ventura campus will not help the current 
crop of Ventura County high school graduates who want to attend a public 
university near home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore High School graduate Elida Bautista would have liked to go to college 
locally. Instead, the 19-year-old enrolled in Claremont McKenna College, where 
she just finished her second year and made the dean's list. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no other option," said Bautista, who is interning this summer in 
Washington as a congressional aide. "If you are serious about going to a 
four-year college, you have to leave the county." Student Transfers to the UC 
and CSU Systems 
</P>
<P>
 Percentage of students who started Ventura County community colleges in Fall 
1988 with no prior credit and who earned at least 12 units before enrolling in 
a CSU or UC class by Fall 1992:

 Moorpark College: 16.6%

ADULT EDUCATION ENTERS THE HIGH-TECH AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Les Lane fell trying to climb without a ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the demands of his bosses at a Moorpark T-shirt company, Lane 
scrambled up some shelves along a warehouse wall to retrieve stock. He slipped, 
severely breaking his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Lane is still unable to stand for more than 15 minutes at a 
time. So he spends his days at a task he had never envisioned for himself at 45 
years old: training for a new career in computers. 
</P>
<P>
 He considered attending a community college or private computer institute, the 
traditional sites for such high-tech training. But he chose instead to enroll 
at a local adult school. 
</P>
<P>
 Once viewed as the province of students trying to catch up on the basics such 
as learning to speak English or finishing their high school equivalency 
degrees, many adult schools are now becoming centers for teaching technology. 
</P>
<P>
 As they move into this arena, adult schools in Ventura County and around 
California increasingly are competing against colleges and private institutes 
for students such as Lane who have been laid off or disabled on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura Adult School, where Lane is enrolled, has been at the forefront of 
this statewide trend, a position state education officials credit to the 
leadership of Principal Barry Tronstad. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tronstad took over at Ventura Adult School in the late 1980s, the 
school's vocational offerings consisted mainly of routine courses in 
bookkeeping, word processing and other office skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Tronstad began quickly to revamp the program -- filling the school's 
classrooms with the latest models of computers, hiring teachers from industry 
and designing courses geared to a changing workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a pioneer," said Al Koshiyama, a state Department of Education 
adult education administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being a leader among the state's 412 adult schools in offering 
technology classes, Ventura Adult School also stands out because of its 
responsiveness to its community, Koshiyama said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most adult programs just keep on doing the same-old, same-old, year after 
year," he said. But Ventura Adult School has "state-of-the-art vocational 
technical skill development." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's adult education program now offers courses ranging from 
computer-aided drafting to computerized accounting and computer animation. And 
it boasts an 80% success rate at placing graduates in entry-level jobs in these 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has seven adult schools ranging in size from the 100-student 
Fillmore Adult School to the 14,000-student school in Oxnard. All of the adult 
schools are run by local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Ventura Adult School, the three other large adult schools in the 
county -- located in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Oxnard -- also offer 
training for careers ranging from computerized bookkeeping to X-ray technology. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura Adult School has gone the furthest in building a vocational 
rehabilitation program for injured or laid-off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 9,500 students who attend Ventura Adult School each year, about 275 are 
disabled or laid-off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Oxnard Adult School has only about 75 such adults among its 
14,000 students. Simi Valley Adult School's 11,500 students include only 80 who 
are there for vocational rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides any altruistic motivation to serve the disabled and the out-of-work, 
Ventura Adult School has another reason for shifting its focus -- cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Because workers' compensation funds and state and federal retraining programs 
pay tuition for disabled and laid-off employees to prepare for new careers, 
they are a ready source of money for budget-strapped schools serving such 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Adult School charges $700 per month, for example, for the 
computer-aided drafting course that Lane is taking. The course typically lasts 
about five months, bringing the total cost to about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a big jump over the nominal fees for typical adult school classes, 
such as the $48 that Ventura Adult School charges for a semester of 
conversational French. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Ventura Adult School gets $850,000, or more than one-quarter of its 
annual $3-million budget, from its vocational rehabilitation program for 
disabled or laid-off workers. The school gets another $1.2 million per year 
from a special retraining program it runs at Camarillo State Hospital for 
adults confined to the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Adult School, by contrast, gets only $100,000 in fees each year 
from its vocational rehabilitation courses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Simi Valley school, which has one of the widest selections of course 
offerings among the county's adult schools, gets about $4.6 million from the 
state each year compared to only about $1 million in annual state funding for 
the adult education program in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of such stagnant levels of state funding, Tronstad decided when he 
took over Ventura Adult School that the only way to enhance the school's 
courses was to get money from other sources. So he began to contract with local 
insurance companies and rehabilitation agencies to train their disabled or 
laid-off clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the school cannot use any of the money it receives from 
vocational rehabilitation contracts to support other programs at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 So it uses the funds from its Technology Development Center -- the name of its 
vocational rehabilitation program -- to pay the salaries of the center's 10 
full-time teachers and to upgrade its equipment. The school spends roughly 
$200,000 each year on hardware and software for subjects ranging from computer 
animation to computer graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering such courses allows the adult school to play a vital role in the 
community at a time when when midlife career changes are becoming the norm and 
employers are demanding an increasingly high level of skills from workers, 
Tronstad said. 
</P>
<P>
 For students, adult schools frequently offer more individual attention and 
flexible hours than community colleges or private institutes, some students at 
Ventura Adult School said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike schools that abide by traditional academic year calendars, students are 
able to enroll in any Technology Development Center's courses at any time 
during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although students report to class during regular hours each day -- from 8 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. for the computer-aided drafting course -- they work at their own 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said he considered but dismissed the idea of enrolling at a community 
college, where it takes two years to earn an associate's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't afford at my age to kick back and go to school for two years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A onetime painting contractor and heavy-equipment operator, Lane has always 
made his living by the sweat of his brow. 
</P>
<P>
 But a year after breaking his ankle, when even surgery failed to heal the 
pain, Lane faced the fact he had to train for work that he could do without 
standing or using his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 When he earns his computer-aided drafting certificate in November, he hopes to 
land an entry-level job, most of which pay between $7 and $11.50 per hour. That 
would be less than what Lane earned in previous jobs, he said, but it would be 
far more than the $187.50-per-week workers' compensation payments that he has 
to live on while he is in school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lane travels to school from his home in Carpinteria each day. Other students 
come from as far away as San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never touched a computer, not even to play computer games," Lane said.  
</P>
<P>
 But he never forgets the seriousness of his situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concentrating on this," Lane said, gesturing toward his computer, 
"because I don't have a backup." 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Giallenardo, a 57-year-old Camarillo resident, worked as a waitress for 
40 years before she slipped at the Newbury Park restaurant where she worked, 
breaking her hip and left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer able to lift heavy trays, she is now studying computerized 
bookkeeping at Ventura Adult School. Although she earned $15 an hour as a 
waitress, including tips, Giallenardo said she expects to get a bookkeeping job 
paying $8 to $12 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved waitressing," she said. "It was the only thing I knew." But she said 
she shares with her classmates a hopeful attitude about the future. "Everybody 
has a pretty good attitude here. You're here because you want to be."

 Crystal Cove--Combining unspoiled beaches, wind-swept bluffs and more than 
2,000 acres of canyon backcountry, Crystal Cove State Park is a gem among 
Orange County parks, attracting legions of hikers, mountain bikers and nature 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The inland canyons were hit hard in the fire of last fall, but the vegetation 
in most areas has come back strongly. Park rangers offer guided programs every 
weekend, giving first-time visitors an excellent introduction to the park, 
while giving those familiar with the park a chance to know it better. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the featured programs are a canyon walk, leaving from the El Moro 
Nature Center at 9 a.m. and going to noon, and a coastal walk, leaving from the 
Pelican Point parking lot at 1 p.m. and returning at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Next weekend, the following programs are offered: Saturday, canyon walk from 
El Moro, 9 a.m. to noon; Sunday, coastal walk from Pelican Point, 9 a.m. to 
noon; historical program at El Moro, 2 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Park ranger Kirk Marshall said the canyon walks are geared to the desires and 
abilities of the group that shows up, usually three to 20 people. "You kind of 
try to read the group and make a decision," he said. "The hike is never so 
strenuous that the group can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal walks can either follow the top of the terrace, rich in bird life 
(including the threatened California gnatcatcher), or amble along the water's 
edge. Sometimes, the walks take in both. The historical talk focuses on the 
community of cottages in Crystal Cove, a fixture since the 1920s. Beginning 
mountain bike tours are also offered occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Walks are free, but parking is $6. The park is about halfway between Corona 
del Mar and Laguna Beach on Coast Highway (El Moro is on the inland side of the 
highway; Pelican Point on the ocean side). Information: (714) 494-3539.

PICKETERS BLAST SATURN RECORD AMONG BLACKS; PROTEST: RAINBOW COALITION MEMBERS 
URGE BOYCOTT AT FIRM-SPONSORED CAR OWNERS' REUNION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Rainbow Coalition were outnumbered and without their leader, 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, as they picketed a Saturn Corp. event Saturday for what 
they charge is the car company's poor record of awarding franchises to African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 protesters, whose leader was attending a news conference in Los 
Angeles, brandished "Boycott Saturn" and other signs near the entrance of 
Knott's Berry Farm, where more than 8,000 Saturn owners and family members 
attended a company-sponsored reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was sparked by the case of African American retailer Timothy L. 
Woods, whose license to set up a franchise in Chino was revoked last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn officials said that Woods failed to set up a dealership after having 
the license for four years. Woods sued, but a federal court upheld an 
arbitration panel's decision in Saturn's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's protest was "an issue of access and empowerment," said Eddie Wong, 
western regional director for the Rainbow Coalition, a political group Jackson 
founded 11 years ago to advance the economic condition of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, it's like a wake-up call to Saturn until they can sit down with 
Rev. Jackson and the Rainbow Coalition" to discuss African American ownership 
in the company, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturn officials asserted in a news release that the company's record for 
signing minority and African American franchisees is actually higher than it is 
for other car makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company in a written statement passed out to Saturn owners Saturday stated 
that its dealerships and future "commitments" for facilities will include at 
least 11 controlled by African Americans. They did not say how many are 
currently owned by African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The release also said that Saturn has signed an agreement with another African 
American businessman to replace Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the facts, our record of minority representation is the 
highest in the industry," said George Doss, an African American who is Saturn's 
western area manager. "We can always do better -- everyone can -- but I think 
the proof is in the pudding." 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturn owners attending the fete at Knott's weren't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If what I hear (from pickets) is true, I think it's wrong," said Larissa 
Brown, 20, of Santa Ana.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
COUNTY DEMOCRATS HEADST FOR WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION, ISSUE BRIEFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House-bound: County Democrats Howard Adler, Richard O'Neill, Chris 
Townsend and Mark Lee are on their way to Washington this week for a day of 
briefings with senior officials and a reception with President Clinton. 
According to Adler, a Laguna Hills-based shopping center developer and former 
county Democratic Party chairman, the Administration wants to talk to 
California business people about goals and about the issues facing the nation, 
including health care and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler says he is going to tell Clinton's advisers that they are doing a poor 
sales job on the health-care plan, which he maintains is good for small 
business, not the liability it is often perceived to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they have sold this plan well to small business," says Adler, 
51. "The message hasn't come through that small companies with, say 100 
employees or less, will actually do better under the Clinton plan. Right now, 
we are subsidizing the minority of businesses--those companies who don't pay 
employee health benefits--and that ticks me off." 
</P>
<P>
 On the crime bill, now stalled in Congress, Adler will suggest that the 
Administration find a way to sidestep the death penalty debate--perhaps making 
it a separate issue entirely--and get the bill passed quickly. "The death 
penalty appeal issue is holding the entire bill hostage," Adler says. "I'm 
upset. The sooner we get more cops on the street the better." 
</P>

 Same job: With the recent arrival of conservative political consultant Ed 
Rollins to the Michael Huffington Senate campaign, the question became: What 
does this do to former Orange County supervisor Bruce Nestande's role? Some 
insisted Rollins' arrival meant a demotion for Nestande, who has worked for 
Santa Barbara-based Huffington since his successful run for Congress in 1992. 
But Nestande insists that is not so and that there has been no shake up in the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed was brought aboard because he's a very successful political consultant and 
manager," says Nestande, now a resident of the north Tustin area, who is 
working in Huffington's Costa Mesa office. "He did Reagan's campaigns and has 
good knowledge of California. He's helping us develop our overall campaign 
strategy. My main focus is networking with the political establishment in 
California." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Silly season: It is candidate filing time in local races and Orange County's 
powerful, conservative Lincoln Club will get involved at both the city council 
and school board levels, according to club vice presidents Tom Malcolm and Ron 
Meer. Neither would say whether the club will back a Republican candidate to 
challenge Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, a Democrat who is up for reelection in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the club does take an interest in local races. We're trying to get more 
active in local issues," says Malcolm, an Irvine attorney. "We're looking for 
good candidates to run for higher offices." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Meer: "It's not our policy to play headhunter or seek out people, but if 
somebody is interested in running for office, we're interested in talking to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the county: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Orange, rumors persist that 65-year-old Mayor Gene Beyer will file for 
reelection despite his ill health and such poor attendance that officials 
covered his name on the voting board, although some of his supporters are 
quietly trying to persuade him not to run. So far, the only other mayoral 
candidate is Councilwoman Joanne Coontz. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Newport Beach, Long Pham, 43, is a council candidate who, if elected to 
one of four open seats, would be the county's second Vietnamese American to 
hold public office after Westminster Councilman Tony Lam. The distinction 
matters little to Pham, a mechanical engineer and five-year Newport Beach 
resident. "It is not that I don't think about the Vietnamese community. But I 
think first about the community I live in." 
</P>
<P>
 * In Irvine, Mayor Michael Ward surprised the crowd at last week's council 
meeting by sporting a black eye patch and earring, part of a Leukemia Society 
fund-raising gimmick. "This is going to be great during the reelection 
campaign," said Ward, who is seeking a second term as mayor. "I can see it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 * In Huntington Beach, Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson--a candidate for county 
supervisor--said two rumors floating around Surf City are false. She is not 
running a co-campaign for City Council nor will she seek a council appointment 
if she loses the supervisor's race to her rival, fellow Councilman Jim Silva. 
"I'm committed to run for the Board of Supervisors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moving west: Everyone keeps insisting that Assemblyman Ross Johnson 
(R-Fullerton) will move west to the coast and make a run for state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson's seat in a special election after Bergeson takes over as county 
supervisor in December. If so, Johnson would be facing Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson, who has already announced he wants the seat, and possibly 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress). The speculation increased after Johnson 
held a recent fund-raiser in Sacramento. So far, Johnson's not admitting it, 
nor, however, is he denying the rumors.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; YOUTHS WRITE VIDEO SCRIPT TO WARN PEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As his van wound through the remote, rocky canyon on the western fringe of 
Thousand Oaks, 18-year-old Aristotle Alvarez began to sweat. What, he thought, 
had his probation officer gotten him into? 
</P>
<P>
 Why had he volunteered to spend four days cooped up on this distant ranch, 
surrounded by eerie, fire-scorched mountains? Why had he promised to work long 
hours for just a token stipend of $25 a day? 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few hours, Aristotle answered his own questions. 
</P>
<P>
 He was there to help other youths avoid the troubles he had encountered 
growing up in North Hollywood. He was there to learn, and to teach. He was 
there to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 And so were the other seven teen-agers who joined him at the Carlisle Canyon 
ranch last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by a $10,000 federal grant, the students spent four days writing a 
script for a half-hour video aimed at teaching their peers to stay away from 
drugs and protect themselves from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hosts, film industry veterans Clifford and Carol Lynn Wegner, have been 
running similar programs for the past three years.  
</P>
<P>
 They have helped about 70 at-risk teen-agers write and produce educational 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
 But this particular project marked the first time the Wegners had received 
money -- and explicit instructions -- from government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Office on AIDS, Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, and 
Department of Education had teamed up to commission a video linking drug use 
and infection with the HIV virus. And they wanted the film to be produced by 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project has really validated what we know from research," video 
coordinator John Elfers said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to reach kids, the best way is through kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids who worked on the federally funded video were referred by probation 
officers, social workers or school counselors.  
</P>
<P>
 All shared an initial skepticism about the project -- doubts that evaporated 
when they got down to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Camacho, 17, a former Oxnard gang member and recovering alcoholic, wrote 
a script about a young addict who shared needles and woke up one day terrified 
that he would contract the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College art student Chris Matthews, 19, co-wrote a sardonic talk-show 
script in which the HIV virus acts as a host, taunting callers that he'll catch 
up with them eventually. And 14-year-old Lydia Spurlock of Santa Paula wrote 
about a depressed, abused teen-age boy who turns to drugs for solace. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers will return to the ranch in late August to shoot the 28-minute 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a chance in a lot of aspects of life," Chris said. "I want to 
do something productive here and be able to see what I've done at the end."

 Two candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 41st 
Congressional District. They are Democrat Ed Tessier of Pomona and Republican 
Jay C. Kim, the incumbent, of Diamond Bar. Where they stand on four issues: 
Health Care 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier: "First, I support maintaining a private sector health care system so 
that market forces will maintain flexibility and competitiveness. Second, I 
believe universal coverage must be a goal by the end of this decade. I support 
efforts to expand access to current health care plans by eliminating most 
eligibility restrictions. For the working poor, I would support eligibility in 
current poverty-focused health care systems. Third, I oppose financing new 
public sector coverage by taxing health care benefits or imposing mandatory 
employer 'contributions.' Only sin taxes (cigarettes, alcohol, ammunition) seem 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: Did not respond to this question. 
</P>
<P>
 Education and Health Care Benefits for Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier: "Increasing our control of our national borders is imperative. 
However, denying undocumented children access to education would cause crime to 
increase and threaten us with the return of mass exploitation of child labor. 
It would not reduce illegal immigration. Similarly, refusing treatment to the 
undocumented ill would not reduce illegal immigration, but only threaten the 
public health." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: I "favor curtailing both health care and educational benefits" to illegal 
</P>
<P>
 immigrants. Crime 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier: "I support 'three strikes and you're out' legislation for violent 
criminals and boot camps for young offenders. I support more severe prosecution 
of parole violations and oppose any early release of violent felons. However, I 
believe that our best public investment is in crime prevention. We must 
increase the number of police officers to match the crime rate. . . . Community 
policing, cops on the beat, junior police corps and trained resident patrols 
are all necessary."  
</P>
<P>
 Kim: Opposed anti-crime bill approved by the House earlier this year that is 
now pending before a House-Senate conference committee. "We must pass more 
stringent measures to control rampant violent crime at the local level." El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier: "Historically, expansion of aviation infrastructure has meant 
long-term job growth and economic expansion. I support the concept of 
converting the El Toro base into a commercial airport. However, in this 
recession, public investment must be cautious, clearly demonstrating an 
economic benefit. For example, private sector investment must be secure and the 
conversion process should not jeopardize the operations of other facilities 
such as Ontario or John Wayne airports." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "This is a local decision that is best handled at the local level."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGED KNIFE THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo man was arrested on suspicion of assault and false imprisonment 
after he held his son and three of his son's friends at knifepoint for more 
than six hours Friday night and early Saturday morning, a county sheriff's 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Gullickson, 40, was arrested after one of his son's friends escaped 
and called authorities from a neighboring home, Sheriff's Lt. Gary Backman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backman said Gullickson does not have custody of his son. The boy and his 
friends came to Gullickson's home Friday and joined him for an evening of 
drinking and taking drugs, Backman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not say how old the boy or his friends were. 
</P>
<P>
 For unknown reasons, Gullickson would not let the boy and his friends leave, 
Backman said. He confronted them with a knife, handcuffed them and then 
threatened to kill them if they did not stay, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies were called about 5:30 a.m. Saturday after one of the 
friends escaped, Backman said. Authorities did not say how the friend managed 
to free himself from the handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies arrived, they had to use pepper spray to subdue Gullickson, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullickson was booked into the Ventura County Jail on suspicion of false 
imprisonment, assault with a deadly weapon, and for being under the influence 
of an illegal drug, deputies said. His bail was set at $5,000. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; TRUSTEE WILL SEEK 3RD SCHOOL BOARD TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking a third term on the Conejo Valley school board, trustee Mildred Lynch 
filed papers last week with the Ventura County Elections Division to get her 
name on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch's seat is one of three up for election this fall. Positions held by 
trustee Richard Newman and former trustee William Henry Jr., who resigned July 
1, are also open. Newman has not said whether he will seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, who has served on the Conejo Valley school board for nearly nine years, 
said she has enjoyed her tenure and is eager to continue her work as a board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have accomplished something and there is more to be done," she said 
Thursday. "I have always been actively involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch has been a strong opponent of the California Learning Assessment System 
test and has traveled to Sacramento to voice her concerns about the 
controversial exam before various state committees. "Whether I am elected again 
or not, I will not lose my interest (in CLAS) and will do whatever I can to 
make it better or wipe it out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An English teacher at both the high school and university levels for 35 years, 
Lynch said she wants to revamp the district's curriculum to improve students' 
writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The 77-year-old Thousand Oaks resident believes in setting high standards for 
students. "If there is one thing wrong with our education, it is that we do not 
expect enough" from students, she said. Lynch said diminishing school funds 
will be the biggest issue facing the school board next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money will continue to be the problem," she said. "But I don't believe money 
is the sole answer to better education. You have to make choices sometimes that 
are not too keen. You have to be able to make the most of what you have." TRACY

 A former Oxnard man was arrested in Huntington Park on suspicion of killing 
Guillermo Ortega at Community Center Park in Oxnard five years ago, an Oxnard 
police spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Villa, 28, was arrested about 11:30 p.m. Friday by Huntington Park police 
after a warrant was issued and signed by Ventura County Superior Court Judge 
Melinda Johnson, the spokesman said.Oxnard homicide investigators said an 
anonymous tipster led police to Villa, who also goes by the alias Jorge Luna. 
The homicide investigation dates back to June 18, 1989, when Ortega was slain 
at Community Center Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa was taken to Oxnard and then booked into the Ventura County Jail on 
suspicion of murder, a jail spokesman said. His bail was set at $250,000. SCOTT

SUMMER LEARNING PROGRAM IN PLACENTIA STRESSES CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Derrick Tan waved a white plastic straw over pieces of cereal and sawdust, 
watching closely to see if any of the items moved. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a magic trick, but Tan's expression revealed a touch of wonderment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it worked," Tan said, as bits of cereal clung to the straw. 
</P>
<P>
 The straw-waving exercise, which demonstrated the power of static electricity, 
was one of several conducted by students participating in a summer enrichment 
program at Golden Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Foundation for Creative Minds, the program offers weeklong 
classes combining academic subjects with art and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 To teach the lesson on static electricity, for instance, instructor Madeline 
Johnson had students quickly rub plastic straws with pieces of nylon, then wave 
the straws over a variety of items to see which ones were attracted to the 
straw. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslye Prum, director of the Foundation for Creative Minds, started the 
enrichment program five years ago to give her son something to do during summer 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the courses emphasize creativity and use a hands-on approach, Prum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing we're trying to accomplish is to bring enrichment to children, 
to have them so turned on to learning that they can hardly wait to come back 
here," Prum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Aherne Daly has discovered an essential tool in teaching fractions and 
other math concepts to young students: food. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we use measuring cups and spoons to teach fractions, students are more 
likely to remember them," Daly said. "It's something they see at home, that is 
applicable to their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, who teaches first grade at St. Columban's School in Garden Grove during 
the school year, used a variety of food projects to teach children in the 
enrichment program about fractions, estimating and graphing. 
</P>
<P>
 Handfuls of colored jelly beans were used to teach estimating and graphing, 
with students predicting how many of each color were in their pile, then 
charting the actual numbers. Students used fractions both to measure 
ingredients to make pizza and to divide the pizza into even portions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fun way to learn math," said 8-year old Shannon Brammer. "Plus, I'm 
just starting to make my own lunch so that's why I wanted to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Space is available for the last summer enrichment program session beginning 
Monday, offered at both Golden and Laguna Road Elementary School in Fullerton. 
Classes are held from 9 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. The fee is $80. For more information 
call the Foundation for Creative Minds, (714) 738-1296.

FULLERTON VOTERS WANT AN ELECTION, AND THEY'LL GET IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recent editorials, letters to the editor and news reports regarding the 
controversy surrounding the forthcoming Fullerton council election may have 
created a misperception in some minds. Current published accounts appear to 
imply that voters in the June 7 recall election called for a special election 
as opposed to electing recalled council member replacements during the next 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is our ballot choice was between a special election and replacement 
by appointment, should the recall prevail. Thus, the majority of voters opted 
to have recalled council members replaced by the election process rather than 
by appointment by the remaining two council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the ballot options given, I voted for replacement by election. 
However, if the ballot choice had been between a special election and the 
general election, and had related costs been accurately established and 
effectively communicated to the voting public, I would have opted for the Nov. 
8 general election. I believe a large number of Fullerton voters would have 
done the same if for no other reason than to save the estimated expense of a 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
 E.M. GINTER 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * Enough of this self-serving blathering about "honor" among the three 
recalled Fullerton City Council members (Hal McDonnel, Letters, July 17). 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks they should resign at once -- which would create difficult legal 
problems that might not be sorted out for ages. In any case, he wants the 
special election to fill the three seats held as early as possible, not 
consolidated with the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mr. McDonnel is interested in honor, why doesn't he mention that the 
earliest possible date for a special election would be Oct. 18 -- barely three 
weeks before the general election at which time this matter will be settled. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the height of foolishness to have an election whose outcome might be 
reversed only three weeks later.

ANAHEIM COUPLE TAKE TO THE ROAD TO PICK UP LITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glen and Susan Hanket's lives are still consumed with trash and miles and 
miles of road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim couple has spent the better part of the past 15 months walking 
across the United States to pick up litter.To date, they have walked nearly 
3,000 miles and filled more than 1,000 bags with at least two tons of trash, 
says Glen Hanket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't believe how filthy the roads are, even out in the middle of 
cornfields," he said. "But we can always tell what highways are part of an 
Adopt-a-Highway program. They are much cleaner. It really makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more unexpected items they have found are a butterfly collection, a 
teddy bear and, in a Midwestern cornfield, a pile of German and Polish 
pornographic magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hankets, both 38, began their venture in April, 1993, after Glen took a 
voluntary layoff from his job as a software engineer at Rockwell and Susan quit 
her paralegal position. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, they walked and filled trash bags from Maine to Missouri, 
covering 1,800 miles, and have paused to talk to reporters from time to time. 
They broke for the winter, resuming their trek in Missouri in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanket said they cover about 13 to 15 miles a day. They plan to end their 
journey on the Washington coast on Halloween.

3 MEN ARRESTED IN ROBBERY MAY BE LINKED TO OTHER CASES

 A regional police task force arrested three men on suspicion of robbing a 
local liquor store and is investigating their possible connection to other 
recent robberies in the area, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After an investigation, which included a 2 1/2-day stakeout, police arrested 
two brothers and their uncle Friday after the robbery at Neighborhood Liquor at 
9461 Edinger Ave. in Westminster, said Lt. Luis Ochoa of Huntington Beach 
police, which released information on the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from Anaheim, Huntington Beach and Irvine recovered $112 and a 
six-pack of beer taken in the robbery, as well as a loaded .44-caliber revolver 
allegedly used by one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Vergara, of Garden Grove, and his nephews Gabriel Vergara, 22, and 
Raphael Vergara, 18, both of Anaheim, were being held Saturday in the 
Huntington Beach City Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa said that the investigation has broadened to include recent robberies in 
Huntington Beach, Costa Mesa, Irvine and Fountain Valley. In each case, 
gun-wielding robbers held up the stores. During the robbery in Irvine, Ochoa 
said, one of the robbers fired four shots at a clerk but missed.

TIME RUNS OUT FOR BANK SEIZED AFTER LOSING $200,000 A MONTH; SAN PEDRO: REAL 
ESTATE SLUMP AND BAD LOANS ARE BLAMED FOR THE FAILURE OF THE HARBOR AREA'S SOLE 
INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With regulators knocking at their door, Bank of San Pedro executives tried 
time and again to stay afloat. They sold real estate assets, raised money in a 
stock offering, even collected a settlement from a sunken ship. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all too late. State banking officials seized the financial institution 
this month, shutting the doors on San Pedro's only independent financial 
institution. The bank had been losing $200,000 a month, and its operations lost 
more than $4 million since 1992, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Bank of Signal Hill acquired $22.1 million of the Bank of San Pedro's 
$123.4 million in assets, including two of the failed institution's branches in 
San Pedro. The sites reopened Monday under their new name. Home Bank also plans 
to keep about 40 of the Bank of San Pedro's 80 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed bank's other sites -- including its headquarters in San Pedro and 
branches in Long Beach and Gardena -- were closed by state officials and placed 
into the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Also closed was a site in Avalon, leaving Catalina Island with only one bank, 
a branch of Southern California Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of San Pedro President Lance Oak and board Chairman Peter Mandia, along 
with other top executives, gave up the bank's management after it was seized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just ran out of time," said Gerry Findley, publisher of the Findley 
Reports newsletter, which reports banking statistics. "Management of the past 
couple of years has been doing a good job of trying to raise capital." 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators blamed the bank's failure on real estate investments that turned 
sour during the recession and a high number of bad loans. Overall, the losses 
reduced the bank's capital to $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bank's portfolio of non-performing loans was 5.9% at the end 
of last year. State and federal regulators -- who date the bank's problems to 
1987 -- recommend only 1% to 2% in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got hit with what many independent banks have gone through," said Barry 
Rubens, president of California Research Corp., a bank consulting firm in Santa 
Monica. "They just couldn't get over the problems. Usually, in seven years you 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 Some former board members blame the bank's demise on the new direction the 
institution took in the 1980s, when it added new branches and started a 
subsidiary to invest in real estate projects. Among the investments: an 80% 
stake in the $25 million Redondo Shores shopping center, which has lost money 
and cut into the bank's profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really the iceberg that brought it down," said Jim Hussey, a Bank of 
San Pedro founder, who left its board 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hussey and four others founded the bank in 1975 at the site of a former 
take-out chicken restaurant, their goal was to give the harbor community's 
residents and businesses a financial institution of their own, rather than 
depend on big chain banks based in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a major shake-up in the bank's executive ranks in 1981, when two San 
Pedro developers -- Steven G. Podesta and Bill A. Moller -- acquired a 
controlling interest in the bank's stock. The founding directors quit and some 
were dismayed at the decision to move the headquarters to a 5th Street building 
owned by Moller and Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the bank's new directors oversaw a rapid expansion, including 
the start-up of the Gardena, Torrance and Avalon branches, and investments in 
real estate projects near the Port of Los Angeles. The bank's assets jumped 
from $32 million when they joined the board to $180 million by the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1989, state banking regulators began to scrutinize some of the loans 
the bank issued to its own directors, including nearly $2 million in loans to 
Moller and slightly more than $1 million to Podesta.  
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials defended the loans and contended the scrutiny stemmed from the 
special attention that federal regulators began to give to so-called insider 
loans following the savings and loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank directors, however, agreed in 1990 to adopt tighter restrictions on 
loans to themselves and other bank officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moller and Podesta, who left the bank's board in 1990, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The two partners also were once co-owners of the cruise ship Princess Louise, 
a popular floating restaurant in the Los Angeles Harbor that sunk in 1989. They 
had sold the vessel by that time, but the subsequent owner went bankrupt and it 
was repossessed by the Bank of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until last summer that the bank collected a $2 million insurance 
settlement on the ship. The money gave the bank a momentary reprieve from state 
banking regulators, who already had imposed deadlines for raising capital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bank could not sustain its revenue stream. Moreover, bank officials were 
unable to close a deal on the Redondo Shores shopping center, which continued 
to eat away at profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They talked about selling it for a number of years," said Stan Cardenas, 
chief deputy superintendent at the state Banking Department. "We heard about 
it, but it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the bank also tried to sell stock to investors, but raised only $3 
million, far short of the $4 million to $5 million it needed to meet state 
banking guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure has left the FDIC with some of the bank's assets, including stakes 
in Redondo Shores and the Catalina Canyon Hotel on Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC also will set up a plan for payment of claims to 210 customers who 
have uninsured deposits exceeding $100,000. Shareholders in the company are 
expected to lose their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Bank, which bought $82.2 million of the bank's insured deposits, will 
continue to operate the former bank's sites as consumer-oriented banks, said 
Home Bank Chief Executive James Staes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there is a downturn, every financial institution has to bite the 
bullet," Staes said.

FAMILY, FRIENDS PAY TRIBUTE TO SLAIN ORANGE COUNTY WOMAN; MURDER: MEANWHILE, 
INVESTIGATORS SAY THE SUSPECT PROBABLY ACTED ALONE IN KILLING DENISE HUBER, WHO 
DISAPPEARED THREE YEARS AGO AT AGE 23. 
</P>

<P>
 Hundreds of people joined Saturday in bidding farewell to Denise Anette Huber, 
the ever-smiling young waitress who disappeared three years ago and was 
recently found bludgeoned to death in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath a sun-washed, denim-blue sky, family and friends, including those who 
came to know Huber's parents only after the 23-year-old vanished along a 
Southern California freeway, gathered at Mariner's Church in Newport Beach for 
a graceful, low-key memorial that included an abundance of tributes, 
testimonies and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 From as far as Canada and Tennessee, Huber's relatives and friends traveled to 
attend the 90-minute service, where six of them, each allotted a brief moment 
to remember her equally brief life, recalled with humor her fondness for frogs, 
fun and the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Vancouver and I did not share Denise's enthusiasm for the Los 
Angeles Kings," said Huber's cousin Dave Nieuwsma, a youth pastor and Vancouver 
Canucks fan, whose remark prompted muffled laughter, one of half a dozen such 
lighter moments in an otherwise somber event. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieuwsma, whose oldest daughter was about Huber's age, talked of possessing 
wonderful memories, but said the "one who brought those memories is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have been more like her," said Debbie Scott, a former college 
roommate. "Life was so much fun when she was around." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the grisly events of the past 10 days -- since Huber's body was found 
in Arizona inside a freezer belonging to a former Lake Forest man -- were 
alluded to several times, the Rev. Walt Shepard urged people to set the past 
aside and look forward. And yet, in the next breath, he seemed unable to heed 
his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help thinking . . . of some of the details that have come out in 
the investigation," he said. "You've got to be thinking with me of the words 
blunt-force trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 As Huber was eulogized Saturday afternoon, investigators and criminologists 
continued to pore over evidence in the case and said they have concluded that 
John Joseph Famalaro, the man charged with her murder in Arizona, probably 
acted alone. Yet authorities said they have not dismissed the possibility that 
Famalaro, a 37-year-old house painter, had help hiding her body for more than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there are no signs of an accomplice, but we can't rule out the 
possibility that someone may have knowingly helped him hide the body 
afterward," said Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith declined to say who police believe may have helped Famalaro conceal 
Huber's body since 1991. Authorities suspect that her corpse was stored most of 
the time in a freezer purchased by Famalaro about a week after Huber 
disappeared in Costa Mesa on June 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona authorities found the freezer July 13 inside a Ryder rental truck 
parked outside Famalaro's home at the Prescott Country Club in Dewey. It 
contained Huber's body, her hands cuffed and eyes and mouth sealed with duct 
tape. An extension cord ran from the truck to Famalaro's mother's house next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, of Newport Beach, was last seen alive after attending a rock concert at 
the Forum in Inglewood. Her abandoned Honda Accord was later found on the 
Corona del Mar Freeway, with its right rear tire shredded. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also said Saturday that Arizona officials turned over a sample of 
Huber's blood so the Orange County Sheriff's Department's crime lab can 
complete critical tests that might determine where Huber was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sample is being compared with a substance, possibly blood, taken from a 
Laguna Hills storage facility that Famalaro was renting at the time of Huber's 
disappearance. Authorities are trying to determine whether Huber may have been 
killed there. 
</P>
<P>
 If the samples match, they could further implicate Famalaro, and place Huber's 
death in Orange County, clearing the way for the case to be moved there for 
prosecution.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JOSE DE LA TORRE: MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES WILL NEED 
TRANS-NATIONAL MANAGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSE DE LA TORRE, JOSE DE LA TORRE is a professor of international business 
strategy in UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management and director of the 
university's Center for International Business Education and Research.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The globalization fad that is rapidly spreading among U.S. corporations has 
important implications for the skills required of future managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Long gone are the days when companies sent a small force of expatriates to the 
far-flung posts of the corporate empire. These "foreign service" executives, 
bribed to serve most of their careers overseas by large bonuses and perks, were 
seldom integrated into the company's main business at home and often were 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the multinational structures that consisted essentially of cloning 
domestic business activities in other countries. Cost pressures and the need to 
be "politically sensitive" argued for replacing expatriate managers with local 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, we see more and more companies giving up regional or geographic 
structures and shifting decision-making authority to "global" product 
divisions. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ford is merging its North American and European operations (Latin America 
and Asia will follow soon) into five worldwide program centers responsible for 
all future product development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM's new structure moves away from its old geographic organization by 
setting up 14 worldwide sales and marketing groups focused on specific 
industrial sectors -- a move that recognizes the importance of being more 
responsive to groups of customers with similar needs, whatever their location. 
</P>
<P>
 * Similar stories can be told about European and Japanese multinationals. 
Faced with the need to coordinate an increasingly complex set of activities, 
companies as different as Philips, ABB, Honda and Mitsubishi Electric either 
have broken operations into small units with global responsibilities or set up 
new coordinating mechanisms requiring multicultural, multinational task forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Different industries and company cultures require tailored approaches to the 
eternal dilemma of how best to balance global demands with local requirements. 
But one thing is common to all of these organizations: Cross-national teams are 
thrust together at all levels. They must sort out how best to serve a 
multinational client operating in five continents, make decisions as to when 
and where to add or remove capacity, design new products for global customers, 
transfer best practice from around the world and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 What sort of managerial skills does life in these global organizations 
require? 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies that technical and professional competence will continue to be 
requisite skills to succeed in today's competitive business world. But they are 
no longer enough. The managers best suited to function in the new global 
economy at Apple or 3M -- or for that matter at Compaq or Disney -- also will 
need a better understanding of the global business environment, a great deal of 
cultural sensitivity and a set of language and communication skills adapted to 
operating in such cross-cultural teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges and universities must do their part in emphasizing international 
content in their programs and in requiring such activities as foreign 
internships and language training. But the critical burden is on the 
corporation to provide opportunities for international careers that will 
enhance the acquisition of these skills by their executives. 
</P>
<P>
 A telling trend is the increasing reliance on foreign-born CEOs by such 
leading U.S. corporations as Coke, 3M, Salomon Bros., Citibank, Ford, Apple, 
Intel and Compaq. To the extent that the way to the top calls for an 
international background or experience -- and that systems are put in place to 
provide it to young executives -- there will be little need to bribe them to go 
abroad. Self interest will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no substitute for such firsthand exposure to the complexities of 
world markets. Having served in the trenches, the executive returns with a 
greater understanding of conditions overseas and more realistic expectations. 
The same applies to the benefits of rotating key potential managers from abroad 
through domestic operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Coca Cola proudly assigned one of its toughest and most successful 
U.S. managers to France to deal with its newly acquired distribution system. He 
spoke no French, had never visited France and took pride in the fact that he 
would "Americanize" the French market. Eighteen months later, he was reassigned 
home. It was not that his ideas were wrong or badly implemented, but that his 
lack of cultural awareness got in the way of his effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrast that story with Squibb's decision to hire the head of the Chinese 
language department at Cornell University to head its new subsidiary in 
Shanghai. Although ignorant of the technical aspects of the business, he was 
supported by an excellent U.S. staff, and his language and cultural skills 
allowed him to surround himself with the best local managers, whether they 
spoke English or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The global organization of tomorrow will need a strong group of senior 
executives who can operate in a complex and multicultural world. This calls for 
a new generation of trans patriates -- not ex patriates -- who have served in 
various countries early in their careers, acquired experience in multicultural 
teams and have an open and curious attitude toward other peoples and cultures. 
The time to begin developing these skills is now.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: POSITIVE SIGNS ARE FEW FOR STOCK FUND INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I made a call to Arms this past week searching for clues to the stock market's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard W. Arms Jr., that is. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a leading "technical" stock market analyst who earlier this year started 
a new job as portfolio manager of a small capital-appreciation mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
 I figured he and other defensive fund managers might have some insights as to 
what's in store for the remainder of 1994, following a rough first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms' investment-advisory firm, based in Albuquerque, N.M., on Jan. 1 took 
over the Investor's Research Fund, a laggard $37-million portfolio formerly 
headquartered in Santa Barbara. Under his direction, the fund had a decent 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors Research did lose 3.4% during the January-June period, but that was 
less than half the 7.8% average decline for other capital-appreciation funds, 
reports Lipper Analytical Services. Domestic stock funds in general were off 
5.8% on average. 
</P>
<P>
 As a technical analyst, Arms makes investment decisions after studying price 
and share-volume trading patterns in individual stocks and the market. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stockbroker in 1967, he developed the Arms index, also known as the 
short-term trading index, or Trin. This indicator measures the volume of rising 
stocks compared to the volume of declining stocks -- a yardstick closely 
monitored by many active traders. (Should you happen to find yourself in 
Albuquerque, Arms is the guy driving the Mercedes with "volume" spelled out on 
the license plate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the indicator isn't flashing promising signals for stock fund 
investors. Arms doesn't believe the market's downward phase is over yet, even 
with the Dow Jones industrial average off more than 200 points since late 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "A decline of this magnitude has to end with heavy (selling) volume, a 
capitulation that we just haven't seen yet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms doesn't think the current downdraft will end until a lot more investors 
throw up their hands in exasperation and sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms isn't the only stock fund manager who thinks prices could move still 
lower from here. Though their rationales often differ, several other 
defensive-minded managers who fled to the sidelines earlier this year are still 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Robert Meeder Jr., who runs the Muirfield portfolio at the 
Flex-Funds group in Dublin, Ohio. He scraped out a 0.7% gain during the tough 
first half, thanks to a decision to move to cash in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Arms, Meeder rates overall investor sentiment these days as grim, which 
in Wall Street's mind-set is a positive, contrarian sign. Meeder also takes 
heart from what he sees as a firming bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 But as of this past week, Meeder had the $80-million Muirfield portfolio 
entirely in cash. He expects to remain there until he sees such encouraging 
signs as a higher ratio of advancing to declining stocks, a greater percentage 
of upside volume and better performance by medium and small stocks, among other 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Brody also started to move heavily to cash in February. He manages the 
$70-million American Growth Fund in Denver, which slid a modest 1.2% in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining the fund's 71% cash weighting, Brody cites the trend to higher 
interest rates as a drag. Also, he notes the typical bear market takes stocks 
down about 25%. At its April low, the Dow Jones industrial average was off only 
10%, and it has rallied modestly since. 
</P>
<P>
 Brody isn't attempting to fight the tide. "We're not really trying to make 
money right now. We're just trying to preserve it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Though pessimistic now, Brody sees the bear market ending this year and then 
an advance that will take the Dow to 8000 within four years or so.  
</P>
<P>
 Rich Howard doesn't try to time the market, but when he can't find attractive 
stocks the effect is much the same. Howard manages T. Rowe Price Capital 
Appreciation, a $585-million Baltimore-based fund that surrendered just 0.6% 
during the first half. (Note: T. Rowe Price funds are listed under "P" in The 
Times' mutual fund tables.)  
</P>
<P>
 Based on what he considers to be slim pickings in terms of bargains, Howard 
has about 25% of the portfolio in cash -- a fairly defensive posture that he 
has maintained for nearly three years. Lately, he has been buying some oil 
companies and bad-news stocks such as Philip Morris, but prices in general 
might have to fall further before more issues catch his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Most encouraging of the defensive-minded managers surveyed for this article 
was Kevin Wenck, who runs GT Global America Growth, a $180-million fund 
headquartered in San Francisco. Helped by a March 1 cash position of 40%, and 
some astute picks, the fund advanced 8.2% during the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Howard, Wenck doesn't try to time the market per se but allows cash to 
build up when he can't find bargains. He looks for good-quality growth stocks 
that have been knocked out of favor for one reason or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't find very inexpensive stocks, we won't buy anything at all," 
Wenck says. Lately, he has uncovered some good buys, and the fund's cash 
position has dropped to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even Wenck admits to being concerned by the market's skittish behavior of 
late, as revealed by the tendency of investors to fixate on small negative 
"details" of a company's operations and beat down its share price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder if I'm a little early (making investments) because of all the 
negative sentiment out there," Wenck says. "This is one of the strangest 
markets I've seen."

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: SELLING AN INSURANCE POLICY FOR CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I have AIDS and am thinking of selling my individual and group life 
insurance policies to generate money on which to live comfortably for the rest 
of my life. What kind of taxes will I have to pay on the money I get from these 
policies? -- M.W . 
</P>
<P>
 A. As more and more people with life-threatening illnesses seek to cash in 
their life insurance policies to raise cash to see them through their final 
days, an entire industry has sprung up around these so-called viatical 
settlements. Before you worry about tax consequences, however, you might wish 
to consider some other important issues in deciding whether this is the right 
move for you. 
</P>
<P>
 First, some background. All types of life insurance policies are eligible for 
such sales -- whole life, term, universal and even group life from an employer. 
Selling one's insurance policy usually takes six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the amount paid in advance on life insurance policies is between 
50% and 80% of the policy's face value. The percentage is lowest for small 
policies. Another factor is the policyholder's life expectancy; the longer it 
is, the less you can expect to get for the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, companies that buy these policies are looking for people 
who are expected to live less than two more years. They also want policies that 
are at least 2 years old, to ensure that the contest period on the policy has 
expired. Attempts to sell a policy during its first two years could trigger an 
investigation that might lead to losing the coverage entirely, due to 
misrepresentations on the original application. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, proceeds from insurance policy sales are subject to regular federal 
income tax, but they are not taxed by the state of California. Some companies 
may try to imply that you have no tax obligation by telling you there is no 
reporting of the payment to the Internal Revenue Service on a 1099 statement or 
other document. While it is true that there is no formal reporting system, your 
tax obligation still stands. The federal government is considering allowing 
life insurance policies to be redeemed without tax liability by people who have 
life-threatening illnesses. However, the new regulations are not yet in effect, 
and when they are it is possible that they will apply only to policy sales made 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 California requires viatical settlement companies to be licensed by its 
Department of Insurance. So far, about 30 companies have applied, and three 
have been licensed. Be sure you deal with a licensed company or one that has 
applied for a license and paid the required fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure, too, that you secure at least three bids for a net cash-out value 
(after all expenses) and do not, under any circumstances, accept partial or 
installment payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Before selling your policy, ask your insurance company whether it offers an 
accelerated benefits program or will make you a loan against your policy. Many 
companies will advance you some of the proceeds during your lifetime, with the 
remainder to be paid to your beneficiary upon death. However, this service 
typically is available only to people who are expected to survive less than a 
year or even six months. Some companies will structure the payment as a loan so 
that no tax will be due.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if you expect to live longer than a year, you may be able to borrow 
against your policy, which would get you some of the money you need without the 
immediate tax consequences of selling. 
</P>
<P>

licensed or awaiting licensure in California, contact AIDS Project Los Angeles 
at (213) 993-1473 or (213) 993-1474. Primers for New Investors 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am 17 years old and have just come into an inheritance that I would like 
to invest. Are there some books you can recommend that I, or any beginner, 
would find easy to understand? -- J.P . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Peter Lynch, the former whiz-kid manager of the Fidelity Magellan mutual 
fund, has written two books with John Rothschild that are among the best in the 
field. One is "One Up on Wall Street"; the other is "Beating the Street." Both 
books describe the ins and outs of savvy stock picking and offer tips on how to 
select companies and mutual funds that fit your investment objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 A third good choice is John C. Bogle's new book, "Bogle on Mutual Funds: New 
Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor." All three titles should be readily 
available from public libraries and bookstores. Figuring the Value of Spun-Off 
Shares 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do I know the tax basis of shares of stock that I have gotten when a 
company spins off one of its subsidiaries? I purchased Pacific Telesis stock 
years ago and received one share of its cellular subsidiary, AirTouch, and one 
share of its phone company operations for each share of stock I held. When I 
sell, what value do I assign to each of these new shares? -- J.L . 
</P>
<P>
 A. You should have received a letter from Pacific Telesis explaining this in 
detail. All companies spinning off subsidiaries and offering their shareholders 
new stock explain how the shares should be valued for tax purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pacific Telesis officials, you should first research exactly how 
much you paid for your original Telesis shares. Then you should assign 60.17% 
of that amount to the new Telesis shares and 39.83% to the AirTouch shares you 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 This information is also available from the investor relations office of the 
company in which you hold shares. It is also in the "Capital Changes Report" 
published by Commerce Clearing House, a book most brokerages should have on 
hand.

AFRICAN TIMES EDITOR EXPLAINS HIS COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the opportunity you gave me to be interviewed and quoted in your 
feature article "A Continental Divide" (July 10). 
</P>
<P>
 However, I would like to correct some inaccuracies, especially as it regards 
comments credited to me. 
</P>
<P>
 At no time did I say that "the hard-work ethic that Africans share with 
immigrants fosters resentment among some black Americans, who see black 
foreigners succeeding while they are not. . . . But the elite stereotype adds 
to the mutual distrust that's already there." 
</P>
<P>
 All I said is that African immigrants who come to America share the same 
survivalist immigrant mentality like other immigrants in the United States such 
as the Latinos, Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, etc., who have to work harder than 
the average American to survive. And that this does not in anyway mean that 
immigrant Africans work harder than African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Words such as resentment and elite were never used in my discussions with your 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 The African Times was also wrongly characterized as a "community newspaper for 
Africans living in Los Angeles." The African Times is a national, biweekly 
Pan-African newspaper with bureau offices in Washington, New York, Atlanta and 
San Francisco. It is also distributed in select markets in Africa.

WHAT DO STUDENTS LEARN FROM PICKING UP TRASH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It amazes me that educators are attempting to make excuses by pointing the 
finger at parents and students (Letters, June 19). Students suffer when 
educators disrespect them and bolster their own egos.I find it ironic that the 
same educators who can strike to acquire higher pay cannot make reasonable 
efforts to find appropriate means for successfully improving and enhancing our 
educational system. Well, the buck stops here! I am fighting your injustice and 
supporting the well-being of our future, the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators do not pick up trash because it would lessen their effectiveness and 
self-esteem. Further, trash pickup is not a specific requirement of their job 
function. Students go to school to get an education. What do they learn from 
picking up trash? Perhaps they develop a slave mentality, low self-esteem, lack 
of support and lack of self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the educators should view this problem from a historical perspective. 
Have you forgotten your past because your middle-class values promise you a 
future? Well, only today is promised to you. Tomorrow you may not be an 
educator but instead a janitor.

BASKETBALL; AREA, OUT-OF-TOWN STARS SHINE BRIGHT AT SLAM-N-JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The largest annual West Coast High School basketball Tournament, Nike 
Slam-N-Jam, ended last week with the New York Riverside Church Team defeating 
Kansas City Blue, 56-53, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which involved 56 teams and 600 players from 15 states, showcased 
the skills of many of the country's best young basketball players, who were 
watched by Division I coaches such as Bob Huggins of Cincinnati, Lute Olson 
(Arizona), Todd Bozeman (UC Berkeley) and Jim Harrick (UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look back at some daily highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: Raymond Palmer, a 6-7 Crenshaw forward, scored 14 points on 5-of-11 
shooting from the field and a pair of free throws. His traveling team, South LA 
Adidas, defeated the LA Blazers, 71-62. Palmer went two for four from the 
three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw freshman Travis Reed, a 6-7 forward, had 18 points, five rebounds and 
two assists, but his K&E Bulls traveling team lost to Modesto, 88-77. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Los Angeles, comprised of eight area players -- seven from Fremont -- had 
an impressive 82-65 win over third-seeded All-Ohio Red. Fremont's Leon Jones 
led area players with nine points. Point guard Donnie Wilcher of Fremont added 
eight points. Fans can expect to see more of the same full-court traps and 
run-and-gun style from Fremont next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: The tournament's top seed, Value for Better America, was upset by 
unseeded Washington D.C. City Line, 64-62. A scary moment came at 10:50 in the 
second half when VBA's Schea Cotton, a 6-5 forward from Mater Dei, fell to the 
floor after being struck in the left eye while going for a rebound. Cotton left 
the floor unassisted but did not return. D.C. had the momentum down the 
stretch, outscoring VBA, 12-3, to end the game. D.C., which won the tournament 
last year, was led by Ossie Jones' 15 points. Jelani McCoy of San Diego St. 
Augustine and Cotton finished with 21 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood star Paul Pierce scored a game-high 23 points and grabbed 10 
rebounds as his K-Swiss Pacers defeated Team Nike, 75-63. Pierce, a 6-7 
forward, made all nine of his free throws. Corey Benjamin, a 6-5 junior from 
Fontana, had 12 points and four rebounds for Team Nike. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: In the first semifinal game, Kansas City Blue defeated defending 
champion D.C. City Line, 91-75. Six-eight Manny Dies was the high-point man for 
K.C. Blue with 20. Forward Derek Hood of Central High, who is considered one of 
the top 20 players in the country, added 13. Gary Anderson of D.C. led all 
scorers with 22 points. The second semifinal game was won by New York Riverside 
Church, 73-62, over Baltimore. Six-six Tyrone Grout from Grady High in New York 
scored a game-high 24 points. Six-two guard Travon Broadway led Team Baltimore 
with 22 points, but 5-6 guard Shawnta Rogers, who chipped in 20, won the crowd 
with his no-look passing and long-range shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: In the championship game, Vasile Estinov had 12 points and 13 
rebounds for the New York Riverside Church Team. Estinov, who was named the 
game's most valuable player, also won the three-point competition. Derek Hood 
led K.C. Blue with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Benjamin of Team Nike won the slam-dunk competition.

CHANGING FORTUNES / THE VALLEY ECONOMY IN TRANSITION; SURVIVING THE FALL; 
PARTNERS IN A FRATERNITY OF THE DOWNWARDLY MOBILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chic and Audrey, Stephen and Nicki. They come from different generations, hail 
from far-flung corners of the professional world -- the car dealer and 
engineering headhunter, the salesman and the accountant -- but the irregular 
beat of an uncertain economy has forced them all into a joyless dance of major 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, bankers took Chic Vandagriff's Ferrari dealership and later 
seized the sprawling Encino home he had built up from the first brick, forcing 
him to leave the state. Suddenly without a job, Audrey Gallant walked away from 
the fast-paced sales world to eventually find satisfaction in operating a 
cappuccino machine at a Sherman Oaks coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 For four long months, Steven Kumagai didn't have an office or a job -- thanks 
to an October layoff. But he didn't let that stop him. The 42-year-old still 
rose at dawn, donned a shirt and tie and methodically went about the business 
of regaining a niche in the work-a-day world. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicki Tonius already has a job -- as a Woodland Hills bank manager. It's just 
not the one she dreamed of 18 months ago as a USC accounting graduate ready to 
take the market by storm. But, for now, she knows that banking will just have 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Complete strangers, they are nonetheless partners in a growing fraternity of 
declining fortunes -- among thousands of workers who fell from professional 
grace during a recession that gripped the San Fernando Valley for nearly four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, each had a solid grasp of a different rung on the career 
ladder -- reveling in the dreams and ambitions that come with making money and 
having professional options. But the 1990s saw an end to that -- recessionary 
years that hit white-collar middle managers particularly hard -- dealing blows 
from which most still struggle to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "People now see there is no protection against a recession of this magnitude," 
said Katherine Newman, an anthropology professor at New York's Columbia 
University and author of two books on the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans have always thought that there was no force large enough to tear 
down the truly motivated. But they've been sorely disappointed. The truth is, 
they've met their match." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, during these demanding years, many have found themselves flailing away 
just to stay in place, putting dreams and once-strong ambitions on hold, 
dimming expectations of success and focusing on the choices that remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite good economic news nationwide, the recovery has lagged in California 
and the Valley, with the recession still exercising a wrestler's grip on the 
psyche of many local residents. Just ask Chic, Audrey, Stephen and Nicki. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a tale of four Valley professionals -- a story of how their careers 
collapsed and how they have responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The going has been hard. They've begun a painful journey Newman calls becoming 
"downwardly mobile" -- tumbling from the ranks of the middle class through loss 
of income, struggling to keep pace with friends and associates in pursuit of 
the California good life. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person's response depends on whether they grew up through the Great 
Depression, the optimistic '60s or the conservative '70s," Newman said. "It has 
to do with the national economy they went to school with, where they started 
out, their age and their gender. It has no doubt helped to see them through 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 One noted author and lecturer on the American work ethic suggests that no one 
should take such harsh economic times personally, that the real issue is one of 
pure survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "For millions of people, this has been the Depression, just like we had back 
in the 1930s. And depressions take no prisoners," said Studs Terkel, whose book 
"Working" chronicled a generation of American laborers. "Saying we've just been 
through a recession is like calling cancer a pimple. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened may not be anyone's fault. People need to know that there's 
something cockeyed with a system that hires you, uses you up and then just 
throws you away. It's a cruel thing and it affects everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, these people were part of the 'have' group. Now money's tight and they 
have less. They've moved from the haves to the 'have-somewhats.' And if this 
keeps up, we're going to see more people -- our friends, our bosses, ourselves 
-- move into that bottom group, the 'have-nots.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary. But it's been real." 
</P>
<P>
 End of Good Life 
</P>
<P>
 Chic Vandagriff stared into a cup of black coffee and pondered his fall from 
moneyed grace, how he went from being a millionaire to a morose man who 
anxiously awaits his monthly Social Security check. 
</P>
<P>
 Chain-smoking Kent 100s, he wondered how his $1.7-million dream home suddenly 
became a house of cards -- foreclosed upon by an impatient lender and sold last 
fall to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 The tough economy closed down his once-successful Ferrari dealership in 
Hollywood, destroying his lavish lifestyle as well. At 65, he's suddenly got 
too much time on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American dream blew up right in my face," he sighed, exhaling a stream of 
cigarette smoke. "I had it good. And now it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Vandagriff, experts say, is typical of an aging generation of Americans who 
survived the Great Depression of the 1930s and rode a post-war boom to cash in 
on big profits in California real estate throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the roof fell in, a lot of people in this generation were able to ride 
out the calamity," Newman says. "They had their houses paid off. Their children 
were gone. They weren't risky in their investments. The ones who lost were the 
high-flyers who acted like the money was always going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 People like Vandagriff. 
</P>
<P>
 When the going was good, Vandagriff pushed all the envelopes: He raced sport 
cars. His restaurant bills topped $1,000 a month and he spent thousands more on 
art. And Vandagriff traveled: He liked the way people knew his name in hotels 
across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Then disaster struck.  
</P>
<P>
 The luxury tax was just one new government measure to hurt his business. 
Skittish banks retreated and Vandagriff lost his complicated financial backing. 
In the end, he said goodby to his dealership of 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing $1 million on some bad investments in Mexico and at home, 
Vandagriff found he couldn't make his $5,000 monthly mortgage payment. In 1992, 
his home -- appraised at $1.7 million the year before -- sold for $600,000 in 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Vandagriff waits uncomfortably for the end to come, noting with irony that 
today he couldn't afford to pay even the taxes on the place, let alone 
utilities and a $100 bill for monthly sewer and water service. 
</P>
<P>
 The former millionaire, failed by the once rock-solid real estate market, 
admits he made numerous investment blunders. But he saves most of his anger for 
the politicians he says paved his road to ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is stupid as hell," says Vandagriff. "Most tax dollars go to 
giveaway programs like welfare. Meanwhile, the government taxed me to death. 
I've paid my last taxes here." 
</P>
<P>
 So Vandagriff sold off the by-products of wealth. He threw a garage sale and 
peddled much of his collection of fine wines. The paintings have been sent back 
to the brokers in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, he walked away from his dream home. The house that is no longer 
his stood up well during January's earthquake. "There was no damage, not the 
way I built that house, not a crack. My situation, now that's a different 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's living in Las Vegas with a girlfriend, plotting his next fortune, 
considering the home-building market or some other investment. But one thing is 
for sure. "I'll never go back to California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for Work 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Vandagriff, Steven Kumagai never had a posh mansion or zippy sports 
cars -- just a south Valley condo and a can-do attitude. To survive the hard 
times, he needed both. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid off in the fall of 1993 from his office products marketing job, the 
42-year-old skipped the usual self-pity. He went back to work -- looking for 
new work. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew the unemployment drill. In 1983, during the last recession, Kumagai 
spent seven months out of work. This time he began looking for other marketing 
jobs, re-evaluating his options, stretching the definition of career -- even 
looking for work in fields such as travel consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 And he worked hard at remaining high profile, never missing a meeting of 
several business associations to which he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he attended every social function he could manage, networking with 
possible new employers, volunteering for favorite charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other out-of-work friends, nobody caught Kumagai hitting golf balls at 
noon -- dropping out socially as well as professionally: "I don't spend my time 
watching Oprah, Jane and Sally and then saying at the end of the day, 'My God, 
look how I've wasted my time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say Kumagai is typical of the early baby boom generation, 
professionals who graduated college in the late 1960s and '70s, finding an 
accommodating job market that eventually went bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they had a taste of economic rockiness of the early 1980s," Newman said. 
"If they were on the ball, they learned something from all the pain of being 
out of work. They learned discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Kumagai was a man with a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day he woke up at 6:30 a.m. Even with little to do other than type job 
letters, he combed his hair, donned a shirt and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumagai insisted on seeing the bright side. He even had time to scratch his 
acting itch, working as an extra in several films and television shows. The 
jobs made him feel good about himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kumagai's story is the story of this recession," said Richard M. Vogel, a 
local career management consultant. "He has the right attitude and is doing the 
right things to get work. He is keeping his personal life together." 
</P>
<P>
 That regimen eventually paid off. A week after the January earthquake, Kumagai 
landed another job -- this time as a salesman for a company that makes 
industrial packaging containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he has now survived two recessions, Kumagai doesn't want to test 
his luck with a third: "The thing I have anxiety about is, as we get older, it 
gets tougher to bounce back. I don't know if I could do it again in my 50s. But 
I'd try. As long as I have a good mental outlook and physical health, I have 
tremendous confidence in myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting Bottom 
</P>
<P>
 For Nicki Tonius, the year she received her accounting degree turned out to be 
the year of the Big Letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the 31-year-old was a job-seeker who believed her life would be 
professional wine and roses. Job forecasters had assured the USC accounting 
graduate that she had done everything right: She had chosen the right 
university, even the right major. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she graduated, companies that had guaranteed her employment while 
she was a student were already out of business. Would-be bosses were themselves 
looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months of searching produced no job offers -- just a parade of rude 
prospective employers who would not return her calls: "I blame it all on the 
economy. I've worked hard. The employers just changed the rules on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1980s, some very bright people went into traditional jobs in search of 
security," Newman said. "They believed that if they did the pragmatic thing, 
the future would be theirs. But that's not how it panned out. Even the most 
conservative bettors were big losers." 
</P>
<P>
 After months of rejection, Nicki Tonius knew she was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was almost homeless," she said. "I was two months behind in my rent with a 
huge college loan to repay. Funny -- less than one year before I was on top of 
the world. Then I hit rock-bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 She summarized her frustrations last summer by scrawling a message on the wall 
of her North Hollywood apartment: "Sometimes, you can do everything right and 
still lose." 
</P>
<P>
 So Tonius downshifted her expectations, seeking any job that would pay her 
bills. In July, she accepted an entry-level bank job and nicknamed herself 
"Teller Tonius" -- joining the ranks of Southern California's under-employed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as a branch manager making nearly $30,000 annually, she still considers 
herself a victim of cruel recessionary fate. But she isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, she felt that many of her thirtysomething friends who landed 
accounting jobs were leaving her behind, splurging on expensive dinners and ski 
vacations she cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
 She tried to keep pace, even if it meant eating dinner first at home and then 
joining her friends for coffee at that pricey restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some of those friends have lost their high-paying jobs. And Tonius herself 
said that she may feel the ax at her bank job. 
</P>
<P>
 She's scared, but she's surviving. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father always told me that I'm as tenacious as a bulldog," she said. "When 
I grab onto something, when I put my teeth into it, I don't let go until it's 
dead or I'm finished eating it." 
</P>
<P>
 Return to Freedom 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Audrey Gallant was working as an engineering equipment broker, 
the latest in a succession of high-stress jobs that included engineering 
headhunter and a television programmer in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it happened. She was laid off in September, 1992. Now she could kiss her 
old boss for letting her go, returning her freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 The two years have taught Gallant something about the nature of pursuing a 
career in America. For years, she did jobs she secretly hated, just because she 
saw the corporate ladder as something everyone had to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Gallant. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she works at The Coffee Roaster in Sherman Oaks. She looks forward to 
going to work, dealing with people she wants to see. Sure, she makes far, far 
less money, about a quarter of her former salary. But it's like suddenly 
shedding 100 pounds: She feels great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night while working those other jobs, I went home with things on my 
mind -- week after week, worrying about things I had to do the next day. 
Weekends were two days of freedom and I crammed everything I could into them to 
make the time off seem longer. Because I dreaded going back to work, I just 
pretended that I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the rat race meant no more pointless meetings. No more nylons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I leave work, I'm out of here. All I have to do is do my job. I don't 
sit here wondering if I'm going to get a pat on the back. I'm not waiting for 
my next raise or promotion." 
</P>
<P>
 The move has not come without sacrifice. At age 33, she has sold off many 
belongings and has moved into a studio apartment near work. She has no credit 
cards and may even opt to go without health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that all the things I worked so hard to acquire, I really didn't 
need in the long run. It's like, I didn't miss it. I just see the whole world 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy. And no recession could take that away from me."

 In days past, most people found jobs by putting in long hours sending out 
resumes and pounding the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's job-seeker can access a large number of employment opportunities from 
home with a personal computer and modem. Computer "bulletin boards" such as 
CompuServe and Prodigy, in addition to standard services such as electronic 
mail and catalogue shopping, offer electronic job listings and specialized 
areas where like-minded users can send and receive messages on a variety of 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 By navigating a series of simple menus, users can scan descriptions of 
available jobs in fields such as banking, health care, manufacturing, 
communications, retail sales and the arts. Like traditional classified ads, 
electronic listings include a brief description of the position, required 
experience and an address or phone number where users can direct inquiries. 
Most systems also maintain databases with information about particular 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services also enable users to research a company's background, send 
resumes and cover letters electronically and network with other people -- all 
without leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one 1993 survey, nearly 4 million households subscribe to such 
networks -- and the number is growing. Major bulletin boards include: America

ALL'S FAIR; RURAL AND CITY KIDS TAKE PART IN VALLEY LIVESTOCK AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Duke Keeble of Sun Valley had two things to be proud of after 
participating in Saturday's Junior Livestock Auction at the San Fernando Valley 
Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, young Keeble raised the fair's grand champion lamb, a 115-pound 
baby named Jason. And second, Duke helped persuade a neighbor, Terry Shelton, 
to bid a whopping $36 a pound for the lamb, money Duke will use to buy more 
animals to raise next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little carried away," Shelton said, but you can't blame him. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day before the auction, Duke had been asking Shelton, "Are you 
going to buy my lamb?" 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day fair at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center ends today. Fair 
officials were optimistic the event would wind up a success. The crowds came 
out Saturday, but Thursday and Friday's total attendance of 13,500 was down 500 
from the first two days of last year's fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five hundred is such a small number, it hardly makes a dent," said Clover 
Hodgson, a spokeswoman for the event.  
</P>
<P>
 In the auction ring, where Duke and other youngsters trotted out their lambs, 
steers and other animals, farm kids and city kids alike competed for the 
highest prices they could get. On hand to help were auction spotters like 
Abraham Feltus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think each and every sale is as important as the next," said Feltus, 
enthusiastically scanning the crowd for bids, often climbing into the stands to 
encourage a higher offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they need a little nudging," said Feltus, who has worked as a 
spotter for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Feltus said he has learned not to pressure people to pay more than they want 
to for the kids' animals. But he just might mention that this is a child's 
first year in the auction and some extra money might inspire the child to stay 
involved in agricultural groups, such 4-H, Grange and the Future Farmers of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Feltus has gotten to know many of the kids' families at these auctions, 
watched the children grow up and bring their own children to the auction years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being in a ballgame and there's no way to lose because you're 
giving these kids as much as you possibly can," Feltus said about the action in 
the auction ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a voice left," said Steve Pietrolungo, an agriculture teacher at 
Canoga Park High School who was also a spotter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominick Diaz, a 15-year-old from Torrance, raised the grand champion steer, 
which weighed in at 1,180 pounds. He sold the steer, named Wrigley, for $5 a 
pound, or $5,900. That gave the teen-ager, who paid $1,200 for the steer as a 
calf, a princely 300% return on his investment, not counting the cost of 
feeding and caring for Wrigley.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a seven-day-a-week job, with no holidays," said Dominick,, a "city" kid 
who had to take his bike or get a ride everyday to the farm where Wrigley 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Dominick also raised a lamb, chicken and turkey, and a pig named 
Sega, which he sold Saturday for $1.40 a pound. Sega is very smart, he said. "I 
taught him tricks." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancee Siebert, whose 19-year-old daughter, Jessica, found her grand champion 
pig, Cha-Cha, as rambunctious as his name, enjoys the fact that the auction 
brings together kids from both urban and rural backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't forget where your roots are," said Siebert, whose children have 
been auctioning animals at the San Fernando Valley Fair for about seven years. 
It is also good for children to learn where the meat on their table comes from, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An animal rights group, Last Chance for Animals, promised to picket the fair 
last night, claiming the Bull-O-Rama event is cruel to animals. Jan McClellan, 
a spokeswoman for the group, said about 100 protesters planned to hand out 
flyers at one of the fair entrances.

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES GET COLD SHOULDER IN SANTA CLARITA; LAW: THE 
HISTORICAL SOCIETY'S CURATOR SAYS THE BEDROOM COMMUNITY HAS ALWAYS FOUGHT SUCH 
BATTLES BUT 'UNOFFICIALLY, IT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are no prostitutes walking the streets. Residents looking for X-rated 
movie theaters -- or the Playboy Channel on cable TV, for that matter -- are 
out of luck. But the sexual revolution is still full of skirmishes in this 
conservative bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the battle of Castaic Junction: A Gentleman's Club. 
</P>
<P>
 All-nude dancers gyrated into the new club about a month ago and wowed the 
crowd -- for one night. The war over the only such establishment in the area 
has been raging ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall Land and Farming Co., a developer that owns the building, heard 
about the performance and got a court order forcing the dancers to cover up 
with bikinis. Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said the club's lease 
prohibits "lewd or offensive" entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our property and that is not a use that we want for our property," she 
said. "It is obvious that the community is not supportive of this type of 
venture." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, sheriff's deputies shut the club down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of residents had complained to Newhall Land and government officials 
since the club opened. County inspectors found the club was operating without 
the proper food and entertainment permits, issued warnings to the owner that 
went unheeded for a couple of weeks, then ordered the shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
 County and Newhall Land officials said club owner Stuart Cadwell brought much 
of the trouble on himself because he failed to tell them the establishment 
would offer exotic dancing.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cadwell isn't conceding defeat. He's applied for the necessary permits, 
noting that business has been good. "The place is just screaming for 
entertainment of this type," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar over Castaic Junction isn't surprising to many. Sexually oriented 
businesses have long been given the cold shoulder by local officials and many 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officially, they've pretty much always been like that," said Jerry Reynolds, 
curator of the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society.  
</P>
<P>
 But, he noted, "Unofficially, it's been going on since the dawn of time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a drive-through condom shop had its windows smashed and was 
defaced with paint hours before its scheduled opening in 1992. A city 
councilwoman suggested discouraging customers once the store did open by 
videotaping them.  
</P>
<P>
 A current lingerie shop billboard featuring a woman in her underwear has 
sparked a protest petition containing more than 1,500 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley that many officials and residents hope people see is 
the community that featured exclusively family oriented movies (nothing racier 
than PG-rated) at its first international film festival in March. It's also a 
place where the Playboy Channel was discontinued on local cable in 1992 because 
of a lack of viewership. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the valley's few adult shops attract a steady stream of 
customers, and the community's bizarre history matches anything that could be 
found on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita is home, for example, to a self-proclaimed sex priestess who 
claims to have spiritually purified more than 2,500 men by having sex with 
them. The priestess, Mary Ellen Tracy, who with her husband, Will, was 
convicted in 1989 of running a house of prostitution, said she hopes to open a 
temple in Santa Clarita soon. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city's moral politics are unquestionably on the conservative side, 
pinning down the attitudes of residents is a bit trickier. A 31-year-old 
married woman strongly condemned the dancers at Castaic Junction -- as she 
headed with a female friend into Chili Peppers, a new establishment that 
features male exotic dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are definitely more conservative here, but I think they're more 
accepting of this than they are with female dancers," she said. "Whenever you 
have females dancing you end up with hookers outside, where as with men you 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Peppers also sponsors a bikini contest for women every other week. 
</P>
<P>
 Many locals said they are willing to tolerate sexually oriented businesses, to 
a point. Marilyn Wegner, 62, is a 15-year resident of Santa Clarita who works 
at the Lutheran High School Thrift Shop in a small, aging strip mall on the 
eastern outskirts of town -- just a few doors down from an adult video and gift 
shop.  
</P>
<P>
 Wegner said she doesn't mind the adult shop because of its remote location. 
But she said more centrally located or more sexually explicit businesses, such 
as X-rated theaters, are a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a growing family community, with a lot of young families," she said. "I 
think we don't want our children to grow up with that influence of pornography 
and sexually explicit material." 
</P>
<P>
 The adult gift and movie shop, Funzie's, is managed by Tina, a 23-year-old 
resident who didn't want to give her last name because she said her boyfriend's 
parents are devoutly religious and have no idea where she works. But she shook 
her head at the city's conservative politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you going to tell me none of the City Council members use motion lotion 
or whipped cream?" she asked. "They had to be young sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy laughingly asserted that she is no prude. But she 
said that allowing even a few high-profile, adult-oriented businesses would 
open the way for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts a bad reputation to a city when you see those types of things 
proliferating," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If marquee signs aren't turning heads, some of the council members' past 
actions certainly have. Howard P. "Buck" McKeon, Santa Clarita's first mayor 
when the city incorporated in 1987 and now a Republican U.S. congressman, wrote 
a letter during his term to the only local movie theater at the time, stating 
that it should feature more G-rated movies. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1992, two men converted a kiosk along a busy street into a 
drive-through condom shop called the Safe Sex Shop. Councilwoman Jan Heidt 
suggested videotaping customers to discourage them after numerous complaints 
were voiced by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us what we were doing is evil," co-owner Richard Kotler said. The 
shop closed due to a lack of business a few weeks after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-adult business political tone is consistent with officials who have 
governed the Santa Clarita Valley since it was inhabited, the historical 
society's Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The town leaders, whoever they happened to be at the time, always frowned at 
this sort of goings-on and tried to maintain a very moral community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reynolds said those living here shouldn't delude themselves -- the city 
lost its collective virginity a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A club known as the Sandburg offered gambling and prostitution during the 
1920s to clients willing to make the trip several miles north of town to Ridge 
Route Road, Reynolds said. One of the area's most notorious prostitution 
outlets was operated in the 1930s and '40s by Ace Caine, a stunt man, rodeo 
rider and B-movie actor who lived in the upscale Sand Canyon area, Reynolds 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was sort of his ranch, but he also had slot machines, brothels and ladies 
of the evening out there for his friends -- and he had a lot of friends," 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most famous modern-day episode involves Mary Ellen Tracy, 52, also 
known as Sabrina Aset, the self-proclaimed high priestess of the Church of the 
Most High Goddess, which required new followers to give a monetary donation and 
have sex with Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to Mary Ellen and Will Tracy's nondescript Canyon Country home and they 
will probably deny who they are, unless a convincing explanation is provided 
for the visit. Will Tracy said the couple have to be cautious -- even though 
few know where they live -- because their property has been vandalized and 
residents occasionally taunt them in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what kind of wackos might show up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tracys are trying to maintain a low profile while pursuing litigation that 
would allow them to reopen their church -- perhaps near their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents were outraged in November, 1992, when they learned that Mary 
Ellen Tracy had volunteered to lead children on educational hikes at the 
Placerita Nature Center. Placerita officials at first defended their decision, 
but told Tracy a month later not to return, claiming the publicity was hurting 
the center and that parents were worried about leaving their children with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy, who has master's degrees in chemistry and environmental science, said 
it upsets her that residents -- and more often political officials -- won't let 
her lead a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really not the scum ball I'm portrayed to be," she said. "People don't 
know my background and education." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Anderson, a Saugus resident, said he moved to the area because of the low 
crime rate. But he said he would never dream of giving out the address of his 
business. He runs a nationwide "900" phone line with 80% of the calls 
specializing in "romantic talk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has already relocated his business once within the city because of 
hecklers and encounters a few more every time he advertises for "telephone 
actresses." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we run this ad the same lady calls," he said. "She calls up and 
says 'You're going to be out of business within 30 days.' She's been telling me 
this for a year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy said she doesn't object to out-of-the way businesses like Anderson's but 
understands why some people do. She said many residents moved here to escape 
the undesirable influences of more urbane areas and are adamant about keeping 
them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we do have an attitude, because we think this is a very good 
community, family oriented, and we'd like to keep it that way," she said.

</P>
<P>
 Authorities said a passing motorist spotted John Brown Avila just after 2 a.m. 
Saturday in the 44000 block of 3rd Street East. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila, who had been stabbed several times in the upper body, was pronounced

FAMILY, FRIENDS PAY TRIBUTE TO SLAIN ORANGE COUNTY WOMAN AT MEMORIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of people joined Saturday in bidding farewell to Denise Anette Huber, 
the ever-smiling young waitress who disappeared three years ago and was 
recently found bludgeoned to death in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath a sun-washed, denim-blue sky, family and friends, including those who 
came to know Huber's parents only after the 23-year-old vanished along a 
Southern California freeway, gathered at Mariner's Church in Newport Beach for 
a graceful, low-key memorial that included an abundance of tributes, 
testimonies and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 From as far as Canada and Tennessee, Huber's relatives and friends traveled to 
attend the 90-minute service, where six of them, each allotted a brief moment 
to remember her equally brief life, recalled with humor her fondness for frogs, 
fun and the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Vancouver and I did not share Denise's enthusiasm for the Los 
Angeles Kings," said Huber's cousin Dave Nieuwsma, a youth pastor and Vancouver 
Canucks fan, whose remark prompted muffled laughter, one of half a dozen such 
lighter moments in an otherwise somber event. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieuwsma, whose oldest daughter was about Huber's age, talked of possessing 
wonderful memories, but said the "one who brought those memories is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have been more like her," said Debbie Scott, a former college 
roommate. "Life was so much fun when she was around." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the grisly events of the past 10 days -- since Huber's body was found 
in Arizona inside a freezer belonging to a former Lake Forest man -- were 
alluded to several times, the Rev. Walt Shepard urged people to set the past 
aside and look forward. And yet, in the next breath, he seemed unable to heed 
his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help thinking . . . of some of the details that have come out in 
the investigation," he said. "You've got to be thinking with me of the words 
blunt-force trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 As Huber was eulogized Saturday afternoon, investigators and criminologists 
continued to pore over evidence in the case and said they have concluded that 
John Joseph Famalaro, the man charged with her murder in Arizona, probably 
acted alone. Yet authorities said they have not dismissed the possibility that 
Famalaro, a 37-year-old house painter, had help hiding her body for more than 
three years.

THEY'LL FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES; DESPITE ENCROACHING ILLS, MANY SUBURB RESIDENTS 
VOW TO PERSEVERE TO SAVE DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came dreaming of horse trails and baseball diamonds, of single-family 
homes tastefully designed to blend with the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 They pretty much found what they came looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 But their delight was hard to keep under wraps. As word of these suburban 
havens spread, populations swelled. And growth has inevitably spawned more 
crime, more traffic, and more smog -- the very things they sought to escape in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 With alarm, residents who fled urban centers and aging suburbs two to three 
decades ago feel a sense of deja vu. This time, though, instead of fleeing, 
they're fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dreamed that we could build our paradise here and enjoy it afterward," 
Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. "Well, we've built it. Now we 
have to maintain it." 
</P>
<P>
 That dream has managed to survive, even thrive, for decades in Thousand Oaks 
and other communities on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Founded in the late 
1960s and early 1970s, these beige suburbs attracted upscale refugees who still 
believed in the boundless possibilities of life in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Families fed up with the hodgepodge development and stop-and-go traffic of the 
San Fernando Valley crept westward to Ventura County and northward to the 
Antelope Valley. Folks tired of the increasing urban woes of northern Orange 
County fled southwest to Irvine and master-planned communities tucked into the 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 The dream has been good enough to hold on to, despite the doomsday hyperbole 
of the national media.  
</P>
<P>
 The dreamers have suffered through earthquakes, of course, and fires, floods 
and a stubborn recession. But still they find, in these far-flung suburbs, 
communities fit for raising kids and spoiling grandkids. They find homes to 
grow up, grow old and retire in. 
</P>
<P>
 They describe their dreams with a buzzword phrase: quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 With that cliche, they encompass everything that has made their neighborhoods 
so special: clean air, safe streets, good soccer leagues for the kids. 
Top-ranked public schools. Red-tile roofs and back-yard pools. Family hiking 
trails, a public golf course, a regional mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Beaver Cleaverville," said Irvine resident Ron Witter, summing it all 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Watering his immaculate lawn in the Los Angeles County suburb of West Hills, 
Todd Nathanson posed no brain-stretching theories about Southern California's 
crumbling mythology. He spewed no diatribes about the fading City of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California Dream?" he said, shrugging matter-of-factly. "This is it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson's blue-and-cream house sits midway between two family destinations: 
a major shopping center and a craggy hiking trail. In just a few minutes, he 
can reach the mall rats or the mountain lions, depending on which way he turns 
from his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a house, a garden, money, clothes," Nathanson said, as his 
3-year-old daughter, Rebecca, cavorted on the lawn with her stuffed Barney 
dinosaur. "I don't need anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, of course, even well-bred suburbs can't escape the now-standard 
litany of Southern California ills. They have smog, sometimes even bad enough 
to force a health warning. They have traffic, sometimes gridlock, on local 
streets. They have crime -- graffiti, theft, now and then a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they still have an allure. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people sitting in Minnesota on Jan. 1, watching the Rose Bowl 
parade, see this as a dream," said Larry Janss, whose family members were 
pioneer developers of Thousand Oaks and Westwood in Los Angeles County. "A big 
back yard, a red-tile roof, 2.3 kids, a bicycle in the driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the dream revolves around safety. Irvine and Thousand Oaks remain 
two of the safest cities in the nation with populations above 100,000, 
according to FBI statistics. Residents don't leave their doors unlocked, but 
they do stroll freely on the streets and feel secure in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar peace prevails in smaller communities sprinkled throughout Ventura, 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, for example, where the two-lane freeway winds through 
breathtaking canyons and curves past acres of orange groves. In Calabasas, 
where gated communities hide homes with lush lawns and drought-resistant flower 
beds. In Rancho Santa Margarita, where the annual fiesta rodeo evokes the 
rustic Old West and gives city slickers a chance to try steer wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Other suburbs, too, can claim a piece of the dream: Westlake Village and 
Agoura Hills, Mission Viejo and Dove Canyon, places with good views, nice 
neighbors and solid schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of exciting things to do here, but that's OK because it's 
supposed to be a bedroom community," said Arnold Berman, 62, a retired school 
principal who raised his son and daughter in Irvine. "It's a nice, clean area 
with good family values." 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuit of clean air and family activities, the dreamscape cities spare no 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, for example, posts its own version of SigAlert signs to warn cyclists 
when a bike path is closed for repairs. And Thousand Oaks builds playgrounds 
made entirely from recycled plastic set on squishy cushioning that prevents 
scraped knees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the neighborhoods stay relentlessly residential, no stores or 
industries fouling the air or jamming the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 From the bedroom window of her Thousand Oaks condo, Lorrette Weber can see a 
soaring, grassy hill -- and sometimes, she glimpses a bold coyote, deer or 
fawn. "It's heavenly to look out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully planned "open space," divided between parks and trails and untamed 
hills, lets residents enjoy the toasty Southern California weather that lured 
them west in the first place. For what California Dream could be complete 
without twisting oaks and swaying palms, postcard sunsets and bright blue 
skies? 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa and Avery Mittman can attest to the powerful pull of California 
weather. They gave up a shot at homeownership in Kansas to rent a townhouse in 
Irvine. Though they've struggled a bit to scrape by in Orange County, the 
Mittmans are glad to be rid of snow shovels and indoor gyms, frigid winters and 
treacherous, ice-laden roads. 
</P>
<P>
 As with most of life, the dream has its trade-offs. There may be less traffic 
in Idaho, but few relish driving in seemingly endless harsh winters. There may 
be less smog in Oregon, but who wants to spend months indoors waiting out the 
rainy season? There may be less crime in Arizona, but is that worth enduring 
115-degree days? 
</P>
<P>
 Te Mittmans proclaim themselves willing to put up with the inconveniences of 
Irvine -- including tough commutes -- in order to enjoy the good weather and 
good schools. And an added attraction for visiting relatives: They're near all 
the tourist meccas.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfect here," Teresa Mittman said. "My family can even come vacation 
while they're visiting us -- they can stay with us and go to Disneyland or 
Universal Studios." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that perceived perfection lies in Southern California's unique 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to laugh when I'm on the freeway and I see a car going one way with a 
surfboard on top and another car going the other way with skis," said Thousand 
Oaks resident Cathy Schutz, a satisfied dreamer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't like the outdoors, you might have different feelings," she 
added, "but I would never go back to New England. I've never been disillusioned 
with California. I will stay forever." 
</P>
<P>
 But the enduring allure of these suburbs alarms some veteran suburbanites. 
Each new family that moves into a community brings more traffic and more trash. 
And criminals see more potential victims. 
</P>
<P>
 To give the new arrivals their spacious two-car garages and sparkling 
back-yard pools, developers pave over strawberry fields and rip out lemon 
trees. To pay for their schools and services, politicians must woo big 
businesses with big sales-tax potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dream is strangling itself," Larry Janss said.  
</P>
<P>
 Urban planner William Fulton offers a simple prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer can suburbanites expect quarter-acre lots and street after street of 
single-family homes. Even more dramatically, Fulton predicts that dreamers will 
have to adapt to new neighbors -- neighbors of different races, different 
ethnic backgrounds and different income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demographic change in California is unbelievable, and the economic change 
has been so dramatic that it's hard to know whether we can continue to support 
so many wealthy suburbs," Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, once-white suburbs have opened up to middle-class families of diverse 
backgrounds. Irvine's population is 18% Asian and more than 6% Latino, although 
less than 2% of the residents are black. In Thousand Oaks, nearly one in ten 
residents is Latino. And Fulton expects these suburbs to become ever more 
diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Resisting change, some communities' stubborn dreamers have walled their tracts 
off with gates and guards, a trend Fulton calls "cocooning in smaller and 
smaller cocoons."  
</P>
<P>
 Others plan to get out, to sell their homes in tony suburbs and use the cash 
to buy huge, unspoiled ranches out in the boondocks of Central California. 
</P>
<P>
 After 17 years in Irvine, for example, Roger Rostvold can't wait to move. 
Standing on his shaded street, next to his black Peugeot and white Jaguar, he 
said his dream has gone bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question of the day is, why would this guy want to leave all this?" he 
mused. 
</P>
<P>
 The answers of the day: fear, disgust and anger. Rostvold's scared to go to 
one of his favorite restaurants, where gangbangers mill in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's fed up with the vile graffiti scrawled across freeway sound walls. 
"We're counting the days until we get out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For every dreamer who quits the suburbs in disgust, however, others remain, 
determined to preserve their vaunted "quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired carpet installer Tom Villanueva said he would not consider leaving 
West Hills, a shaded community of cozy homes impervious to the neon glare and 
angry horns of nearby San Fernando Valley streets. Here, Villanueva and his 
wife, Lucille, have found their dream: puttering in the garden, relaxing in the 
sunshine, chatting with the mailman on his daily rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty content," Villanueva said, "right where we're at."

COMMENTARY; THE RAPID RISE AND FALL OF AKSARBEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A visitor to Aksarben racetrack cannot talk to any local fan without hearing 
vivid descriptions of what the place was like a decade ago: the big crowds, the 
high quality of racing, the enthusiasm, the noise. On a Saturday, the roar of 
the crowd reverberated like thunder over the Nebraska plains. 
</P>
<P>
 Aksarben was the most remarkable success story in the sport. In 1985, its 
average daily attendance was more than 15,000 -- a figure exceeded by only six 
other American tracks. It handled an average of $1.7 million a day -- more than 
tracks such as Laurel, Pimlico, Arlington Park and Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 But today there are no roaring crowds at Aksarben. Attendance and wagering 
have dropped to one-third of what they were in the track's heyday, and purses 
have fallen accordingly. Even in an industry plagued by widespread economic 
woe, no track's fortunes have fallen quite so dramatically as Aksarben's. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1921, Aksarben (Nebraska spelled backward) prospered because of 
strong community support. A quirky Nebraska law requires that racetracks in the 
state be operated by nonprofit organizations dedicated to "civic purposes." The 
Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben -- which supervised the track and contributed its profits 
to charities and various good works -- became one of Omaha's most prestigious 
organizations. The whole city loved its racetrack. Sharon Smith, who is now 
Aksarben's chief executive officer, recalled: "In my college days here, you 
never had to make a call to find out where your friends were in the afternoon. 
They were at the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Aksarben drew customers from many parts of the Midwest. Every Saturday, more 
than 100 buses carried racegoers from Kansas City to Omaha. With a record of 
phenomenal growth -- total wagering increased every year but one from 1949 
through 1985 -- the track confidently embarked on a $7.5 million plan of 
physical improvements that were completed in 1986. But that year Aksarben's 
fortunes took a stunning turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986 Iowa legalized greyhound racing, and a new dog track, Bluffs Run, 
opened just across the Nebraska border -- 10 miles from Aksarben. At the time, 
the Aksarben management didn't see the dogs as a great threat. "I think," said 
Dick Moore, the current vice president, "they thought they were invincible." 
</P>
<P>
 But greyhounds have hurt thoroughbreds in virtually every market where they 
competed, and Omaha was no exception. Bluffs Run averaged $400,000 in wagering 
per performance; Aksarben's business dropped by nearly $450,000 a day. And that 
was just the beginning of the competition that Aksarben would face, because the 
gambling boom had begun in America and had arrived in the heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoroughbred tracks opened in Iowa and Missouri; there would be no more 
processions of buses from Kansas City to Omaha. Nebraska legalized keno, and 
the lottery-like game became wildly popular. The most successful keno parlor in 
the country, one that took in $25 million in wagers last year, is located two 
miles from Aksarben. Even Moore had to concede, "They really know how to treat 
their customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Two Indian casinos, an hour from Omaha, added to the competition. The 
proliferation of gambling dealt a severe blow to Aksarben's old nemesis, the 
Bluffs Run dog track, which tried to bolster its business by offering 
thoroughbred simulcasts from out-of-state tracks. There is more gambling to 
come: Iowa is expected to have slot machines later this year and riverboat 
casinos in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Aksarben's sudden decline generated much consternation and blame-casting. Many 
racing fans thought the track's management had been too complacent in the face 
of mounting competition. The Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben realized they were out of 
their element trying to oversee a racetrack in such a tough environment and 
decided to sell; Aksarben became a political football until the county 
government bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario was a familiar one. As the thoroughbred business has declined in 
Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and many other states, critics have blamed 
inept, short-sighted management. To some extent the criticisms are valid, but 
the main cause of horse racing's problems is that it has lost its longtime 
monopoly in the gambling marketplace. No American racetrack will ever occupy 
the unchallenged position that Aksarben enjoyed for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most tracks, Aksarben hopes that simulcasting will offer the remedy for 
some of its ills. It beams its races to other Nebraska tracks as well as Las 
Vegas, but its product isn't good enough to compete with the heavyweights in 
the simulcasting market. It has begun to offer full-card simulcasts from 
Louisiana Downs and Hollywood Park, and the innovation has increased wagering 
totals, but this growth will come with a price. Regular customers are diverting 
their dollars from the Aksarben races to the out-of-state events, reducing the 
betting pools on the live races, threatening to make those live races a 
marginal (and perhaps expendable) part of the track's product. 
</P>
<P>
 The one strength that Aksarben retains is the community's affection for the 
track. "Everybody has a different idea what we should do here," said Smith, 
"but these people really have a passion and a dedication to Aksarben and to 
racing in general." Sadly, there might be no ideas strong enough to restore 
prosperity to tracks like Aksarben, situated in small markets and engulfed by 
competition for the gambling dollar.

CHANGE DOESN'T BOTHER MATTINGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON HEYMAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Mattingly, saddled with a bum wrist and low power numbers, gracefully 
accepted Manager Buck Showalter's decision to move him from the coveted No. 3 
spot in the batting order to No. 5. In fact, Mattingly applauded the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 No controversy here, no sir. The Yankees' most celebrated player over the past 
decade said he knew it was time to be dropped in the order. Paul O'Neill batted 
third Wednesday night against the Athletics, with Mattingly moving to No. 5 for 
the first time since May 28, 1984. No hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was managing, I would have done it a long time ago, the way Paulie's 
hitting," Mattingly said. "He needs to get into a position where he gets the 
most at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
 The move apparently was much tougher on Showalter, who admitted he's been 
mulling the switch for a month. Mattingly has been glued for years to the No. 3 
hole, generally reserved for a team's best hitter. However, at times in recent 
years, his persona has kept him at No. 3 as much as his pop. Before Wednesday 
night, the last time Mattingly did not bat third was Aug. 11, 1992, when he 
batted fourth. It was such a shock to see him as low as fifth that the PA 
announcer mistakenly called Mattingly's name fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Showalter stopped short of describing the move as permanent, although he 
indicated he isn't viewing this as short-term, either. O'Neill, the league's 
hitting leader at .383, will bat third against right-handers for now, with 
someone else likely to take that spot against left-handers. Jim Leyritz would 
seem to be a logical choice. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become apparent that Mattingly, who is only 6 for 24 since returning 
from the disabled list, has not completely recovered from the wrist injury that 
has hampered him all year. Showalter cited Mattingly's lingering ailment as a 
main reason for the switch. While Mattingly is batting .301, his homer total of 
five is noticeably low in this year of the home run. And it also is difficult 
to ignore the stunning and consistent production of O'Neill. Just when there 
was a sign he might slow down, he got hot again; he is on a 20-for-39 tear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will give Paul a couple extra at-bats until Don gets a little more 
comfortable," Showalter said. "It's not where he'd like it to be. Certain 
swings he takes, it bothers him. It's probably going to be with him the rest of 
the season." Mattingly's frustration is clear. At one point while discussing 
the troublesome wrist, he joked he might "cut it off." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill was as unaffected by the move as Mattingly. Typically, O'Neill said, 
"I don't think it's a big deal." In the past, O'Neill was viewed as someone 
with a fragile psyche about his batting position. However, Showalter said, "I 
think Paul's over that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly on rare occasions in the past has expressed a preference for the 
third spot. However, he said the only time he thought it was a mistake not to 
bat him third was in 1989, when Bucky Dent became manager and the Yankees had 
no other run-producer besides Mattingly. That lasted only one game, as 
Mattingly made clear his thoughts about batting second by dragging a bunt in 
his first at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly said his spot in the order "is not something I take personally. The 
thing I take personally is that I wish I were swinging the bat better." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly conceded he has not batted like a No. 3 hitter this season, like 
Rafael Palmeiro or Ken Griffey Jr. Or like O'Neill. "Times change," Mattingly 
said. "I'm not 23 or 24 anymore. The club's not the same. The situation is 
different. We've got a guy leading the league in hitting. He should be getting 
more at-bats. I believe this is the right thing to do."

HOT PROPERTY: 'THELMA' HITS ROAD -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Oscar-winning actress GEENA DAVIS and her husband, Finnish director RENNY 
HARLIN ("Cliffhanger," "Die Hard 2"), are moving their primary residence to a 
newly purchased multimillion-dollar estate in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, married last September, formed a company in May that will produce 
video games, theme restaurant parks and feature films, including the thriller 
"The Edge," which Harlin will direct. He is said to own the largest indoor 
amusement park in Europe as well as nightclubs and restaurants in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who won an Academy Award for "The Accidental Tourist" (1988) and 
co-starred in "A League of Their Own" (1992) and "Thelma and Louise" (1991), 
co-stars with Michael Keaton in the upcoming film "Speechless" and starts 
production in September on "Cutthroat Island," which Harlin will direct. He and 
Davis are producing "Speechless." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has listed her 2,700-square-foot Victorian in Los Feliz at $800,000, or 
$1.2 million, including a guest house. The site was once subdivided, but Davis, 
who already owned the main house, bought the guest house before meeting Harlin 
to return the estate to its original size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geena owned the house twice," said listing broker Lynne Beavers. "I sold it 
to her years ago and then, I sold it to her again after she was divorced from 
(actor) Jeff (Goldblum)." Davis restored the main house but hadn't gotten 
around to restoring the guest house when she married Harlin and moved to 
another home. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Los Feliz house in which Davis has an interest is listed with Beavers 
at $1.15 million. The three-story, 6,400-square-foot home, which is steeped in 
Hollywood history, was left partially renovated when work stopped after Davis' 
wedding. Now neighbors fear that nobody will complete the restoration, and the 
house, a local landmark, will be razed. 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime home of the late actor BILL BIXBY, best known for his starring 
role as Dr. David Bruce Banner on "The Incredible Hulk," has come on the market 
at $875,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bixby, who also starred in the series "My Favorite Martian" and "The Courtship 
of Eddie's Father," died last November at 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Bixby had owned the home, a two-bedroom townhouse, since it was built in 1980 
in the Century City development of Century Hills. He helped plan his unit and 
oversaw $200,000 in kitchen improvements. The townhouse also has a wine cellar 
and an office/computer area. 
</P>
<P>
 Bixby's widow, Judith Kliban-Bixby, plans to donate proceeds from the 
townhouse sale to an as yet-unspecified public television charity, in 
accordance with her late husband's wishes, said listing agent Kay Pick of Mike 
Silverman Estates, a Jon Douglas Co., in Beverly Hills. The townhome is 
co-listed with Gene Powell of Jon Douglas Co., Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Marino estate designed by WALLACE NEFF in 1929 for a Chicago woman whose 
husband was a founder of Sears Roebuck has been sold to a local businessman for 
close to its asking price of $3.5 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which is on nearly two acres, was also owned at one time by J.B. Van 
Nuys, whose family developed the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-room compound has five bedroom suites and 10 baths plus a two-bedroom 
guest apartment over a garage. The estate also has a tennis court, formal 
gardens, a reflection pool and fountain. The seller, a real estate company, was 
represented by John Tartaglione of Douglas Properties. 
</P>
<P>
 CATHY MCAULEY, best known for her role of Wanda, Bull's wife, in the TV series 
"Night Court," and her husband, Ken Radcliffe, director of operations for 
Rainbow Productions, have purchased a 4,000-square-foot house in Ireland for 
$450,000, sources say. Built in 1840 of cut stone, the home is on 27 acres with 
1,200 feet of river frontage. 
</P>
<P>
 McAuley, who has been set to star in an updated and renamed version of the 
Ginger Rogers film "Kitty Foyle" (1940), and Radcliffe live primarily in a 
Hollywood Hills condo that they have owned since 1985.

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL: A SUMMARY OF SELECTED CITY HALL ACTIONS IN THE 
PAST WEEK AFFECTING CENTRAL LOS ANGELES.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * NEW SUPERMARKET: Approved construction of a Vons supermarket at 5837 S. 
Vermont Ave., an area where residents have complained about a lack of such 
stores. The neighborhood's councilwoman, Rita Walters, applauded the decision, 
noting her district is home to 260,000 people but only three supermarkets. 
Construction is scheduled to begin in January, with the work expected to be 
completed in August. 
</P>
<P>
 * UNLICENSED DRIVERS: Voted to support, with one suggestion, state legislation 
that would authorize law enforcement officers to impound the vehicles of 
drivers who lack a driver's license or whose licenses have been suspended or 
revoked. The council recommended that the bill, AB 3148, be amended to give 
drivers with expired licenses a 60-day grace period before their vehicles are 
impounded (the measure currently calls for a 30-day grace period). Currently, 
drivers who are found to be without a license are merely ticketed. According to 
the California Department of Motor Vehicles, there are about 1.7 million 
drivers in the state who have never obtained a license or whose license is 
suspended or revoked. Statistics show that such drivers are four times more 
likely to be involved in a fatal accident than licensed drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 * CAR DONATION: Voted to accept Kaiser Permanente's donation to the Los 
Angeles Police Department of five automobiles. The cars, 1991 and '92 four-door 
sedans, will be used as unmarked vehicles by detectives. Because of budget 
restraints in recent years, the Police Department has not purchased any 
unmarked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * JAPANESE FESTIVAL: Approved street closures in Little Tokyo in the area 
bounded by Alameda, Los Angeles, 1st and 3rd streets from 2 to 7 p.m. Aug. 7 to 
celebrate the 54th annual Nisei Week Japanese Festival. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * AIDS RENTAL ASSISTANCE: Voted to extend a contract with three human 
service agencies that provide people with AIDS a onetime rental assistance fee 
of $500 or $1,000. The $731,000 contract, originally approved in 1991, will 
require no extra funding because the agencies, to date, have given out only 
$550,000. The contractors -- Aid for AIDS, El Centro Human Services and the 
Minority AIDS Project -- have had some difficulty dispensing the funds since 
eligibility is restricted to low-income people. Any money remaining at the 
conclusion of the contract on Dec. 31 will be funneled into AIDS prevention 
projects. Passed 14-0. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Jackie Goldberg, Mike 
Hernandez, Nate Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr., Rita Walters.

MOVIES; THEY PUT THEIR BEST FACE FORWARD; SO YOU THOUGHT THE DINOSAURS OF 
'JURRASIC PARK' WERE PRETTY AMAZING? THE FACES BEHIND 'THE MASK' SAY THEY 
REALLY HAD TO STRETCH THEMSELVES TO CREATE THE HIGH-TECH ANIMATION FOR JIM 
CARREY'S NEW COMEDY. HERE'S HOW THEY DID IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, Chuck Crisafulli is a frequent contributor to Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Carrey, the loose-limbed, rubber-faced star of "Ace Ventura: Pet 
Detective," is, quite decidedly, a physical comic. But even Carrey might have 
trouble pulling off gags that call for his skin to turn green, his eyes to 
rocket out of their sockets and his tongue to unscroll atop a nightclub table. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, with a little help from the physics-defying computer animation 
department at Industrial Light & Magic, Carrey can, and will, do anything for a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Mask," which opens Friday, Carrey's contortive brand of slapstick and 
ILM's high-tech computer effects have been combined to create an explosive 
blend of comedy and fantasy. Made for less than $20 million, the New Line 
production ranks as a modest film against pricier competition at the summer box 
office. But in using cutting-edge computer animation to make the very human 
Carrey as squashable and stretchable as any "Looney Tunes" favorite, "The Mask" 
aims to offer some of the summer's most striking movie moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Carrey is an elastic man to begin with," says director Chuck Russell. 
"And now, I think he's proud to have achieved a personal career goal by 
becoming a living cartoon." 
</P>
<P>
 The comic stars as Stanley Ipkiss, a helpless, hapless bank teller whose days 
are a disheartening series of humiliations. When Ipkiss gains possession of the 
ancient cursed mask of the title, he discovers that by donning it, he is 
transformed into a green-headed, zoot-suited, wisecracking phantom. The film 
also features newcomer Cameron Diaz as Stanley's love interest, comic Richard 
Jeni as his best buddy, Peter Greene as an ultra-creepy villain and Peter 
Riegert as a continually befuddled police detective. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve the mind-bending sequences, effects supervisors from ILM were on 
the set throughout the shoot to advise Russell and monitor Carrey's action. 
When live-action shots were completed, they were sent to the ILM headquarters 
in San Rafael, north of San Francisco. There, the same computers that were used 
to create the true-to-life dinosaurs of "Jurassic Park" were used to re-create 
the kinds of cartoon gags made famous in the '30s and '40s by pioneering 
"Looney Tunes" directors Tex Avery and Bob Clampett. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a quick break from his increasingly busy work schedule, Carrey still 
hadn't seen the finished cut of the film, but he says he can't wait to see how 
ILM has enhanced his antics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a really fun character for me. I've been describing him as 'Fred 
Astaire on acid.' It's going to be really odd and really interesting to see 
what I'm doing in the finished film. But, frankly," he says with a laugh, "I 
don't think I'll see myself doing anything I haven't imagined myself doing 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, then Carrey has a formidable imagination. When Stanley 
turns into the Mask, he can spin himself into a tornado, pull a barrack's worth 
of armaments out of his pocket or sprout a wolf's head in order to whistle at 
the object of his desire. And though the Mask character tends to make things 
difficult for evildoers, he's no white-knight crime-fighter. To avoid being 
captured, he can use his compelling singing voice to turn a battalion of cops 
into a frenzied conga line. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer crew at ILM couldn't have been happier with the work. While the 
T. rex and velociraptors of "Jurassic Park" were groundbreaking, technical 
tours de force, the actual animation work was often grueling. The freewheeling 
spirit of "The Mask" offered the high-tech cartoon-lovers at ILM a chance to 
get back to their animation roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was loose," says visual effects producer Clint Goldman. "We could go 
crazy. The craziest we could get in 'Jurassic' was when we had the T. rex 
chomping on the lawyer. That was fun. But 'crazy' on 'The Mask' meant 
multiplying Jim Carrey's head by three and giving him four-foot bulging 
eyeballs. That was a lot more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "After 'Jurassic,' I was almost ready to pack it in," says director of 
animation Steve Williams, a six-year veteran of the ILM computer graphics 
department. "But 'The Mask' was completely refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we could do with the dinosaurs was limited by the laws of the natural 
world, but 'The Mask' was textbook cartooning. We got really excited watching 
the dailies. It was a lot more fun spending a year watching Jim than it was 
spending two years seeing how accurately we could make the butt of a giant 
reptile jiggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey was equally excited about working with ILM and says he felt he was 
among kindred spirits the first time he met Goldman, Williams and their staff: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved Tex Avery stuff. I went up to ILM before we started 
shooting to see what they had in mind, and I found these guys sitting around, 
watching cartoons like a bunch of children -- just giggling and pointing. It 
was amazing. I said, 'God, thank you for putting me where I belong.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mask" is loosely based on a comic book of the same title developed by 
Dark Horse comics in the early '80s. The title character was originally 
conceived as a slightly less malevolent takeoff on Batman's perennial nemesis 
the Joker, and the stories in the comic books were often quite dark. New Line 
bought the film rights to the comic book and, after a couple of years of 
unsuccessful development, approached Russell about signing on to the project. 
The director was grabbed by the basic theme of the tale but wanted to make a 
film with a much lighter tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the idea of this mysterious mask that completely transforms whoever 
puts it on," he says. "But I wanted to set the story in a more colorful world. 
I wanted to create the tone of the old musical comedies, because I saw the Mask 
as a very musical character. He's a little hallucinogenic, and a little 3-D, 
but there's a musical-comedy energy to everything that he does." 
</P>
<P>
 As director of "Nightmare on Elm Street III" and the remake of "The Blob," 
Russell had experience evoking chills from his audiences, but comedy has never 
been far from his mind -- this is the man who had Freddy Krueger erupt out of 
Dick Cavett and attack Zsa Zsa Gabor. He also produced the 1986 Rodney 
Dangerfield vehicle "Back to School" early in his career, and it was in 
planning that film that he discovered the charms of a young comic named Jim 
Carrey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd seen his stand-up work and thought he was phenomenal," Russell says. "I 
kept wondering why nobody had used him in movies yet. I wanted to use a 
comedian for a part in 'Back to School,' but it was the part of a college 
professor and Jim was too young to play that. We ended up using Sam Kinison. 
When I started scripting 'The Mask,' I had Jim in mind even before I knew 
whether I could get him or not. When he read the first draft I worked on, he 
said, 'It looks like it's written for me.' I said, 'You're absolutely correct.' 
We were in sync from then on." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey's only worry about the project was that the heavy effects might crimp 
his comedy. In all of his scenes as the Mask, he needed to wear a prosthetic 
head designed by makeup effects artist Greg Cannom. And because most of his 
shtick would have a computer-generated payoff, any comic improvisations on the 
set would have to be tailored to ILM's capabilities. But he discovered that 
Russell and ILM were equally prepared to let him run wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern was about having a little freedom," Carrey explains, 
"especially since I was coming from 'Ace Ventura,' where I got to cut loose. 
That's the best method for me -- I like to spew and go out on wild tangents and 
let the director guide me as to the appropriateness of something. Chuck had my 
scenes pretty well worked out, but after the first week of shooting, things 
changed completely. New Line was getting dailies that weren't on any page of 
the script. They put a little pressure on Chuck at first, but then they started 
liking the new stuff even better than the stuff that had been planned." 
</P>
<P>
 "When the makeup and the costume came on, he really did become the Mask," 
Russell recalls with a laugh. "I think he even surprised himself sometimes with 
what he came up with. . . . I never had to pump Jim Carrey up, although I will 
admit to feeding him a few extra cappuccinos at the right time of night." 
</P>
<P>
 The director was happy to discover that his computer animators could ad-lib 
just as well as his star 
</P>
<P>
 "One day we decided that in a nightclub scene, the Mask should offer his love 
interest a cigarette and blow her a heart-shaped smoke ring -- sort of a Pepe 
le Pew maneuver," Russell says. "We came up with that on the set, Jim did his 
part, and then ILM went ahead and ran with it. Both of their talents came 
together to create this nice, off-the-cuff comic moment." 
</P>
<P>
 As images and action sequences were created by the animators and sent to the 
director for approval, a unique language was created. 
</P>
<P>
 "ILM and I now know the difference between a zip and a zing , Russell says. 
"It got that specific. And we were often getting into these very serious 
discussions about which scenes in the movie needed extra 'face wobble.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the shoot, the biggest problem that Russell and ILM encountered was 
not in matching the animation to Carrey's movements but in making sure that the 
animation hit the right lighthearted, comic tone. They discovered that when 
some cartoon gags were applied to a human in photo-real fashion, the effect 
could be horrific rather than comedic. That was particularly true of the 
transformation scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the shots where the mask is going on Jim's head or coming off it, there's 
a lot of interaction between this thing that's totally synthetic and 
computer-generated and his real skin," says visual effects producer Goldman. 
"For that to look natural, and have a sense of fun to it and be scary but not 
too scary -- that was some pretty tricky work for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was always the danger of being grotesque," Russell says. "When you do 
what we called the 'Awooga face,' and the jaw drops and the eyes pop and the 
tongue rolls out, it could be a scene in a monster movie. I wanted this film to 
have a dangerous edge, but I wouldn't let it get grotesque." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, the director of animation, was a little more willing to let things 
look ugly: "I think Chuck and I had a little bit of the old Lennon and 
McCartney tension," he says with a chuckle. "I wanted eyeballs to bulge 
grotesquely, and he usually wanted a less shocking image. He always had to pull 
the animators back a little bit in terms of how graphic the image was. But once 
we had the right tone, he encouraged us to go completely nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he hopes the future may bring another chance to get gross. 
"Maybe if there's a sequel, I'll get to put more veins in the eyeballs." 
</P>
<P>
 New Line founder and Chief Executive Officer Robert Shaye said he looks 
forward to seeing Carrey don the mask in further adventures. Carrey, who was 
paid $450,000 for "The Mask," was signed after the wild success of last 
spring's "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" for a "Mask 2," reportedly for as much as 
$10 million. The film has already spawned a forthcoming animated TV show, an 
album (on which Carrey makes his recording debut, with a rendition of "Cuban 
Pete") and a line of toys, and when the film was presented to international 
distributors at the Cannes Film Festival, the response was enthusiastically 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that has helped a lot of studios thrive, and has certainly 
helped New Line, are the so-called tent poles," Shaye says. "I'd be happy to 
see 'The Mask' become one of ours. I'm just amazed that if we had made this 
film two years ago, we probably would not have had this kind of quality special 
effects you see in the film today, because they weren't affordable or even 
available." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell also sees the making of "The Mask" as a triumph of good timing. 
"Because of the success of 'Ace Ventura,' 'The Mask' has gone from being 
described as 'a movie starring the white guy from 'In Living Color' to 'a Jim 
Carrey comedy,' " he says. "And I think people will see in this film that Jim 
can be just as charming an actor when he's Stanley Ipkiss as he is a comedic 
madman when he plays the Mask."  
</P>
<P>
 Shaye says that if the manic Mask does become a franchise player for New Line, 
there is always the chance that he may meet up with the stars of the company's 
other tent poles -- the "Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Friday the 13th" series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Universal did that kind of thing, and we're not blind to the possibilities," 
he says. "If Universal could have Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein and the 
Wolf Man, maybe Stanley Ipkiss could meet up with Freddy and Jason."

DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN; BY THE TIME THEY GET TO 'WOODSTOCK '94,' CROSBY, STILLS 
& NASH WILL BE BACK WHERE THEY STARTED 25 YEARS AGO. ARE THEY GOING THERE TO 
IMPART A SENSE OF HISTORY? NOT THESE GUYS.

<P>
 When David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash went on stage at Woodstock 
in 1969, it was only their second show together. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the band celebrates a quarter-century of music-making with an album, 
a tour and, fittingly, a performance at "Woodstock '94," which will be Aug. 13 
and 14 in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But if these three '60s survivors are supposed to present themselves as solemn 
elder statesman of the Woodstock Nation, they aren't playing the part very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby, Stills and Nash are in a Burbank recording studio working on the final 
track for their first album together in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the trio's ties to Woodstock, their respective backgrounds with 
the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and the Hollies, and their fitful relationship 
with Neil Young, they represent an enormous chunk of rock 'n' roll history. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mood in the room is not one of dignified reflection -- and there's no 
talk of historical significance. Instead, food fights are narrowly avoided, 
O.J. jokes are circulated and spreading waistlines are made fun of. 
</P>
<P>
 The band so famous for its heady harmonies and shifting grudges is, in short, 
having a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our general rule is, 'If it ain't fun, we ain't going,' " says Stills, 49. 
"We enjoy laughing too much. We can't think of ourselves as a big deal. Not in 
here, anyway. We poke fun at each other relentlessly. And after all this time, 
it's still not as much fun to make music if the other two aren't around." 
</P>
<P>
 The music at hand is a Stills composition titled "Only Waiting for You." The 
group thought it had completed its album, "After the Storm," during recording 
sessions with producer Glyn Johns, whose credits -- from the Rolling Stones and 
the Who to Eric Clapton and the Eagles -- represent another chunk of rock 
history. But two weeks into their current tour, Stills put together what may be 
the record's strongest track. Instead of taking a weekend tour break, the band 
has returned to the studio with longtime CSN keyboardist/vocalist Michael 
Finnigan and are yukking it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "'We sound like church geeks," complains Crosby, 52, after hearing a playback 
of the song. He's at a microphone with Nash and Finnigan saying that the 
"ooohs" they're singing over Stills' lead are too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The part is changed to "aah" on a second take, but the attack is too harsh for 
Stills' taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good God," Stills grumbles in the control room, "not so much Bruce Lee." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's hard competing with Mr. 'Star Search' Voice here," says Finnigan, 
eyeing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
 When it looks as if a musical impasse is nearing, Nash diplomatically works 
out a part his bandmates are happy with. On the final take, the blend is just 
right. And when Nash bends his note in counterpoint to Crosby's, there it is: 
the shimmering mix of voices the group is famous for. 
</P>
<P>
 Stills' smoky baritone is now mostly grit and gravel, and his partners' 
harmonies aren't as pristine as they were back in the "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" 
days of the late '60s, but the gracefully spirited union of their talents is 
still powerful and affecting. The new song has sprung to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, away from the mike, Crosby flashes a mischievous grin. "Man, these were 
supposed to be vacation days for us. But Stephen had to go and write the single 
after we finished the album -- the dip." 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually this is not unusual at all," Nash, 52, points out. "The same thing 
happened on (the 1970 album) 'Deja vu.' We didn't quite have an opener for that 
one. We said, 'When you tear the shrink wrap off the LP, what's the first thing 
you want to hear?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We told Stephen we didn't have it. The next day he came in and said, 'What 
about this?' and played 'Carry On.' David and I got a bit wide-eyed and said: 
'OK, Stephen. I think we hear it now. Thanks very much.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby, Stills & Nash were among the first collections of rock 'n' roll 
notables to be dubbed a super-group. But, as each member emphasizes in separate 
interviews, their intention in getting together all those years ago was to be 
more of an anti-group.  
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we used our own names when we started the band was because we also 
wanted to pursue individual careers as well," explains Crosby. "We didn't like 
being locked into roles the way we were in Buffalo Springfield and the Byrds 
and the Hollies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always pursued other projects, and we sing on other people's records 
all the time. It's a tremendously healthy way to do things because you get a 
chance for some musical cross-pollination and you learn something new. And when 
we're ready, we bring it all back to CSN." 
</P>
<P>
 The three met through Cass Elliot of the Mamas & the Papas. When they first 
sang together -- in Elliot's kitchen or in Joni Mitchell's living room, 
depending on who's telling the story -- the sound they made eased their fears 
about collaborative work. All had bad tastes in their mouths regarding previous 
affiliations: Crosby had splintered from the Byrds acrimoniously, Nash had 
tired of the Hollies' pop direction, and Stills was bitter over the breakup of 
Buffalo Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash (who believes it was at Mitchell's house) recalls that the first song 
they worked on was "You Don't Have to Cry," which appeared on the trio's debut 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 "David and Stephen had worked out the song, and after I heard it a couple of 
times, I came up with a part to fit against theirs," he says, sitting on a 
patio during a break in the recording session. "Halfway through it, we burst 
out laughing. Because as much as we were bored with groups at the time, and as 
much as we (each) didn't want to be in anything remotely resembling the band we 
had been in, we realized that we were going to have to spend some time 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Their first album, 1969's "Crosby, Stills & Nash," was something of a last 
prayer for the '60s counterculture. The fluid, folky grooves of the music and 
the wizened idealism of songs such as "Wooden Ships" and "Long Time Gone" 
seemed a perfect soundtrack for the Woodstock summer. The album made it to No. 
6 on the pop charts, and Nash's upbeat "Marrakesh Express" single made the Top 
40. 
</P>
<P>
 The group quickly added Neil Young, who had played with Stills in Buffalo 
Springfield, and after some particularly volatile recording sessions, the 
foursome released "Deja vu" in 1970. That record went to No. 1, partly on the 
strength of the group's first Top 20 single, the Joni Mitchell-penned 
"Woodstock." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash's gentle Aquarius Age anthem "Teach Your Children" was released as a 
second single. The song was headed for the Top 10, but when four student 
protesters were killed by National Guardsmen at Kent State University, the band 
quickly recorded and released Young's angry response to the deaths. CSNY's 
"Ohio" made it to the Top 20 and knocked "Teach Your Children" off the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been some memorable lowlights over the years. The band is 
closely associated with Woodstock, but they also played with the Rolling 
Stones, Jefferson Airplane and others at the ill-fated Altamont show in 
California. A fan was stabbed to death during a melee in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest point came in 1985 when, after several years of drug addiction, 
Crosby was incarcerated for nearly a year in Texas on drug and weapons 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible time, because I had stopped writing," Crosby says now. "And 
I'm not good for much of anything in this world if I'm not making music. I'm 
fortunate that Stephen and Nash stood by me, and I'm writing more than ever 
now. I've probably only made a couple of smart decisions in my life. One was 
marrying my wife (the former Jan Dance, in 1987), and the other was getting 
sober." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Deja vu" there have been three more Crosby, Stills & Nash albums: "CSN" 
in 1977 and "Daylight Again" in 1982, both of which made the Top 10, and 1990's 
"Live It Up," which didn't crack the Top 50. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is misleading to measure the trio's contributions in terms of official 
CSN albums. Through the years there have also been two more CSNY albums, 
several Crosby-Nash packages, a Stills-Young collection and numerous solo 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the media has often written about CSN in terms of breakups and 
reunions, Crosby sees their efforts as part of a continuing stream.  
</P>
<P>
 "Breakups and reunions are more dramatic, but it's a bunch of crap," Crosby 
says with a laugh. "We're doing what we intended to do when we started. One of 
the reasons I don't think much about this being our 25th-anniversary tour is 
that we've never really stopped, except for the year that I was in the joint. 
One way or another, we've worked together every year since we started." 
</P>
<P>
 The band opened its current five-month North American tour in June with a rare 
club show, at L.A.'s House of Blues. It will include shows Oct. 17 and 18 at 
the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether there was any talk of bringing in erstwhile cohort Young for the 
new record, Crosby grins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put it this way," he says. "You don't bring Neil Young anyplace. 'Neil, 
over here please' just doesn't apply. It's never worked that way. And, frankly, 
I love the guy, but he needs us like a stag needs a hatrack. Once in a while, 
when we really need to pull out the horsepower, we'll get together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it at Bill Graham's wake (in 1991), and it was one of the best 
afternoons we've had in many years. And friends of mine who are totally honest 
with me -- Phil Lesh and Jerry Garcia from the (Grateful) Dead and Robin 
Williams -- heard that and said, 'That's the real stuff. What's the matter with 
you guys? Why don't you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 That's the question that producer Johns forced the group to confront as they 
made "After the Storm," which will be released Aug. 16. CSN had always produced 
their own work, but, because they were unhappy with the sound of their last 
couple of albums, they brought in Johns in hopes of recapturing some of the 
magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I set out to make a record that was true to the sound that excited all of us 
who loved Crosby, Stills & Nash at the beginning," Johns says. 
</P>
<P>
 The group says their newest songs do well among the old favorites in their 
concert sets. All three wrote for the album, and lyrically the material 
continues the familiar CSN weave of self-examination, romantic intrigue and 
political consciousness. The record also features a stark reading of the 
Beatles' "In My Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Johns, "Bands that have been around as long as they have naturally try to 
change with the times and adapt what they do. But I felt now would be a great 
time to have a record that related a little more to what they used to be. 
That's what I set out to achieve, and they readily climbed on board." 
</P>
<P>
 The group wasn't so eager to return to Woodstock, though. They were ready to 
record and ready to tour, but they didn't see much point in playing at 
something they saw as an attempt to cash in on nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the bill began to fill up with acts such as Aerosmith, Nine Inch Nails, 
Cypress Hill and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, CSN decided they could stop 
worrying about the day's cultural significance and simply enjoy the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby holds out hope that some of that original spirit will surface even at 
this tightly scheduled, highly organized '90s-era event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old unreconstructed hippie that I am, I've been trying to cause as much 
trouble as I can," he says, smiling. "I'm loudly predicting that at this 
carefully managed 250,000-people event, 2.8 million people will show up, and 
I'm hoping it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If every Grateful Dead fan in the country packs up their tie-dye and gets 
there, nobody would be happier than me. I'd love to see a 10-mile-long tailgate 
party on the New York Thruway. It'd be nice to think that there are still some 
things that aren't totally manageable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash says that despite the trip back to Woodstock, CSN remains intently 
focused on its future and the music to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose we could spend time dwelling on how meaningful we are, and how 
important the last 25 years are, but we don't. We're lucky to take it a day at 
a time. We can't continually look into the past, because that's not who we are 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all grown as musicians, and we've expanded as people." He rests a hand 
on his midsection and cocks an eyebrow. "Please smile when you say we've 
expanded." 
</P>
<P>
 Stills says he is simply looking forward to a weekend of good music and better 
accommodations than they had 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we had mixed feelings about going back to Woodstock," he says, "but 
we're going to have fun with it. We just want to arrive early and get a good 
parking space. We've got a much nicer tour bus this time around, and as long as 
I'm on the bus, I know I'll be comfortable."

DANCE; A LOOK AT THE ROLODEX OF DANCE; LONG A SHOWCASE FOR AREA ARTISTS, 'DANCE 
KALEIDOSCOPE' IS ALSO A SHOPPING GROUND FOR PRESENTERS. BUT DOES IT REALLY SHOW 
THE BEST? 
</P>

 Imagine the choreographic equivalent of a multi-chapter Chinese restaurant 
menu. What you've got isn't just a meal, it's a performing arts pig-out. It's 
also a fair approximation of Los Angeles' premier festival of Southland dance, 
a.k.a. "Dance Kaleidoscope." 
</P>
<P>
 There are smaller festivals here, including "Dance Roots," "Prime Moves" and 
Highways' annual dance showcase. But there's no terpsichorean event quite like 
this one. And certainly none that is growing at such a rate in spite of hard 
times for arts funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dance Kaleidoscope," which opened Friday, presents five different programs 
during the next two weeks at Cal State L.A.'s State Playhouse and the John 
Anson Ford Amphitheatre. The event features 40 companies in works that run the 
gamut from performance art to ballet to jazz, from modern to folk dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists include such disparate talents as the dance theater duo Blue Palm, 
modern choreographer Russell Scott and modern company Rose Polsky and Dancers. 
The world-dance component includes Ballet Folklorico del Pacifico and Keshet 
Chaim Dance Ensemble. And for the first time "Kaleidoscope" will offer a 
program designed specifically for children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, what's unprecedented about the event is not its scope but its size. 
Clearly, the number of participants alone demonstrates the variety of 
indigenous dance. 
</P>
<P>
 It also proves that word has gotten out about "Kaleidoscope." In 1993, 87 
individuals and companies auditioned for 27 openings. This year, there were 142 
hopefuls for 40 slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kaleidoscope" Director Don Hewitt, the Cal State L.A. dance faculty member 
who has overseen the festival since 1989, finds the demand daunting, though not 
surprising. "It's scary and good at the same time, because you think, 'Oh my 
God. All these people need a place,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the year people call me like an agent," he says, referring to his 
reputation as a veritable human Rolodex of information on Southland dance 
artists. "A lot of (choreographers and dancers) have been discovered here." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in a city that has few affordable venues to present dance, 
"Kaleidoscope" is widely regarded as an indispensable platform for emerging 
Southern California choreographers, as well as for some of their more 
established colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only time of year that you get to see a whole range of dance and the 
only place the dance community will go to look at other people's work," says 
independent producer Serena Tripi. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Kaleidoscope" is a one-stop shop for presenters and others trolling 
for new talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great showcase," says Rachel Cohen, one of the few L.A. concert dance 
agents and a member of this year's selection panel. "The general audience goes 
there to have a night of dance that's not too expensive. And I go to see what's 
new." 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge all emerging companies I know to go there because it's a good 
springboard and it's a chance to get reviewed," says Cohen, whose clients -- 
Mehmet Sander Dance Company, Winifred R. Harris' Between Lines and Naomi 
Goldberg's Los Angeles Modern Dance and Ballet -- all are part of this year's 
"Kaleidoscope," which she helped select. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford Amphitheatre performances are a homecoming of sorts for "Dance 
Kaleidoscope." Although in recent years nearly all of the "Kaleidoscope" 
programs have been staged at Cal State L.A., the festival was launched at the 
Ford by the now-defunct Los Angeles Area Dance Alliance in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 When the alliance went under in 1985, "Kaleidoscope" went with it. The 
festival then lay dormant until it was revived at Cal State L.A. in 1989, as a 
co-presentation of the campus's department of theater and dance and the city's 
Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt was the driving force behind the project and has remained so. He says 
he was simply responding to a need: "Artists were saying that there were no 
venues. I was teaching at the time and I noticed that during the summer there 
was nothing happening in the theaters on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 He approached campus officials about the possibility of presenting a dance 
festival and they responded with interest, if only to the tune of a couple of 
thousand dollars. Since then, the city has paid for the artists' honorariums 
and Cal State L.A. has provided the venue and other in-kind services. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional funds -- usually about $50,000 -- need to be raised each year to 
pay for technical support and other necessities. This year, that money is 
coming from grants from the National-State-County Partnership for the Arts, the 
Brody Foundation and the dancewear company Capezio Balletmakers. These monies, 
plus box-office receipts, constitute the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kaleidoscope's" funding has held relatively steady. Hewitt has been 
successful in securing and keeping the funding in part because he has sought to 
upgrade the programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original 'Kaleidoscope' had more companies in it than we do now because 
each company had only one performance and only one half-hour tech rehearsal," 
he says. "They desperately needed a showplace at that time, but we couldn't get 
people to review it, because it was so uneven. The quality is much different 
than before because we give them two evenings and two tech rehearsals each 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Kaleidoscope's" uphill road to its current success has not been 
bump-free. Three years ago, for instance, there was a disagreement between 
Hewitt and Cultural Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials wanted to revise the audition process -- holding tryouts 
around the city rather than at one central location. They also wanted to have 
performances at multiple sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt, however, fought to keep auditions and the shows in one place. "I was 
opposed to it because I didn't think it was fair to the artists to audition 
them in different venues," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also worried that his pet project was about to be co-opted into something 
less professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to unify the community, not tear it apart," he says. "But it was 
even suggested to me that we might have the audience choose (who would be on 
the bill). I was afraid that would turn it into 'The Gong Show.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Cultural Affairs and Hewitt may have been reaching for similar 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt that everyone wasn't having an equal opportunity," he says. "But 
when we presented evidence, they got off our backs. Now it's fine. I haven't 
had a problem with Cultural Affairs (since). I just don't think 
("Kaleidoscope") should be a political football." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though this clash was resolved, the selection process remains 
"Kaleidoscope's" most controversial aspect. A 10-member selection panel of L.A. 
dance and performing arts professionals holds the auditions. The group's roster 
differs from year to year, although each of the panelists serves for a minimum 
of two years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a process that many praise. "They have a good selection process," says 
producer Tripi, who has been a panelist in years past. "We see a good 
sampling." 
</P>
<P>
 But even supporters have complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a few artists, who shall remain nameless, who have been on 
the program several years in a row," Tripi says. "I find that bogs the program 
down. You need to give everybody a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 One artist who says that he hasn't had that chance is choreographer and Cal 
State L.A. alumnus Frank Guevara. He is working on a new piece these days. It's 
called "My Mexican Hat Dance," but you won't see this work at "Dance 
Kaleidoscope" (he intends to premiere it in Cal State L.A.'s State Playhouse in 
October). 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario -- in which Guevara adopts a fictional persona who is also a 
dancer -- is bound to be controversial. It was inspired in part by his having 
auditioned for "Kaleidoscope" four years ago and again this year but being 
rejected both times by a process he found "insulting." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about a Latino man auditioning in the Southland and how he needs to put 
a mask on his movement in order to be accepted," says the East L.A.-raised 
Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara says he has been-there done-that himself. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'My Mexican Hat Dance' is a protest piece," says the dancer, who's known for 
his rigorous "hyperdance"-style work. "This character just wants to dance -- to 
move from emotion. However, he has to do these traditional things for these 
people because that's what they want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 During "Kaleidoscope's" initial incarnation, from 1985 to 1989, the programs 
were heavily weighted toward modern dance, leading some critics to charge the 
festival with lack of interest in so-called ethnic dance (but not Hewitt, who 
didn't take over until '89). Yet Guevara's complaint is not that choreographers 
of color aren't included in "Kaleidoscope" now -- they have contributed a major 
portion of the programming since 1991 -- but that non-white artists don't enjoy 
the creative freedom of their Anglo colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara says the problem begins with the selection process: "The feedback 
wasn't good. And there was no Latino representation on the panel. Francisco 
Martinez was supposed to be there, but he wasn't when I auditioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara believes that even if all of the appointed panelists had been present 
for his most recent audition, a bias against non-white artists who don't do 
culturally specific dance would have prevented him from being selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this rule somewhere that I need to be represented by folklorico 
groups," he says. "I'm not ashamed of folkloric groups, but it's a problem for 
me that that's what we're expected to see." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need for Latino modern dance, but there's no modern Latino 
representation on the bill," Guevara says. Partly in response to this 
situation, he founded the East L.A. Choreographers' showcase in 1989 and 
launched his own company, Dance Theatre of East L.A., in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of African American modern companies and choreographers on 
the "Kaleidoscope" bills -- including Bridge Dance Theatre, the Lehman Dance 
Company, Bre Dance Theatre and Bambi Anderson -- but the sole Latino modern 
choreographer-soloist is Roger Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Guevara, Garcia believes that "Kaleidoscope" and the dance community in 
general are open to Latino modern dance. Yet Garcia's placement on the 
children's program may suggest, at least, that his work is not as controversial 
as Guevara's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware of any resistance myself. I think it's the opposite," says 
Garcia, who had never auditioned for the "Kaleidoscope" festival before this 
year. "I've been well-received." 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt also denies any prejudice. "There is absolutely no bias against any 
ethnic group, particularly Latinos, doing contemporary or modern work," he 
says. "We judge solely on the quality of a 20-minute audition." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the continuing debate over programming, the greatest problem in 
terms of the advancement of L.A. dance remains that there is no place to go 
from here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need another step up for established artists -- otherwise our companies 
are not going to grow," Tripi says. "I want to be able to see more of what I 
see at 'Dance Kaleidoscope.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that once a company gets strong, they don't participate anymore," 
Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, in particular, a dearth of affordable mid-sized venues at which 
companies can self-produce -- a problem that also plagues L.A. theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has to hunt all over for a venue. I want a place that would be like 
DTW West, where the community can go and use the space cheaply," Tripi says, 
referring to New York's Dance Theatre Workshop. "Then we can start to get the 
general population used to coming to a place other than the Music Center to 
watch dance. Right now, all we really have is 'Kaleidoscope.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, "Kaleidoscope" aficionados and others may not need to look 
further than their own back yard to find a new base. The new Luckman Center for 
the performing arts is set to open this fall at Cal State L.A. It is expected 
to feature a number of local dance companies in its premiere season, and, 
Hewitt says, "Kaleidoscope" may also take up residence there next year. 
</P>
<P>
 He likens the Luckman to New York's Joyce Theatre, a mid-sized venue devoted 
to the presentation of dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we had a theater like that. Maybe then we could support companies like 
Lewitzky, Los Angeles Chamber Ballet, Aman and Jazz Tap Ensemble with a home 
base." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 'Kaleidoscope' has been here at Cal State L.A., it's opened the door 
for that to happen," Hewitt says. "We've been waiting for a place for dance to 
be."*

COVER STORY; ANGST AT DISNEY'S WORLD; ALL HOLLYWOOD'S EYES ARE ON DISNEY 
STUDIOS CHAIRMAN JEFFREY KATZENBERG. HOW MUCH HAVE FRANK WELLS' DEATH AND 
MICHAEL EISNER'S HEART SURGERY CHANGED HIS FUTURE? TIME WILL TELL, BUT HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH EISNER IS THE REAL STORY.

<P>
 Just three weeks ago, Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner sat in his office atop 
corporate headquarters in Burbank and for the first time reluctantly discussed 
what has been on the minds of all of Hollywood -- the fate of his studio 
chairman, Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg's future in the ever-expanding entertainment empire had been the 
source of intense debate since April, when Frank G. Wells, Disney president and 
chief operating officer, died in a Nevada helicopter crash. While much of the 
industry assumed that Katzenberg would step into Wells' job, based on his 
decade-long record of success, Eisner said in this candid two-hour interview 
that he had no intentions of sharing the Disney throne. 
</P>
<P>
 Such speculation intensified after last Saturday's unexpected turn of events 
-- which found the 52-year-old Eisner undergoing emergency quadruple heart 
bypass surgery. While a Disney spokesman said on Wednesday that Eisner's 
position remains unchanged, it's widely assumed that he now will be forced by 
events to appoint a second-in-command to help carry the heavy load of running 
one of the industry's biggest entertainment companies. 
</P>
<P>
 So the spotlight instantly returns to Katzenberg -- who is known to covet the 
crown as Prince of the Magic Kingdom. In his interview, Eisner said that there 
is no one in the industry he trusts more than the 43-year-old studio chairman, 
whom he has mentored for the past 20 years since their days at Paramount 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is extremely trustworthy and loyal and very supportive of the whole 
company -- he is very much a team player," Eisner said of Katzenberg three 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the harmonious facade of Team Disney, there exists a complex, 
tension-filled relationship between Eisner and Katzenberg that many see as a 
psychological barrier to change. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends and colleagues say that despite Katzenberg's accomplishments, 
Eisner has never given his close associate the due he has always sought. 
Indeed, sources say the two have never even discussed the issue of Katzenberg's 
future in the post-Wells era. "This is about a withholding father and a son 
looking for love and recognition from that father," a close associate of both 
men said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a decade ago that Eisner left as head of Paramount and brought his 
fast-talking, hyper-ambitious president of production with him to Disney. 
Together they helped transform the moribund studio -- which had only $225 
million in revenue in 1984 -- into the $4.5-billion revenue producer it is 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 As studio chairman, overseeing motion pictures and television, Katzenberg has 
made contributions to the empire's animation franchise and other endeavors that 
would seem enough to make him the obvious heir to the throne. His track record 
is among the best in Hollywood, even though the studio has been struggling for 
years to recapture the lost luster of its live-action movie business. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's latest animated classic, "The Lion King," has so far grossed nearly 
$200 million at the box office in just over four weeks, reconfirming Disney's 
utter dominance of the feature animation kingdom. Under Katzenberg's 
supervision, Disney's first foray into live theater, Broadway's "Beauty and the 
Beast," is the top-grossing show on the Great White Way. The ABC series "Home 
Improvement," produced at Disney under Katzenberg and studio president/TV head 
Richard Frank, was this past season's No. 1 TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 But achievement isn't always rewarded generously in the corporate jungle. The 
untimely death of Wells, who had always served as adviser and the mediator 
between Eisner and Katzenberg and a confidant to both, compounded with Eisner's 
sudden health problems, complicates their relationship even further, sources 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two events add an artificial drama to what was already a real-life 
drama. This situation became much more complicated when . . . the father became 
vulnerable," observes one. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point Eisner isn't the only one who's vulnerable. Friends say that 
Katzenberg, widely considered a control freak, has been emotionally frayed by 
the sudden uncertainty surrounding his career. After turning down countless job 
offers in the past, Katzenberg last week confided to those closest to him that 
he will leave the company if Eisner passes him over. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg refused to be interviewed for this story. And given his powerful 
position in the industry and the delicate nature of relationships in Hollywood, 
dozens of his associates and friends also would not speak on the record. But 
privately there was no shortage of people willing to speculate on Katzenberg's 
future, and the unusual dynamic that exists between him and Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is not cleared up soon, it could become a very dangerous situation . 
. . Jeffrey could become impatient. And both of these men are of incredible 
value to that company," a source who is close to Eisner and Katzenberg said 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A close Katzenberg friend, Jim Wiatt, president of the powerful talent agency 
ICM, agrees: "It would seem to me, they (Eisner and the Disney board) would 
have to do something soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner was expected to return home by this weekend from Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, where he has been making business phone calls from his bedside for the 
past week and has been visited at least twice by Katzenberg. Eisner, who plans 
to be back at work within weeks, has made no public comment since his 
hospitalization. So it is anyone's guess if -- and when -- he will make any 
major decisions regarding the corporate hierarchy. Katzenberg's contract is 
believed to expire within six months, and Eisner may want to move quickly to 
resolve his future to assure Wall Street that the company's management remains 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner initially declined to be interviewed for this story, specifically 
because he did not want to fuel any speculation that Katzenberg's role at the 
company would be changing. But he later relented, deciding that too much might 
be read into his silence. 
</P>
<P>
 At what turned out to be his last interview before his bypass surgery, Eisner 
sat at a coffee table in the anteroom of his pastel-colored executive suite, 
wearing gray slacks and a light blue shirt. He was robust and talkative, though 
at times defensive during an informal interview that ran four times longer than 
originally scheduled. Glancing frequently at the corporate publicist seated 
across from him, Eisner remarked no less than six times, "I know I'm going to 
regret having done this." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the Wells position, he drew a sharp distinction between the 
demands of running a studio and administering a Fortune 500 company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want Jeffrey at the moment to worry about corporate insurance and 
that's what Frank Wells did . . . he kept the machine running," Eisner said, 
adding that Katzenberg had always been "spared the day-to-day administrative" 
duties, and that his "ultimate responsibility is for the creation of product 
lines in the motion picture division." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eisner: "Like casting (a movie), I want to keep my stars in star roles." 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear that as much as he treasured Katzenberg as a creative and 
financial executive, acknowledging that "he has now matured to the point where 
he is a principal in this company," Eisner viewed himself as the sole king of 
the Disney jungle organizationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders and friends concede that Katzenberg lacks the depth of 
experience of Wells, a lawyer and veteran studio executive who oversaw 
strategic, corporate and financial planning and was Eisner's chief adviser. 
Unlike the media-savvy and image-obsessed Katzenberg, Wells was also a classic 
background player. Throughout their time together he was content to let Eisner 
-- with his tousled silver hair and goofy smile that masks a tough interior -- 
seize the spotlight, whether playing the role once filled by Walt Disney in the 
company's public relations campaigns or basking in the adulation of the media. 
</P>
<P>
 But Katzenberg's closest allies argue that Disney's next president doesn't 
have to be in the exact mold of Wells. They say that Katzenberg's keen focus 
and salesmanship could be used to benefit a creative-based company like Disney 
-- which derives most of its revenue from film, video, television, theme parks 
and merchandising. They also point out that others inside the company are 
available to assume the financial management duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Many associates believe that Katzenberg, in lieu of an actual promotion, has 
been quietly grooming himself for broader responsibilities by trading in his 
casual blue jeans and polo shirts for designer suits and spending more time in 
the company of corporate executives. Eisner may have been moving to mollify the 
restless Katzenberg even before Wells' death by having Katzenberg supervise 
Disney's troubled Hollywood Records unit, its burgeoning interactive division 
and its extremely successful foray into legitimate theater, "Beauty and the 
Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner acknowledged Katzenberg's achievements and "creative discipline" in his 
interview. But he also said that he wants him to remain focused on the studio 
-- which has been painfully searching for the formula to put the roar back into 
its flagging live-action business. 
</P>
<P>
 As "The Lion King" races toward record-setting returns at the box office and 
beyond, continuing Disney's unprecedented string of success in feature 
animation and driving ancillary business such as merchandising and theme parks, 
its non-animated movies are more like an albatross. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Katzenberg -- the very model of the relentless, modern industry predator, 
fiercely pursuing his prey with a laser-like focus, a steel-trap mind and 
killer drive -- has been unable to break through the morass of such 
forgettable, one-note comedies as "Cabin Boy" and "Holy Matrimony," which have 
dominated Disney's slate for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I've been happier with the animated product. . . . In an area of the 
company where we're not doing well, I'd like to improve it," said Eisner, 
conceding his unhappiness with the studio's live-action movies during the last 
half of his and Katzenberg's 10-year reign at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its problems, Disney remains one of the most profitable studios of all 
time. The filmed entertainment division, which includes TV and video, generated 
$622 million in operating income for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1993, on 
gross revenue of $3.7 billion. And profits have steadily gained over the past 
decade. The division has become a more significant part of Disney's operating 
income. A recent Barron's survey showed that it accounted for 36% of income 
last year, compared to 22% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how he expected Katzenberg to be able to shoulder both new 
responsibilities at the same time he is charged with fixing what is broken at 
the studio, a confident Eisner said, "I know he can do it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, the more critical question becomes what if Katzenberg were to 
be appointed to the presidency of Disney: Would the corporate duties overshadow 
his much-needed expertise at the studio? Those mounting issues will undoubtedly 
add strain to what is already widely observed as a tense relationship between 
Katzenberg and Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 Those close to Katzenberg say he likens his relationship with Eisner to his 
marriage to his wife, Marilyn Siegel, in that both relationships have endured 
the normal ups and downs but they remain deeply committed. Katzenberg likes to 
say, "I've been married to the same woman and the same man for 19 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In his interview, Eisner denied rumors that he and Katzenberg frequently spar, 
saying, "We disagree on occasions . . . we've never had a fight!" Some find 
that hard to believe given their competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's recently departed international president, Bill Mechanic, now 
president of 20th Century Fox, says: "They're perfectionists. They feel that 
with their record of success, they both have something to offer the process. . 
. . They bicker, but there's a basic level of respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Both had something to prove when they came to Disney in 1984 -- Eisner that he 
was capable of running a major corporation after spending his career in TV and 
film, and Katzenberg that he possessed the skill and maturity at age 33 to run 
a major Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Both succeeded beyond expectations by building on Disney's trademark family 
entertainment franchise. In 10 years, Disney rose from a $2 billion a year 
company to an $8 billion a year behemoth with tentacles reaching throughout the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
 It is probably safe to assume that living with such success has made both 
Eisner and Katzenberg hypersensitive to failure. This may be a cyclical 
business in which every studio has its ups and downs, but Disney's live-action 
problems stand in stark contrast to its multibillion-dollar success in feature 
animation. Since Disney is the industry's only brand-name family movie label, 
the company still clings to an image of purity and infallibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally for Katzenberg, who by nature is very controlling about how he is 
publicly perceived, any failure is particularly embarrassing. Privately, people 
close to the studio chief agree that Katzenberg is so personally intertwined 
with his work that it's impossible to separate the two. He lives and breathes 
the business -- rising before dawn to begin his workday, and trading in 
information like a frantic commodities broker. By his very actions, Katzenberg 
lends insight into the inner workings of Hollywood, from what ends up on the 
big screen to the labyrinthine process that gets it there. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-born Katzenberg, son of a Park Avenue stockbroker, can still pass 
for a grad student with his compact, wiry frame, starched preppy clothes and 
hyperactive, Diet Coke-slugging style. His reputation as a spunky, take-charge 
guy goes back to the 1960s, when Katzenberg was a teen-age advance man for New 
York Mayor John Lindsay for seven years. After brief stints as a talent agent 
and producer's assistant, he went to work in 1975 opening mail for Hollywood 
mogul Barry Diller, then the tough New York-based chairman of Paramount 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, Katzenberg, a college dropout, was shipped to Hollywood, 
where he rose through the ranks to become Paramount's president of production 
under Eisner. People still remember Katzenberg's resourcefulness. He once 
managed to get a plane that was already taxiing on the runway to stop and turn 
around and pick up his Paramount bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, Eisner had left Paramount and brought Katzenberg along as studio 
chief. They helped build a nonexistent live-action movie division into a 
successful business during their first five years with a string of comedy hits 
that included "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," "Three Men and a Baby" and "Good 
Morning, Vietnam." The new regime followed an untraditional strategy of putting 
faded stars and TV actors in inexpensive, high-concept projects that were 
hatched in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney evolved from what box-office analyst Art Murphy calls "a half-sized 
major" studio living off a few reissues a year of its animated classics in 1984 
to the No. 1 market share position in 1988 with 18 releases. "Nobody had ever 
done that," Murphy observes. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years, the live-action winning streak that powered the studio's 
growth had all but ended, as Disney refused to keep pace with the escalating 
salary demands of major stars and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one seemed to notice. Because by then Katzenberg, along with animation 
heads Roy Disney and Peter Schneider and a top-drawer team of animators, had 
revived the studio's animation division by creating a new world of icons for 
kids with 1989's "The Little Mermaid," 1991's "Beauty and the Beast," 1992's 
"Aladdin" and now "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of Disney's live-action strategy was a continuing effort to cut 
costs. In 1988, it created Hollywood Pictures to help pump up the volume from 
Touchstone Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures. Ricardo Mestres, a Katzenberg 
protege, was put in charge of the new division, whose mandate was to churn out 
inexpensive high-concept movies for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 That formula subsequently failed at both Hollywood and Touchstone, with a few 
exceptions such as "Joy Luck Club" and "What's Love Got to Do With It." While 
the trademark Disney family label has had modest hits like "Homeward Bound" and 
last year's sleeper "Cool Runnings," it too has had its share of duds, 
including the recent comedy "Blank Check." 
</P>
<P>
 About two months ago, Eisner lost his patience with the continuing dismal 
performance of Hollywood Pictures and ordered Mestres fired. Many industry 
insiders believe that Mestres was the fall guy for the studio's more emblematic 
problem of generally losing touch with its live-action audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner admitted that he absolutely shares responsibility for Disney's problems 
and is personally involved in helping Katzenberg find a solution. "You have to 
allow for failure," he said. "Even if it's a long period of time . . . I can 
deal with this failure and I understand that we have to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, Eisner stressed that even though his studio chief was taking on 
added business responsibilities, he wanted Katzenberg even more involved in the 
details of movie-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was highly publicized criticism of Katzenberg's hands-on 
meddling in creative matters, such as giving extensive script notes to 
filmmakers and deciding what actors should wear on screen, that caused 
Katzenberg to step back and assume a more macro-management role. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two years, he began delegating more to the division heads and 
three months ago put his top lieutenant, David Hoberman, in charge of all three 
movie units so he could concentrate on his broadened mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg no longer signs off on every project in development, but is still 
clearly the final say behind what movies get made.  
</P>
<P>
 Hoberman's promotion, clearly, if not coincidentally, may have come at the 
perfect time for Katzenberg if he is fated to move into the president's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Eisner said he did not want Katzenberg straying too far from the 
creative front lines. When he was in the trenches at Paramount, Katzenberg 
earned the nickname "golden retriever" for his ability to hunt down and deliver 
scripts to his masters faster than anyone in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is still the best golden retriever I ever met," Eisner said three weeks 
ago. "He's the best person to follow through on a project, an idea or slate of 
ideas . . . that is his main attribute." In the early stages of their 
relationship, Eisner says, "I did 100% of the thinking and he was the one to 
get something done." Nowadays, Eisner says Katzenberg "not only gets it done, 
he comes up with the idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Joe Roth, who was chairman of 20th Century Fox before bringing his 
Caravan Pictures to Disney, also praises Katzenberg's "incredible focus of 
energy." Says Roth: "If you need something done, he gets it done." When the 
Hollywood Records' soundtrack to Caravan's upcoming Keenen Ivory Wayans movie 
"Low Down Dirty Shame" needed songs, Katzenberg took pop star Janet Jackson to 
dinner to persuade her to contribute to the album. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his biggest competitor, Warner Bros. Co-Chairman Robert Daly, concedes: 
"Jeffrey is one of the best executives in the movie business." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of Disney's bad rap with talent that's not drawn on cels, Katzenberg 
has always been an irresistible magnet for actors, directors and writers. "When 
Jeffrey gets on the phone and calls talent, they love it. He's absolutely 
seductive," says Jerry Katzman, William Morris Agency president.  
</P>
<P>
 But some say Katzenberg's tenaciousness can also work against him. "Once he 
decides he loves something, whether it's a good idea or bad idea, he gets 
fixated and can be extremely persuasive to get people to do things they don't 
want to do," says one colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 In a business sense, one Hollywood insider points out, "Jeffrey doesn't get 
blinded by his passion -- which is both a tremendous strength and enormous 
weakness because he doesn't gamble. This is such a crapshoot business, I wonder 
if his allegiance to the corporate culture at Disney hasn't sometimes prevented 
him from taking creative chances you need to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg's vow more than a year ago that Disney would release 50-60 movies a 
year, including those that Miramax distributes, also has drawn fire on and off 
the Burbank lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The films start cannibalizing each other in the marketplace," acknowledges a 
Disney executive, to which a producer adds: "When a studio puts out 40 to 60 
movies a year, certain pictures, especially smaller movies, are going to get 
trampled on. It becomes a Friday-night business. If you don't do big business 
on Friday night, by Monday morning's marketing meeting they're moving other 
pictures into your slot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eisner-Katzenberg volume strategy is aimed at building up Disney's 
library, which was small by industry standards when they took over. "Our 
leverage is volume," Eisner explained. "As the industry became content-starved, 
our strength became being a volume company. . . . The question is, how do you 
keep up volume and keep your quality up? Our goal is to keep our volume and 
enhance our quality." 
</P>
<P>
 As much head scratching and rethinking of its low-budget, high-volume 
filmmaking strategy goes on behind the Disney gates, one of the ways Katzenberg 
has already moved to reverse the creative shortfall in live action is by 
diversifying Disney's movie lineup. In the last several years, the studio 
forged deals with key creative producers, including Roth, Andy Vajna (Cinergi 
Productions) and prestigious filmmakers Ismail Merchant and James Ivory 
("Howards End"). Disney's 1993 purchase of scrappy Miramax Films, which 
releases such provocative films as "The Crying Game" and "The Piano," was 
considered a bold and smart move by the historically conservative studio. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Katzenberg has desperately sought to mend fences with 
Hollywood's creative community, given the ill will that was created by Disney's 
notorious tightfisted and controlling ways with talent. High-powered agents 
were particularly irked over Katzenberg's widely leaked 1991 "memo," a 28-page 
scolding of the industry's runaway spending on high-priced stars and scripts 
and Disney's own indiscretions in losing sight of cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they started out, in their initial two or three years they were great 
with talent -- they really took care of them," recalls one high-powered agent. 
"Then Jeffrey started getting hard-line and very combative and he alienated 
everybody in town. The consensus in the community was that Disney was resistant 
to creative freedom. They drove writers and directors nuts. Nobody wanted to 
work there." 
</P>
<P>
 A top Hollywood businessman suggests that Disney's fiscal prudence was 
"ultimately what got them into trouble. Because finally, at the end of the day, 
too many small movies don't add up to anything. They tried to break the star 
system, but they failed." 
</P>
<P>
 But with his usual perseverance and engaging personality, Katzenberg has all 
but willed top talent back under the Disney tent with promises of more freedom 
and even more money in some cases. He has even made amends with the town's most 
powerful agent, Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, who said 
recently that while at one time "Disney was not especially interested in our 
established clients, that's all ancient history now." 
</P>
<P>
 Though still very risk-conscious, Disney is paying market prices in some cases 
and has put out the welcome mat to such directors as Robert Redford (whose 
"Quiz Show" comes out this fall), Tony Scott (soon to shoot the $50-million 
action film "Crimson Tide," with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman), "Home 
Alone" creator John Hughes (who will make the comedy "The Bee") and Mike Newell 
("Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Enchanted April"). 
</P>
<P>
 Redford, whose next movie is also committed to Disney, said that though he had 
heard "all the stories about how Disney brutalized talent, how they kept 'B' 
and 'C' lists (of talent) and were cheap and interfered, I can tell you I'm 
three-quarters of the way through the journey on 'Quiz Show' and my experience 
has been absolutely wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Ovitz, known for his tumultuous relationship with Katzenberg in the past, 
agrees that things have improved. "Jeffrey is a pleasure to do business with," 
the agent said. "He is responsive, accessible and someone who will give you a 
quick answer. I would rather do business with Jeffrey Katzenberg, even if he 
doesn't agree with my point of view, than someone with less knowledge who is 
slower in getting you an answer -- that is death for an agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is sold on the new Katzenberg. While Ovitz and CAA President Ron 
Meyer won't discuss it, one CAA star who still refuses to do repeat business 
with Disney is Robin Williams, who is fuming because he says the studio wrongly 
used his voice as the wisecracking Genie in "Aladdin" to merchandise the film's 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford's experience notwithstanding, another key filmmaker gripes that "the 
creative environment is worse than ever. They squish and squash the creative 
life out of you because they have no insight when it comes to art." 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry skeptics argue that Katzenberg's less controlling stance is 
reserved for the "A" list only and may never trickle down to lower-echelon 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons they had trouble attracting first-class filmmakers is you 
have to give up control and Jeffrey Katzenberg finds that one of the most 
difficult things," observes Marty Bauer, president of talent agency UTA. "But 
as he grows as a human being he's trying to cope with that frailty . . . I 
think it remains to be seen (if he backs off) but that's his intent." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg's cozying up to stars and agents has been another source of tension 
with Eisner. "It was helpful for Herman Melville to give notes to Nathaniel 
Hawthorne," he said. "My note to Jeffrey Katzenberg would have been to ignore 
all these people." Eisner added: "As we become more user-friendly, I feel we've 
become less effective. I would encourage Jeffrey Katzenberg to be more 
detail-oriented. . . . When he was involved in the details and not caring what 
CAA, ICM or the L.A. Times thought, he did it great." 
</P>
<P>
 While it's hard to find anyone in Hollywood who doesn't respect Katzenberg's 
talents, many question his creative instincts for picking live-action movies 
today's audiences want to see. 
</P>
<P>
 A powerful Hollywood lawyer who greatly admires Katzenberg says, "Jeffrey is 
the best executivein the business and he has no taste." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Katzenberg, creating art for art's sake had never been a priority. 
Harvey Weinstein, who along with his brother Bob sold New York-based Miramax to 
Disney 16 months ago, says, "I don't think Jeffrey wants 'Blank Check' to be 
his legacy." Yet Weinstein recalls phoning Katzenberg after seeing the movie to 
ask, "What the hell is this?" Katzenberg's response: "That's about $15 million 
in corporate profits, my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 But Weinstein is quick to defend the studio chief: "I don't think he 
personally has low-brow taste . . . but he's in charge of an operation that has 
to make a lot of money and when you have to pay those kind of bills, you're 
appealing to a different common denominator." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, for his part, recently assured a close associate that Disney's 
commitment to a higher level of quality is real, and that "it's not good enough 
anymore that our films simply make money. They have to have some creative 
reason for being." 
</P>
<P>
 Movies aren't the only thing Katzenberg is reassessing. Some have observed 
that after turning 40 and suffering the loss of several close friends and 
associates, including lyricist Howard Ashman, the studio chief is placing more 
emphasis on his personal life with his wife and their 11-year-old twins, Laura 
and David. The couple now takes yearly Mediterranean cruises. The family has a 
getaway ski house in Deer Valley, Utah, and spends its traditional two weeks 
each Christmas in Hawaii. With their main residence in Beverly Hills, the 
Katzenbergs also have an extravagant beach house in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller, who socializes with Katzenberg, says, "He has the full complement -- 
his wife and his children and his friends. . . . Jeffrey very much has a life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have sensed in Jeffrey a reflectiveness and maturity I didn't see before," 
says high-powered entertainment attorney Ken Ziffren. "He was a bullet shot out 
of a gun, but I'd say he's now more open and more personally vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that Katzenberg ever stops inhaling and exhaling the 
business or has much of a social life outside work. Other than his few close 
friends in the business like music mogul David Geffen and Steven Spielberg, 
Katzenberg doesn't hang out with Hollywood types, unless of course it's 
business, or fun for business sake such as his famous all-boy "raft trips," 
where the guest list includes other studio heads, executives, agents and 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg defies the stereotype in other ways as well. He has no use for the 
screenings and premieres that dominate Hollywood night life. The Disney chief 
regularly attends movies in Westwood and Century City to experience them with 
real audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of sources interviewed for this article remarked on how few people 
really know the personal side of Katzenberg. Even Eisner, who said he probably 
knows him "better than anyone," agreed that his colleague doesn't easily reveal 
himself. Eisner and Katzenberg rarely if ever socialize. "They're not chums -- 
it's strictly business with them," says a longtime friend of both. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg and Spielberg have grown especially close in recent years. After 
collaborating on the 1988 hit "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Spielberg says that he 
and Katzenberg discovered they got along best avoiding the movie business 
altogether. "We haven't talked about movies in three years," Spielberg says. 
"And we became better friends the moment we stopped. A lot of people don't 
believe me when I say Jeffrey can talk for two hours without mentioning film." 
</P>
<P>
 The two movie millionaires went into partnership on a restaurant chain called 
Dive! whose first location recently opened in Century City. Spielberg says the 
business came together after he complained to Katzenberg that there were no 
good submarine sandwiches in L.A. Within a day, Spielberg recalls, Katzenberg 
had arranged a meeting with a Chicago food service company, which turned the 
Dive! concept into reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg's boundless energy, like his hunger, hasn't waned with years. This 
is a guy who doesn't take breaths between bites, who drives like a crazed teen 
who just got his license. He still rises before dawn to work out or just plain 
work, still schedules appointments down to the nanosecond, still reads half a 
dozen scripts a weekend, still lives by to-do lists on little cards, still 
burns up the phone lines (recently calling all 600 people who worked on "The 
Lion King" to personally thank them) and still logs more miles than a flight 
attendant. Legendary for his quirkiness, Katzenberg is so fond of his 
supercharged Mustang convertible that he recently bought and stored one of the 
last of its kind to roll off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 Organization is his religion, control his mantra. Aside from color-coding his 
clothes in his home closets, even his raft trips and corporate retreats are 
"completely scheduled" and punctuated by "forced fun" activities, as one 
participant puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Rifkin, worldwide head of the motion picture division at the William 
Morris Agency, observes that Katzenberg sits at the control panel even in the 
wilds of the Colorado rapids. "Only he knew the arrival time of our 
helicopters. Our exit depended on him. We had no phones, no communications of 
any sort." 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of David Hoberman's recent nuptials, Katzenberg threw a Las Vegas 
bachelor party for a group of his friends, who boarded Disney jets for the 
Mirage Hotel, where they partied in a private suite. During the festivities, 
Katzenberg slipped out for nearly an hour. When asked about his whereabouts, he 
nonchalantly explained that he was meeting with Las Vegas developer Steve Wynn, 
his and Spielberg's Las Vegas partner in Dive! "It suddenly struck us that 
Jeffrey took these fairly influential people to Vegas and parked us in this 
room for 45 minutes!" recalls UTA's Jeremy Zimmer, who said that even 
Katzenberg had a good laugh over it. 
</P>
<P>
 For Katzenberg, already at a personal and professional crossroads, the pivotal 
and unforeseen events of the last 3 1/2 months will force a resolution of his 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The further role of fate aside, it ultimately boils down to what Eisner 
decides to do. Needing to cut down on stress, the convalescing Disney chairman 
may rethink his workaholic ways and be more ready to share the power and the 
pressure that goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, his assessment three weeks ago of his own job and Katzenberg's 
unbridled ambition was perhaps telling if not ironic. "Jeffrey has a better job 
than I do," Eisner said. "He has all the fun stuff."

VOICES / COMMENTARY ON LOCAL ISSUES, VIEWPOINTS OF RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY 
LEADERS, AND LETTERS.: CASTING BREAD ON TROUBLED WATERS; STRUGGLING HOMEBOY 
BAKERY GAVE A FORMER GANG MEMBER A PLACE TO START OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK RANGEL, Rangel was interviewed by Times Staff Writer Kevin Baxter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Frank Rangel, 25, a former hard-core gang member, "making bread" used to be 
a street term that meant hustling money. Now, it means baking loaves of 
pumpernickel and rye at the Homeboy Bakery, next to the Dolores Mission Church 
in East Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The bakery, part of Father Gregory J. Boyle's Jobs for a Future program, pays 
at-risk young people such as Rangel $5 to $7 an hour from money raised through 
sales and from community donations. But the modest salary is just part of what 
the workers take home. "Thanks to Homeboy, I got values now," Rangel says.  
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the bakery was turning out 4,500 loaves of bread a month. Now, 
production has stopped to search for a new oven -- or for the funds to repair 
the old one. If repairs are not started soon, there is a chance the bakery 
could go out of business, just as its sister job-training project, Homeboy 
Tortillas, did. For Rangel and others, that could mean a return to the streets. 
 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not a role model. I'm an example of what a project can do for some 
hard-core inner-city kids if they have the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in the Aliso Village projects. Before, I used to get in a lot of 
trouble with the police. I've lived the hard life. I got busted with a .357 and 
a .44 because I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I wound up pleading 
no contest. Boom, they gave me six months and I only did three. And from there 
I went to probation, and my probation officer got really attached to me. He 
knew that I wasn't a menace to society and that I had potential. He gave me a 
letter of recommendation and I brought it down here. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother and father, they were two different people and they separated. I was 
on my own; I grew up with my aunt. I was the black sheep of the family, moving 
from my mother's side of the family to my dad's side. Everybody thought I 
wouldn't succeed in life. But I was just trying to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Homeboy changed my life a lot. I have values now. I know how to carry 
myself a little better. I've been to Washington and met the President of the 
United States. When Vice President Gore came down here, I met him, too. 
</P>
<P>
 We've got a crew of nine here. We're all from different gangs. If we were on 
the streets, well, we're like the Hatfields and McCoys. We don't get along with 
the guys across the street. But when they come down here, they're our brown 
brothers. Whatever there is out there on the streets, it stops at the gate when 
you come into the business. We're a family here at Homeboy Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a baker. But right now we're remodeling the place, so they got us learning 
several different trades. They got us doing plaster and masonry. They got us 
hitting sledgehammers on the ground and making drains, learning plumbing. They 
got us going on the roof and hammering nails in wood and learning carpentry.  
</P>
<P>
 But my real job here is to school the little guys, try to keep the peace. A 
gang member from 13 to 18, if they don't get the right kind of schooling from 
the guys above, they're not going to fly right. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, they're not telling us to sell ourselves short, to change the way we 
dress or to get out of gangs. They trust us. They respect our ideas here. 
Father Greg gave us the opportunity to make honest money and he really doesn't 
ask for anything. He teaches us not only to respect ourselves but to respect 
our elders. He shows us the important values of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody wants to be running from the police. Nobody wants to be dealing drugs 
all their life. Everybody wants to make an honest living. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I set goals. I'm going up the ladder little by little without skipping a 
step, with a positive mental attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 The priests want to send me to college. I want to study psychology. I want to 
be a psychologist, psychiatrist, something just to let people come and talk to 
me and I can talk to them. My job is to tell these guys there's a different 
place besides the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But first we need money to fix up the place so we can start baking bread. 
Actions speak louder than words and this is a place of action. If they let this 
pass, it will be a big mistake because we see this as an example for all of 
urban Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're going to spend more money for nicer prisons when you could build 
places like this. Why not try to make changes and build places like Homeboy 
Industries? It's a lot cheaper to build a bakery than to build a prison. And 
we're either going to be in prison or in the bakery.

VOICES / COMMENTARY ON LOCAL ISSUES, VIEWPOINTS OF RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY 
LEADERS, AND LETTERS.: SKIES HAVE LIMITS; THE DIRECTOR OF A CITIZENS 
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP IS UNHAPPY WITH CURRENT POLICIES ON POLLUTION. HE THINKS 
ONLY PRESSURE FROM COMMUNITIES ON INDUSTRIES CAN MAKE AN EFFECTIVE DIFFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS PORRAS, Carlos Porras is Southern California director of Citizens for 
a Better Environment. The Venice-based nonprofit group has several urban 
environmental projects under way and is studying air pollution in cities in 
Southeast Los Angeles County. Porras was interviewed by Mike Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southeast Los Angeles project is just getting into second gear. It's a 
multifaceted community organizing campaign to document cu mulative exposure to 
toxics such as chromium, lead and petroleum-based solvents emitted into the air 
by local industry. Apple has given us computer equipment for that research, and 
it will be a big job. Existing regulators won't or haven't addressed cumulative 
exposures. They prefer to deal with site-specific cases and isolate them. 
</P>
<P>
 With regulators, there are certain assessments that take place. If an industry 
falls into a category of a certain level of emissions for a toxic, the Air 
Quality Management District must evaluate what they call a health risk 
assessment. If it is deemed that there is a significant risk, then the company 
must take certain steps. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm pretty down on the AQMD. I've seen the district move from where it thought 
it might be representing public health, but was being pressured by industry's 
economic cries, to complete disregard of any element of public health interest. 
The AQMD is front-running for industry right now because of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD board of governors recently passed a rule, 1402, that defines the 
level of significance for public notification. They set it at 100 added cancers 
per million people exposed. The federal standard and most of the conservative 
agencies out there were defining it at 10 added cancers per million exposed. 
The EPA, the state and some of the more progressive public health-interested 
agencies were defining it at one additional cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Here the AQMD comes up with 100. Industry was willing to settle for 50. Their 
own staff recommended 10. But that board of governors took it on themselves to 
say 100. That's an insult to the people of this region, saying our lives are 
less important by a magnitude of 10 times the national standard. 
</P>
<P>
 It all comes down to community organizing, to put outside pressure on the 
board. Those people are elected officials on other bodies that are appointed to 
this one. That means there's limited accountability. You have to put pressure 
through the elected office they are accountable to, and overall the community 
needs to cry out, saying, "We cannot accept this district operating as it 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies like we're doing in Southeast Los Angeles can help apply the pressure. 
We're interpreting Southeast Los Angeles as a region of eight cities -- Vernon, 
Huntington Park, Florence, Maywood, Bell, Bell Gardens, Walnut Park and Cudahy. 
They're all within what's commonly known as the Alameda Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the most densely industrialized region in the United States. The city of 
Vernon has been documented as the dirtiest ZIP code in the state of California. 
It's a potpourri of industries. There's still some of the steel industry there, 
chemical manufacturers, chemical distributors, the largest lead battery 
recycler on the West Coast. Ironically, with all of those, there are more and 
more food companies. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of our outreach, we'll have community meetings where we give people 
information about the hazards around them, and tell them what the vehicles for 
intervention are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our argument is that regulators aren't using a true picture of the health risk 
to the community when they take a company in isolation of anything else that 
might be there. We say the community is impacted by the cumulative total of all 
exposures. That is a debate the regulators have avoided until now. We need to 
back that up with empirical data. 
</P>
<P>
 There are models of coexistence. Just recently we negotiated a settlement with 
Chevron in Richmond, Calif., that means the company will be investing $6 
million over the next five years into the community. They'll do outreach to 
educate the community about the effects of the emissions from the refinery and 
do a mentoring program in the schools and have some medical outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the resistance of industry comes from a philosophical perspective 
rather than a problem-solving perspective. They're afraid of being marginalized 
in their profitability and are not really open yet to a partnership with the 
communities they exist in. They draw on the community for labor and sometimes 
for natural resources. Our argument is that it should be a partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The urban environmental movement is definitely growing from the ground up. 
That's the only way it's going to work. You can write regulations and policy 
all day long and it's not going to change anything until there's community 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The most disenfranchised and the most disempowered are usually the ones that 
pay the burden. Those are the ones you have to help. I believe in Jimmy Hoffa's 
model. You float the boat from the bottom up. Contradictory to trickle-down 
economics, you've got to start at the bottom. If the bottom rises, the top 
rises with it. That's what we've got to focus on as a community, rather than 
let ourselves be divided along lines of immigrant issues, welfare issues, 
color, religion, nationalism.

MOVIES; TAKING THE REINS FOR THE FIRST TIME; SCREENWRITER CAROLINE THOMPSON 
PARLAYED HER TRACK RECORD IN HOLLYWOOD AND HER LOVE OF HORSES TO BECOME THE 
DIRECTOR OF 'BLACK BEAUTY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, Lawrence Christon is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caroline Thompson's career so far has been a tribute to the efficacy of 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster in Bethesda, Md., she longed to be a child of the '20s, that 
delirious decade of the flapper, the frat boy and the tubful of gin; the Jazz 
Age of all-night revels from which someone would extricate himself Gatsby-like 
to step out for a breath of air and realize he'd been partying with a lost 
generation, separated from the old world by the Great War, and saturated with 
romantic yearnings toward the unknown, clamorous new. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other longing was to come to California, whose soft air, sensual shoreline 
and jasmine-scented nights gave credence to the myth that the place was once 
idyllic home to a glorious tribe of Amazons at rest and play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an odd expression of America, where fantasy and self-invention can be 
realized," Thompson says. "The freedom of the '20s was for girls to be able to 
take off most of the 19 pounds of underwear they had to wear before the decade 
began. In California, you were free of the past, free to undertake whatever it 
is you wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And she wanted a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 The object of her first longing was of course unobtainable -- Thompson was 
born in the '50s. And the calamities of California life, both human and 
natural, have been enough to lacerate anyone's Arcadian fantasies -- although 
she has lived in Southern California for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But eventually she did buy a horse, and became, as best she could, a full-time 
horsewoman -- so knowledgeable about the world of horses that when Warner Bros. 
-- which had been impressed with her scripts for "Edward Scissorhands," 
"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" and "The Secret Garden" -- asked her 
to do the screen adaptation of Anna Sewell's 1877 children's classic, "Black 
Beauty," Thompson said, "Yes, but I'd like to direct it too." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I meant to be opportunistic," Thompson recalls about the film, 
which opens Friday. "But because I know horses and love them, I didn't want 
anyone else to film a story who didn't know how to work with them. It took 
Warners a while to make up their minds, but eventually they agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 For a major studio to run with a first-timer who's never even shot a student 
film is risky business, but a number of elements combine in Thompson that make 
her more than someone lucky enough to indulge a hobby. As a student of Greek 
literature at Amherst College, she had to have realized how far back men and 
horses go -- far enough to a storied time when they were merged in the body of 
the centaur, and later became indispensable counterparts of knight and cowboy. 
They still exert a mythic pull. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no more aesthetically perfect being," Thompson says. "They're an 
embodiment of otherness, but not only do they tolerate us, they're generous to 
us. They're willing to work with us. What's most astonishing is that when 
you're riding a horse, it wants to dance. It's like the tango, a form of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say they're stupid animals. I don't know about that. One day I was 
riding my horse at Griffith Park. He stopped on the path and wouldn't go around 
a corner. I had to force him. Then I saw the flasher, waiting to do his thing. 
These animals have senses we don't have. They have a coded language; they're 
always testing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on her patio, she takes a drag on a cigarette and glances over toward 
Merrylegs, a white Welsh-Shetland pony who peers back curiously between the 
rails of a small outdoor pen. Merrylegs appears in the movie, gamboling through 
the woods with Black Beauty and his high-spirited girlfriend, Ginger. "He's 
getting fat," she observes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, 38, hasn't taken the earnings from her run of successes (six films 
since 1990) to pour into one of those leafy Westside duchies favored by the 
industry's well-to-do. Instead she lives in a relatively small, unpretentious 
old-style hacienda near the Griffith Park stables, where the thin relentless 
wail of freeway traffic sounds nearby. The house is L-shaped, and strongly 
encourages the eye outdoors to its cluttered garden, which includes a giant 
topiary horse, a souvenir of "Edward Scissorhands," rearing beside a fountain 
overrun with vines.  
</P>
<P>
 "Girlish" isn't an adjective that would sit well with Thompson, who's direct 
and unaffected, doesn't wear makeup and walks with a purposeful stride. But her 
pale skin and inverted bowl of dark hair evoke the moppet she must have been as 
a kid, and the lightness in her handshake suggests a construction of bone 
china. A man's plaid buttoned shirt and dark pants don't conceal the length and 
delicacy of her frame -- nor the muscles of hips and thighs built up from years 
of guiding a half-ton or more of horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to honor what ("Black Beauty") made me feel as a child," she says. 
"Anna Sewell was a lifelong cripple who had to be pulled around in a cart -- 
she lived near Bath. She was a spinster, as they used to say. Told one day that 
she had 18 months to live, she decided to write a thank-you note to the horse 
who pulled her. It took her six years. She died shortly after the book came 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only was it popular, it changed a lot of laws regarding horses. It did 
away with the bearing rein," a carriage strap that yanks a horse's head 
painfully and unnaturally high. "It led to water troughs put out for horses, 
and rest homes. It made people realize that the horse is not a mechanical 
object, like a car or a tractor -- it's a creature with feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Beauty," the story of a horse born into an idyllic manor life and then 
cast into the Dickensian brutality of Victorian London, where he appears left 
for dead, has had two other film incarnations. One was in the United States in 
1946, and the other in Great Britain in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's version comes straight from the book -- and the horse's point of 
view. If anthropomorphizing a horse takes away from its sizable mystery ("Mine 
is a story of trust and betrayal and learning to trust again," Beauty says at 
the beginning, in Alan Cummings' narrative voice), Thompson gives Black Beauty 
less and less to say as time goes by so that we're closer to feeling the 
horse's experience instead of hearing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 And in several instances, she suspends the plot for no other reason than to 
show horses running for the pure joy of it. "I got to express something I've 
loved for a long time. Think how seldom that gets to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 As for directing -- the film world's version of assuming a throne, or at least 
earning the rank of field general -- she took a course that was diplomatic and 
no-nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest mistake you can make in this instance is thinking you 
know someone else's job," Thompson says. "If I didn't know what lens to use in 
a particular situation, I could convey the feeling I wanted, so that determined 
the shot list. Claire Simpson, my film editor, won an Academy Award for 
'Platoon.' John Box, the production designer, is 80 -- he worked with David 
Lean and won four Oscars. These people don't need anyone to tell them their 
jobs. I also got a cast of some dream people." 
</P>
<P>
 They include Sean Bean, David Thewlis, Jim Carter, Peter Davison, Andrew 
Knott, Alun Armstrong, John McEnery, Peter Cook, and Eleanor Bron -- an 
all-British roster in a wholly English shoot -- which Thompson considers 
immeasurably helpful in her instance, as well as top animal trainer Rex 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the only movie being shot at Pinewood (Studios) last summer. The 
actors really wanted to work. The didn't say 'Eeeeww, this is a kid's movie!' 
They didn't resent playing second fiddle to a horse. A lot of these people came 
from the Royal Shakespeare Company, but they don't have attitude. I don't know 
that this could've been done here." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ethereal nature of her work and her absence of a directorial track 
record, Thompson was no pushover on the set, and draws high marks for keeping 
everyone energized and focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the studio felt there was no one better to direct," says producer 
Peter MacGregor-Scott, who last worked on "The Fugitive." "Everything she's 
written has been made; she's a lover of horses and an accomplished rider. In 
England, movie-making is much more of a craft. She had experienced hands around 
her, a very solid cast and crew. But it was clear from the beginning that she 
had the vision. The picture was in her head. She's got a lot of energy and 
fortitude." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a lot tougher than she looks, or else she wouldn't be able to make it 
in this cutthroat business," says actor David Thewlis ("Naked"), speaking on 
the phone from Wales, where he's making "Restoration." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she was very brave to take on a complicated work that involved 
animals and children. But she really held it together on the set. She's good 
for an actor. She gives detailed, specific direction. There's not a lot of 
vague discussion. In my limited experience of Hollywood, she struck me as not 
someone superficial. She's got a good sense of humor. She's easy to be with. We 
all had a lot of trust in Caroline." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson has a mixed attitude, part sanguine, part dread, toward directing. "I 
loved being able to follow through on a script, which you normally can't do as 
a writer," she says. "I do want to do it again, but not always. The metaphor 
you always hear about it is war. That's true. I liked the responsibility and I 
think it helped that I don't care to be lied to; I don't like people telling me 
what they think I like to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can see how it developed as a male environment. No female would've 
invented it. A female would've made sure to create more reflective time." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that may have helped Thompson is that, unlike a lot of 
industry types feverishly aspiring to be players, she isn't tapped into 
Hollywood's underground cable of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "For reasons I can't quite understand, I never operate out of fear," she says. 
A lot of that may have to do with a solidly traditional East Coast upbringing 
in a house that had been in the family for 80 years. Her father is a Washington 
lawyer and her mother teaches kids with learning disabilities. Thompson has an 
older brother who's an investment banker in Hong Kong and an older sister who 
is a doctor. She even went to the same Episcopal high school as her mother and 
sister ("a wonderful school, which had the daughters of a lot of congressmen 
and diplomats"). 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson remembers herself as a bookish kid who wanted to write, and took her 
practical-minded father's advice, to pursue journalism. She interned for the 
Los Angeles Times her high school senior year, but never saw her life in the 
news business. "Editors always thought they were being objective," she says. "I 
could never convince them that they were as subjective as everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 A brief period at Radcliffe followed, in which she grew impatient with 
classmates "impressed with themselves for getting into Harvard," and finished 
up a happier academic career at Amherst. In 1983 she wrote and published "First 
Born," which she terms "an odd, adolescent novel." It was optioned by filmmaker 
Penelope Spheeris, for $1, if Spheeris would let Thompson write the screenplay, 
an irresistible offer if ever there was one. The film was never made, but 
Thompson found her calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with the screenwriting form. It's as specific as a sonnet. I 
trust my instinct, which is smart or stupid, depending on how it turns out."  
</P>
<P>
 "Serendipity" is what Thompson calls her success, but by any other name it's 
been notable. Three of her movies came out last year, and she's at work on a 
ghost story -- set, naturally, in the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling a little arid right now," she says, suddenly looking a bit 
downcast. "Maybe it's just finishing the film." She peered at a sheet of paper. 
"A friend sent me this: 'Desiderata.' Taken from the Paulist monks 300 years 
ago. It really says it, doesn't it? 'Many fears are born of fatigue and 
loneliness.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She looks up. "I do have one fear -- that I won't know when my time is over. I 
hope I know when it's happened, and can come and go at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an odd confession. But perhaps the thing that has infused her best work 
so far is the knowledge that what is most precious is most perishable as well.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: PENTAGON A 'NO GO' ON VIET 
MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS

<TEXT>
<P>
 James Webb has long dreamed of making a movie based on his 1978 novel, "Fields 
of Fire," a gritty portrayal of Marines in combat during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the former Navy secretary has won support for his film project from 
the Marine Corps and even the current communist government of Vietnam, the U.S. 
Defense Department has turned thumbs down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ironic as hell," said Webb, a Marine rifle platoon leader in 
Vietnam who was wounded twice and won the Navy Cross and two Bronze Star medals 
for heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said Vietnamese officials have given him permission to film in the Quang 
Nam province west of Da Nang, in an area called the An Hoa basin where half of 
the Marines died in Vietnam combat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to shoot it right on the same terrain where we fought," Webb said 
in a phone interview from Arlington, Va., adding that he hopes filming can 
start in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought them a script translated into Vietnamese," he recalled. "They 
reviewed it in Hanoi, in Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) and in the district 
where we will film and they all supported it. It is not a political script." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Webb took a three-month trip to Vietnam and came away with a 
Vietnamese partner assigned to his production. "It's taken us a year-and-a-half 
of negotiations to do this," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he is seeking a domestic distributor for "Fields of Fire." He said 
the dismal box-office showing of "Heaven and Earth," Oliver Stone's latest 
Vietnam movie, "blew the bottom out of the market for foreign pre-sale deals." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb's agent, Guy McElwaine of ICM, has been showing the script to a select 
group of directors in Hollywood hoping to have one in place by September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go to a distributor until I have a director," he said. "What 
I'm trying to do is put it together with a major filmmaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he already has lead financing from Greg Carr, the chairman of Boston 
Technologies, which has allowed him to scout locations and begin casting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm also talking with two potential financing sources in New York to see if I 
can get $5 million in equity, which I can then leverage and do an independent 
production," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said a key reason he wanted help from the Defense Department was to 
obtain equipment and trained manpower to make the war scenes look authentic. As 
an example, he cited the H-46 helicopter, which is unique to the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only 11 H-46 helicopters in the entire world outside of the Corps," 
Webb said. "They are all owned by one company. . . . If the DOD doesn't give us 
cooperation, then we'll figure out a way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fields of Fire" tells the story of a Marine platoon making its way through 
Vietnam's rice paddies and jungles. To bolster its realism, the book includes 
scenes of fragging, use of illegal drugs, executions of suspected Viet Cong and 
the burning of a villager's hut. The Marine Corps has made it recommended 
reading in the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Commandant Gen. C. E. Mundy Jr. wrote Webb last year that the Marine Corps had 
no objections to the screenplay and was ready to "work with you where we can 
with Marines and equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is a labor of love for you -- love of your Corps, your country 
and your fellow Marines," Mundy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a subsequent letter dated Dec. 15, the Pentagon's senior liaison to 
Hollywood told Webb that the Defense Department was rejecting Mundy's 
recommendation over concerns that illegal activities depicted in the script 
"will obscure the acts of bravery and dedication that the Marines displayed 
throughout the war in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 "In 'Fields of Fire,' only the killing of the suspected Viet Cong is 
investigated, after overcoming the great reluctance of the regimental legal 
officer," wrote Phil Strub. 
</P>
<P>
 "The script would have to be changed to reflect that the vast majority of 
military personnel actively and effectively support the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice," Strub's letter continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said that he was "flabbergasted" and wrote back, saying he took "deep 
exception" to Strub's characterization of the script. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to me that what you are really saying is that when it comes to 
Vietnam, (the Defense Department) will support only sterile documentaries, or 
feature films that amount to nothing more than dishonest propaganda," Webb 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Marines considered Webb's novel a "faithful depiction of the horrors 
of war," Strub said, the Pentagon felt that in a movie "one can't bring to the 
viewing experience in a theater the same kind of nuance and context" as in a 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Pentagon provides military installations and equipment for a film, 
it requires producers to submit a script. Whichever branch of the service will 
be needed studies the script and decides if (a) it will promote recruitment and 
retention in the ranks and (b) whether it educates the public about the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 Using these criteria, the Pentagon has helped out on such films as "Top Gun" 
because it portrayed Navy fighter pilots in a positive way, but rejected "Iron 
Eagle" because it left the impression that an Air Force pilot would steal a 
plane and conduct a non-sanctioned raid on another country.

ON LOCATION; SEX, DRUGS, PICK AND ROLL; JIM CARROLL'S CULT FAVORITE 'THE 
BASKETBALL DIARIES' IS FINALLY MAKING IT TO THE SCREEN. IT SEEMS EVERYONE 
WANTED TO STAR. LEONARDO DICAPRIO MADE THE CUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Matt Dillon wanted this movie. Anthony Michael Hall, Eric Stoltz, Ethan Hawke, 
Stephen Dorff -- and River Phoenix, who may have wanted it too much. It's 
perfect for any ambitious, talented young star who can play conflicted, 
charming and doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is "The Basketball Diaries" and the star is Leonardo DiCaprio. 
</P>
<P>
 It's based on Jim Carroll's 1978 book of the same name -- a memoir of the 
43-year-old poet and subculture hero's days as a New York teen-age hoop prodigy 
and heroin addict. The book has been optioned many times, but either the 
project was wrong or the political climate was. Now with heroin, for better or 
worse, hot and basketball extremely cool, Island Pictures has lured DiCaprio 
and Mark Wahlberg (a.k.a. Marky Mark) and hired a first-time director to film 
Carroll's visceral cautionary tale in and around the streets of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 In the musty, echoing gym of Forest Hills High in Queens, Leo, as his friends 
know him, playing Carroll, is driving up court, Steadicam following alongside. 
He puts the basketball between his legs and passes to Wahlberg, who lifts the 
ball with both hands behind his head and scores a perfect layup. A bleacher 
full of teen-age extras goes wild. Wahlberg contorts his face into a victory 
scowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hooooo!" he exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 DiCaprio smiles. They bump chests amicably. 
</P>
<P>
 A loud bzzzzzzz signals that the shot is over. "Beautiful," says Scott 
Kalvert, the director. It's the second day of shooting here. Doing a period 
movie would have cost too much, so everyone looks like '90s New York kids: 
black hair, white skin, baggy jeans. Forest Hills High is Kalvert's alma mater. 
"I think they've still got my picture and prison number on the wall," he jokes. 
Did he play basketball? "No. I did the drugs, though." 
</P>
<P>
 It's cold in Bruno Kirby's trailer. The heat's not working. A guy keeps trying 
to fix it. "No problem," says the mild-mannered Kirby, who is discussing his 
character, Swifty, the perverted coach of Jim Carroll's scrappy boy's club 
team. The guy's real name was Lefty, but all names except Jim Carroll's have 
been changed for the movie to avoid lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "NAMBLA," Kirby says, referring to the National Man-Boy Love Assn. "Are you 
familiar with this organization? It's quite scary, really." Asked how he feels 
about playing a pedophile, Kirby demurs. "I don't really play villains," he 
explains. "I play people with problems." Yes, well, Swifty's "problem" is that 
he doesn't just want to coach the pretty young men on his team, he wants to 
molest them. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just one of the squalid little details from Carroll's bizarre youth. 
"The Basketball Diaries" appeared in book form in 1978, but he'd been 
publishing pieces of it in downtown New York literary magazines since the 
1960s, when he was still a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 When he wasn't doing drugs or playing ball, he was hanging out around 
Greenwich Village and the St. Mark's Place poetry scene. He made himself known 
to Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso, but preferred Randall Jarrell to the 
Beats. (He still publishes poetry, including a volume for Penguin called "Fear 
of Dreaming," out this year.) In 1980, he branched out into rock, recording 
"Catholic Boy," an album of spare rock 'n' roll and streetwise lyrics that 
included "People Who Died." He was more of a punk than a hippie and for a 
while, Carroll was the punk movement's Lou Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 For all these reasons, the book has always had a cult following. When MTV 
asked River Phoenix what he wanted to do after being nominated for an Oscar for 
"Running on Empty," he pulled a battered paperback "Basketball Diaries" out of 
his pocket and said, "I want to play Jim Carroll." 
</P>
<P>
 DiCaprio never met Phoenix, but saw him at a party in Los Angeles the night he 
died, a face in the crowd. "I said, 'Was that River Phoenix?' And then he was 
gone," DiCaprio recalls. "It was kinda creepy." 
</P>
<P>
 It's warm in DiCaprio's trailer. This is a low-budget movie: $4 million, 
according to producer Liz Heller. Maybe only the star gets heat. He's sitting 
around in jeans and a hooded sweatshirt. He's 5-foot-11 but doesn't look it 
because he's so skinny -- a male Kate Moss. He's an OK basketball player, not 
amazing. And he looks a little like the young Jim Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Between takes, he's watching a pay-per-view event called something like "The 
Ultimate Guy Fight to the Death," in which he-men from around the world battle 
in a no-rules Thunderdome until bones break or someone says "Uncle." 
</P>
<P>
 DiCaprio does not want it mentioned that he was watching this festival of 
ultra-violence. Or that he was smoking. That would be bad example for his young 
fans. The teen-idol star of "This Boy's Life," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" 
and next year's "The Quick and the Dead" would rather keep his sins to himself. 
But he says he had no qualms about playing a kid junkie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just gonna do the films that I'm gonna do," he says. His voice is flat, 
affectless, Californian. A cold has made it raspier. He pops vitamin C tablets 
into his mouth like popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't always think of public perception, because if you get caught up in, 
'Oh, he's a depressing actor. He just does dark films,' you get locked into one 
thing," he says. "You should just do everything, all types of different 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 DiCaprio has been enjoying New York to the fullest since he got here in early 
spring. Tabloid gossip columns have reported numerous club sightings of him 
with Wahlberg and Kalvert. Asked if his research of the Jim Carroll experience 
has extended to experimentation with drugs (a persistent rumor), he says no, 
and his voice rises in astonishment at the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to this guy, I'm so clean, man, it's ridiculous," he says. "I swear 
-- and I wouldn't just say this for an interview -- but I don't do any of those 
drugs. It's just acting for me. People said, 'Why don't you try it for the 
movie?' and that's just so lame, you know? You do drugs like that and it gives 
you an excuse to do them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the title, "The Basketball Diaries" isn't really about basketball. 
It's three years, age 13 to 16, in the life of an all-city athlete who at 
6-feet-1 can dunk the ball backward and score 40 points in a game while doing 
almost every drug known to man. But with each successive diary entry, ball 
playing is replaced by drug playing. By the end of the book, all that's left 
for Carroll's keen intelligence and writer's eye to observe is his own life 
going down the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a coming-of-age tale," says Kalvert. "Like 'Catcher in the Rye.' " 
</P>
<P>
 More like "The Catcher in the Rye" through the rheumy eyes of William 
Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Kalvert's first feature. His resume so far consists of music videos 
for Will Smith, Cyndi Lauper and Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. It's also the 
first produced screenplay for the writer, Bryan Goluboff. Kalvert is 30, 
Goluboff 27. Both are total Carroll groupies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to follow Jim around in the Village when I was 14 years old," says 
Goluboff. Kalvert read the book at 18 and says he "lent it to everyone I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Sex and drugs are all over the "Diaries." Carroll turns to prostitution to pay 
for his habit. Karen Akers, a New York cabaret singer, turned down a cameo in 
the film when told what the scene entailed: whips, razor blades, cruelty to 
cats. The worst has been toned down, say the producer and director. The last 
thing they want in a film starring teen idols is an NC-17 rating. So while 
moviegoers may not actually see DiCaprio stick the needle in his vein, they'll 
see its evil effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toward the end of the movie, when you see some of the stuff that goes down -- 
the prostitution, stealing from his mother (played by Lorraine Bracco) -- it's 
not pretty. People aren't gonna say, 'Wow, I want to do drugs.' It's 
sickening." 
</P>
<P>
 The producers hired an ex-addict as a "drug consultant" to ensure 
authenticity. A genius at mimicry, DiCaprio can slip effortlessly into junkie 
mode. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voice: you go down an octave. Even when you raise your voice it's like 
you got this frog in your throat," he says, as if teaching an acting lesson. 
"It's not necessarily being tired and it's not necessarily like being drunk. 
It's sort of like your body becomes jelly and all your bones and everything 
become completely relaxed. You just feel at peace. Supposedly. I don't know. 
I've never done it. Right?" He laughs nervously. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later: another day of shooting, this time at St. Agnes Cathedral on 
East 12th Street in the Village. It's a funeral for Jim's friend Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The real Jim Carroll is sitting in the balcony, high above and removed from 
the action below. He looks like someone you'd see in a bus station. Long 
straight red hair, thinning at the temples, pulled back in a ponytail that 
hangs halfway down his back. Old jeans (he's still lean). Old red-and-white 
leather Converse high tops-basketball shoes. Plaid shirt over a T-shirt, 
grunge-style. A baseball cap that says "NBA Jam Session." 
</P>
<P>
 "When they first told me it was gonna be Leo, I didn't know who he was," 
Carroll says in his amused way. "If they'd said the kid from 'Growing Pains,' I 
would have known, because when I first saw that kid, I said, 'This kid has a 
lot of presence.' I said, 'That kid is very pretty. He's gonna do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Who knew Jim Carroll watched "Growing Pains"? 
</P>
<P>
 When Carroll talks, he rarely looks you in the eye. He fixates on 
middle-distance objects and launches into long rambling bits of autobiography. 
His digressions seem like tangents, but they always come back to the point. His 
voice is nasal, New York-accented, with a slight lisp. He's been clean since 
1975, but he still talks like Dennis Hopper in "Apocalypse Now" -- a hipster 
junkie rap with lots of exclamatory "wows" and "mans." He also uses words like 
eschew and baroque -- correctly -- and has a memory like flypaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll told DiCaprio about how they used to use eyedroppers instead of 
syringes to boot the heroin, about how he never got nauseous but would 
sometimes sneeze for nine hours straight, about how even when he was straight 
he used to "trance out" so much he was lost in thought that they called him 
"Dazey." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he's sick of being known as the "Basketball Diaries" guy for the last 
20 years, the fact that they're making this movie, he says, "just makes me want 
to work harder on something new." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wahlberg is sitting on a stoop next to the cathedral. He's in a geeky 
white shirt buttoned to the top and gray church pants. His hair is a goofy 
short bowl cut. The first thing he says, in his thick Boston street brogue, is 
"You wanna heah my impression of Jim?" Then he does it: 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing with Mawky is he's got such a name and I figure, Wow, I 
can't have him in this movie! But gettin' back to the first time I smoked a 
bag, Wow, I muthta been 13 years old. Leo's great. Leo's fabulous. He just 
plays bathketball a little differently." 
</P>
<P>
 He's got it down. Who knew Marky Mark had a sense of humor? 
</P>
<P>
 Wahlberg, who appeared earlier this summer in Penny Marshall's "Renaissance 
Man," read six times for the part of Herbie, Jim's toughest buddy in "The 
Basketball Diaries." "I felt the character in a lot of ways," he says. "I 
wasn't strung out on heroin but I was doing what I had to do, you know what I'm 
saying? It was more about money for us than getting high." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the difference between Wahlberg and DiCaprio. Wahlberg, 24, has the 
wary humility of a guy who's been spanked by stardom. DiCaprio, a cocky 19, 
acts like he thinks his star is always going to be on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 DiCaprio wanders over from his trailer. He and Wahlberg talk trash at each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's up?" says DiCaprio, "You sayin' good things about me? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, whaddya kiddin' me?" says Wahlberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I have a cigarette?" says DiCaprio. Then he remembers there's a reporter 
watching. "Oh yeah," he says. "I don't smoke."

WHO'S HOT; EX-FIREFIGHTER SETS OFF RAP INFERNO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DENNIS HUNT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coolio, the Compton rapper whose "Fantastic Voyage" is the nation's No. 1 
single, jokes that his life has been something of a fantastic voyage itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been up, down . . . this way, that way . . . every which way," he quips 
wearily. "Sometimes I still don't know how I got where I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Where he is right now, thanks to the hit single, is reigning over the rap 
community, with "It Takes a Thief," his album of glib, comical, funky, 
gangsta-fringe songs that was just released by Tommy Boy Records. (See review, 
Page 65.)  
</P>
<P>
 Where he has been is in depths of the drug scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to the mid-'80s, I was into cocaine," he recalls with hardly an emotion. 
"I was a wild man then -- real crazy. I had a reputation for doing crazy things 
-- like hitting people over the head with bottles and stuff like that. That 
happens when you grow up in Compton . . . you survive how you can. Drugs are 
just one of the pitfalls. I fell in . . . deep." 
</P>
<P>
 But he dug his way out and in the process became probably the only star rapper 
to ever have been a firefighter -- working for crews in the San Jose area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't looking for a career, I was looking for a way to clean up -- a way 
to escape the drug thing," he explains. "It was going to kill me and I knew I 
had to stop. In firefighting training was discipline I needed. We ran every 
day. I wasn't drinking or smoking or doing the stuff I usually did." 
</P>
<P>
 Coolio, whose real name is Artis Ivey, proudly says he has been drug-free for 
about eight years. When he quit the dope scene, he resumed his rap career, 
which began in the early '80s. "The first time I really tried to rap, I was 
about 15," recalls Coolio, at 31 one of the oldest of the major rappers. "I 
wrote a rap in about 15 minutes. It sounded good. It was natural for me because 
I used to write poetry and short stories." 
</P>
<P>
 He slowly built a name in the local underground over the years with songs like 
"You're Gonna Miss Me" and two albums recorded with a group called MAAD Circle. 
He was long considered one of the top rappers in Southern California. The 
consensus was that, with a major label, he'd become a star. After some record 
deals went sour, he finally scored last year, signing with Tommy Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 He refers to his first solo album, "It Takes a Thief," which was largely 
produced by his pal Wino, as autobiographical because it draws so heavily on 
his own life. For instance, the grimly comical "County Line," about being on 
welfare, isn't some fiction. "I've been there," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining what separates him from the rap pack, Coolio says, "I try to be 
real in my raps and try to enlighten people with humor and observations about 
life. Commercialism is sucking the life out of rap and I stay away from it as 
much as I can. You can't stay away from it completely because this is a 
business, but you can avoid some of that real ugly, obvious commercial stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The single, "Fantastic Voyage," launched his mainstream career, partly 
riveting fans because it's based on a 1981 hit by Lakeside -- one of the 
biggest funk groups of that era -- and partly because it's a cozy trip to a 
fantasy land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I create this world where everything is safe and people are living well and 
it doesn't matter if you're black or white," says Coolio, who still lives in 
Compton. "I use the lyrical structure of the Staple Singers' 'I'll Take You 
There.' In a way I'm telling everybody I'll take you there -- to that place. 
People like to hear that."

 "Everything is in place for the greatest weekend of peace and music in 25 
years."  
</P>
<P>
 -- John Roberts, "Woodstock '94" organizer 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "Woodstock '94" commercial flashes on MTV between Janet Jackson and Snoop 
Doggy Dogg videos. A carefree teen skips through a green field, rambling on 
about how his friend's dad is taking his psychedelic bus to "Woodstock '94," 
and how he and his friend are going too, for the convergence of generations. 
</P>
<P>
 His generic baggy wear flops around with all of his clumsy moves, while a list 
of bands playing at next month's festival -- which still uses the dove and 
guitar logo, but now says "two more days of peace" -- scrolls by in groovy 
script on the bottom of the screen. The commercial is capped by the fleeting 
words "Sponsored by Pepsi and Nike." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, the next commercial on MTV is Oliver Stone hawking a Macintosh 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The '60s are alive -- and more bloated and self-important than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the 25th anniversary of Woodstock and no one's gonna let us forget it -- 
even to the point of pushing it on a generation 30 years removed. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, contemporary groups such as Nine Inch Nails, the Rollins 
Band and Metallica will play the same stage with some of Woodstock's original 
artists, including Crosby, Stills & Nash, Joe Cocker and Santana. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dylan will even grace the weekend for that extra blast of nostalgia, maybe 
following the power-punk sounds of upstarts Green Day. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt there will also be speeches about all the breakthroughs made in the 
'60s -- and how members of my generation and others could be just as great if 
they'd try hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't the original Woodstock the brainchild of '60s youth -- something that 
their Pat Boone-weaned parents couldn't touch, let alone understand? 
</P>
<P>
 Rock 'n' roll isn't about celebrating someone else's generation or bonding 
with your parents. It's about defining your differences and discovering things 
for yourself instead of being coerced into recycling the old. It's about 
voicing your feelings, the feelings of your generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt by "Woodstock '94" to merge the generations is intrusive, not to 
mention self-righteous. Why would anyone assume that young people today want, 
or should have to live, in the glory of a bygone era? 
</P>
<P>
 The '60s -- with all its naive ideas -- are shoved down our throats like 
spinach. It's good for you! I hope I'm not shoving Nirvana and the wondrous 
rebellion of hard-core punk down my kids' throats when I'm 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the Woodstock generation -- or, more to the point, the "Woodstock '94" 
organizers -- forgotten how it felt to shut the door and blast Hendrix? It was 
something that was all their own -- a sanctuary from the adult world that 
pissed them off so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lollapalooza" is the Woodstock of the '90s, minus the nauseating nostalgia. 
It's a show most parents would not want to attend. This is a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sweltering early July heat of "Lollapalooza '94's" opening show in Las 
Vegas, 17-year-old fan Rebekah Pfeifer sat with her friends on a quilted 
blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it here 'cause there's just young people and no hippies," she said 
while adjusting her oversized trousers. "I was thinking about going to 
Woodstock, but I went to a (Grateful) Dead show recently and knew Woodstock 
would be just as big of a commercial farce. 'Lollapalooza' is commercial too, 
but it doesn't pretend to be something else. This is for my generation, my 
peers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lollapalooza," now in its fourth year, is the baby of eccentric and edgy 
artist-musician Perry Farrell. He spent his teens and 20s in the more 
experimental side of punk rock with the bands Psi-Com and Jane's Addiction. His 
idea now with "Lollapalooza" is to offer all sorts of different sounds from 
today, and some seminal contributors from the past. It's a chance for young 
people to get together, without the influence of adults, and formulate their 
own thoughts, or maybe just have fun -- their own way. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing revival of the '60s may be clad in bell-bottoms and good 
intentions, but in 1994 it's ultimately the antithesis of the original radical 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it time for the dazed and confused '70s generation to rise up and brag 
about what a great group KC & the Sunshine Band was or preach how the 
introduction of sparkling rayon was a revolution for dance floors everywhere? 
</P>
<P>
 What's gonna happen if someday I want to brag about the hard-core punk scene 
from the mid-'80s? Will there be room, or will the greatness of the Beatles, or 
the wonderful mindset of the Woodstock Generation forever overshadow it? 
</P>
<P>
 Let the '60s grow old gracefully and move over. There's a backup of 
generations waiting to get by.

SUSPECT MAY HAVE HAD HELP HIDING CORPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Investigators believe that John J. Famalaro acted alone when he allegedly 
abducted and killed Denise Huber, yet authorities said Saturday that they have 
not dismissed the likelihood that Famalaro had help hiding her body for more 
than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there are no signs of an accomplice, but we can't rule out the 
possibility that someone may have knowingly helped him hide the body 
afterward," Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith declined to say who might have helped Famalaro conceal Huber's body 
after she vanished on June 3, 1991. Authorities suspect her corpse was stored 
most of the time in a freezer that Famalaro bought in Orange County about a 
week after Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The large deep freezer was moved several times around the county until it was 
finally taken to Arizona earlier this year. Police say that Famalaro, 37, 
formerly of Lake Forest, had enlisted the help of friends and acquaintances to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona authorities discovered the freezer on July 13 inside a Ryder rental 
truck parked outside Famalaro's home at the Prescott Country Club. It contained 
Huber's body. An extension cord ran from the truck to his mother's house next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, 23, of Newport Beach, was last seen alive after attending a rock 
concert at the Forum in Inglewood. Her abandoned Honda Accord was later found 
on the Corona del Mar Freeway, with its right rear tire shredded. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those questioned by police during the past week was Famalaro's brother, 
Warren, of Mission Viejo -- a former chiropractor convicted in 1980 of sexually 
assaulting two of his patients. But Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden 
said Saturday that Warren Famalaro has been "ruled out as a suspect at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also said Saturday that Arizona officials turned over a sample of 
Huber's blood so the Orange County Sheriff's Department crime lab can complete 
critical tests that might determine where Huber was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Local authorities want to determine whether the sample matches a substance 
that appears to be blood taken from a Laguna Hills storage facility that John 
Famalaro was renting when Huber disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 If the samples match, it could further implicate John Famalaro, and place 
Huber's death in Orange County, clearing the way for the case to be moved to 
California for prosecution. Snowden said the test results might be available as 
early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Smith said, an autopsy has revealed that Huber was hit at least 12 
times in the head with a blunt object, but there is no indication that she was 
sexually assaulted before her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investigators say that John Famalaro's arrest and the evidence 
seized by Arizona authorities from his country club home have provided few 
answers to the many questions raised by Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrest has added more questions to the long list of questions we already 
had," Smith said. "I've always thought that she was killed in Orange County. 
From what I've learned about Denise and her habits, I still think it was an 
abduction on the freeway and the murder happened a little later." 
</P>
<P>
 A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said Orange County 
authorities are looking at several theories to determine whether Huber was 
alive before the freezer was purchased, including the dreadful possibility that 
the young woman was in a coma or unconscious for a few days after she was 
bludgeoned in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite evidence recovered from John Famalaro's house that links him to the 
victim, investigators may not be able to tie him to Huber's car. The Honda was 
released to her family in 1991, Snowden said, after detectives could not find 
any fingerprints or other evidence such as hair, blood or remnants of fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 To help investigators in Arizona and ease the transition should the 
prosecution of John Famalaro be transferred to Orange County, Snowden sent a 
pathology team to Phoenix on Friday, including Dr. Richard Fukumoto, a forensic 
specialist for the Orange County coroner. The Maricopa County medical 
examiner's office, however, would not let Fukumoto view Huber's body. He 
returned home Friday afternoon after waiting almost four hours, raising 
questions from Orange County authorities who were concerned about cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona officials said they turned Fukumoto down because they have 
jurisdiction in the case, and the medical examination of Huber's body, as well 
as other forensic work, was virtually complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden said Saturday he was disappointed that Fukumoto was not allowed to see 
Huber's body, but he did not interpret the incident as a sign that a rift was 
developing between Orange County and Arizona law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud the Arizona authorities," Snowden said. "They have been operating 
as if this is one big department. It's like there are no state boundaries. It 
could not have been any more professional. But I'm in a quandary. I'm sure we 
will have a logical explanation on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Yavapai County Attorney Thomas B. Lindberg, the prosecutor handling the 
Famalaro case, said that because of a misunderstanding or a lack of 
communication between agencies, the Maricopa County medical examiner was 
unaware of Fukumoto's plans to visit or his desire to see the body. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fukumoto arrived in Phoenix, Maricopa County investigators were examining 
the corpse and did not want to disrupt their work, Lindberg said. "I don't 
think anybody wanted to create any ill feelings between medical examiners." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Orange County and Arizona officials deny there is a jurisdictional 
dispute in the case, but several Orange County law enforcement authorities 
interviewed late last week said privately that they prefer that John Famalaro 
be tried in Prescott. It would be easier to convict him and sentence him to 
death under Arizona law, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 One official told The Times that it might be difficult to prove special 
circumstances -- the burden of proof required to qualify a defendant for the 
death penalty under California law -- during a trial in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said prosecutors have discussed five special-circumstance options 
if the case is tried in California, including charging John Famalaro with 
kidnaping, torture, rape, attempted rape and robbery, along with the murder. 
But he added that the evidence needed to uphold each of the options "is still 
very weak." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said the Maricopa County officials -- who brought in outside experts, 
including an anthropologist -- completed their tests on Friday, and are now 
holding the body so that an Arizona pathologist can conduct an independent 
examination for John Famalaro's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the autopsy was conducted a week ago, investigators on Friday 
reconstructed Huber's skull, "trying to piece bone on bone back together to 
determine the number of blows and the type of weapon used," Lindberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items seized by homicide investigators at John Famalaro's home were 
a crowbar with bloodstains and hammers, according to a search warrant filed in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 John Famalaro's attorney, Thomas K. Kelly, has hired a private pathologist, 
who is scheduled to examine Huber's corpse on Tuesday. It will enable the body 
to be released to the family in time for a funeral Thursday in South Dakota, 
where Huber's grandfather is buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. H. H. Karnitschnig, who retired as the Maricopa County medical examiner 
two years ago, said he will look at Huber's skull fractures to see if they are 
consistent with the type of weapon police say was used. He said he will also 
try to determine whether the autopsy and forensic tests have been done 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause and time of Huber's death might be "a crucial issue in the case," 
Kelly has stated in his court papers, and Karnitschnig said Saturday that it is 
"essentially impossible" to determine when she died, which might make the 
prosecution's job harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had a number or bodies that have been dead for weeks or for months," 
he said. "But I have never had one that was frozen." 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a week of investigation, law enforcement authorities have not 
officially linked John Famalaro to any other unsolved homicide cases in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives, however, are still trying to determine whether he might be 
responsible for the unsolved 1992 slaying of a Sedona, Ariz., woman, whose 
skull was pierced by a .45-caliber bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said he was in Sedona at the time 50-year-old Marjorie Anne Hope 
vanished along a local roadway, and officials say he owned a .45-caliber 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 The roof of a white Chevrolet truck in John Famalaro's possession at the time 
of his arrest had a bullet hole in it, although he obtained that vehicle last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sedona, authorities were asking residents to report any information about 
John Famalaro's whereabouts in Sedona in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 No detail or chance meeting is too insignificant because it will help create a 
timeline about John Famalaro's comings and goings, Sedona Police Chief Bob 
Irish said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might think it's not much if he cleaned their rugs one day, but it 
could be a critical piece of evidence," Irish said. "Something might click -- 
there could be a connection."

FAREWELL TO A DAUGHTER, A SISTER -- AND A FRIEND; MEMORIAL: DENISE HUBER, THE 
SMILING FACE ON THE MISSING PERSONS' POSTERS, IS REMEMBERED BY THOSE SHE 
TOUCHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an elegant ceremony for a young woman whose tragic story many came to know 
through grim headlines, hundreds of people bid farewell Saturday to Denise 
Huber, whose murder seems yet another symbol of how brutal the times in which 
we live have become. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath a canopy of sun-washed, denim-blue sky, some 300 friends and family, 
including those who came to know the Hubers only after their 23-year-old 
daughter vanished three years ago, gathered at Mariners Church in Newport Beach 
for a graceful, dignified memorial that included an abundance of tributes, 
testimonies and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 From as far away as Canada and Tennessee, Denise's relatives and friends 
traveled to attend the 90-minute service, where six of them were allotted a 
brief moment to remember Denise's equally brief life. One quoted C.S. Lewis' "A 
Grief Observed" -- in which Lewis described the pain of losing his wife to 
cancer -- and all recalled with humor Denise's fondness for frogs, fun and the 
Los Angeles Kings hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Vancouver and I did not share Denise's enthusiasm for the Los 
Angeles Kings," said youth pastor and Vancouver Canucks fan, Dave Nieuwsma, 
whose remark prompted muffled laughter, one of a half-dozen such lighter 
moments in an otherwise somber event. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousin and long-time family friend with a daughter roughly Denise's age, 
Nieuwsma spoke of having wonderful memories of Denise, described by all as a 
person of strong religious convictions. But Nieuwsma said the "one who brought 
those memories is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have been more like her," confessed former college roommate 
Debbie Scott. "Life was so much fun when she was around." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the events of the past eight days -- ever since Denise's bludgeoned 
body was identified as that found tucked inside a freezer belonging to a former 
Orange County man -- were alluded to several times, the family pastor, the Rev. 
Walt Shepard, urged people to set history aside and look forward. And yet, in 
the next breath, he seemed unable to heed his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help thinking . . . of some of the details that have come out in 
the investigation," the reverend said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be thinking with me of the words BLUNT -- FORCE -- TRAUMA. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't expect me to believe that you haven't seen an entirely new meaning 
to the word: bludgeoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years after her disappearance, Denise's frozen, handcuffed corpse was 
found July 13 after an Arizona woman thought it queer that house painter and 
former Lake Forest resident John J. Famalaro had an extension cord leading into 
a Ryder rental truck parked outside his country club home in Dewey, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 She tipped authorities and Famalaro, 37, was indicted last Thursday on 
first-degree murder charges after investigators turned up numerous suspicious 
items at his home, including a crowbar that appeared to be stained with blood 
and the clothing Denise is believed to have worn the day she vanished, also 
bearing crimson stains. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because it involved the kind of circumstances most people could both 
relate to and dread -- she fell victim after her car broke down on the Corona 
del Mar Freeway at 2:30 in the morning shortly after dropping a friend off at 
home -- the crime galvanized what is typically an aloof community. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by friends and sympathetic strangers, the family plastered flyers 
throughout the area, posted messages on freeway billboards, passed out "Do you 
know where Denise is?" bumper stickers and, eventually, even hired a banner 
plane. With the help of others, the family raised a $10,000 reward, and 
television programs "America's Most Wanted" and "Inside Edition" afforded the 
case national attention. 
</P>
<P>
 In what in retrospect seems an eerie quirk of fate, Denise's mother, Ione, 
expressed frustration in an interview for a newspaper story that ran in The 
Times June 3 -- three years to the day of Denise's kidnaping -- that she could 
not "put an end" to the years of "not knowing" what befell her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the end that has come to pass in the weeks since she expressed those 
sentiments may be more horrific than even what she and husband, Dennis, ever 
imagined, Saturday's tribute to their daughter did seem to provide them and 
every one else a measure of closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is wonderful for Denise," said Gillian Fay, who has known the 
Hubers for nearly a decade. "She deserved this." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Brown, who described Denise as her best friend, said she wanted to say a 
few words at the service, but when the day arrived she could not muster the 
composure, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be too much," she admitted, her voice quivering. "I didn't have the 
strength to stand up in front of everybody and talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past three years, I have talked to her through my heart, telling her 
how I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of her friend, she pinned a picture of her and Denise from their UC 
Irvine graduation, Brown's favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this photo," she said. Brown, 26, said the photo brought back memories 
of kinder days. 
</P>
<P>
 DeeAnn Holley, 37, of Irvine said she didn't know Denise nor her family, but 
attended the service because she wanted to pay her respects and say a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The story of her disappearance) touched me as a parent," Holley said. "I 
just felt the pain almost as if it was one of my own daughters. It broke my 
heart. I guess it is just a mother-to-mother kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the pews sat old and young alike, among them pony-tailed brunettes who 
looked not unlike a toddling Denise as portrayed in the many photographs 
stationed on an easel in the church vestibule. Together, the photos formed a 
collage of the young woman's life: as a youngster in her softball uniform, a 
grinning schoolgirl with braces and as an infant seated on the lap of her 
grandfather, next to whom she will be laid to rest Aug. 2 in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 Another photograph depicted a piece of fabric on which Denise had embroidered 
for her parents the words, "Life is fragile; handle with care." 
</P>
<P>
 On the stage of the cavernous auditorium rested 13 flower arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist John Andrew Schreiner paid one of the most moving tributes -- an 
original song, "Her Memory," whose haunting lyrics were, in part: 
</P>
<P>
 "Said goodby to her friend, drove home real late.  
</P>
<P>
 "What happened next was a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone took her away -- left us just her memory. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Three years of prayin', three years of fright. But I know in my heart 
everything is all right."  
</P>
<P>
 The songwriter, Nancy Streza, a lifelong friend, said her family was about to 
leave on a trip to Colorado, one they've taken every year since Denise's 
abduction, but this year's trip would be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year we went, it was just a few days after Denise disappeared," she 
said. "My girls and I stopped at every truck stop and rest area on the way to 
put up flyers, and it was the same next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we don't have to put up any flyers and we don't have to look for 
her along the side of the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Shattering what is at least the usual perception of law enforcement officers 
as among the most calloused, Costa Mesa Police Chief Dave Snowden could not 
contain his tears as he delivered a tribute to a woman whose case he said had 
touched his own life deeply. Throughout the service, he sat in the front row 
clutching his wife's hand and delicately fingering the tiny, gray program that 
bore a black-and-white portrait of a beaming Denise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her picture has been my constant companion," Snowden said. "It's on my desk 
at work. It's on the visor of my car, and it's on our dresser at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating something Denise's father had once told him, the chief added, 
"Parents should not live to bury their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brown, the friend, sighed: "Yes, there is some sense of closure, but I 
know this really isn't over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad for this opportunity (to say goodby) and also to finally have the 
answers -- although they were not the ones we wanted," Brown said. "At least 
they are answers." Authorities still must sort out the grim task of determining 
whether the trial will be held in Arizona or California, and then there is the 
trial itself to endure. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the service, family and friends mingled in the lobby and courtyard, 
as Dennis and Ione Huber spoke briefly with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 With words sincere, the family's pastoral staff, saying they were speaking for 
Denise's parents and her brother, Jeff, again and again emphasized that people 
should leave with hope. And yet, though well-intended, they were words that -- 
on this particular afternoon -- seemed to ring a bit hollow, even for a family 
of faith such as the Hubers. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, it seems that the prophetic statement of Costa Mesa Police Capt. 
Tom Lazar, spoken just two days after Denise's kidnaping, rang truest Saturday: 
"We have feelings about these things, and this one doesn't feel good."

RWANDAN TELLS OF HORRORS, CANNIBALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man believed to be the first Rwandan refugee to surface in Los Angeles 
during the current crisis told a harrowing story Saturday of mass murder and 
cannibalism, of luck that led to his survival and of a debt repaid that led him 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Wanzam, a 28-year-old member of the minority Tutsi tribe, said his 
ordeal began in April when he saw his family murdered by rival Hutus. Then, he 
said, he barely evaded death himself in a massacre at a jungle prison camp and 
fled on foot to neighboring Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he searched out an old family friend whom his father had once harbored 
from the wrath of former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who killed thousands of his 
own countrymen during the 1970s. This time, it was the friend's turn to offer 
safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend, a successful farmer, provided Wanzam with phony passports and 
bought him airline tickets to Johannesburg in South Africa, Jakarta in 
Indonesia, and ultimately Los Angeles, where Wanzam arrived June 23 and applied 
for political asylum with the help of the refugee organization El Rescate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel comfort now," he said. "I feel that I am all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanzam had surrendered to the Immigration and Naturalization Service when he 
got off the plane at Los Angeles International Airport. He was held for three 
weeks at a detention facility on Terminal Island until an El Rescate official 
arranged for a $2,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a subdued Wanzam sat at a Formica table at the Highland Park home 
of his lawyer and recounted his experience of the ethnic warfare that has 
turned Rwanda red with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanzam, who was educated in Catholic parochial schools and speaks English, 
began by describing the murders of his parents and sisters the day after the 
Rwandan president's plane was hit by rockets, an act that set off the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, controlled by the Hutu tribe, blamed the rocket attack on 
Tutsi rebel forces, which had been receiving counsel and supplies from Wanzam's 
father, a successful coffee farmer and outspoken advocate of Tutsi rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the rocket attack, local militiamen came to the Wanzam farm 
and seized his father's letters, Wanzam said. That night, after supper, masked 
security forces appeared looking for additional correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanzam said he was forced to watch as a gunman shot his kneeling father, then 
his mother when she began to hurl insults. His two sisters, ages 20 and 22 were 
next. They were shot, he said, when they began to cry, and clubbed to death 
when they did not die right away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times was unable to independently confirm details of Wanzam's account 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wanzam's lawyer, Robert J. Foss, who regularly represents refugees for El 
Rescate, said he verified the account in general terms by comparing it to 
reports from Amnesty International about massacres in Wanzam's hometown of 
Nyanza. Because of the turmoil, Foss said, his account "is really the only 
evidence he has." 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials contacted Saturday said they could not immediately verify it, 
but did confirm that he arrived June 23, was jailed for three weeks and is now 
free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching his parents and sisters shot and clubbed to death, Wanzam said 
he was thrown into the bed of a truck with a score of other young men from 
Nyanza and taken to a makeshift military concentration camp in a jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanzam assumed he was being kept alive so that his tormentors could question 
him about his father's efforts to aid rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 He said masked interrogators had already pulled out one of his fingernails 
with pliers and used a knife to cut into his thigh in an effort to extract 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanzam, who said he didn't know details of his father's activities anyway, had 
his hands tied behind his back and then to a stake where he was left to sit for 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanzam, who appeared almost numb during much of a lengthy interview, said, at 
that time, he had no fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing for me to be afraid of," he explained quietly. "I knew 
death was only once and I knew I was going to die. . . . Nobody who was ever 
taken by the security returned to his home." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he said, the majority Hutu tribesmen who ran the camp were too busy 
fighting off encroaching rebels to pay attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rebels advanced, Wanzam said, the Hutus broke camp, shooting to death 
any prisoners -- including some women and children -- considered too weak to be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
 They trucked him and some others to another jungle clearing, where the 
prisoners were again tied to stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the man at the next stake died, a friend two stakes away suggested to 
Wanzam that their only chance to survive would be grasp nearby sticks and use 
them to scrap away some of the dead man's flesh. They managed to do just that, 
Wanzam said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time," he said, "we were not even considering ourselves human beings. 
We were not thinking what we were doing was wrong or right . . . It was OK, 
because that was the only means to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 After three days in the second camp, an official appeared, giving instructions 
that the camp was to be abandoned and the barbed wire and watchtowers torn down 
and burned. Guards then opened fire on the prisoners tied to their stakes; 
Wanzam pretended he had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck was with him, he said, as he lay still for hours, long after he had heard 
the last sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after a struggle, he managed to free himself from his bonds and hiked to 
the Uganda border, about 15 miles away.

COSMIC COLLISION HAS EARTHLINGS LOOKING SKYWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For astronomers and star warriors who already view the night sky with 
foreboding, the cataclysm that convulsed Jupiter last week was a possible 
preview of the fate of Earth, which one day may be caught off-guard by a stream 
of natural warheads -- comets or asteroids on a collision course with the home 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpectedly powerful impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter -- 
striking repeatedly with hundreds of times the energy contained in all Earth's 
nuclear weapons -- is lending new respectability to scientists who want to 
detect and ward off objects that may intersect Earth's path. 
</P>
<P>
 As the comet fragments blossomed into plumes of superheated gas on Jupiter, 
the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology voted last week to require 
that NASA catalogue and track all major comets or asteroids that may cross 
Earth's path. And several prominent scientists have quietly lobbied the U.S. 
Air Force Space Command to volunteer the use of its network of sky-watching 
satellites and telescopes for the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next year, the Space Command is expected to make its early warning 
satellite system and at least one of its ground-based telescopes available to 
watch for incoming asteroids or comets, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The programming of the satellite system, which normally monitors hostile 
rocket launches, will be modified so that it will also warn of objects 
approaching from deep space. The telescope, part of a system being upgraded, 
normally monitors foreign satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Space is far from empty. Millions of asteroids and comets crisscross the solar 
system, but almost all of them are far from Earth, orbiting between Mars and 
Jupiter or circling in a vast cloud more than a light-year from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers have already identified about 200 objects large enough to wreak 
havoc on Earth. By tracking their orbits, they have determined that none of 
those would hit Earth. But most scientists suspect there are thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists say Earth has been struck many times in its history. Scientists 
recently identified a 110-mile-wide impact crater on the Yucatan Peninsula. The 
65-million-year-old crater, believed to be connected to the demise of the 
dinosaurs, is the largest-known impact structure on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, such scars were considered part of Earth's past, not a preview 
of any future hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, only a few aged telescopes are dedicated to searching for asteroids 
near Earth. If the House measure is adopted this fall, NASA will have a decade 
to catalogue every Earth-crossing object more than half a mile wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicist Edward Teller has suggested using hydrogen bombs to knock such 
intruders out of the sky, but scientists actively involved in planning such 
defenses say far more modest methods will suffice. No nuclear weapons or 
anti-comet ballistic defense systems, please, these scientists are quick to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 They want just enough advance warning -- say a century or so -- to nudge any 
incoming asteroid out of the way by shoving it with a rocket tipped with a few 
tons of lead or to attach a solar sail that will waft it on a new course safely 
away from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory H. Canavan, a senior scientific adviser at Los Alamos National 
Laboratory on Friday called such gentle precautionary maneuvers "cosmic 
croquet." Canavan, who convened a group of scientists to evaluate the problem 
for NASA and Congress, estimated that an early warning system of small 
telescopes around the world might cost about $10 million a year and active 
defenses another $50 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the insurance premium for things whizzing at you out of the cosmos," 
he said. "With a hundred years warning, you would not need nuclear explosives. 
You would have lots of options." 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists are skeptical of the risk from comets or asteroids and are 
adamantly opposed to any effort to shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would worry more about a car wreck, airplane crash or getting a bad can of 
Spam," said University of Arizona astronomer Mark Sykes at the Steward 
Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
 David Morrison at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, who helped 
prepare a report for Congress on ways of intercepting asteroids and comets, has 
made a study of the risk and determined that it is unlikely but large enough to 
warrant concern. 
</P>
<P>
 An impact that might kill 1 in 4 of the people on Earth can be expected about 
once every 500,000 years; everyone alive therefore faces about a 1 in 2 million 
chance of being killed in such a collision in any one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a lifetime that works out to about a 1 in 20,000 chance, which is 
comparable to the risk most people face of dying in an earthquake or an 
airplane crash, according to figures he presented to the American Assn. for the 
Advancement of Science. 
</P>
<P>
 "My (colleagues) think we are absolutely crazy to suggest government money 
should be spent to prevent a catastrophe that happens only once every several 
hundred millennia or so," he told the symposium of scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "Unlike other natural hazards, impacts can kill billions of 
people and endanger civilization. Unlike any other natural hazard I can think 
of, you can avert an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Shoemaker, the astronomer who helped discover the comet that collided 
with Jupiter last week, supports the effort to develop an early warning system 
to watch for incoming celestial objects, but is skeptical about proposals to 
create missile defenses against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knocking a comet down is a tough thing to do," he said Friday. Hidden by a 
dazzling cloud of dust and gas, a comet nucleus would be hard to target 
accurately. And any explosion powerful enough to destroy it might 
unintentionally knock it more directly into Earth's path. Earth's best 
protection against the hazards of cosmic hail is its relatively diminutive 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker said that Jupiter, which contains about 2.5 times the mass of all 
the other planets in the solar system combined -- presents a much larger target 
than Earth, and so it is hit more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Although objects the size of the comet that rocked the planet last week might 
be expected to hit Jupiter every 1,000 years, he said, they might hit Earth 
about once every 100 million years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mathematics of risk assessment take no account of disasters that may 
already be in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course if there is one coming," said Lucy McFadden, a University of 
Maryland astronomer, "the statistics are irrelevant."

PORTRAIT EMERGES OF INSULAR, ECCENTRIC FAMALARO FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSO; GEBE MARTINEZ, ; LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Anna Famalaro campaigned for the Santa Ana City Council in 1981, the 
outspoken 56-year-old left little doubt about her top priority: how to stem a 
growing tide of crime in that central Orange County city. 
</P>
<P>
 But unspoken in her losing political effort was the crime that already had 
devastated Anna Famalaro, her neighbors say, driving a wedge into the heart of 
her devoutly Roman Catholic family. In 1980, her eldest son, Warren, a 
successful chiropractor, was arrested and convicted of sexually assaulting two 
children who had come to him for treatment. His mother's reaction was harsh: 
"She just stopped speaking to him," one business associate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 13 years later, her youngest child, John, stands accused in the killing 
of Denise Huber, a dark-haired young waitress whose body was discovered in a 
freezer outside John J. Famalaro's Arizona home. The 1991 disappearance of 
Huber, 23, from the shoulder of an Orange County freeway had sparked a 
nationwide search and a storm of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, police also have sniffed suspiciously around the edges of 
a family characterized by former neighbors, colleagues and other associates as 
eccentric, insular and often, oddly confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since John Famalaro's arrest, police have searched his mother's 
neighboring Dewey, Ariz., home and raised questions about her decision several 
weeks ago to allow her son to run an extension cord from her house to the deep 
freezer later found to contain Huber's body. After his arrest, she told police 
that John explained to her that he needed the freezer kept running to prevent 
food from spoiling during a power outage, a law enforcement source said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, investigators have questioned his brother Warren several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really reached no conclusion as to what his status is," Assistant Dist. 
Atty. John Conley said Friday. "It's the kind of thing where we want to keep an 
open mind. . . . This is an unusual case." On Saturday, Costa Mesa Police Chief 
Dave Snowden said the brother was not a suspect "at this time." The Famalaro 
family has retreated for the most part behind closed doors and telephone 
answering machines, in some cases denying their identities in an effort to 
avoid the relentless media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a man wearing pink polka-dotted shorts and assisted by several 
friends quickly moved storage shelves, a television and other items out of the 
Lake Forest house owned by Warren Famalaro. Neighbors identified the 
shorts-clad man as Warren but he insisted he was not, and even agreed to take a 
message for the former chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warren obviously doesn't want to make a statement," a companion said. "And if 
he doesn't, we don't either." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with neighbors of the Famalaros in Arizona, and former 
neighbors, colleagues and political acquaintances in Orange County, and from a 
variety of court documents, a picture emerges of a religious, conservative, 
hard-working family, but one characterized again and again by people who knew 
them as reclusive or simply, "different." 
</P>
<P>
 The family includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Anna Mae Famalaro, now 69. Born in Atlantic City, N.Y., Anna is described by 
neighbors and acquaintances as a forceful, strong-willed woman, fiercely 
protective of her children and often strident in her dealings with others. She 
also is known by some as Anne. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, she expressed bewilderment and outrage at those who 
have been quoted as calling her son John "secretive" and describing her as a 
domineering mother. "It is unbelievable what they are saying," she said. "This 
is killing us." 
</P>
<P>
 * Angelo A. Famalaro, 78. The visibly frail man suffers from Parkinson's 
disease but has joined his wife in visits to their son at the Yavapai County 
Jail. Born in Norwich, N.Y., Angelo worked in sales and later kept the books 
for his son's chiropractic office. Quiet and pleasant, he is "a constant, 
loving man," said David Stark, a Lake Forest chiropractor who knew the family 
in the mid-'80s. "He was always there for his kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * Warren John Famalaro, 41, Anna and Angelo's eldest child, is a former 
chiropractor who owns a Lake Forest business called Raintree Practice 
Management. Now divorced, he lost his chiropractor's license after he was 
convicted in 1980 of sexually assaulting two patients, a 10-year-old boy and a 
17-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 He also admitted to a court-appointed psychiatrist that he had had sex with 
two to three patients a year for nearly six years, according to court 
documents. In both those records and in interviews, former colleagues described 
him as a skilled chiropractor but ambitious and often manipulative in business 
matters. A number of former patients, however, extol him as a warm, charming 
man who cared about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of those interviewed also expressed sympathy for Warren. His brother's 
sudden notoriety, they said, had forced his conviction back into the public 
eye. "What Warren did was wrong, but it's a long time ago and he's being 
dragged through the mud all over again because of this," said Steven A. Annis, 
an Aliso Viejo chiropractor who once worked with him. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marion Thobe, 40, the sister of Warren and John. A nurse at a retirement 
hospital in Prescott, Ariz., she has declined comment in recent days, other 
than to say that her family is distraught over the allegations against her 
brother. "I think anyone can imagine what type of crisis we are in right now," 
she said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Duane Thobe, 53, Marion's ex-husband. He owns a carpet cleaning business in 
Prescott, and is also listed as the owner of the house where John Famalaro has 
lived since January, next to his parents' home at the Prescott Country Club. 
Curiously, on July 11, Duane Thobe, a former Davenport, Iowa, police officer, 
asked the Arizona Public Service Co. to turn off electric power to the house, 
according to affidavits filed by Arizona investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Anna Famalaro apparently told the utility that ownership of the 
house was in dispute and asked that power be restored. Thobe has declined to 
comment and, through his attorney, has complained that reporters are harassing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 * John J. Famalaro, 37, the house painter and handyman accused of killing 
Huber and preserving her nude, handcuffed body in a freezer for three years. 
Several neighbors near his Prescott Country Club home said he was a secretive 
man who took pains to avoid them. In contrast, former neighbors in Lake Forest 
said he was amiable, even charming. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really very personable," said Pat Darvas, who lived a few doors from 
Famalaro on Perth Way in Lake Forest in 1990 and 1991. "He always waved. . . . 
He was very nice, the type of person you'd never spend a minute worrying about. 
I can't believe what's happened. It seems so out of character." 
</P>
<P>
 As investigators and reporters sifted the details of John Famalaro's life last 
week, they found little in his childhood or later background that seemed to 
offer an explanation for his link to the bizarre murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Famalaro family arrived in California from Long Island, N.Y., in 1956, 
living first in a new, brown, single-story home on South Ramona Drive in Santa 
Ana before moving about three years later to a larger home on north Victoria 
Street, a neighborhood of custom homes and sweeping lawns. The elder Famalaros 
also lived in Laguna Hills and Lake Forest before moving to Arizona in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 A former neighbor on Ramona described Angelo as a "sweet man" who often seemed 
overshadowed by his wife. Anna Famalaro also was extremely protective of her 
two younger children, Marion, who had a learning disability, and John, then a 
toddler, the neighbor said. The Famalaro children, in fact, were not usually 
allowed to play with other kids, although her daughter was among the few who 
did, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always got the sense that (Anna) was unnecessarily worried about things 
that wouldn't happen," said the former neighbor, a Newport Beach artist who 
spoke on the condition that her name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 She "was not the kind of person that you could talk to without her 
overpowering you," the woman said. "She was not the kind of woman you would 
invite over for coffee. . . . She was worried and frantic all the time, always 
in a panic about her children." 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Hellweg, who lived near the Famalaros on Victoria Street, said the 
children "didn't ride their bicycles in the street with the other children. . . 
. The children never played with any of my children. They weren't out and 
about. They were into themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Stauffer, whose oldest son was John's age, said Anna had a reputation 
among the neighbors for becoming unreasonably upset about minor problems, 
prompting some to avoid her. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids on Victoria Street also knew it was best to keep their distance. They 
were "careful not to step on her lawn or she would chew them out," Stauffer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Stauffer's 4-year-old son happened to touch a newly painted chain in the 
Famalaro yard. After Anna called to complain, Stauffer walked over to examine 
the chain -- which appeared undamaged, she said -- and was standing in the yard 
apologizing to Angelo Famalaro when his wife came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told him, 'Go inside and I will take care of this,' " Stauffer recalled. 
"Then she raked me up and down and called my 4-year-old a juvenile delinquent. 
I got angry and told her she must be a very miserable human being. She just 
stood there with her hands on her hips." 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, the Famalaros were regulars at Mass at St. Joseph's Church 
in Santa Ana and the children attended St. Joseph's Elementary School before 
transferring to the city's public schools. All three attended Willard 
Intermediate; Warren and Marion later graduated from Santa Ana High School, 
while John apparently went on to Amherst Collegiate School in Anaheim, a 
private high school that has since closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Calder, whose mother shared car-pool duties with Anna Famalaro, said she 
and her sisters got in trouble more than once for mimicking the devoutly 
religious Mrs. Famalaro's behavior at Sunday Mass. "She'd pray louder than 
anybody else, and I remember thinking it was pretty funny," Calder said. "She 
just really stood out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anna Famalaro also is remembered in Santa Ana as a community activist who 
worked tirelessly for her conservative causes, including the "fundamental 
schools" movement in the city. She also belonged to the now-defunct Republican 
Women's Club of Santa Ana and a city beautification committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a bright woman and dedicated to the causes she was interested in," 
said Mary Pryer, a former member of the Santa Ana Unified school board. "I 
thought she was a nice person and I liked her." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Famalaro served for three years on the city's Personnel Board, but not 
without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said that during Anna Famalaro's tenure, 
he was concerned that her frequently "bizarre" statements might prompt a judge 
to set aside decisions of the board, which held administrative hearings 
concerning the employment status of city police, firefighters and civilian 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very opinionated, very argumentative and frequently her statements 
were off the wall," Cooper said. "We'd be trying to get at the facts of a case 
with witnesses and she'd pop up with statements that were not relevant to the 
discussion in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, she ran for the City Council but lost to former Councilman John 
Acosta. She campaigned as an Independent and, in her clipped candidate's 
statement, highlighted her political independence and her desire to control 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience as Vice Chairman of Personnel Board shows that both people and 
police are apprehensive about crime rate in Santa Ana. . . . Council must 
involve community to control growth of crime. I intend to create effective 
solution to problem," she stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Pryer said the subject of Warren's arrest and conviction was never mentioned 
in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was left lying on the table. People knew about it; they didn't say 
anything about it. It was a non-issue," Pryer said. "She never talked about it, 
really, and I didn't ask because I didn't think it was appropriate to ask." 
</P>
<P>
 Pryer said she was shocked to hear of the news of Anna Famalaro's younger 
son's arrest in the Huber case and expressed sympathy for her old friend. "She 
must be going through hell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By several accounts, the family, particularly its strongly Catholic matriarch, 
was shattered by Warren's arrest and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 David Stark, a Lake Forest chiropractor, came to know the Famalaros when he 
bought Warren's practice in the early 1980s and, as a condition of the 
purchase, employed him as the office manager upon his release from Patton State 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren's mother, who frequently came into the office for treatment of a stiff 
neck, all but ignored her son, Stark said. "They never spoke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Famalaros did, however, attempt to help their son by establishing a family 
trust and later tried to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors in 1981. 
But a judge found the family trust an ineligible debtor under the bankruptcy 
code, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust, which operated from Warren Famalaro's current business address in 
Lake Forest and included his then-wife, Holly, and his father as trustees, 
listed its assets as three houses -- all encumbered by several mortgages. The 
properties included a $1.5 million Laguna Beach home in the same elegant 
neighborhood where Bette Midler and other celebrities lived. All but one of the 
dwellings, Warren Famalaro's current residence, were later sold. 
</P>
<P>
 While Famalaro was a highly successful chiropractor -- he was seeing more than 
100 patients a day at the time of his arrest -- court-appointed therapists who 
saw him after his conviction said he was a troubled, compulsive man, court 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, psychologist Albert J. Rosenstein described him as an "emotionally 
unstable" pedophile with an explosive personality and a mental disease that 
"predisposed him to commission of sexual acts, which represented a danger to 
the community," court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 And even after he was treated for more than two years and discharged from 
Patton State Hospital, the medical staff warned that he should not be allowed 
any unsupervised contact with minors. 
</P>
<P>
 But he showed enough progress that in 1985 one of his counselors recommended 
the end of his outpatient therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Famalaro has established a solid sense of self-worth as a person. This is 
in sharp contrast to the time preceding his offenses -- when he was driven to 
obtain power, status and sexual conquests to prove his worth. An enjoyment of 
people, relationships and new activities has replaced his former drive and 
manipulation," wrote Keith Tannler, of the Orange County Mental Health Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Former patients praised his care and vowed that they would return to 
Famalaro's office if his license were reinstated. "My children and myself have 
always had the deepest respect for his regard of his profession and our needs," 
wrote former patient Sherree Wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Board of Chiropractic Examiners still had doubts and in 1985 it 
rejected Famalaro's pleas to reissue his license. To demonstrate his fitness, 
Famalaro offered some 50 letters from family members, doctors, chiropractors, 
lawyers and his pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel Warren is an honest, dependable and moral person," wrote his 
then-father-in-law, Charles W. Heath. "His experience during the past few years 
has taught him valuable, albeit traumatic lessons that will stay with him 
forever. Other than his family, his life seems to be directed by devotion and 
love of the chiropractic profession." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of a patient of Warren's in the late '70s, a girl who was then 
about 12, last week described him as a caring chiropractor. She said she 
allowed him to take her two daughters to join Warren and his girlfriend on an 
outing to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 She was shocked a year later to hear of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, several of those interviewed expressed similar shock at the charges 
against John and described the two as alike -- ambitious, hard-working men who 
could be charming, to both men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 "John's like his brother; they've got very similar personalities," said 
Leonard Malin, an Anaheim chiropractor. "John's a little more introverted but 
either one would size you up and then turn on the charm. To meet (John), you'd 
think he was a good guy. 
</P>
<P>
 But where Warren was successful in business, John was not. He seemed to dabble 
in careers, trying one after another in succession, each time appearing to lose 
interest in favor of yet another path. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied to become a chiropractor but apparently never finished. He sought 
to become a police officer and actually applied at several Southern California 
departments but was not accepted. He spent four months as a reserve sheriff's 
deputy for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department but failed to complete 
the six-month training. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned his living as a house painter and handyman, but both in Orange 
County and the Prescott area left a litany of complaints from angry customers 
who had hired him to paint their homes or make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 months ago, John moved to Dewey, Ariz., apparently to help care for 
his parents, particularly his ailing father. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, after more complaints from clients that he had performed shoddy work 
or left jobs unfinished, his Arizona contractor's license was revoked and he 
began work as a part-time real estate salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighbors in Arizona said he was strange and secretive and complained 
of his late night hours. But others said he was a pleasant, endearing man who 
made friends easily. 
</P>
<P>
 One testimonial came last week during a Prescott radio talk show, when a woman 
who identified herself as "Patricia" said she was bewildered that a man who she 
had come to know as a "very sweet" person could be arrested in such a bizarre 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 When Famalaro came to work on her house last summer, she felt "he was one of 
the most kind, outgoing people I have ever met," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She trusted him so much, in fact, that she gave him the key to her house, had 
him over for dinner, invited him to a Christmas celebration at her home, and 
even offered to set up a blind date with a friend of hers from California 
because "he seemed lonely." But the date was never arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her family also felt "a little sorry for him," because he said he was 
supporting his parents and his father was ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, the woman said, "was the last person on earth" she would have 
thought could commit such a crime. 
</P>
<P>

this report from Dewey, Ariz., while staff writers Doreen Carvajal, Matt Lait, 
Julie Marquis, Jodi Wilgoren and correspondent Susan Howlett contributed from

FORMER LAPD GOLDEN BOY TARNISHED BY HOLDUP ARREST; POLICE: MIKE BRAMBLES' 
ADMIRERS -- AND ENEMIES -- ARE SHOCKED BY THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM IN NINE 
ROBBERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elizabeth Adams, the notorious Beverly Hills madam, swore to the end that he 
was "one of the most honorable, decent cops I have ever met," and she had met 
-- and tested -- a lot of cops. 
</P>
<P>
 No less than former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates called him "one of the 
smartest . . . most innovative detectives I've ever known . . . exactly what 
you'd want in a detective." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Brambles was, indeed, a golden boy of the LAPD -- the highest-profile 
organized-crime fighter on the force, a man wondrously articulate yet willing 
to spend hours on the street to pursue some of the sexiest cases the city had 
to offer, from ZZZZ Best to the madam herself. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did so many blood feuds accompany his rise up the ranks? 
</P>
<P>
 Why did some fellow detectives talk of punching him out? Why did prosecutors 
become wary of him? And why did one former prosecutor, Ed Consiglio -- the one 
he turned into a Mafia suspect -- announce to anyone within earshot, for years, 
that he wouldn't mind seeing "that idiot" dead? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, almost everyone dismissed Consiglio as a vindictive malcontent, 
just as they dismissed the mob boys who screamed for years that Brambles 
fabricated tantalizing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 So Brambles moved on to new investigations and finally, in March, retirement 
from the LAPD with a $30,000 pension and visions of plum security jobs in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that he was arrested this month on a Los Angeles warrant charging 
him with nine armed robberies, mostly of restaurants, along with a dry cleaners 
and a bicycle shop. Brambles, 45, was extradited to Los Angeles, where he 
pleaded not guilty Thursday and was ordered held in lieu of $200,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The events shocked his admirers and enemies alike, prompting both to look 
back, with new eyes, at a career that roller coastered like none other in the 
recent history of the LAPD. Love him or hate him, there was one thing that 
neither group could reconcile: the nature of the crimes that could earn 
Brambles 30 years in prison if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of guy who -- well, Ft. Knox, he might break into," former 
partner Tom Convey said. "But not a little chump robbery, where you walk in 
with no mask and say, 'Hey, mister bike shop owner, gimme your day's receipts.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mike was gonna do a crime," said Convey, one of Brambles' admirers, "he 
would do a crime that would be a one-time thing and be gone with multiple 
millions." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Consiglio was caught off-guard by the allegation that his adversary had 
become a stickup man. "I didn't think he had the guts," the former prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gates? "Mike Brambles," he said, "is probably the most baffling person I 
have ever known." Meeting the Madam 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles exemplified the LAPD's mind-body ideal. A UCLA graduate with a major 
in geography, of all things, he had a wiry build kept fit by surfing -- he 
would often hit the waves before the office. And despite military-neat brown 
hair, he was no Joe Friday square; he preferred jeans and tennis shoes to a 
coat and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles began his LAPD career "like anybody else," he once recalled -- in 
uniform, on patrol. Soon, though, he was recruited into narcotics duty in 
Hollywood, spent 2 1/2 years in vice and was named to the Sexually Exploited 
Child Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 He had not been in it long when he met Adams. The occasion was singer Don 
Henley's 1980 arrest for contributing to the delinquency of a minor after 
paramedics called to his home found a nude 16-year-old girl who had overdosed 
on drugs. Looking for leads on the girl, who was a runaway, Brambles visited 
Elizabeth Adams' house above Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The door was answered by a short woman in a smock whose hair was so thin she 
nearly looked bald -- hardly the embodiment of a top-end madam. When she said, 
"No sabe, " Brambles left. Then the woman did too, going into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 For years -- after he tracked her down -- Adams would laugh about the ruse 
that was the unlikely start of their relationship. In the parlance of the cop 
shop, he became her "handler." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, she knew other cops -- they even came occasionally to bust her. 
But this one, she said, was particularly "cute . . . nice . . . and 
unbribable." 
</P>
<P>
 Like any veteran of the vice trades, Adams learned that a key to survival was 
keeping the law happy. "I'd say, 'Look guys, your pensions are all you have 
going for you so I won't tempt you. . . . But when you retire. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles "never wanted anything," she said. "Not (women), not money, not 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Much later, Internal Affairs would poke around in vain for something crooked 
in their relationship; if not money, perhaps antiques from the store she used 
as a front. 
</P>
<P>
 No, she insisted, the relationship was based on the other commodity those in 
vice trades peddle to keep the law at bay -- information. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles said she passed extremely reliable leads on porn rings, drug dealers 
and even terrorists -- including one plotting to bomb the British Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, an astute cop had to be skeptical of such nuggets. A former call 
girl recalled how once, when Brambles was visiting, Adams instructed her, " 
'Come over and nod yes to everything I say.' It was a story about some girl 
bringing computer chips to Communist countries. On the way out, Mike Brambles 
said to me, 'Is this true?' And I gave him a look like, 'Are you crazy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But even if a little iffy information came with the good stuff, the ability to 
cultivate such a source only increased the confidence of Brambles' bosses. In 
1984, he was assigned to the Organized Crime Intelligence Division. And when 
Adams saw him after that, she recalled, "he was a star." ZZZZ Best Detective 
</P>
<P>
 The "elite" tag is overused for police units, but the organized-crime division 
unquestionably merits it. "One of the most sensitive jobs in LAPD," Gates 
termed it. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brambles joined, the unit also was in transition. For although it was 
credited with keeping the mob from gaining a firm foothold in Los Angeles, the 
division had drawn criticism for collecting "intelligence" -- including tidbits 
on political leaders and celebrities -- without making arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1984 Olympics, officials decided that the division would make cases 
for the world to see. That required aggressive detectives and that's what its 
leader, Capt. Stuart Finck, saw in Brambles, whom he would promote twice, to 
D-3, the highest rank of supervising detective. 
</P>
<P>
 "An exceptional guy," Finck, now retired, recalled recently, still amazed at 
how Brambles "uncovered the ZZZZ Best thing . . . virtually all on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles' police reports trace a winding path that led him to the 
carpet-cleaning company renowned for its teen-age founder, Barry Minkow, who 
began the business in his parents' Reseda garage. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1987, Brambles and a partner went to Malibu to serve a warrant on 
Ronnie Lorenzo, owner of Splash restaurant and, Brambles wrote, a "reputed made 
member of the Bonanno crime family." Their interest was piqued when they found 
him driving a car provided by Maurice Rind, a fast-talking financial whiz with 
two stock fraud convictions back East. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail went on: Rind had a company based at his Encino condo complex. Its 
utilities were paid by another firm, whose registered agent was . . . Minkow. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation went public with a bang. Gates announced that the 
organized-crime division had served search warrants on eight people suspected 
of using ZZZZ Best to launder "large organized crime (drug) profits." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, federal authorities had pleaded with the LAPD to hold up 
the searches. The feds saw the case differently -- as a "massive fraud" by 
Minkow and others, using faked profits to drive up ZZZZ Best stock. "We never 
believed ZZZZ Best was a mob operation," former federal prosecutor James R. 
Asperger said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Brambles saw it, though, the FBI was simply "jealous that we got the jump 
on them." Gates backed him to the hilt, saying the feds could "go to hell!" 
</P>
<P>
 Seven organized-crime detectives were assigned to the case, led by Brambles. 
In January, 1988, when a congressional committee held hearings on ZZZZ Best, he 
was sent to Washington to testify. "Why did (the mob) get involved?" he was 
asked. "Money," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution was brought in federal court, however, and included none of 
the alleged mobsters. When the case came to trial, it was Minkow's attorneys 
who subpoenaed Brambles to bolster a long-shot defense -- that the mob had made 
him do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was little second-guessing after Minkow and a slew of others went 
to prison and several of the mob figures were at least hit with Securities and 
Exchange Commission civil suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Few noticed when the most obscure of the suspects spotlighted by Gates but 
never charged -- an Arcadia woman named Darlis Clark -- sued Brambles and the 
LAPD for allegedly violating her rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark challenged a report that she had attended a meeting with several 
mobsters. Brambles said he was able to hear, through a window, talk of 
"cleaning and investing the money" and not wanting to "face the boss" who was 
"back in New York." Clark's attorney, Kevin McDermott, insisted that Brambles 
made up a scene out of "some bad Mafia novel." 
</P>
<P>
 But persuading jurors was another matter. The jury met barely long enough to 
select a foreman, then exonerated the detective. 
</P>
<P>
 As McDermott interpreted it, "The jury couldn't believe that a police officer 
would lie." 'I've Become Sort of an Expert on Mr. Brambles' 
</P>
<P>
 Although many find bureaucracies suffocating, Consiglio wasn't one of them. He 
loved the camaraderie of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. And 
the security. He meant to be a lifer. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd been a D.A. for 13 years when Brambles walked into his Van Nuys office in 
the spring of 1987. Neither man's life would ever be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles had come for information about a potential informant on ZZZZ Best. 
Consiglio had sent the guy to jail for conning financier Rind. Now the guy 
wanted to tattle on Rind and others. Consiglio cautioned Brambles not to trust 
the con man's tales about Rind. Brambles said he'd go see him anyway, thank 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the detective thought Consiglio had been strangely protective of 
Rind, the fraud artist he described to Congress as "an associate to all five 
New York organized crime families." Then, in the ZZZZ Best searches, 
Consiglio's name was found on Rind's papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Later it hit the front pages, how a prosecutor was under investigation for 
nothing less than helping the mob. He allegedly used a law enforcement computer 
on Rind's behalf, went to boxing matches in his limo and accepted other favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Consiglio tried explaining it to his bosses: He'd become friends with Rind, 
but only after meeting him as a victim of a crime. He'd bought the boxing 
tickets and gone in a car -- where had Brambles gotten that limo nonsense? And, 
yeah, he took stock tips from Rind, but would "do it again" -- hey, he made a 
few bucks off ZZZZ Best. 
</P>
<P>
 It did him little good. Although he was never charged with a crime, he 
resigned as a prosecutor in 1988. His new mission -- revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've become sort of an expert on Mr. Brambles" was how he explained it. 
"Other people who have trouble with Brambles end up, one way or another, 
talking to me." 
</P>
<P>
 There was Lorenzo, who said Brambles lied to get Splash's liquor license 
revoked. There was Rind, who said Brambles "made me bigger than Meyer Lansky!" 
And Clark, who had sued. Consiglio found others, too, and began poring over 
their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 He soon mockingly joked about the days "before I joined the Mafia" and 
introduced himself with, "Hi, I'm the cocaine-pushing, money-laundering D.A." 
</P>
<P>
 A former football lineman, Consiglio was a powerful man with pointed, bushy 
eyebrows and thinning black hair brushed back like Jack Nicholson's -- whose 
menacing air he also adopted when the name Brambles came up. "I'd like to get 
him in a room, alone, one man comes out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They did run into each other shortly after Consiglio resigned, at Builders 
Emporium in Woodland Hills. Consiglio heard a voice ask, "How's it goin', Ed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they were "yelling and screaming across the parking lot," recalled a 
friend who was with Brambles that day. 
</P>
<P>
 To the friend, it was no accident the cop said the first words. "Mike knew 
that it would set him off," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He enjoyed the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't seem like a game to police brass, though, when Consiglio's wife 
called some time later to warn that Brambles, in fact, might be in danger. She 
was divorcing the former prosecutor in part because of his obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, 12 officers were assigned to guard Brambles around the clock. And 
two detectives from robbery-homicide visited Consiglio at his new job, as 
counsel to an Italian marble import company in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you assure us (Brambles is) safe?" one detective asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "From me," Consiglio replied. 
</P>
<P>
 When they left, he began muttering -- about his wife, who was gone now, and 
Brambles, who would only be enhanced by the episode, as a cop at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some ------ life," Consiglio said. "Gettin' older and older and not gettin' 
------ nowhere." The Code of Silence Cracks 
</P>
<P>
 When local attorney Susan Harrison turned to the organized-crime division in 
late 1988, she asked for Brambles -- she'd heard he was a "stand-up guy." 
Harrison was working on a civil suit over ownership of the Palace nightclub and 
was worried about a young lawyer on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the organized-crime division? The lawyer was New York transplant John 
Scotto, grandson of Anthony Anastasia, the legendary Murder Inc. figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the civil case was a criminal one. Then-Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner personally 
announced the 1989 indictment of Scotto for attempted "strong-arm" extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it was another impressive notch in Brambles' service revolver. 
But then transcripts of the grand jury proceedings were turned over to the 
defense, as is routine in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Right in black and white was the stunner: testimony by William H. Seeley, an 
LAPD veteran recently assigned to the division. Seeley told grand jurors of a 
disturbing incident during a photo lineup, in which victims pick out suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 With one witness, Seeley said, he saw Brambles "take his finger and very 
deliberately put it under one individual," tipping the witness off to which was 
the right photo. Rigging the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was inappropriate and, I felt, unprofessional," Seeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor promptly called Brambles before the grand jury to swear he had 
"not at all" tipped off the witness. But the matter already had gone beyond the 
panel -- Seeley said he alerted his supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, colleagues had been aware of outsiders' charges that Brambles took 
liberties, but "it was always against bad guys, and they never had any proof," 
recalled a retired organized-crime detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a force often criticized for its "code of silence," an inside voice 
had been added to the chorus -- eventually reaching Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens," Gates said of the warnings from the ranks. "(Officers) come 
forward and say, 'I can't buy this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Seeley, though, paid a price. The unit became a chilly place for him. He soon 
transferred out, to a Valley division. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 5, 1989, Brambles also was moved, to West Los Angeles. He filled an 
opening for a detective supervisor -- in the auto theft unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Brambles was called as a witness in the Scotto case. And although 
the lawyer eventually agreed to a plea bargain, his attorney first got a chance 
to question Brambles on his transfer. He was asked, "Is that of your choosing, 
sir?" "Yes," Brambles insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was grilled about his ties to Harrison, whose complaint started the 
case. "A business relationship," Brambles said. 
</P>
<P>
 With those answers, he had given his foes all the ammunition they needed. They 
had good reason to suspect he had been forced out of the organized-crime 
division. And they knew he and Harrison were more than business associates -- 
the pair had fallen for each other, prompting Brambles to be divorced from his 
wife, a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Consiglio copied the transcripts and sent them to Internal Affairs. 
Eventually, a police Board of Rights found Brambles guilty of giving false 
testimony, although it had sympathy for him. "As a result of your tenacious and 
diligent investigation of organized-crime figures, the defense attorneys . . . 
were using the department's disciplinary system . . . to impute, frustrate and 
equalize your investigation," one commander wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be impossible to blame his other clashes on the foes of law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, after the LAPD's own Administrative Vice unit arrested Adams after 
years of unfettered madaming, she called Brambles as a witness to boost her 
defense -- that she had bought immunity from arrest by providing police with 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Pam Bozanich, who later gained fame in the Menendez case, said 
Brambles confronted her outside the courthouse and told her "Adams would never 
do a day in custody." 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Whose side are you working on?' " 
</P>
<P>
 An Administrative Vice detective became suspicious, too, after seeing Brambles 
"with his nose in our files. I almost went to fist city with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brambles prevailed when prosecutors agreed to let Adams off with 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, whose relationship with Brambles lasted three years, said the 
clashes took a toll. After he "lost his elite position," she said, he became 
disillusioned and depressed and developed serious ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
 But you could never really know what was going on in the head of a guy who 
once earned his stripes in undercover narcotics jobs, where "you can lose your 
life if you're not good at lying." 
</P>
<P>
 What she did know was this: "I would never ever ever want to be an enemy of 
Mike Brambles." 
</P>
<P>
 He left a few at West L.A. before he retired in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Another police disciplinary board found that in 1992 he put an "obscene 
photograph" on the desk of a female detective -- showing him bending over, 
exposing his buttocks and genitalia. Then he cursed out a watch commander. 
</P>
<P>
 It pained pals like Tom Convey, an old partner in the organized-crime unit, to 
see Brambles' career descend into feuds that were intense even for the LAPD, 
where office politics has never been a child's game. The last time they spoke, 
Convey said, "He was still working in West L.A., (but) talked about retirement 
and moving to Las Vegas. He was gonna have a home built . . . get married and 
live happily ever after." Mike Brambles Goes to Jail 
</P>
<P>
 On July 5, the LAPD announced that Brambles had been picked up in Nevada for a 
two-month string of stickups. Although he had moved to the gambling mecca upon 
retirement, he was making twice weekly trips back to visit his two children -- 
and in his spare time allegedly robbed restaurants and small shops in the 
Melrose area, Mid-Wilshire district and West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A sole gunman was reported in each case, usually arriving at closing. A 
detective said Brambles became a suspect by a "one chance in a billion" 
occurrence, when the clerk at a robbed dry cleaners saw him at an Inglewood 
motel and said he was definitely the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles insisted police had "the wrong person." 
</P>
<P>
 He cast a depressed figure as he was led into court for arraignment Thursday 
after extradition from Nevada. Eyes to the ground, he tried to avoid the 
cameras that had come to record the law enforcement version of the 
man-bites-dog twist -- cop turns robber, allegedly. 
</P>
<P>
 His new wife, Kathryn, an airline employee, was frantically trying to raise 
$200,000 bail. "I love him and I believe in him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles' lawyers said they may argue misidentification. "After being with 
LAPD for 23 years," asked Santa Monica attorney Audrey Winograde, "who would do 
. . . penny-ante little robberies with no disguises?" 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest had very different meanings for those whose lives had become 
intertwined with his. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked and yet not shocked," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggle with the idea that he could be guilty of this," Convey said. 
</P>
<P>
 So does Consiglio. "Armed robberies?" he asked, sounding almost like the 
defense lawyer, doubting the notion. But then he accepted it as vindication and 
began making calls to get "Mikey boy's" booking picture. He was going to blow 
it up 8-by-10 and pass out the glossies. "There'll be plenty of takers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison? She too struggled to understand why he might have done it. 
Self-destruction? A cocky belief that he could get away with it? Or perhaps the 
simple motive he once saw in the mob -- money? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think he was a good investigator," she said. "Did he stretch the 
limits? . . . I firmly believe he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he did it much more than others," she added -- but to her that 
was no excuse. His predicament is "all his own doing." 
</P>
<P>
 And then Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills madam saw a frame job. "All the infighting and knocking each 
other down and ratting each other out -- it's unbelievable what they do to each 
other in this LAPD!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So she asked her own attorney to visit Brambles. Then she got a call from the 
ex-detective, from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (asked) if I'd be a witness for him and I said, 'Anytime.' I'm gonna tell 
them all the good work he did." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who helped Mike Brambles climb the LAPD ladder even threatened to 
pull out a few names from that little black book every madam is rumored to 
have, but which never seems to appear. "If they don't lay off," she said, "I'm 
gonna sing like a canary."

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a thousand-yard stare, Diane Haywood gazes past the rusty marquee of the 
Cloud 9 Motel in Cypress, scoffing at the sign's metallic, cartoon-like cloud 
turned neon nest for a family of pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha! This joint ain't no Cloud Nine, that's for sure," she says ruefully. 
"Cloud Nine means being on Easy Street, someplace like heaven. This place is 
more Motel Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Haywood, her husband and two children have lived in places like the 
Cloud 9, paying $25 a night for run-down little rooms where the curtains smell 
of mildew and old cigarettes -- where four people crowd into one 
bumpy-mattressed bed and meals are cooked in a Crockpot perched on a rickety 
three-legged chair. 
</P>
<P>
 A scowling Haywood talks of the foulest part of paying by the night for the 
roof over her head: The nasty girls -- the hookers who even proposition 
10-year-old boys and whose theatrical moans can sometimes be heard at night, 
providing a perverse soundtrack to the staccato blink of the red-and-white neon 
on the Cloud 9 marquee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahhh," Haywood says scornfully, "the motel life." 
</P>
<P>
 Once considered as American as jazz, many motels have fallen on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many clean, comfortable motels still line America's roadways, more 
and more of their big-city cousins are magnets for crime and for the down and 
out, including some immigrant families and others like Haywood, who cannot 
scrape up enough money for a permanent place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 So on boulevards and back streets throughout Southern California, newly 
arrived families from Iowa and Guatemala City rub elbows with chronic petty 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary of such crime and urban blight, cities throughout the Southland are 
getting tough with motel owners who have allowed their properties to run 
rampant with drugs and prostitution. Threatening to go after motel business 
licenses, neighborhood leaders, politicians and police have joined the 
crackdown, stressing that if the owners cannot clean up their act, they may 
soon be out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley along Sepulveda Boulevard, on a stretch of South 
Figueroa Street near Downtown Los Angeles, in pockets of the Inland Empire and 
in Orange County cities such as Cypress and Anaheim, officials are keeping an 
eye on the goings-on at a nether world of tacky motels. In some cases, the 
owners are fighting back, threatening to take city officials to court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles has recently stepped up its revocation process -- a strategy 
requiring owners of businesses deemed "public nuisances" to prevent illegal 
activities on their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean hiring security guards, installing better lighting, walls and 
fences or even closing the business during certain hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The revocation process is prompted by citizen complaints or action by police 
or local politicians. Officials call a community hearing where residents voice 
their complaints. The number of such citations has increased dramatically, city 
zoning officials say -- from perhaps one or two in 1989 to more than 50 motels 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * In response to complaints from residents, Anaheim has contacted a half-dozen 
owners of problem motels along Beach Boulevard, suggesting ways they can stop 
an ongoing crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The program includes offering motels security lighting at no cost and a tip 
sheet on how to drive away drug dealers and prostitutes. "If they don't work 
with us, we're going to bring them before the City Council to terminate their 
land-use permits," said John Pool, manager of Anaheim's code enforcement 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 * In March, in a move that has become a routine volley in the new war against 
problem motels, Los Angeles zoning officials cited 27 code violations at five 
Van Nuys motels deemed magnets for prostitution and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two of the motels have filed appeals that eventually could reach the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year, even tiny San Clemente required that all adult entertainment 
businesses, including motels, be specifically zoned in an industrial park at 
least 1,000 feet from residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is considering a non-fee permit system for motels. "It would give us 
leverage if they get out of line -- we can revoke their permit," said City 
Manager Mike Parness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For many communities, motels are the very symbol of cities crumbling at their 
core. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists in poorer areas claim the motels persist because city governments do 
not care enough to see that they are renovated or torn down -- as they have 
been in wealthier beach areas where vocal homeowners' groups watch questionable 
activity with vigilance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities themselves are part of the problem," said Tom Henry, land-use deputy 
for Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs. "We've got to help provide these 
places with an alternative client, perhaps by encouraging industrial business 
to return to these areas, blue-collar people who might use motels. In the 
meantime, the message is clear: We will not tolerate anyone renting to known 
prostitutes, pimps and druggies." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn., said residents are 
tired of motel-related crime flaunted in their face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outraged by what I see," he said. "Motel drug deals in broad daylight, 
prostitutes soliciting men at stoplights just like they owned the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 This obviously wasn't what Pasadena architect Arthur Heineman had in mind when 
he opened the nation's first motel in San Luis Obispo in 1924 -- paving the way 
for an army of independent motels catering to the travel-bound whims of a 
post-World War II America on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 For generations, motels epitomized the wanderlust of a country aching for 
wide-open spaces. With their funky roadside attractions and comfortable rooms, 
Mom-and-Pop motels allowed America to feel at home away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, the roof caved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Major freeways were built, bypassing many old motel-lined roads. Chains nearly 
drove others to extinction, sending them to the shady edge of town to scrounge 
for a new breed of customer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, motels have become the road's version of legitimate pop art, a 
lure to photographers, artists, writers and filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Alfred Hitchcock's horrific image of the Bates Motel in "Psycho," 
motels soon came to represent an American pop culture icon gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1940s magazine article, J. Edgar Hoover charged that motels were haunted 
by "nomadic prostitutes, hardened criminals, white slavers and promiscuous 
college students." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, officials say, the taint remains. In Los Angeles, even the 
motel names can be suggestive: The Trojan. The Nity Night. And The Rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Sgt. John Girard has made a career out of keeping tabs on 
such trouble spots. For 13 years, until a recent transfer, he tracked crime 
rates at a string of independent motels along Sepulveda Boulevard in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon for one of these motels to have 200 or more police calls 
for service in a single year," he said. "For people who live there, it's a sad 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Take the 19-year-old woman arrested for prostitution. "Her own stepfather was 
her pimp," Gerard said. "The tale got sadder. Two months later they found her 
body dumped in Santa Clarita." 
</P>
<P>
 Like J. Edgar Hoover, Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude has strong 
words for the most troublesome urban motels. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a cancer," he said. "And when you've got a cancer, you've got to cut 
it out. We've got to close them down. Why? To save a life, to save the life of 
the community. Our community has a cancer sore and we've got to do something to 
correct it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cypress, Police Sgt. Gordon Re said some motels along a ramshackle stretch 
of Lincoln Boulevard are repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent Fire Department inspection at one motel, nearly all its 40 
rooms failed. "The only one that passed was the manager's," said Re, who heads 
the narcotics unit for the Cypress Police Department. "He wasn't stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Unwary tourists from attractions such as Knotts Berry Farm have accidentally 
stumbled onto spots like the Cloud 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes them 24 hours to realize they've wandered into one of the most 
Godforsaken places on Earth," Re said. "They don't have places like this back 
in Iowa." 
</P>
<P>
 Cloud 9 co-owner Sam Bhakta denied that his motel is a trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're liars," he said of police and customers. "There are no prostitutes at 
my motel. One time I see cops take somebody away. How can we stop these things? 
We never know what people do inside their rooms. We don't have movie cameras to 
watch them." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Diane Haywood feels like a customer at the Motel California: She's 
checked in. But will she ever leave? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our dream," she said, "to put this place behind us." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With a broom and a frown, Rocky Patel sweeps the last greasy remnants of the 
french fries and Big Mac from the entrance to his Naseeb Motel on South 
Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
 In his native Hindi, Naseeb means "good luck." But Patel and his parents have 
had little of that in the 14 years they have operated a motel in the southern 
shadow of Downtown Los Angeles, along what some consider to be the shadiest 
urban motel strip on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the Ash Motel at 45th and South Figueroa and The Satellite at 120th 
lies a wasteland of flophouses that police say are havens for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 There is precious little of the charm these motels boasted during the heyday 
of the 1940s and '50s: Paint jobs and new roofs are 20 years overdue. Customers 
are greeted through a bulletproof window, through which proprietors squint like 
that gruff gatekeeper at the Emerald City. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no Oz. The previous night, Patel said, two prostitutes fought over 
a client, pummeling one another with fast food. A dispirited Patel was left to 
clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 At 31, Rocky Patel is already an urban realist. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these places run on prostitution -- every last one of them," he said. 
"Nobody will tell you that, but it's a fact of life on this motel drag. It's 
the nature of the place: You've got a bed, television, privacy. In this area, 
that means prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
 He flicks a french fry with his broom and offers a tour of the place he was 
once proud to promote. The 1992 riots reduced the number of long-term residents 
-- working people who brought stability to the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, Patel has repaired vandalism in the rooms: Holes punched in 
the walls, burned-up bedspreads and roach clips left on the floor. Then there 
was the shattered chair in the shower: "Why drag a chair into the shower?" he 
asked. "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 In Room No. 3, he points to bullet holes in the curtains. Gang members 
recently peppered the place in a new kind of urban crime: The motel drive-by. 
</P>
<P>
 One customer died. "It was bloody," Patel said. "We had to close down the room 
for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 For Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), the South Figueroa drag will always be 
remembered as the place rock 'n' roll great Sam Cooke died. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, Cooke -- who sold more than 10 million records, including his hit 
"You Send Me," -- was shot and killed by a motel manager after he burst into 
her office-apartment, searching for a woman he had met at a Hollywood party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I pass that South Figueroa strip," Waters said, "I always think 
about it -- Sam Cooke died there." 
</P>
<P>
 The congresswoman, who represents Hawthorne, Inglewood, Gardena and segments 
of South-Central Los Angeles, said the area still represents trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The glut of problem motels, she said, grows out of the fact that many 
residents of poor neighborhoods are unaware of their civic power to do anything 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike their beach neighbors, residents in poor neighborhoods just don't 
question the right of these motels to be there in the first place," she said. 
"In richer communities, people just say, 'No way, we won't stand for this.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But poor people don't always recognize that power. They say, 'Well, you've 
got the land. You must have a right to be there.' If these people started 
bugging City Hall, maybe elected officials would be more willing to take a look 
at the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Detective Rick McElroy has a few weapons against motels: "Red-light" 
abatement laws and court injunctions. But McElroy, who works in the 
Administrative Vice unit, said the jury is out on whether law enforcement can 
have any effect on troublesome motels. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of the Nity Nite. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the South Figueroa motel was a hotbed of prostitution, police say. 
Then, last November, a court injunction closed the place for several months. 
When it reopened, there was new management and refurbished rooms. And, in an 
attempt to clean up its image, a new name: The Ding Dong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something I wanted to try," McElroy said of the closure. "There were 
just so many prostitute arrests there last year. So far, since the injunction, 
there haven't been any. But we're keeping our eyes peeled." 
</P>
<P>
 Many inner-city motels have gotten the message. Like the Ding Dong, they post 
signs warning against bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome," the sign reads. "No guests. No drugs. No hourly rates. No 
prostitutes. No refunds." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the motel problem, officials say, is cultural. Many are run by 
immigrant families whose struggle to survive causes them to look the other way 
rather than make trouble for customers, even though they're breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Maoson Young, president of the 1,200-member Greater Los Angeles Motel Assn. 
and owner of the Ash Motel on South Figueroa, said his members -- many from 
Taiwan and India -- see their motels as clean businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motel business is good for families. We can all live in there and take 
care of our kids. It's why you have so many foreigners running these places." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad neighborhoods, he said, bring prostitution: 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't blame motels. You chase prostitutes from one place, they go to 
another. Like cockroaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they thrived in the same era as jazz, representing some of the same 
alternative freedom of expression, aging motels -- unlike the music -- remain 
out of step with the present day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz music today is still a thrill," said Chester Liebs, a University of 
Vermont sociology professor and author of "Mainstreet to Miracle Mile: American 
Roadside Architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 "But motels, especially the ones in large urban areas, are like jet travel -- 
a onetime thrill that now can be quite a bore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony is these places once represented a sense of freedom for Americans. 
Now it's another kind of life -- one of being trapped." 
</P>
<P>
 No need to tell that to Mike and Sandy Ross. The pair live at the Gates Motel 
on South Figueroa. While working sporadically at blue-collar jobs, they can't 
afford an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 So they rent by the day. Mike knocks a few bucks off the $35 fee by providing 
impromptu security at the motel, breaking up fights among street wanderers, 
giving the strong-arm to thugs who try to levy "taxes" on motel guests. 
</P>
<P>
 They're tired of eating Big Macs and drinking 7-Eleven coffee. "For us, a 
night on the town is two chili-cheese dogs for $1.29," Mike said. "That's why I 
stay drunk. It makes motel life easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a film crew has moved into the Hiway Host in North Hills to shoot 
scenes for "Number One Fan," a film in which a Midwestern woman stalks her 
favorite movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rundown motel," said film location manager Dominick Clark, "is the perfect 
place for a fringe character like this to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Cloud 9, Connie Moreno knows the real fringe means struggling to 
rear her four children in a small two-room unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the parking lot at the Peacock Motel, 40-year-old Greg Reyna, a recent 
prison parolee, worries about how to keep his 10-year-old son, Russell, from 
repeating the crimes of the father. 
</P>
<P>
 For the youngest generation of motel dwellers, this is an unkind childhood: 
Growing up in parking lots, playing on rusty swing sets that have gone mostly 
unused since their parents were their age, trying to stay away from trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing across a litter-strewn lot, watching his son play games with Moreno's 
boys, Reyna knows rearing a child here will be tough. Sometimes, from the 
windows of their respective motel rooms, the two parents catch each others' 
eyes and shake their heads in sadness.

GOP PRESSES FOR DELAY IN HEALTH REFORM ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican leaders, meeting Saturday in Los Angeles to gear up for the 1994 
campaign, demonstrated a growing conviction that the country and their party 
will be better off if no national health care reform legislation is approved 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoning long-held assumptions about the political cost of opposing health 
reform legislation, an increasing number of Republican leaders say they believe 
their candidates could overcome being branded legislative "gridlockers" by 
arguing that they supported other versions of health reform and that President 
Clinton's proposed solution was worse than the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The complexities of health care have created sharp divisions within both 
parties over the issue. For example, some Democrats are opposed to a national 
health plan that would include abortion as a covered benefit while others 
insist upon such coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, White House strategists have always assumed that Clinton 
would need bipartisan backing to win enactment of a comprehensive reform 
package that he has made the centerpiece of his domestic agenda. The shift in 
Republican thinking will make it harder than ever for the President to 
accomplish this goal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Republican National Committee's summer meeting Saturday, former Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney, a 1996 presidential hopeful, won resounding applause 
from committee members when he declared: "There is absolutely no reason why we 
have to have a (health) package passed by November." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the committee members from 13 states in the GOP's Southern 
region, stretching from Florida to Texas, unanimously adopted a resolution 
calling for a delay in health care legislation now pending in Congress until 
after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, GOP leaders believed that a majority of Americans were 
demanding some form of health care reform and would turn against public 
officials who stood in its way. Recent national polls, however, have found 
dwindling support for Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans say they are reacting not only to polling data but to what they 
view as Clinton's intransigence. They complain that Clinton has refused to 
agree to significant compromises on such issues as requiring all employers to 
pay for their workers' coverage, even though he seems unable to win over enough 
members of his own party in Congress to pass the sort of legislation he favors. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP officials do say, however, that their emerging view could be altered 
if circumstances change on Capitol Hill, where debate on health care is 
entering its climactic stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they come up with something I can live with, I would support it, " said 
California state party Chairman Tirso del Junco, a surgeon. "But I do not 
believe that the plans presently on the table would be approved by the American 
people. To rush this through is bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the Democrats "don't have a 
plan, they're just driving around the country," a reference to the half-dozen 
White House-backed bus caravans traveling to Washington from various parts of 
the nation to boost public support for the President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing to happen would be for a good bill to pass," Republican 
National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour said in an interview Saturday. "But 
events of the last few months have served to confirm the belief that it's right 
to take the position that no bill is better than a bad bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney, at a news conference following his talk, said that based on his 
travels around the country campaigning for GOP candidates, he has concluded 
that the "vast majority of the American people are going to be suspicious of 
something that's passed in the dark of night and rushed out to the floor in a 
big cardboard box that nobody has had the chance to analyze or examine." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia GOP Chairman Patrick McSweeney, one of the Southern leaders who voted 
for the resolution urging postponement of congressional action, said the 
proposal was intended to influence GOP lawmakers, particularly Dole, who is the 
author of the principal GOP approach to health care. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, Dole touted his own reform proposal, which offers fewer 
benefits at lower cost than Democratic-backed alternatives. But he also sounded 
willing to consider waiting until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to do it all this year," he said in the closing address to 
committee members. "We don't have to do any of it this year. You know, Congress 
meets every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of bright spots to (acting) next year," he added, referring to 
Republican expectations of major gains in the November elections that would 
give the party more clout in the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida GOP Chairman Tom Slade made the same point in explaining his support 
for delaying action. "There is going to be a different Congress in 1995," he 
contended. "And it will be a Congress more reflective of the wishes of the 
American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the timing of the Republican remarks, Democrats are likely to view the 
"wait-until-next-year" theme as simply an effort to gain leverage in bargaining 
over the pending legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts claim that the Republican position has been strengthened by 
the President's ambiguity last week in his remarks to the National Governors' 
Assn. At least for a day he appeared willing to accept less than 100% coverage 
of Americans, a retreat from his longstanding demand for truly "universal 
coverage." He later said his comment had been misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 Another point said to help the Republicans is that they have offered 
alternative solutions of their own to the health care problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is never a loss for a politician who can go back to his district and 
tell the voters, 'I tried to do something that would have helped, but the other 
guys didn't want to do it,' " said UCLA political scientist John Petrocik, who 
sometimes works as a GOP polling consultant. "Among voters you get credit for 
trying to do the right thing, even if what you tried didn't produce anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Also joining in the chorus deriding the Administration's health care efforts 
was California Gov. Pete Wilson, who addressed committee members at their 
Saturday breakfast session. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to excessively detailed government regulations for buying felt tip 
pins, Wilson said: "If government can do that to buying a felt tip pen, think 
what it can do with health care. It will take them a hundred pages just to say, 
'Take two aspirin and call me in the morning.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson talked to committee members about economic growth, crime prevention and 
other issues that have helped him narrow the once formidable lead held by his 
Democratic challenger, Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 He was introduced by Barbour, who said: "The sunny beaches of California are 
strewn with the bones of people who underestimated Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no more important election in the United States for Republicans than 
the reelection of Pete Wilson," he said.

DISNEY RIDE GETS NEW LAUGHING MATTER; THEME PARK: JUNGLE CRUISE SPIEL IS 
REVISED TO COVER NEW GROUND AND APPEAL TO '90S VISITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the fierce Disney jungle, where jokes rain down on tourists like an evening 
at the Improv, only the strong -- and the really corny -- survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of a recent Jungle Cruise remodeling project, Disney comedy 
writers embarked on a major revision of its famed boat ride spiel, burying 
nearly one-fifth of the shtick that has been drawing guffaws and groans for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are old knee-slappers like the one about the crocodile and the gorilla, 
written in 1980. Time was when boatloads of tourists who passed by the two 
creatures fighting over a backpack, would hear their skippers intone: "Now, 
there's a croc with a snappy personality. He's going to get himself a knuckle 
sandwich if he isn't careful." 
</P>
<P>
 "This just isn't funny anymore," said Disney senior show writer Christine 
Goosman, who supervised the revision, the first significant one since 1985. 
"Our view in the '90s is different than the '80s, and altogether different than 
the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the movie "The African Queen," the Jungle Cruise ride in 
Adventureland has consistently been among Disneyland's top 10 attractions since 
the Anaheim amusement park opened in 1955. Guests glide along the river in 
open-air boats passing through lush foliage and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Though guests cruise by lifelike rhinos, hippos, and elephants, the ride is 
known primarily for its comic appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jokes are so corny," said 39-year-old West Covina resident Susan A. 
Hidalgo, on board with her seven children. "That's what makes the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction's jokes, like the jungle, has its own resilient ecosystem. For 
every wisecrack and one-liner weeded out in the review, another took root in 
the 37-page routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The botanist told me bamboo can grow to be six stories tall," skippers are 
now telling their passengers. "I think it's seven . . . but then that's another 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the script was spruced up to make it funnier to today's 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go through this (new) script I start laughing," said Goosman, 
who wrote most of the witticisms. "That's so tacky, I know. You can't laugh at 
your own jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two key principles guided Goosman and her staff as they searched new terrains 
for Disney humor. The material not only had to be funny, but it had to enhance 
the ride's safari theme. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a joke about an elephant's mate being the most feared animal in 
the jungle was bounced because it lacked informational value, Goosman said. The 
bit was supplanted by facts about an average elephant's weight (six tons), 
height (10 feet) and life span (70 years). 
</P>
<P>
 Just when the ride starts sounding like a zoology lecture, guests are hit with 
this new zinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to be around when they blew out the candles on his cake." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to move the story forward," Goosman said. "We just don't have 
stand-ups up there telling joke after joke. It's not a comedy club." 
</P>
<P>
 New jokes also had to conform to set alterations, which took place during a 
major Jungle Cruise renovation over the last six months. Boat-riding guests on 
the five-acre waterway will no longer hear the crack about Shriners building an 
ancient Cambodian temple. The scene (and the joke) had to be scuttled to make 
way for the new Indiana Jones thrill ride under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Indiana Jones ride opens next year, the lines of thrill-seeking 
guests will be visible to the passing jungle boats. Not to worry, the innocent 
bystanders will become part of the new act. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people disappear up that walk," skippers will soon say, pointing to the 
Indiana Jones line, "I sometimes hear hideous screams of untold terror. Then I 
compose myself and resume the tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the ride's former entrance was replaced by an enormous two-story 
Victorian-style home. The structure, parts of which are overgrown with 
vegetation, is designed to look like a trading post in 1936 colonial Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 As they snake their way through the building, guests are meant to slowly 
absorb the '30s atmosphere as they pass by six elaborate "vignettes" or rooms 
that recall the era. 
</P>
<P>
 While writing copy for a "wireless" vignette, Goosman became acquainted with 
another comedy restriction -- the delicate tastes of Disney. Originally, she 
proposed having a British broadcaster dryly making this pun: "As William 
Congreve so eloquently said, music has charms to soothe the savage breast." 
</P>
<P>
 But the "B-word" wasn't about to pass Mickey's censors. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we recorded it, this line continued to dog me," Goosman said. "People 
would say, 'Didn't you quote that wrong? Isn't that beast? ' And then they'd 
say, 'Can you say breast at Disney?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Goosman's counter-argument that Magic Kingdom restaurants served chicken 
breasts failed to sway her critics. The line was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The approved version, which can be heard crackling over the radio, says 
simply: "Here's a charming new melody for your listening pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 However, few jokes were squashed because of fragile Disney sensibilities, said 
Goosman, who has written Disney comedy for more than 10 years. Jokes that 
failed to make it into the jungle, in the end, just didn't work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll write things and you'll laugh your head off," said Goosman, who 
included skippers in the collaborative comic process. "But we are dealing with 
an audience here. It might ruin their day" if they were offended by a joke. 
"So, you have to pay a lot of attention to the reaction of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The ride's jokes frequently live or die by their delivery, Goosman said. 
That's why each skipper is given a menu of four "approved alternatives" they 
can use in each bit during the ride. Which item the skippers choose depend on 
their own manner and their sense of the 32-person audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every skipper has his own style," said Fullerton resident Eric, 26, who has 
hammed up countless jokes in four seasons as a skipper. (It's Disneyland policy 
not to release the last names of park employees.) "I'm very over the top. They 
are others who are very dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, who quickly memorized the new script material, said, "There's more 
interaction with guests on this ride than any other and that's what makes it 
fun. What makes it work is when people groan and make faces." 
</P>
<P>
 His style won over two teen-age sisters who laughed their way through most of 
the eight-minute ride. Sacramento-area residents Blanca Cervantes, 15, and her 
sister Esmeralda, 16, had boarded the Jungle Cruise four years ago, but could 
not notice any major differences on their recent trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed pretty much the same to me," said Esmeralda, a high school senior. 
"Just the way he was talking made it funny." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of revisions, a few time-honored jokes keep creeping back into some 
of the skipper's patter. According to the new script, when the boat emerges 
from the jungle, the skipper can say: "And now, we come to the most dangerous 
part of our journey: the return to civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 But a couple of skippers on a recent hot afternoon deviated from the script, 
tacking on the previously acceptable "and the Southern Californian freeways" to 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway remark upset art director Kim Irvine, in charge of concept design 
at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no continuity," Irvine said. "It's 1936 and then a freeway reference. 
Bam, there goes your whole visual setup." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some of the attraction's jokes are as much a part of the ride as 
the hippos or the shrunken head salesman and probably will never be cast out of 
the jungle, Goosman said. For instance, on rainy days, you might hear a skipper 
tell one of Goosman's favorite oldies as the vessel winds its way through its 
tranquil surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please remember," the 30-year-old line goes, "that the tighter together you 
sit, the better the heating system on the boat works." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love that joke," Goosman said.

WHITE HOUSE AWAITING PANETTA'S PRESCRIPTION; POLITICS: NEW STAFF CHIEF IS 
EXPECTED TO TRY TO SUBSTITUTE DISCIPLINE FOR DISARRAY. WILL CLINTON TAKE THE 
MEDICINE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now comes Panetta time. 
</P>
<P>
 First there was Betsey Wright, then, briefly, Mickey Kantor, then James 
Carville. Now it is Leon Panetta's turn to impose order and discipline on a 
leader who, for most of his public life, has resisted both. 
</P>
<P>
 In two decades of holding public office, Bill Clinton has alternated between 
two very different styles of management. His preferred style -- the one now all 
too familiar to Americans from his first 18 months in the Oval Office -- is 
loose, non-hierarchical, unstructured to the verge of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 The other, to which he periodically has agreed to submit himself, is more 
tightly controlled, disciplined and restrictive. Wright, Kantor and Carville, 
each in different ways, enforced such discipline on Clinton, but only 
temporarily and only after deep crises that imperiled Clinton's political 
future -- the loss of the Arkansas governorship after his first term in 1980, 
the threat of disaster during the New Hampshire primary in February of 1992 and 
the experience of sinking into third place behind George Bush and Ross Perot 
later that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton's thing is that when he's in trouble, he acts wisely, but it takes 
trouble to make him wise," said one aide who has observed the President for 
several years. "The problem is, when you're as visible a person as the 
President of the United States, you can't afford much of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The question facing Leon E. Panetta, who officially took over last week as 
Clinton's new White House chief of staff, is whether the President's current 
troubles are once again deep enough to enforce some hard-won wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's own response to that question remains in doubt because the evidence 
from Panetta's first days on the job is mixed. Although Panetta has made some 
changes in White House procedures, he so far has not tipped his hand on 
personnel moves that many see as a key test of the scope of his authority. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be little doubt, however, about the belief among staff members that 
the White House's current troubles are severe enough to require major change. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half into Clinton's presidency and facing some of their toughest 
legislative battles, the President's aides are dispirited, inward-looking and 
frustrated about an opposition that has given them no quarter, a President 
whose personal frailties have exposed them to political peril and a staff 
system that has proved unable so far to consistently deliver timely decisions 
and effective strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different from what it was a year ago," said a White House official -- 
one of more than a dozen senior- and mid-level aides who talked at length, 
after guarantee of anonymity, about the challenges facing Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, during Clinton's first, disastrous, spring, "there was a feeling 
of potential free fall. Nobody knew if this presidency could pull it out. After 
victories on the budget, NAFTA, there was a sense we could make things work. 
Now there's a frustration that we find ourselves once again in a difficult 
situation. It's like, 'Why are we back in this place again?' " the official 
said. "It's like 'Groundhog Day,' " the official added, referring to the movie 
in which the main character finds himself trapped in a time warp, constantly 
repeating the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 A second official praised Panetta's predecessor, Thomas (Mack) McLarty, for 
helping produce a White House of unusual collegiality and a minimal amount of 
bureaucratic back-stabbing. But, the official conceded, the system has been 
plagued with "sloppiness that caused us to get less credit than we should." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never really had a long-term strategy," said a third official. 
"Clinton's had a long-term vision that guided him, but the campaign was always 
a rolling business plan and the Administration has always been day-to-day 
crisis management . . . . People are frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 That frustration has only been heightened by recent events -- a series of 
shifting policies on Haiti, an international economic summit in which Clinton 
offered a new trade proposal only to have it unceremoniously shot down by 
French opposition, and a still-confusing set of presidential statements last 
Tuesday concerning his approach to health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade snafu has led to recriminations within the White House from aides 
saying that poor staff work failed either to detect the French opposition or 
head it off in time to spare the President a public embarrassment. The health 
care remarks prompted a wild 48 hours of White House damage-control efforts, 
accompanied by substantial bafflement on the part of Clinton's aides about 
whether their leader was floating a trial balloon without telling anyone or 
just succumbing to a moment of undisciplined thinking out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this mix steps Panetta, a one-time Republican and Richard Nixon 
Administration official who lost his job in Nixon's Department of Health, 
Education and Welfare because of his advocacy of civil rights and went on to be 
a highly regarded Democratic congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, 56, served eight terms in Congress for a district centered on 
Monterey. His expertise on the causes and potential cures for the federal 
deficit brought him to the attention of Clinton, who in 1992 was searching for 
the right person to head the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he faces even greater challenges with a mandate to change Clinton's White 
House. Panetta's ability in that regard will be helped by the existing 
frustration on the staff level. But two other forces push in the other 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 One force is Clinton's own instinctive resistance to a strongly centralized 
staff system. Longtime friends and associates attribute that resistance to 
several factors. Most important, they say, while Clinton does not have a deep 
preference for disorder, he likes the fact that a decentralized system means 
only he knows all the cards in play at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a 100% control freak who feels he needs to run absolutely 
everything, and he's learning as he goes along, but he is 60% or 70% or 80%," 
one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Clinton tends to push back against any system that he feels 
presents him with too few options, and he likes to hear from many different 
advisers before deciding which option he will choose. When aides tried in the 
past to limit the number of officials invited to White House meetings, Clinton 
has agreed in theory, only to later ask, sometimes angrily, why one or another 
adviser was not present. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, any move to streamline the staff and to produce the sort of "clear 
lines of authority" Panetta has publicly spoken of would inevitably reduce the 
freedom to roam currently enjoyed by Clinton's top aides, including his 
counselor, Bruce Lindsey; his senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos, Deputy 
Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes and economic policy chief Robert E. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of so many overlapping and loosely defined portfolios has often 
led to confusion about where, exactly, the White House stands on a given issue, 
exasperating members of Congress and complicating legislative negotiations. 
Moreover, the absence of clear lines has allowed the staff to cluster around 
whatever issue was hottest at the moment, leaving no one to watch other areas 
until they suddenly burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a sense that everyone at the top gets involved in every decision," 
said a mid-level aide. "We just keep packing more people into the top of the 
triangle as senior advisers and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't necessarily have to fire people or demote them, but you do have to 
narrow their portfolios a bit," the aide added. "It's easy in a campaign to 
have an inner circle that meets on every issue, but believe it or not, running 
the federal government is bigger and more complex, with more people knocking at 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another frustrated official: "Just getting people all to report to the 
same place would be a significant accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the evidence is mixed on the question of whether Clinton is ready to 
abandon the personal control he derives from a loose staff system and to allow 
Panetta to play the role assigned to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta has taken several important early actions. Last week, for example, he 
intervened in stalled negotiations over the crime bill, telling members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus that the White House would not support their 
insistence that the bill include a provision allowing Death Row inmates to 
challenge their sentences by using statistical evidence of racial 
discrimination. Before Panetta's arrival, Congress had been unable to get a 
clear answer from the Administration on the issue as different groups of 
Clinton aides held often-conflicting negotiations with opposing groups in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta's willingness to get involved on that issue cheered many members of 
the staff. McLarty has good relations with many in Congress, but "pretty much 
confined himself to economic stuff and business issues like NAFTA," one 
official said. "Leon's likely to be a more active congressional negotiator 
across a broader range of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, added another official, "everyone loves Mack, but people would 
tear their hair out because he wouldn't pull the trigger, or if he pulled it, 
it wouldn't stay pulled." Panetta, by contrast, "seems to be willing to make 
decisions stick." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta also has made several symbolically important changes in White House 
routine. He has, for example, issued an order requiring that all White House 
hiring and payroll decisions be cleared by the chief of staff's office -- 
authority that McLarty surprisingly did not demand. He also instituted a 7:30 
a.m. meeting for the most senior White House staff members -- a move that has 
caused grumbling among those who are excluded but is seen by others as a first 
step toward creating a hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast with meetings in McLarty's era, Panetta's sessions are "crisper, 
more agenda-oriented," a senior official said. "Panetta comes out at 8:15 with 
a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta "is using the 7:30 meeting as a setup to make decisions about what 
action needs to happen at the presidential level, and then isolating one person 
responsible for moving the ball forward," another senior official said. "That 
sends a double message," the official said: "Somebody's in charge, and 
everybody can't play." 
</P>
<P>
 That official also pointed to another action by the new chief of staff that 
has taken on considerable symbolic significance within the always 
status-conscious White House: pressing members of the National Security Council 
staff to provide more detailed answers to questions about their plans for 
handling foreign policy problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NSC sort of went its own way in prior days. It was less integrated into 
the overall game plan," the senior official said. Many White House aides see 
the NSC staff, which has been battered by criticism of Clinton's foreign 
policy, as increasingly insular and isolated from the political realities 
Clinton faces. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real test of Panetta's authority, many White House aides and others 
agree, will come when he begins the personnel shake-ups that he has broadly 
hinted will take place -- moves that almost inevitably will reduce the 
authority of some aides whose loyalty to Clinton goes back to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With no decisions yet announced, the White House has been awash in rumors -- 
most directed at the White House offices in charge of communications, 
scheduling and advance and political operations. One widely circulated rumor, 
for example, has John Emerson, a former Los Angeles deputy city attorney who 
has handled a number of assignments for Clinton, taking over the political 
office. Another rumor has Panetta bringing in a high-profile outside figure to 
replace communications director Mark D. Gearan, shifting Gearan to another 
high-level post. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of resolution has heightened the anxiety level on the staff and 
exacerbated longstanding divisions between the core of aides who labored with 
Clinton through the sometimes dismal days of the campaign and those -- 
generally older officials -- who came on board only after Clinton's election. 
With the ascendance of Panetta, who had never even met Clinton before the 
election, those in the latter group now hope to see the campaign influence 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've long felt the White House is too insular, with the old campaign group 
talking to each other and no one else," said one official who falls into the 
late-arriving camp. "Some of those people who've been getting a free ride 
because they were early and active in the campaign will now be getting a little 
more scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Many White House officials had expected, perhaps unrealistically, that Panetta 
would make major personnel changes immediately after Clinton returned from the 
economic summit in Europe earlier this month or, at the latest, by the end of 
his first week. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that those widely heralded personnel changes have not yet taken place 
has disturbed some White House officials -- some because they worry about a 
long, drawn-out process that could become highly disruptive; others because 
they fear the delay signals back-sliding on Clinton's willingness to give 
Panetta a free hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials close to Panetta discount the need to act quickly or to make major 
changes in personnel, as opposed to changes in the White House process. "The 
reality is you guys aren't going to walk away and say he's done a great job 
because of the size of the pile of scalps outside his door," one such official 
said. "If he hangs a lot of folks and things still don't go well, you'll just 
say he croaked the wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, said another aide, is acting "deliberately and carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's said repeatedly that any such changes would be made as quickly as 
possible. That's what's happening," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who think more dramatic action is needed warn that the new chief 
risks losing an important early opportunity. "It embarrasses the President and 
Leon if it doesn't get done soon. It makes it look like he's objecting to what 
Leon's proposing or else that he's slow to make painful decisions," one aide 
said. "People are likely to conclude that he's reluctant to allow Leon to 
change some people who may have been very loyal." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are expecting a lot from Panetta," another official said. "There's 
going to be a willingness to accept decisions simply because they are 
decisions, even if you don't like them. That will dissipate over time. He 
should take advantage of it while it's there."

 The Mississippi came and went, but it took something irreplaceable from the 
tiny Illinois river town of Fults. 
</P>
<P>
 When the river receded in October, after three months of fetid dominion over 
the southern Illinois bottoms, it washed away Fults' fragile sense of 
community, its reason for existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Midwestern riverside towns have lost far more monetarily to last year's 
great flood -- the kind of losses that were visited again on towns in 
southwestern Georgia during this month's flash-flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fults, alone among them, is in danger of disappearing entirely from the 
map. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the town's original 90 inhabitants have scattered to other parts, and 
the six families who talk of returning are unsure whether there will be enough 
people left to run the town council and keep Fults from unincorporating. Even 
if there are, there will be little to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 "The river broke a lot of people's spirits," said Mayor Eugene Williams. 
"There's not much to come back to." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams presides over a phantom zone where once-hardy cypresses and maples 
are as bare and wretched as winter foliage, where abandoned houses poke up from 
untended lawns like rows of broken teeth. Williams' only official task these 
days is to mow virulent patches of ironweed that sprout knee-high along Fults' 
dusty roads. At night, even he retires to a federal trailer outside town -- 
leaving Fults to its two remaining residents and damp fields of cicadas. 
</P>
<P>
 American towns die every year, killed off by the usual economic and spiritual 
malaise that has infected rural havens for more than a century. It is a slow 
process that often takes generations to set in, and even a place like Fults, 
barren of business and ignorant of its own history, can subsist for decades in 
a shrunken state, barely alive yet still a living community. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year's flood had no mercy on the weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see these towns go, but it's the survival of the fittest," said 
novelist William H. Gass, a small-town native and St. Louis resident whose 
fiction probes the heart of the heartland's psyche. "The ones that won't come 
back will be spared a living death. They'd be left with a population of talking 
memorial stones living in places that are more cemeteries than towns." 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since the Mississippi and other Midwestern rivers rose up and 
swallowed their banks, state and federal authorities estimate that as many as 
21,000 residents may have been left permanently displaced, forced to find new 
housing beyond the towns where they once lived. In most river communities, the 
numbers of those applying for federal buyouts or simply abandoning their ruined 
homes have been sparse enough to allow town life to pick up where it left off. 
</P>
<P>
 While many towns are slogging back to life and a few, like Valmeyer -- just 
northwest of Fults -- are moving to higher ground, beaten communities like 
Fults have been pitched into a struggle for their existence. Already on a 
downward spiral of failing economic vitality, these towns are now forced to 
contend with an exodus that threatens to wither their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Alton, Mo., across the river from Fults and north of St. Louis, as 
many as 500 of the unincorporated village's 1,000 residents may not return, and 
only a handful of businesses plan to reopen. Upriver in Alexandria, Mo., as 
much as half the population of 500 may not return, federal officials report. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for the exodus is the federal government's buyout program, 
which has actively encouraged those living in the worst-hit areas to leave the 
flood plains. Many owners of shattered homes see the buyout as their only 
chance to sell off unreclaimable properties and recover what would otherwise be 
exorbitant losses. Even many of those who want to stay have applied for buyouts 
because the alternative -- jacking up their homes as high as 14 feet to 
withstand future floods -- is too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, Fults' town board formally approved the federal buyout, making 
25 of the town's 32 homes eligible for government aid. Despite Mayor Williams' 
worry that residents might be opting for the buyout too early, board members 
approved the aid package -- fully realizing that their decision might doom the 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's more important, the future of a community or the welfare of its 
individual citizens?" said Herman Skaggs, a hazard mitigation specialist with 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Missouri. "Unfortunately for some of 
these marginal towns, their citizens are thinking about their own problems 
first. That's their prerogative, and I don't think they should have to make 
personal sacrifices so that their towns can stay afloat." 
</P>
<P>
 Those abandoning communities where their ancestors lived for decades must 
awkwardly adjust to life inland, watching old friendships die and missing the 
everyday familiarity of small-town routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fults native Tom Mosbacher, a long-distance trucker, almost moved his family 
to Arkansas but finally settled on a double-wide trailer perched in a mud field 
in the rolling hills above the flood plain five miles from Fults. He yearns for 
neighbors who "warn your kids they're in trouble when you're not around to keep 
an eye on them." His towheaded 4-year-old, Chance, pines for playmates he never 
sees anymore. His wife, Shari, tries to regularly phone old friends but sighs 
that "it's no substitute for knocking on their door." The phone conversations 
wane with each passing month. 
</P>
<P>
 North of town, Pam and Gary Vogt have taken up residence in her mother's old 
hillside home, but they have yet to decide where they will put down roots. 
Wherever they go, it will not be back to Fults. 
</P>
<P>
 She will miss Friday dusk softball games and the July children's parade with 
its endless trays of hot dogs and its toddlers pedaling miniature John Deere 
tractors as they dress as clowns, cheerleaders and mailboxes. She will not miss 
last summer's desolate boat rides out to her house or the endless petty thefts 
-- of rosebud trellises, garden tools, her daughter's dollhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody in Fults wanted to move," she said. "This is where the 
town belongs. But none of us wanted to go through any of the heartache again." 
</P>
<P>
 Some return on weekends for an hour or so to sift through ruins. Others prefer 
to stay away, content with memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be there in spirit even if the town ain't," Tom Mosbacher said. "When 
people ask me where I'm from, I always tell them, 'Fults.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Prange says it without regret. Prange, 46, the gaptoothed treasurer of 
Monroe County, the Illinois jurisdiction that may ultimately decide Fults' 
fate, is one of only two homeowners who have moved back. 
</P>
<P>
 Prange is the town's conscience, the only one left who can speak knowledgeably 
about Fults' origin in the early 1900s as a Union Pacific railroad spur and its 
1937 incorporation after relying for years on card games as fund-raisers. He 
can talk too, though more reluctantly, about the town's creeping loss of 
commercial vitality, the final days of its taverns, general stores and, 
recently, its sole remaining business, a grain elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 While others whose families date back generations -- descendants of Bradshaws 
and Limestalls, the town's original settlers -- packed up and moved into the 
hills, Prange decided to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others, he thought about leaving. But he would have had to give up 
his cherished back porch view of the limestone bluff that rises from the 
fertile bottoms just east of town. Prange, whose $60,000 home suffered nearly 
$30,000 in flood damage, still has his "million-dollar view" -- even if there 
is no one left on his block to share it. 
</P>
<P>
 With loans and $12,000 in savings, Prange not only restored his flood-sodden 
house, he spent $11,000 to buy an abandoned clapboard building that housed 
Fults' only church, St. John's United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's 90-year-old congregation disbanded after the flood. They lost 
their pastor a month before the water came in, and so many parishioners said 
they would not be returning that the church board, in its last act, asked 
Prange to serve as caretaker of the town's hillside cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 He now drives up the eastward hill once a week to tend to 200 family grave 
sites, 10 times the number of Fults' returning population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure whether it's honorable or stupid, but someone has to do it," 
Prange said. "I just don't want to see this town die." 
</P>
<P>
 A county official himself, Prange approached the county's commissioners 
recently to make sure they do not rush to kill off the town by revoking its 
charter. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe County Commissioner Bob Ripplemeyer, who expects "it's only a matter of 
time before they disenfranchise," agreed to allow the town's remaining 
residents to decide for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision may be forced on them if there are not enough returning Fults 
residents to staff the town's governing board -- a mayor, clerk, treasurer and 
five trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everyone returns who say they're coming back, we'll have nine adults -- 
one more than what we need to keep the town government functioning," said Mayor 
Williams. Taking no chances, he has persuaded his wife, Ramona, to serve as 
town treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if anyone changes their mind or decides they don't want to get involved, 
we're sunk," Williams said. "If we don't have enough people to run the place, I 
guess we'll have to ask the state to revoke our charter." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Williams can put it out of his mind. He has new aluminum 
siding to strip on his walls -- mottled and warped by three months of 
Mississippi wave action. But when he returns to his weekly weeding, the seeming 
inevitability of the town's fate returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking residents, Fults has become a town of weeds, its environs clotted with 
horseweed, ironweed, wild petunias, grasses and stalks no one can identify. 
</P>
<P>
 A few former residents return with tractors and mowers to keep their lots 
trimmed. But most of the exiles have long given up on their lawns, just as they 
have given up on Fults itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor has sent out official reminders to the town's homeowners, sternly 
informing them that they have an obligation to keep up their properties, flood 
or no flood. Few comply. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it is Williams, still hoping against hope for his town's future, 
who rumbles through the yards on his cherry-red Ford tractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was always such a clean town," Williams shouted over the tractor's 
droning motor. "Not so much anymore. I guess it don't make much sense to keep a 
place clean if you're never coming back."

KING HUSSEIN STAKES FUTURE ON PEACE TALKS WITH ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty-three years ago, a Palestinian enraged by reports that Jordan's King 
Abdullah was meeting secretly with Israeli leaders shot the elderly Hashemite 
king dead as he entered Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque to pray. Standing at 
Abdullah's side when the gunfire erupted was his 15-year-old grandson, Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Hussein -- now the Middle East's longest-ruling leader -- intends 
to openly endorse his grandfather's conviction that the Arabs must come to 
terms with the Jewish state. For the first time, he will meet publicly with 
Yitzhak Rabin, joining the Israeli prime minister for talks with President 
Clinton at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein and Rabin, who are thought to have met secretly several times over the 
tumultuous years during which they have served their nations, are expected to 
sign agreements laying the groundwork for a formal peace treaty between Israel 
and Jordan. They may even sign a declaration of non-belligerency, which would 
end the official state of war between the two nations but fall short of a 
treaty. They also intend to jointly address Congress, and to attend a White 
House state dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israelis and Arabs, their appearances together will hold little of the 
drama that marked Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's historic trip to Jerusalem 
in 1977, or Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's 
handshake with Rabin on the White House lawn last September. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Israelis, their government's state of war with Jordan has been 
theoretical since the king lost the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem to Israel 
in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Israeli newspapers have reported for years on the 
"secret" meetings between the king and a parade of prime ministers, and on 
quiet agreements to secure the border between the two nations and share scarce 
water resources. 
</P>
<P>
 And for most Jordanians, the shock of seeing their king meeting with Rabin 
pales in comparison to seeing Arafat shake Rabin's hand. The shock also has 
been eased in advance by the lengthy negotiations Jordan and Israel have 
publicly engaged in since an October, 1991, peace conference in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yasser Arafat acted as a shock absorber for the king," said Speaker of 
Parliament Taher Masri in an interview before leaving with Hussein for 
Washington on Friday. "People feel we have no alternative but to make peace 
with the Israelis now that the Palestinians are making peace with them. They 
are not happy; they are not sad. They are almost passive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday's meeting with Rabin is the culmination of a personal journey for 
Hussein that has led him through civil war, coup attempts, assassination plots, 
Arab-Israeli wars and the vagaries of Arab politics for more than four decades. 
It is another gamble by a king who has developed acute instincts for sensing 
the mood of his volatile and often divided nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving close to completing a very dear objective," Hussein said 
Wednesday after meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Hussein 
spoke shortly before Christopher flew by helicopter to the Dead Sea to preside 
over another first -- Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres crossing the border 
to discuss trilateral economic cooperation with Christopher and Jordanian Prime 
Minister Abdul Salam Majali. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud of the reaction of the overwhelming majority of people in this 
country" to his decision to step up contacts with the Israelis, Hussein told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still worries among the king's advisers about the risk Hussein is 
taking in accelerating talks with Israel. Syria has criticized the move, as has 
a coalition of Islamic fundamentalists and Arab nationalist groups within 
Jordan. Security forces have stepped up surveillance of groups considered 
potential troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The king decided to make his move now, according to senior Jordanian officials 
and Western diplomats, because he feared that Israel and the PLO were prepared 
to cut Jordan out of any arrangements for the future of the West Bank and Gaza, 
and he believes that Syria stands on the verge of making peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did the king stand to gain by waiting for Syria to go first?" one 
Western diplomat asked. "Rightly or wrongly, he was convinced that (Syrian 
President Hafez) Assad was going to deal, and if Israel achieved peace with 
Syria, Jordan would have no leverage at all in its negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein also is anxious for U.S. aid to ease Jordan's economic crisis and its 
crushing debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordanians are also hoping Washington will pressure Arab Gulf states, still 
angry with the king for his support of Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War, to resume aid to the kingdom, which has been swamped by Palestinian 
refugees from Kuwait and suffers high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to see the Americans deliver on their promises, and soon -- not in 
1995 or 1996, but now," a senior palace official said. "People need to see that 
there are results coming from the concessions that Jordan is making." 
</P>
<P>
 The people the king is most concerned about are the Islamic fundamentalists 
who vehemently oppose any dealings with Israel. The Islamists control 17 seats 
in Jordan's lower house of Parliament and are considered a force to be reckoned 
with in a nation that is overwhelmingly Muslim and deeply conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We at the Islamic Front don't agree with anything that's going on," said 
Mohammad Owaidah, a member of Parliament and assistant director of the Islamic 
Front, a fundamentalist coalition. "We oppose meeting with Jews, because they 
are occupying our land, they are torturing our people." 
</P>
<P>
 Owaidah, born in what was then Palestine, became a refugee at age 2 when 
Israel was founded. He has lived in Jordan ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Owaidah said Islamic activists are determined to work against the signing of a 
peace treaty "by all means," but he acknowledged that the government has banned 
public rallies opposing the king's moves and blocks publication of openly 
anti-peace views in mass-circulation dailies. Still, he said, the Islamic 
forces intend to use leaflets and Friday prayers at the mosques to get their 
views across. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will wait," Owaidah said. "The greediness of the Jews means that nothing 
will come of this peace process. People will see that it is false." 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein is banking on support from the entrepreneurial class in Jordan, from 
the rural tribes that have always supported the Hashemites, from Palestinians 
who want to see self-rule in the occupied territories work. 
</P>
<P>
 "King Hussein is talking about doing this because it is in Jordan's 
interests," the Western diplomat said. "That is a very powerful message here, 
particularly for East Bank Jordanians, who want the king to look out for the 
interests of the kingdom. People tend to believe that if anyone has sold out 
the Palestinians, it is Yasser Arafat, not King Hussein. There is a deep 
loyalty to the king here." 
</P>
<P>
 Manal Hamzeh Smadi, a Jordanian from a wealthy Muslim family, is planning to 
study Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an optimist," said Smadi, an American-educated audiologist. "I turn to 
Israeli TV all the time. I figure that if I learn the language, I'll be able to 
make friends."

VALLEY IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC OF RECOVERY; POLL: TIMES SURVEY FINDS THAT 
AFTER TWO YEARS OF GLOOM MANY BELIEVE THEY HAVE REACHED END OF DOWNWARD SLIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 San Fernando Valley residents -- those not chased out by lost jobs or scared 
away by petty crooks and big-time earthquakes -- seem to be shaking off the 
black mood that had spread and deepened in the sprawling Los Angeles suburb 
over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Life is not great, but it is getting better. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the prevailing sentiment of Valley residents found in a Los Angeles 
Times Poll that probed feelings about neighborhoods, personal finances and the 
workplace -- areas where change has erased many longstanding notions about 
suburban life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had expected lifetime employment," said Richard Wagner, 58, of Van Nuys, a 
former aerospace engineer who started his own graphic design business after 
being laid off two years ago. "I've found now that I like to work for myself 
and I have a knack for the kind of work I do. But the financial impact is 
dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner used to earn $25 an hour. Now he makes between $6 and $10 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have different expectations today," he said, echoing others who have seen 
their lives and neighborhoods change dramatically over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of retirement, I'm going to have to work one way or another until I 
drop," he said during an interview following his participation in the poll. 
"That's OK. I'm fine. I don't mind working." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times poll, supervised by John Brennan, interviewed 1,094 adults living in 
the Valley -- including the cities of San Fernando and Burbank -- on July 9 and 
10. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that after surviving a wave of layoffs, business failures and 
dramatic declines in real estate values, Valley residents are beginning to 
express cautious optimism about the area's financial prospects, despite the 
widespread pain that continues to be felt in many households. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from an economic recovery, many Valley residents instead say they have 
reached the end of a downward slide. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of recession -- as well as several years of accelerated 
demographic and other social changes -- most say they have hit bottom and are 
now poised for a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite lingering economic troubles for many, only 5% of residents polled said 
they believe their finances will worsen in the next year, with 50% saying they 
will improve and 40% say they will probably remain about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime remains by far the main worry, but now fewer than half of Valley 
residents, 43%, believe the quality of life in their community is going 
downhill, compared to 54% who despaired over their neighborhood's prospects a 
little more than a year ago. A total of 70% now say they are satisfied with 
their neighborhoods, compared to 59% reporting in an April, 1993, Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, 31% say they think the Valley will not be in a recession next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing optimism over finances and community comes despite the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, which caused major damage at 44% of residents' homes and 
apartments, according to The Times poll. About 30% say they are worse off 
financially because of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the shift to a more upbeat mood is broad-based, shared almost evenly 
by whites, Latinos, young, old, rich, poor, homeowner and renter. The mood is 
similar to the feelings of residents countywide, according to a countywide 
Times poll conducted last month. 
</P>
<P>
 More people, 57%, say they are making big purchases such as cars, furniture, 
vacations and tuition. About 45% of those polled said they have postponed 
buying because of financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround was dramatic for artist Andrew Totnan, 33, a Studio City 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was my worst year and this year will probably turn out to be my 
best," he said. Sales of his work, which range in price from $200 to $6,000, 
are suddenly at a record pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, with few buyers, Totnan said he considered returning to teaching, a 
profession he left to be a full-time artist. Now, he said, life is good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have friends in different professions and it seems like most of them are 
doing better, that the economy is really picking up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many others, however, there is only hope of financial recovery, and not 
much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite economists' claims to the contrary, 66% still say they believe the 
Valley is in some kind of economic decline -- either a mild, moderate or 
serious recession. Last year, however, the figure was 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohamad Barmaki, 47, of Burbank says his finances haven't fallen much during 
the past few years. He buys, repairs and sells used cars for a living. But he 
still sees the effects of the recession on his customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not as easy as they were before," he said. "They are more into 
getting bargains. Some are really suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 The recession and a changing economy has forced many businesses to trim 
payrolls and eliminate jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see much dead wood out at the workplace these days," said Alan 
Darnell, 47, of North Hollywood, who works as a temporary accountant at 
different firms. "The people who are on the job are really working. They're not 
just there to collect a paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 But for many caught in the campaign to cut costs, times are still tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Two out of 10 Valley residents say the area remains in a serious recession, 
compared to 34% in 1993. And a substantial group, one-fifth of the Valley's 
population, remains stuck in a monthly struggle to pay rent, buy groceries and 
make car or insurance payments, according to The Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last year and a half my hours were cut from 40 a week to 32, and my 
husband has less work," said Roberta Rohwer, 43, of Burbank. "We were renting a 
house and now we're renting an apartment. . . . This year we couldn't go on 
vacation. They shut off the cable before Christmas and we haven't been able to 
get it put back on because there are too many other important things to pay 
for, like electricity." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohwer, who works in sales at the Ikea home furnishings store, said she has 
been taking night classes in child development at Valley College for the past 
two years. But she is discouraged now after learning that entry-level workers 
at child-care centers earn less than retail sales clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem we will be doing a heck of a lot better any time soon," said 
the Burroughs High School graduate. "It's just frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 For job losses, the worst may be over. This month, 16% report they or someone 
in their household was fired in the last 12 months, compared to 23% in April 
last year. The total proportion of Valley households affected by lost jobs, 
work or income fell to 34% from 43% in April of last year. Among those who lost 
work through staff cuts, the proportion dropped to 23%, compared to 37% last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, fewer families who lost jobs are blaming the recession, 22%, compared to 
42% who said that was the reason last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley residents as a group apparently value education, an investment that is 
consistently made among all income groups, according to the poll. Of households 
making major purchases in the past year, tuition is second only to vehicle 
purchase among those earning $20,000 and less a year. Of Valley residents who 
postponed major purchases, more said they deferred buying cars, furniture, 
vacations and appliances before postponing tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, education is the route to regaining lost ground after losing a job 
in the past two or three years. Often, that means learning a new trade or new 
skills. Most of the 34% who say they have gone to school or taken training to 
improve or learn new careers say the extra work has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Schooling landed Robert Broadway a job in computer software engineering. But 
at age 32, he has already been laid off twice in his career and seen his annual 
income drop $16,000 after his last job change. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not what he expected after following his father's footsteps into the 
computer business, said the El Camino Real High School graduate. His dad, 
Broadway said, has been out of work for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid-off aerospace workers, many with advanced college degrees, have flooded 
the market, making it especially difficult for younger, less experienced 
workers, Broadway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uncertainties of his business, though, Broadway said he is better 
off than when he was working as a car mechanic. He got out of that career after 
he attended Pierce College and completed courses at an electronics trade 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 His first big break came when he was hired by a firm servicing electronic 
equipment for local Fortune 500 companies. "They were paying $36 an hour," 
Broadway said. "Then three years ago I got laid off. They had to downsize 
because they were mostly servicing aerospace companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, Broadway found another job, this one paying $11 an hour in 
the technical support division of computer-maker Packard Bell Electronics Inc. 
"Technical support is not a high-paying job," he said. "But there are always 
openings. It's the drudge job of the computer industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Then after the Jan. 17 earthquake, he was laid off again, only to be rehired 
two weeks later in the company's software engineering division. Now, he said, 
he is not taking any more chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm back in school, taking classes in advanced computer software," he said. 
"As technology becomes more powerful, computers will support more advanced 
programs and so people who write advanced programs will be more and more in 
demand. To stay alive in this industry, you have to read what is going on in 
three or four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the changing nature of the workplace, 58% of those employed report 
earning better salaries than they were paid five years ago. But only 31% report 
improvements in benefits such as health insurance and vacation pay, while 20% 
say they are worse. About 26% of Valley residents who work say they receive no 
benefits at all, 16% say their income fell over the past five years and 23% say 
it is about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering everything, 51% of Valley workers say their job or business is 
better than it was five years ago, 23% say it is worse and 24% say it is about 
the same. However, 86% say they are satisfied with their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of Valley residents, 74%, describe their finances as secure, up a 
bit from a year ago, and higher than residents polled this spring countywide, 
66%, and statewide, 63%. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 28% say they are having trouble paying their rent or mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Tutungi, 38, whose Sylmar townhouse suffered extensive damage during 
the earthquake, is one of the people whose housing costs have become a burden. 
While waiting for insurance adjusters and his neighbors to agree on how to 
proceed with repairs, Tutungi must pay to rent another place to live, as well 
as support his wife and newborn baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough before and now it's worse," said Tutungi, a child-care director 
at a city-run center in North Hollywood. "(Home) prices had fallen enough 
already, and now the earthquake on top of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Homes have become a burden rather than an asset for 20%. That is roughly the 
same proportion of Valley homeowners who bought their houses or condominiums in 
the years 1988 through 1991, the peak of the area's real estate market, 
according to the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 But 72% of Valley homeowners consider their properties an asset. That is also 
about the same proportion who have owned their homes more than six years and, 
presumably, still have some equity despite the fall in prices, now back to 1988 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, 27% of homeowners say they believe the value of their property will 
go up, with half saying it will probably stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Former homeowner Leslie Dimattia has seen both extremes of the Valley economy. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her ex-husband built a pizza chain of 24 stores in five states during 
the 1980s, then went bankrupt in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nice ride, you know, trips to Maui, live-ins, donating money, not 
having to think about what this or that cost," said Dimattia, 41, who figures 
she and her ex-husband ended up owing about $8 million at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she works as a waitress in a Tarzana coffee shop. She and her two children 
live in a rented Van Nuys house, creditors having long ago taken her home in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rough, but the silver lining is that the kids are getting in touch with 
budgeting, something they never had to think about," Dimattia said of her 
children, ages 8 and 14. "But they remember the Hawaii trips, private schools 
and going shopping for clothes. Here in Van Nuys you have gang members on one 
side and crack dealers on the other. One good part, the princess in my daughter 
had to disappear."

</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,094 adult residents of the San Fernando Valley, 
including Burbank and the city of San Fernando, by telephone, July 9 and 10. 
Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the area. 
Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers 
could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish. The 
sample was weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age 
and education. The margin of sampling error for the total sample is plus or 
minus 4 percentage points. For certain sub-groups, the error margin may be 
somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as 
question wording and the order in which questions are presented. The Lineup

GIRL KILLED, 11 INJURED WHEN VAN OVERTURNS; TRAGEDY: LYNWOOD BASKETBALL PLAYERS 
WERE ON THEIR WAY TO A TOURNAMENT IN LAS VEGAS. A COACH APPARENTLY FELL ASLEEP 
AT THE WHEEL. 
</P>

<P>
 A van carrying a group of Lynwood students to a girls' basketball tournament 
crashed near Las Vegas on Saturday, claiming the life of an 11-year-old girl 
and injuring 11 other passengers, two of them critically. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the accident occurred about 6:40 a.m. on Interstate 15 about 
12 miles north of Las Vegas after an assistant basketball coach who was driving 
apparently fell asleep at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Steve Harney said the vehicle lunged into a 
dirt median, flipped over once and bounced three times before stopping 650 feet 
from where it left the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The accident victims were scattered everywhere," Harney said. "It appears 
that nobody was wearing a seat belt." 
</P>
<P>
 All the children were girls participating in a summer basketball program at 
Lynwood High School for youths between the ages of 11 and 16, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Tracey Myricks, 11, of Lynwood, died of internal injuries at 
University Medical Center about noon Saturday, after several hours of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other 11-year-old girls who suffered chest and head injuries were listed 
in critical condition at the medical center, with one reported to be clinging 
to life Saturday evening, Harney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the group had attended a summer camp at Colorado Springs, 
Colo., and was on its way to Las Vegas to participate in a tournament for camp 
teams from across the West at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Allen, 32, of Paramount, the driver, was listed in serious condition 
at the medical center, as were seven other girls, hospital spokesman Bill 
Pelligrino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harney said Allen told him that she fell asleep at the wheel. Investigators 
will recommend that she be charged with involuntary manslaughter, he said, 
adding that the district attorney's office will decide whether to press 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The head coach, Ellis Barfield, 29, of Lynwood, and a 15-year-old girl were 
treated and released from Valley Hospital Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman 
Lori Tierney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five ambulances from Las Vegas were dispatched to transport the injured to 
area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Harney credited state Trooper Terry Houston, the first official to arrive at 
the scene, with helping expedite treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came upon a lot of people desperately injured and was able to determine 
who needed the most help right away," Harney said.

FAMILY, FRIENDS PAY TRIBUTE TO SLAIN ORANGE COUNTY WOMAN; MURDER: MEANWHILE,

<P>
 Hundreds of people joined Saturday in bidding farewell to Denise Anette Huber, 
the ever-smiling young waitress who disappeared three years ago and was 
recently found bludgeoned to death in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath a sun-washed, denim-blue sky, family and friends, including those who 
came to know Huber's parents only after the 23-year-old vanished along a 
Southern California freeway, gathered at Mariner's Church in Newport Beach for 
a graceful, low-key memorial that included an abundance of tributes, 
testimonies and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 From as far as Canada and Tennessee, Huber's relatives and friends traveled to 
attend the 90-minute service, where six of them, each allotted a brief moment 
to remember her equally brief life, recalled with humor her fondness for frogs, 
fun and the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Vancouver and I did not share Denise's enthusiasm for the Los 
Angeles Kings," said Huber's cousin Dave Nieuwsma, a youth pastor and Vancouver 
Canucks fan, whose remark prompted muffled laughter, one of half a dozen such 
lighter moments in an otherwise somber event. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieuwsma, whose oldest daughter was about Huber's age, talked of possessing 
wonderful memories, but said the "one who brought those memories is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have been more like her," said Debbie Scott, a former college 
roommate. "Life was so much fun when she was around." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the grisly events of the past 10 days -- since Huber's body was found 
in Arizona inside a freezer belonging to a former Lake Forest man -- were 
alluded to several times, the Rev. Walt Shepard urged people to set the past 
aside and look forward. And yet, in the next breath, he seemed unable to heed 
his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help thinking . . . of some of the details that have come out in 
the investigation," he said. "You've got to be thinking with me of the words 
blunt-force trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 As Huber was eulogized Saturday afternoon, investigators and criminologists 
continued to pore over evidence in the case and said they have concluded that 
John Joseph Famalaro, the man charged with her murder in Arizona, probably 
acted alone. Yet authorities said they have not dismissed the possibility that 
Famalaro, a 37-year-old house painter, had help hiding her body for more than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there are no signs of an accomplice, but we can't rule out the 
possibility that someone may have knowingly helped him hide the body 
afterward," said Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith declined to say who police believe may have helped Famalaro conceal 
Huber's body since 1991. Authorities suspect that her corpse was stored most of 
the time in a freezer purchased by Famalaro about a week after Huber 
disappeared in Costa Mesa on June 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona authorities found the freezer July 13 inside a Ryder rental truck 
parked outside Famalaro's home at the Prescott Country Club in Dewey. It 
contained Huber's body, her hands cuffed and eyes and mouth sealed with duct 
tape. An extension cord ran from the truck to Famalaro's mother's house next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, of Newport Beach, was last seen alive after attending a rock concert at 
the Forum in Inglewood. Her abandoned Honda Accord was later found on the 
Corona del Mar Freeway, with its right rear tire shredded. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also said Saturday that Arizona officials turned over a sample of 
Huber's blood so the Orange County Sheriff's Department's crime lab can 
complete critical tests that might determine where Huber was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sample is being compared with a substance, possibly blood, taken from a 
Laguna Hills storage facility that Famalaro was renting at the time of Huber's 
disappearance. Authorities are trying to determine whether Huber may have been 
killed there. 
</P>
<P>
 If the samples match, they could further implicate Famalaro, and place Huber's 
death in Orange County, clearing the way for the case to be moved there for 
prosecution.

SET ON SAVING THEIR SUBURBAN HAVENS; AS URBAN ILLS SPREAD TO ONCE-IMMUNE 
OUTSKIRTS, MANY RESIDENTS VOW NOT TO FLEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 They came dreaming of horse trails and baseball diamonds, of single-family 
homes tastefully designed to blend with the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 They pretty much found what they came looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 But their delight was hard to keep under wraps. As word of these suburban 
havens spread, populations swelled. And growth has inevitably spawned more 
crime, more traffic, and more smog -- the very things they sought to escape in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 With alarm, residents who fled urban centers and aging suburbs two to three 
decades ago feel a sense of deja vu. This time, though, instead of fleeing, 
they're fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dreamed that we could build our paradise here and enjoy it afterward," 
Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. "Well, we've built it. Now we 
have to maintain it." 
</P>
<P>
 That dream has managed to survive, even thrive, for decades in Thousand Oaks 
and other communities on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Founded in the late 
1960s and early 1970s, these beige suburbs attracted upscale refugees who still 
believed in the boundless possibilities of life in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Families fed up with the hodgepodge development and stop-and-go traffic of the 
San Fernando Valley crept westward to Ventura County and northward to the 
Antelope Valley. Folks tired of the increasing urban woes of northern Orange 
County fled southwest to Irvine and master-planned communities tucked into the 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 The dream has been good enough to hold on to, despite the doomsday hyperbole 
of the national media. 
</P>
<P>
 The dreamers have suffered through earthquakes, of course, and fires, floods 
and a stubborn recession. But still they find, in these far-flung suburbs, 
communities fit for raising kids and spoiling grandkids. They find homes to 
grow up, grow old and retire in. 
</P>
<P>
 They describe their dreams with a buzzword phrase: quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 With that cliche, they encompass everything that has made their neighborhoods 
so special: clean air, safe streets, good soccer leagues for the kids. 
Top-ranked public schools. Red-tile roofs and back-yard pools. Family hiking 
trails, a public golf course, a regional mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Beaver Cleaverville," said Irvine resident Ron Witter, summing it all 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Watering his immaculate lawn in the Los Angeles County suburb of West Hills, 
Todd Nathanson posed no brain-stretching theories about Southern California's 
crumbling mythology. He spewed no diatribes about the fading City of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California Dream?" he said, shrugging matter-of-factly. "This is it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson's blue-and-cream house sits midway between two family destinations: 
a major shopping center and a craggy hiking trail. In just a few minutes, he 
can reach the mall rats or the mountain lions, depending on which way he turns 
from his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a house, a garden, money, clothes," Nathanson said, as his 
3-year-old daughter, Rebecca, cavorted on the lawn with her stuffed Barney 
dinosaur. "I don't need anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, of course, even well-bred suburbs can't escape the now-standard 
litany of Southern California ills. They have smog, sometimes even bad enough 
to force a health warning. They have traffic, sometimes gridlock, on local 
streets. They have crime -- graffiti, theft, now and then a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they still have an allure. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people sitting in Minnesota on Jan. 1, watching the Rose Bowl 
parade, see this as a dream," said Larry Janss, whose family members were 
pioneer developers of Thousand Oaks and Westwood in Los Angeles County. "A big 
back yard, a red-tile roof, 2.3 kids, a bicycle in the driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the dream revolves around safety. Irvine and Thousand Oaks remain 
two of the safest cities in the nation with populations above 100,000, 
according to FBI statistics. Residents don't leave their doors unlocked, but 
they do stroll freely on the streets and feel secure in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar peace prevails in smaller communities sprinkled throughout Ventura, 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, for example, where the two-lane freeway winds through 
breathtaking canyons and curves past acres of orange groves. In Calabasas, 
where gated communities hide homes with lush lawns and drought-resistant flower 
beds. In Rancho Santa Margarita, where the annual fiesta rodeo evokes the 
rustic Old West and gives city slickers a chance to try steer wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Other suburbs, too, can claim a piece of the dream: Westlake Village and 
Agoura Hills, Mission Viejo and Dove Canyon, places with good views, nice 
neighbors and solid schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of exciting things to do here, but that's OK because it's 
supposed to be a bedroom community," said Arnold Berman, 62, a retired school 
principal who raised his son and daughter in Irvine. "It's a nice, clean area 
with good family values." 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuit of clean air and family activities, the dreamscape cities spare no 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, for example, posts its own version of SigAlert signs to warn cyclists 
when a bike path is closed for repairs. And Thousand Oaks builds playgrounds 
made entirely from recycled plastic set on squishy cushioning that prevents 
scraped knees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the neighborhoods stay relentlessly residential, no stores or 
industries fouling the air or jamming the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 From the bedroom window of her Thousand Oaks condo, Lorrette Weber can see a 
soaring, grassy hill -- and sometimes, she glimpses a bold coyote, deer or 
fawn. "It's heavenly to look out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully planned "open space," divided between parks and trails and untamed 
hills, lets residents enjoy the toasty Southern California weather that lured 
them west in the first place. For what California Dream could be complete 
without twisting oaks and swaying palms, postcard sunsets and bright blue 
skies? 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa and Avery Mittman can attest to the powerful pull of California 
weather. They gave up a shot at homeownership in Kansas to rent a townhouse in 
Irvine. Though they've struggled a bit to scrape by in Orange County, the 
Mittmans are glad to be rid of snow shovels and indoor gyms, frigid winters and 
treacherous, ice-laden roads. 
</P>
<P>
 As with most of life, the dream has its trade-offs. There may be less traffic 
in Idaho, but few relish driving in seemingly endless harsh winters. There may 
be less smog in Oregon, but who wants to spend months indoors waiting out the 
rainy season? There may be less crime in Arizona, but is that worth enduring 
115-degree days? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mittmans proclaim themselves willing to put up with the inconveniences of 
Irvine -- including tough commutes -- in order to enjoy the good weather and 
good schools. And an added attraction for visiting relatives: They're near all 
the tourist meccas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfect here," Teresa Mittman said. "My family can even come vacation 
while they're visiting us -- they can stay with us and go to Disneyland or 
Universal Studios." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that perceived perfection lies in Southern California's unique 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to laugh when I'm on the freeway and I see a car going one way with a 
surfboard on top and another car going the other way with skis," said Thousand 
Oaks resident Cathy Schutz, a satisfied dreamer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't like the outdoors, you might have different feelings," she 
added, "but I would never go back to New England. I've never been disillusioned 
with California. I will stay forever." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 But the enduring allure of these suburbs alarms some veteran suburbanites. 
Each new family that moves into a community brings more traffic and more trash. 
And criminals see more potential victims. 
</P>
<P>
 To give the new arrivals their spacious two-car garages and sparkling 
back-yard pools, developers pave over strawberry fields and rip out lemon 
trees. To pay for their schools and services, politicians must woo big 
businesses with big sales-tax potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dream is strangling itself," Larry Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban planner William Fulton offers a simple prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer can suburbanites expect quarter-acre lots and street after street of 
single-family homes. Even more dramatically, Fulton predicts that dreamers will 
have to adapt to new neighbors -- neighbors of different races, different 
ethnic backgrounds and different income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demographic change in California is unbelievable, and the economic change 
has been so dramatic that it's hard to know whether we can continue to support 
so many wealthy suburbs," Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, once-white suburbs have opened up to middle-class families of diverse 
backgrounds. Irvine's population is 18% Asian and more than 6% Latino, although 
less than 2% of the residents are black. In Thousand Oaks, nearly one in ten 
residents is Latino. And Fulton expects these suburbs to become ever more 
diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Resisting change, some communities' stubborn dreamers have walled their tracts 
off with gates and guards, a trend Fulton calls "cocooning in smaller and 
smaller cocoons." 
</P>
<P>
 Others plan to get out, to sell their homes in tony suburbs and use the cash 
to buy huge, unspoiled ranches out in the boondocks of Central California. 
</P>
<P>
 After 17 years in Irvine, for example, Roger Rostvold can't wait to move. 
Standing on his shaded street, next to his black Peugeot and white Jaguar, he 
said his dream has gone bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question of the day is, why would this guy want to leave all this?" he 
mused. 
</P>
<P>
 The answers of the day: fear, disgust and anger. Rostvold's scared to go to 
one of his favorite restaurants, where gangbangers mill in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's fed up with the vile graffiti scrawled across freeway sound walls. 
"We're counting the days until we get out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For every dreamer who quits the suburbs in disgust, however, others remain, 
determined to preserve their vaunted "quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired carpet installer Tom Villanueva said he would not consider leaving 
West Hills, a shaded community of cozy homes impervious to the neon glare and 
angry horns of nearby San Fernando Valley streets. Here, Villanueva and his 
wife, Lucille, have found their dream: puttering in the garden, relaxing in the 
sunshine, chatting with the mailman on his daily rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty content," Villanueva said, "right where we're at."

ONLY FITTEST JOKES SURVIVE IN JUNGLE; IN UPDATING DISNEYLAND RIVER CRUISE, 
COMEDY WRITERS MAKE SURE GUIDES CAN STILL GO OVERBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fierce Disney jungle, where jokes rain down on tourists like an evening 
at the Improv, only the strong -- and the really corny -- survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of a recent Jungle Cruise remodeling project, Disney comedy 
writers embarked on a major revision of its famed boat ride spiel, burying 
nearly one-fifth of the shtick that has been drawing guffaws and groans for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are old knee-slappers, such as the one about the crocodile and the 
gorilla, written in 1980. Time was when boatloads of tourists who passed by the 
two creatures fighting over a backpack would hear their skippers intone: "Now, 
there's a croc with a snappy personality. He's going to get himself a knuckle 
sandwich if he isn't careful." 
</P>
<P>
 "This just isn't funny anymore," said Disney senior show writer Christine 
Goosman, who supervised the revision, the first significant one since 1985. 
"Our view in the '90s is different than the '80s, and altogether different than 
the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the movie "The African Queen," the Jungle Cruise ride in 
Adventureland has consistently been among Disneyland's top 10 attractions since 
the amusement park opened in 1955. Guests glide along the river in open-air 
boats passing through lush foliage and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Although guests pass lifelike rhinos, hippos and elephants, the ride is known 
primarily for its comic appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jokes are so corny," said 39-year-old West Covina resident Susan A. 
Hidalgo, who was on board with her seven children. "That's what makes the 
ride." 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction's jokes, like the jungle, have their own resilient ecosystem. 
For every wisecrack and one-liner weeded out in the review, another took root 
in the 37-page routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The botanist told me bamboo can grow to be six stories tall," skippers are 
now telling their passengers. "I think it's seven . . . but then that's another 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the script was spruced up to make it funnier to today's 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go through this (new) script I start laughing," said Goosman, 
who wrote most of the witticisms. "That's so tacky, I know. You can't laugh at 
your own jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two key principles guided Goosman and her staff as they searched new terrains 
for Disney humor. The material not only had to be funny, but it had to enhance 
the ride's safari theme. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a joke about an elephant's mate being the most feared animal in 
the jungle was bounced because it lacked informational value, Goosman said. The 
bit was supplanted by facts about an average elephant's weight (six tons), 
height (10 feet) and life span (70 years). 
</P>
<P>
 Just when the ride starts sounding like a zoology lecture, guests are hit with 
this new zinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to be around when they blew out the candles on his cake." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to move the story forward," Goosman said. "We just don't have 
stand-ups up there telling joke after joke. It's not a comedy club." 
</P>
<P>
 New jokes also had to conform to set alterations, which took place during a 
major Jungle Cruise renovation over the last six months. Boat-riding guests on 
the five-acre waterway will no longer hear the crack about the Shriners 
building an ancient Cambodian temple. The scene (and the joke) had to be 
scuttled to make way for the new Indiana Jones thrill ride, scheduled to open 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Indiana Jones ride opens next year, the lines of thrill-seeking 
guests will be visible to the passing jungle boats. Not to worry, the innocent 
bystanders will become part of the new act. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people disappear up that walk," skippers will soon say, pointing to the 
Jones line, "I sometimes hear hideous screams of untold terror. Then I compose 
myself and resume the tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the ride's former entrance was replaced by an enormous two-story 
Victorian-style home. The structure, parts of which are overgrown with 
vegetation, is designed to look like a trading post in 1936 colonial Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 As they snake their way through the building, guests are meant to slowly 
absorb the '30s atmosphere as they pass by six elaborate "vignettes" or rooms 
that recall the era. 
</P>
<P>
 While writing copy for a "wireless" room vignette, Goosman became acquainted 
with another comedy restriction -- the delicate tastes of Disney. Originally, 
she proposed having a British broadcaster dryly making this pun: "As William 
Congreve so eloquently said, music has charms to soothe the savage breast." 
</P>
<P>
 But the "B-word" wasn't about to pass Mickey's censors. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we recorded it, this line continued to dog me," Goosman said. "People 
would say, 'Didn't you quote that wrong? Isn't that beast?' And then they'd 
say, 'Can you say breast at Disney?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Goosman's argument that Magic Kingdom restaurants served chicken breasts 
failed to sway her critics. The line was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The approved version, which can be heard crackling over the radio, says 
simply: "Here's a charming new melody for your listening pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 However, few jokes were squashed because of fragile Disney sensibilities, said 
Goosman, who has written Disney comedy for more than 10 years. Jokes that 
failed to make it into the jungle just didn't work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll write things and you'll laugh your head off," said Goosman, who 
included the boat skippers in the collaborative comic process. "But we are 
dealing with an audience here. It might ruin their day" if they were offended 
by a joke. "So, you have to pay a lot of attention to the reaction of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The ride's jokes frequently live or die by their delivery, Goosman said. 
That's why each boat skipper is given a menu of four approved alternatives that 
they can use in each bit during the ride. The item the skippers choose depends 
on their manner and their sense of the 32-member audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every skipper has his own style," said Fullerton resident Eric, 26, who has 
hammed up countless jokes in four seasons as a skipper. (It's Disneyland policy 
not to release last names of park employees.) "I'm very over the top. There are 
others who are very dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, who quickly memorized the new script material, said: "There's more 
interaction with guests on this ride than any other and that's what makes it 
fun. What makes it work is when people groan and make faces." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of revisions, a few time-honored jokes keep creeping back into some 
of the skippers' patter. According to the new script, when the boat emerges 
from the jungle, the skipper can say: "And now, we come to the most dangerous 
part of our journey: the return to civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 But a couple of skippers on a recent hot afternoon deviated from the script, 
tacking on the previously acceptable "and the Southern Californian freeways" to 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway remark upset Art Director Kim Irvine, in charge of concept design 
at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no continuity," Irvine said. "It's 1936 and then a freeway reference. 
Bam, there goes your whole visual setup." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some of the attraction's jokes will probably never be cast out of 
the jungle, Goosman said. For instance, on rainy days, you might hear a skipper 
tell one of Goosman's favorite oldies as the vessel winds through its tranquil 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please remember," the 30-year-old line goes. "That the tighter together you 
sit, the better the heating system on the boat works." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love that joke," Goosman said.

ALTMAN LIKELY REPUBLICAN TARGET; WHITEWATER: DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY IS 
EXPECTED TO BE FOCUS OF HEARINGS. GOP CONCERNED WITH POSSIBLE DISCREPANCIES IN 
HIS STATEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the Clinton Administration prepares for the Whitewater hearings in Congress 
this week, Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman is emerging as the prime 
target for Republicans who hope to show that the White House has been 
withholding key information about its handling of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "In their mind's eye, Republicans are painting a bull's-eye around Roger's 
head," says one source close to the House Banking Committee, where the 
long-anticipated Whitewater hearings will premiere Tuesday. The Senate Banking 
Committee will begin parallel hearings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Once considered an all but certain choice to be the next secretary of the 
Treasury, Altman has been swept into the center of the Whitewater controversy 
by potentially damaging discrepancies between his earlier testimony before 
Congress and sworn statements made last week to congressional investigators by 
one of his senior aides, Treasury counsel Jean Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
 When he appeared before the Senate Banking Committee last February, Altman 
said he knew of no secret efforts by the Treasury Department to inform White 
House officials about progress of the Whitewater investigation, with one 
exception -- a brief meeting where Hanson gave them a "heads up" about 
inquiries into the failure of a Little Rock thrift owned by James B. McDougal, 
President Clinton's partner in the Whitewater Corp., an Arkansas land 
development venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman later said he did not learn until March that Hanson had given more 
extensive and multiple briefings about the status of the Whitewater 
investigation to then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and other senior 
Administration officials the previous fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a deposition to committee investigators last week, Hanson said Altman 
ordered her in September to brief Nussbaum and the other White House officials 
about the investigation being conducted by the Resolution Trust Corp., of which 
Altman was also serving as acting chief at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorandum that Hanson wrote to Altman on Sept. 30 of last year also 
indicates that on several occasions she briefed Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen on the RTC's efforts to establish a connection between Whitewater and 
the Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, the failed Little Rock thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Other memoranda obtained by the committee further indicate that, in both their 
frequency and detail, the briefings went far beyond the initial "heads up" 
characterization that Altman gave to the Senate Banking Committee in his Feb. 
24 testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., who took over the 
investigation in January at Clinton's request, has already examined the 
Treasury Department contacts and determined that, while they may have been 
ethically improper, they did not amount to a criminal attempt by anyone in the 
Administration to impede the RTC's probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to Rep. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is 
serving as the Administration's point man on the House Banking Committee, the 
hearings will show that at "every point where a decision was made, it was made 
to go ahead with the investigation." There is no evidence, he added, that 
"anyone in the Administration tried to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 But that may not be enough to let Altman off the hook if, as expected, the 
Republicans try to use the hearings to build a case that he lied to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the ranking Republican on the Senate 
Banking Committee, has indicated he will try to do just that and his 
counterpart on the House Banking Committee, Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, appeared to 
have Altman in mind when he said last week that the hearings would show how 
even some "good people stepped over the line" in their desire to protect 
Clinton from the Whitewater scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Department sources said Altman will tell the committees when he 
testifies this week that his recollection of events simply differs from 
Hanson's. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Frank concedes that this explanation probably won't be enough. Altman 
"is going to have a tough time explaining things," said Frank. "I don't know at 
this point whether he lied or withheld, but he did not seem to give a complete 
accounting of his conversations" in his Senate testimony in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic lawmaker tempered his remarks by stressing that Altman "took no 
actions to impede the (Whitewater) investigation" either during or after his 
tenure at the RTC. But by publicly questioning the credibility of Altman's 
recollection of events, Frank's comments underscored an impression gaining 
ground in Congress that the Administration may be getting ready to sacrifice 
Altman to its Whitewater critics. 
</P>
<P>
 That impression has been reinforced by the fact that the Treasury Department 
seems to have been cut out of an effort to blunt the impact of the most 
embarrassing disclosures expected to emerge from the hearings, senior 
congressional and Administration sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort involves leaking aspects of those disclosures in advance, and most 
of the leaks have involved Altman or his colleagues at Treasury and the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are reports of memoranda and notes of meetings indicating that the 
White House was receiving more detailed and frequent information about the 
Whitewater investigation from the Treasury Department last fall than it has 
previously acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more embarrassing, Frank disclosed on Friday that Altman kept a private 
diary that describes in personal terms the degree to which Hillary Rodham 
Clinton was angered by the appointment of a special Whitewater counsel and 
other developments in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite clearly, the Administration has decided that it doesn't want to be 
caught in the bind of coming before the committees without having revealed 
these things," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadoff witness in the House on Tuesday will be Lloyd N. Cutler, 
Nussbaum's successor as White House counsel, and his testimony is expected "to 
be quite soothing," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Administration appears to be taking no chances as it girds for the 
possibility that there may be a few more revelations emerging that will cast it 
in a bad light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there will be some things that will come out that haven't come out yet 
and I'm prepared for that," one Administration official said.

YELTSIN ADVISERS URGE 2-YEAR DELAY IN ELECTIONS; RUSSIA: AIDES SAY SCHEDULED 
1996 VOTE COULD BRING ZHIRINOVSKY TO POWER IN THE MIDST OF PAINFUL REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Close advisers to President Boris N. Yeltsin are publicly urging that 
elections mandated by Russia's new constitution be postponed and that Yeltsin 
stay in office at least two years longer than his elected term. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding presidential elections as scheduled in 1996 would be "untimely and 
destabilizing," the advisers warn. To bolster their case, they flash the threat 
that holding elections in the midst of painful economic reforms could bring to 
power neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky or another would-be 
dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliamentary elections should also be postponed for two years to give the 
6-month-old legislature more time to learn its business, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very much surprised if elections were held on schedule," one 
senior Moscow-based diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin has kept a polite distance from the initiative. However, since its 
proponents include such Yeltsin loyalists as Vladimir F. Shumeiko, chairman of 
the upper house of Parliament, and former State Secretary Gennady E. Burbulis, 
the idea is presumed to be a political trial balloon floated with the 
president's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking up the challenge, one pro-business parliamentary faction has promised 
to collect a million signatures to hold a referendum on delaying elections -- 
although early polls show that public opinion is against the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has already divided Russia's democratic forces and could threaten 
the delicate political stability that has been achieved in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's usurping power; it's a step toward dictatorship," lawmaker Boris G. 
Fyodorov, the former reformist finance minister, said last week in an interview 
in the cavernous halls of the Duma, or lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of democracy is at issue," Fyodorov said. "In one thousand 
years, power has never changed hands in Russia in a democratic way. . . . Let's 
look into the eyes of some democrats, like Mr. Yeltsin, and see what he really 
thinks about democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov himself vows to walk out of the Duma on Dec. 13, 1995 -- the day on 
which his two-year term expires -- whatever transpires in the meantime. But he 
put the chances of the elections being postponed at "50-50 today," because both 
president and Parliament have a vested interest in staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, 75% of the people in this hall support it secretly," Fyodorov said in 
a comment echoed by many of his fellow lawmakers. "These people are not 
democrats. They want to live in Moscow, they want to get flats, they want to 
make connections, they want to get jobs here, enjoy privileges." 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov also scoffed at the notion that Zhirinovsky, whose popularity already 
appears to be dropping, is likely to seize the presidency if elections are held 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zhirinovsky is an export item for the West," the economist said. "We show him 
whenever we want some more money." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the suggestion that elections be postponed is a political gold mine 
for Yeltsin's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Reactionary filmmaker and parliamentarian Stanislav S. Govorukhin said last 
week that the president's men would hasten to delay because "they have money, 
power, and no chance of winning democratic elections." 
</P>
<P>
 The democratic forces' abysmal showing in last December's elections, as well 
as the upset presidential victories last month of Alexander Lukashenko in 
Belarus and Leonid Kuchma in Ukraine, testify to the anti-incumbent sentiment 
sweeping the former Soviet Union and make the idea of postponing elections more 
attractive to both president and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has already postponed elections once. When he dissolved the old 
Supreme Soviet last September and called new parliamentary elections in an 
attempt to end the power struggle that had paralyzed Russian politics, Yeltsin 
promised to hold presidential elections this June. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the bloody October revolt by hard-liners, Yeltsin abandoned that 
promise and said he would serve out his five-year term, which is to end in 
June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, President Clinton defended that decision, noting that Yeltsin had 
been elected by a huge margin in 1991 and had won a popular referendum on his 
policies in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear whether extending Yeltsin's term would raise the hackles of 
his Western backers -- especially if Parliament agreed to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody cares," said Harley Balzer, director of the Russian 
Area Studies Program at Georgetown University in Washington. "As long as it's 
not a nasty, saber-rattling police state, I think we're willing to deal with 
all kinds of quasi-democracies. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be a little hand-wringing but nothing major," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin had also repeatedly promised that he would be a one-term president. 
But in March his spokesman, Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, said the public may demand 
that Yeltsin run again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 63-year-old Siberian's admitted bouts of depression and back pain 
-- and unsubstantiated rumors of more serious ailments -- Yeltsin remains the 
most popular politician in Russia, and perhaps the only one with the charisma 
to bring a semblance of unity to this fragmented giant land. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible candidates to succeed him include Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin, economist Grigory A. Yavlinsky, Zhirinovsky, Communist Party 
leader Gennady A. Zyuganov, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei M. Shakhrai, ousted 
Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi and Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbulis, Yeltsin's old friend and adviser, proposed last week that the 
president stay in office until 1998 but promise not to run for reelection after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elections in 1996 will be untimely and destabilizing and will add no 
democracy to the country," Burbulis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is a sure winner with Yeltsin's powerful Kremlin entourage, which 
will lose its power and perquisites when its meal ticket retires. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is a 'nomenklatura democracy,' " said political analyst Andrei 
V. Kortunov of Moscow's USA and Canada Institute. "The new political elites are 
trying to consolidate their positions, and they don't want to risk having 
elections. The question is whether they will be able to reach consensus amongst 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper, Kremlin strategists have 
already drafted a memo entitled, "On possible steps to stabilize the situation 
in Russia," which scripts a scenario for postponing both presidential and 
parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step was taken last month, when Shumeiko announced that the 
president and Parliament had already agreed "in principle" to postpone 
parliamentary elections from 1995 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin spokesman Kostikov called the idea "interesting, but debatable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is tired of the acute political fever," Kostikov said. "More than 
anything else it now needs to preserve peace." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, who initially was quoted as favoring the 
idea, changed his mind after hearing the howls from constitutional purists, who 
called such a deal "immoral." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Yeltsin's chief of staff said the president does not favor 
postponing parliamentary elections, because it would give the impression that 
politicians are trying to hold on to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has not commented on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin memo calls for "initiating debate on this suggestion this summer 
and creating an atmosphere of support" through speeches and statements of 
regional leaders, according to Nezavisimaya Gazeta. In September, all the 
parliamentary factions that signed Yeltsin's treaty of civic accord will be 
asked to support postponing the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 As an amendment to the constitution, such a move would require approval by 
three-quarters of the Duma and two-thirds of the Federation Council, the upper 
chamber of Parliament -- a difficult majority to muster. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure does not receive enough votes, it will be decided at a 
referendum in spring, 1995, the Kremlin memo reportedly says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the majority of Russians will find the proposal to give up their 
democratic principles for the sake of stability quite convincing," the 
newspaper said sadly. 
</P>
<P>
 A new poll shows that the Kremlin is in for a tough fight, however. The July 
15 survey of 4,000 Russians in eight regions found 65% were opposed to 
extending Yeltsin's term, and only 23% favored the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Those surveyed were slightly more sympathetic to the newly elected Parliament, 
but only 29% of those polled favored extending its mandate, while 41% were 
opposed, and the rest were undecided.

<P>
 Six member countries said Saturday that they were ready to accept Communist 
Vietnam into ASEAN, the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore 
and Brunei said at their annual meeting that they were ready to admit Vietnam 
but gave no details on how or when it would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources say the target date for Hanoi's membership would likely be 
formalized by the ASEAN leaders' summit next year in Thailand. "There is no 
sticking point involved. The main question is what are the procedures," a 
senior ASEAN diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, ASEAN will begin a three-day forum on regional security issues.

FOREIGN POLICY REVAMP LIT FIRE OF ISRAELI TALKS; MIDEAST: PLANNERS WERE GIVEN 
FREE REIN TO RESTRUCTURE, FIND NEW APPROACHES TO PEACE WITH ARAB NEIGHBORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, as Shimon Peres and his top advisers began total restructuring of 
the Israeli Foreign Ministry, they agreed there should be a small group to 
re-examine the country's policy positions and explore new approaches, 
especially to peace with its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructions to the ministry's new political planning branch were: "Be 
creative, be daring, be provocative," according to Yitzhak Oren, who oversaw 
the restructuring as the ministry's head of coordination. "We told them, 'Slay 
all the sacred cows -- just butcher them.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We could see a real chance of peace ahead, and we knew we needed a lot of new 
thinking to make it work. . . . Today, we see some of the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the progress made in the peace talks over the past year with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordan was due to the new group's work -- 
the hard decisions were made by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign 
Minister Peres -- but the unit's efforts reflected the Israeli determination to 
maintain the momentum of the peace talks with a continuing search for 
compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test has been not to rest and not to stand pat, but to keep pushing for 
those decisive, crucial breakthroughs," Mark Sofer, a Peres policy adviser, 
said. "The decisions are made at the highest levels, as they should be in a 
democracy, but we have had the most free-wheeling discussions imaginable at the 
working levels." 
</P>
<P>
 And Oren and Sofer credit the half-dozen members of the Foreign Ministry's 
policy planning unit with getting Israeli leaders to think in new directions, 
consider challenging scenarios, particularly in negotiations with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Don't repeat our ideas to us,' Peres told them," Oren recounted. " 'Tell us 
something new, tell us something provocative, . . . tempt us to think in new 
ways.' That is very difficult for any bureaucracy to do, but it is something we 
had to do if we were going to find a way out of this very, very long conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 The task before Israeli diplomats over the past year has been immense, both in 
terms of its life-or-death importance for the country and in its sheer scope 
and complexity -- five sets of negotiations with different partners, each with 
its own issues, each with its own forum, each with its own style. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Rabin adviser compared it to "solving four or five very difficult 
simultaneous equations, each of which is itself the sum of 10 or 20 other 
equations." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we reached an agreement with the Palestinians, we had to ask what 
impact it would have on Jordan or Egypt," he said, referring to the countries 
that border the self-governing Palestinian territories. "Every sentence we 
wrote with the Jordanians, we had to examine in terms of the treaty we hope one 
day we will negotiate with the Syrians." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its establishment as a state in 1948, Israel has longed for the day when 
it would be able to negotiate peace treaties with each of its immediate Arab 
neighbors and achieve acceptance in the region as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shimon Peres has dedicated years of his life, decades actually, to reach this 
point, but far from sitting back and savoring it, he's working 20 hours a day 
to make sure we succeed," Sofer said. "These are crucially important times, the 
issues are incredibly complex and sensitive, and the energy required for so 
many sets of negotiations is immense." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Israeli negotiators are largely drawn from diplomats, along 
with some soldiers and a few academics, who have been waiting their entire 
career for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, we have been preparing for these talks for 45 years," Oren said. 
"They have not caught us by surprise. The logistics, the position papers, the 
internal discussions -- these are things we have been trained and prepared for. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so we were ready and we are coping because this is the moment for which 
we have lived -- the hope that soon we will be at peace with our neighbors. 
Idealism, yes, but it's an ideal that gives people the energy to work 18-hour 
shifts and still be sharp and critical and creative." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet all their ideas, including those of the brainstorming Foreign Ministry 
policy planners, are run past Peres and finally Rabin before they are put on 
the negotiating table as Israel's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, the final coordination is done by Rabin and Peres, especially 
Rabin, for every move we make must have political support among the Israeli 
public," a senior Israeli diplomat said. "That means Rabin sits and weighs what 
he can sell and what he needs in return to sell it. Those are the nitty-gritty 
talks: Rabin sitting with Peres and then Rabin sitting by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 As the negotiations proliferated, this has been harder. The volume of 
decisions has grown and the speed of the process has accelerated: 
</P>
<P>
 * With Jordan, Israel is negotiating a peace treaty and agreements on economic 
cooperation. The issues range from ending the state of war between them and 
delineating a border to sharing water resources and cooperating on road 
construction. Adjourned to Aug. 8, the talks are expected to surge ahead after 
Monday's summit in Washington between Rabin and King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 * With the PLO, Israel is working toward a much broader form of autonomy, 
extending self-government throughout the West Bank, holding the Palestinians' 
first national elections as well as implementing the present agreement on 
autonomy for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank district of Jericho. Talks 
continue on an almost daily basis in the Palestinian territories or Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 * With Syria, Israel is discussing the framework for a peace treaty. It will 
be trading withdrawal from the Golan Heights that it captured in 1967 for peace 
and normal relations, the terms of which are disputed. With U.S. mediation, 
Damascus and Jerusalem are moving to the substance of the agreement without yet 
settling its basic parameters. 
</P>
<P>
 * With Lebanon, Israel has the most straightforward set of talks. It has 
pledged to pull all its troops out of southern Lebanon within six months of the 
re-establishment of the Beirut government's authority and presence in the 
border region. Agreement, however, depends on a settlement with Syria first. 
</P>
<P>
 * And, across the Middle East, there are wide-ranging, multilateral 
negotiations, begun after the Madrid Peace Conference in October, 1991, that 
seek to resolve major regional issues, such as economic development, sharing of 
water resources, resettlement of refugees and arms control. They involve 
Israel, its neighbors and a score of countries outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the goal is a comprehensive peace, Israel's strategy is to pursue 
agreements with each country and on each regional issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel learned long ago that it could not negotiate with all the Arabs at 
once," Shmuel Sandler, a political scientist at Bar-Ilan University in Tel 
Aviv, said. "These become negotiations of the 'highest common denominator,' and 
each Arab country is afraid of being seen by the others as weak or too mild, 
and they wind up outbidding each other. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "To negotiate with all of them but separately is already an achievement, and 
maintaining this course of diverse negotiations will be essential to the 
ultimate success of a comprehensive peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the goals of each set of negotiations quite distinct, Israelis 
point out, but so are the styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Jordanians, we have a foundation of understandings based on years of 
secret meetings between our leaders, on a working relationship along the 
armistice line, on common interests that don't need to be spelled out," a 
senior Israeli diplomat said. "It is almost an intimacy, if you will. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Palestinians, there is a familiarity. We have lived with one 
another, in sickness and health, in poverty and wealth, in war and peace, for 
more than 27 years of the occupation and even longer. For the last year, we 
have dealt with a crisis a day, or so it has seemed. We just know each other, 
even if we haven't learned to love each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with the Syrians, it remains tense, remote, discussions through the 
Americans, demands more than offerings. The feeling, on both sides probably, 
is: This is something we have to do, but, boy, we don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a historian of Israel's negotiations with the Arabs, Sandler sees a shift 
back from the totality pursued by the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin in his 
dealings with Egypt to the step-by-step approach used by former Secretary of 
State Henry A. Kissinger after the 1973 Middle East War, when Rabin was prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "Step-by-step suits Rabin's personality, and that matters because he bears the 
ultimate responsibility for the decisions Israel makes," Sandler said. "He is 
suspicious by nature; he doesn't trust people; he is skeptical of new ideas and 
of anything that smacks of a 'breakthrough.' Rabin, in other words, would like 
to see what he is getting before he goes further." 
</P>
<P>
 Yair Hirschfeld, a Haifa University political scientist who played a major 
role in the secret Israeli-PLO negotiations, said that the key element in the 
recent momentum has been the very success of those first moves a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is more successful than success, and the Arabs want to become part of 
what is growing into a dramatic success of historic proportions," Hirschfeld 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement with the Palestinians continues to have an enormous 
psychological impact, because in solving the Palestinian issue we are removing 
the announced reason for the whole conflict. . . . Syria may choose to provide 
the capstone of the endeavor, but the Palestinians laid the cornerstone." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirschfeld sees major international developments continuing to drive the 
negotiations -- factors that lie in the background but still drive the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 They include the end of the Cold War and the emergence of a new international 
coalition; the defeat of radical forces during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and 
the strengthening of pragmatists in the Middle East; the threat of Islamic 
fundamentalism to the pragmatists; the Palestinian intifada , or rebellion, 
against the Israeli occupation, and a realism born of 20 years of 
trial-and-error Mideast negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirschfeld also sees the Rabin government willing to use its "mandate for 
peace" from 1992 parliamentary elections, a feeling of "now or never" among the 
region's leaders and a U.S. Administration with an interest in a foreign policy 
success for its own political needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Israel, we have a very, very strong leadership in Rabin and Peres," 
Hirschfeld continued, "and they are supported by younger men with new ideas, by 
advisers and staffs willing to break through the old shibboleths. The key, 
though, is that our body politic wants peace, and we are finding partners on 
the other side."

ISLAMIC GROUP APPEARS TO TAKE CREDIT FOR BOMBING, PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little-known Islamic organization calling itself the Partisans of God has 
indirectly claimed responsibility for the bombing of Jewish organization 
offices in Argentina and the crash of a plane carrying Jewish businessmen in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement distributed in south Lebanon seems to support Israeli 
accusations that Lebanese militants with backing from Iran were behind the 
Buenos Aires attack. And it follows reports that Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed 
Shiite militia that is leading the resistance against Israel in Lebanon, has 
sought for the first time to expand its operations against Israel outside 
Lebanon's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suicide martyr squads have been formed to confront and combat Zionism 
everywhere. The Argentina and Panama operations are evidence of this continuing 
confrontation," said the statement from Ansarollah, or Partisans of God, a new 
group believed by some officials in Lebanon to be linked to Hezbollah. There 
was no proof of the authenticity of the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 18 bombing of a seven-story building that housed offices for two 
Jewish organizations in Buenos Aires left 46 people dead and more than 60 
missing. A day later, a commuter plane exploded and crashed shortly after 
takeoff in Panama. Two-thirds of the 19 passengers killed were Jews, four of 
them Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah, or Party of God, has denied any connection to either incident. But 
the organization has clearly been infuriated by Israeli commandos' May 21 
kidnaping of a Shiite leader near Baalbek and a subsequent air raid on a 
Hezbollah camp that killed 45 militants. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat was turned up even further on Saturday when Israel announced that its 
soldiers had struck deep within Lebanon on Friday night and kidnaped a second 
Lebanese militant, Kassem Rehan, accused of aiding Hezbollah guerrillas in 
attacks against Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about the internal deliberations of Hezbollah or its 
connections with its Iranian and Syrian backers. But a source close to 
Hezbollah dissidents said the organization, infuriated by Israel's recent 
attacks in Lebanon, has sought to adopt a new strategy for retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The source said Hezbollah's secretary general, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, met in 
Damascus two weeks ago with Syrian officials and Iranian security chief Ali 
Falahian and unsuccessfully sought authority to unleash a barrage of Katyusha 
rockets into Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 When the measure was vetoed by Syria on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's peacemaking visit to the region, Nasrallah is said to have 
broached the subject of hitting Israeli targets "around the world," according 
to the source, whose reports could not be independently verified.

KIM REPORTEDLY WANTS SUMMIT WITH S. KOREA

 Kim Jong Il, North Korea's new leader, said he would seek a summit meeting 
with South Korea's president and continue talks with the United States about 
North Korea's nuclear development, a South Korean newspaper publisher said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A North-South summit is just a matter of time," said Bo Hi Pak, publisher of 
South Korea's Segye Times. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that the son of Kim Il Sung, who died July 8, was 
reported to have spoken about policies he intends to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. talks with North Korea are set to resume Aug. 5. But there had been no 
indication that North Korea would seek to reschedule a summit with the South.

IN PAY DISPUTE, GAMBIAN SOLDIERS SEIZE POWER IN 'BLOODLESS' COUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mutinous soldiers in Gambia seized power Saturday after rampaging through the 
capital city of Banjul in a dispute over pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The ousted president, Dawda Jawara, had taken refuge on a U.S. warship, which 
was visiting Banjul on a training mission, diplomats in neighboring Senegal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four lieutenants who proclaimed themselves the new government of Gambia, 
Africa's smallest nation, said the overthrow was bloodless. They closed 
Gambia's land borders and airport and cut international telephone lines after 
rampaging through Banjul on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunfire was reported, but there was no word on casualties, and British 
diplomats in the capital said the city was calm. 
</P>
<P>
 After declaring in state radio broadcasts monitored in Senegal that "the 
previous political regime has been completely toppled," the soldiers suspended 
the constitution and political parties and declared a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcasts announced the formation of a Provisional Council of the Armed 
Forces, headed by the four lieutenants, identified only as Yahah Jammeh, Sadibu 
Hydara, F.D. Sabaly and I. Signateh. 
</P>
<P>
 Several government ministers, including Vice President Saihou Sabally, were 
reportedly captured, but the radio broadcasts said they "are in safe hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Jawara, who was prime minister when Gambia won independence from Britain in 
1965, became president when the country became a republic in 1970. He survived 
a leftist coup attempt in July, 1981, thanks to Senegalese military 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Troops in Senegal, which surrounds Gambia, were on alert Saturday, but 
official sources said they were unlikely to intervene this time to restore 
Jawara because Senegal blames him for the breakup of the Senegambia federation 
in 1989.

 For the past three years, Denise Huber's disappearance has taken hold of Nancy 
Streza's life. She prayed that God would help bring Denise home and she carted 
flyers with Huber's face on every road trip. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, Streza, who was once Huber's youth counselor at Calabasas 
Presbyterian Church, sat down and composed a song to give to Dennis and Ione 
Huber in commemoration of the third anniversary of their daughter's 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The song, entitled "Her Memory," became a moving tribute in the Saturday 
service that brought the three long years of waiting to a ceremonious end after 
Denise Huber's body was discovered in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote it for the third anniversary and I gave it to them on June 3, but 
then I revised it last week," said Streza, who served as a youth counselor at 
the church along with her husband, Dick, when Denise Huber was in the seventh 
through ninth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The song was performed by pianist John Andrew Schreiner at the Newport Beach 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like we got a glimpse of heaven today," Streza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Streza, who lives near San Juan Capistrano and attends the same Aliso Creek 
church as the Hubers, said she latched onto the lyrics of a Ricky Skaggs song 
during the years of waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes, 'Till the answers come, you've got to keep praying. Keep praying 
till the answers come,' " said Streza, a vocalist and country music fan. "That 
became my song. I made a commitment that I was going to pray everyday." 
</P>
<P>
 Streza said Denise Huber became especially close to her husband during their 
years together at the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Denise Huber disappeared, the Strezas have taken a yearly trip to 
Colorado to visit Nancy Streza's family, plastering every rest stop with 
flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Streza said, they can take their trip with the knowledge that 
Denise Huber's ordeal is over. 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrics of the "Her Memory" follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Five foot nine, eyes of blue  
</P>
<P>
 Oh Denise, we love you!  
</P>
<P>
 She went to a concert on a casual date,  
</P>
<P>
 Said goodby to her friend and drove home real late.  
</P>
<P>
 What happened next is a mystery  
</P>
<P>
 Someone took her away -- left us just her memory.  
</P>
<P>
 Bright eyes and laughter, a heart full of love  
</P>
<P>
 A trusting faith in her God up above  
</P>
<P>
 She loved music and dancin', was a loyal Kings fan  
</P>
<P>
 Walks on the beach with her golden suntan.  
</P>
<P>
 Three years of prayin', three years of fright  
</P>
<P>
 But I know in my heart everything is all right.  
</P>
<P>
 In livin' and dyin' she's safe in God's hands  
</P>
<P>
 The same Lord who loves us has her best in His plans.  
</P>
<P>
 He'll bring us together for eternity  
</P>
<P>
 They didn't take her soul . . . or her memory.  
</P>
<P>
 Bright eyes and laughter, a heart full of love  
</P>
<P>
 A trusting faith in her God up above.  
</P>
<P>
 She loved England and dolphins, was a loyal Kings fan  
</P>
<P>
 I saw her walk on the beach with her golden suntan.  
</P>
<P>
 Though it's still a mystery . . . We have her memory.

PASSENGER ON INFECTED SHIP DIES; AUTOPSY DATA AWAITED

<P>
 A 68-year-old bus driver who was a passenger on a cruise ship where 
Legionnaire's disease bacteria was found has died, an apparent victim of the 
deadly infection, an official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquale Cantone died Friday, a week after being admitted to a hospital near 
his home on Long Island with "a pneumonia-like condition," said Ted Shiebler, 
the hospital administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was performed but the results will not be known for about two 
weeks, Shiebler said. If confirmed as Legionnaire's disease, it would be the 
first death from the cruise ship infections. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four other passengers from the Celebrity Lines cruise ship Horizon 
have been confirmed to be suffering from the disease.

CLINTON RADIO TALK PUSHES GOAL OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a radio address that seemed aimed more at Congress than the American 
public, President Clinton on Saturday defended his goal of universal health 
coverage and warned of a "last-ditch, special-interest media blizzard aimed at 
derailing reform and frightening you." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep our focus for a few more weeks, so we can win a battle that 
has been fought for 60 years," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 House and Senate Democratic leaders are attempting to fashion, from various 
committee bills and other alternatives, the health legislation that they will 
take to their respective chambers. Senate debate could begin as early as this 
week, with the House expected to begin its deliberations shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressional leaders are trying to preserve Clinton's bottom line of 
guaranteeing health coverage to all Americans by a fixed date. 
</P>
<P>
 But resistance is stiff to Clinton's primary means of achieving that goal: a 
requirement that employers pay as much as 80% of their workers' health premium 
costs. Many members of Congress, including some Democrats, are saying that the 
so-called "employer mandate" will not survive in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, with public support for the Clinton plan ebbing, most Republicans and 
some Democrats are trying to build support for a more modest program that 
offers incentives for expanded coverage but does not mandate it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP response to the President's speech, Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) urged 
just such a "common-sense" approach: "Fix what's broken, don't mess with what 
works and make time for preventive care." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clinton insisted that "modified half-measures" will not work. Unless 
everyone is required to be covered, he said, younger and healthier people will 
opt out of the system, making everyone else's premiums more expensive. And when 
the uninsured do seek treatment, he added, it will be in the expensive setting 
of the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 The President framed the debate as one of historic proportions, as significant 
as the efforts that produced Social Security and Medicare. He said those 
programs, too, were criticized as overly bureaucratic, harmful to small 
business and too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that this week will mark the popular Medicare program's 29th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people made it clear then that they wanted reform, and today, 
the pen President Johnson used to sign that legislation is mounted in a 
position of honor in the White House just down the hall from where I'm 
speaking," Clinton said. "And if you tried to repeal Medicare, members of 
Congress from both parties would never let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, Clinton flew to Hot Springs, Ark., with several former 
classmates aboard Air Force One, to attend his 30th high school class reunion.

SHUTTLE ANIMALS DISEMBARK AFTER SMOOTH SUNRISE LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA officials hustled thousands of small animals off Columbia on Saturday 
after the shuttle's smooth sunrise landing concluded America's longest space 
flight in more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the end of the line for the two surviving adult newts -- dissections 
were planned by researchers eager to see the anatomical effects of 15 days of 
weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 A longer, brighter future awaited the four guppylike Japanese Medaka fish. 
They are headed back to Japan in a few weeks to live out their lives and 
continue to mate, under scientific scrutiny, as biologists look for any 
lingering effects of spaceflight. 
</P>
<P>
 Commander Robert Cabana guided Columbia to a touchdown at 3:38 a.m. PDT after 
a voyage of 236 orbits, or 6.1 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-day landing delay caused by offshore storms Friday gave Columbia and its 
crew of seven the shuttle endurance record -- 14 days and nearly 18 hours. The 
previous record was 14 days, 13 minutes, set by another Columbia crew last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It also made Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai the world's female 
space-endurance champ. The all-time records of 84 days on NASA's Skylab in 
1973-74 and 366 days on Russia's Mir space station in 1987-88 -- as well as the 
runners-up -- are held by men. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Cabana and Mukai, Columbia's crew included co-pilot James 
Halsell, flight engineer Carl Walz and mission specialists Don Thomas, Richard 
Hieb and Leroy Chiao. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's next shuttle mission, an 
Earth-monitoring flight by Endeavour, is scheduled for next month.

FIREFIGHTERS ACROSS THE WEST TACKLE 75 LIGHTNING-STRIKE FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of firefighters from throughout the West battled blazes Saturday in 
the dry forests of Northern California and in Oregon, including one that forced 
the evacuation of campers. 
</P>
<P>
 A checkerboard of 75 lightning-sparked fires, which started last week, were 
still burning across the Klamath National Forest of Northern California on 
Saturday as some 2,000 firefighters sought to prevent them from merging into a 
firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a race against time, a race against nature" to get a handle on the 
fires, said Pat Kaunert of the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 5,000 acres of forest had burned in the Klamath forest near the 
California-Oregon border. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires did not threaten any inhabited areas, but the Forest Service said 
they could endanger old-growth forest and the habitat of some endangered 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning also has started fires in the Deschutes and Siskiyou national 
forests in Oregon, but most were out Saturday or under control at less than one 
acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Still burning was the largest Oregon blaze, the Four Corners Fire south of 
Bend, which had swept across 1,680 acres by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire had earlier forced the evacution of more than 100 people from two 
small rustic resorts and at least eight campgrounds, U.S. Forest Service 
spokesman Greg McClarren said. About 900 firefighters were at work on that 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported in Oregon, but one firefighter suffered a broken leg 
parachuting in to fight the California blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 In southern Arizona, the lightning-sparked Rattlesnake fire in the Chiricahua 
Mountains near Tucson was 80% contained after burning 26,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expected to have that blaze under control by today, said Sarah 
Davis, fire information officer for the Coronado National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 About 230 firefighters were working on the fire, she said.

MAN HELD IN SLAYINGS OF TWO YOUTHS AT PARTY IN SAN DIEGO'S OLD TOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested a man on suspicion of murder Saturday in the shootings of two 
teen-agers at a "rave" party near a popular tourist spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old boys were found by police early Saturday morning as the 
outdoor party was breaking up in the Old Town section of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 A rave is an after-hours dance party usually held in an isolated location. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 people were trying to leave a fenced area near the railroad tracks 
when officers arrived about 4 a.m., the San Diego Police Department said 
Saturday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 A shotgun that police believe to be the murder weapon was recovered at the 
scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested was Mark Jonathan Morales, 20, of Paradise Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found one of the teen-agers near the railroad tracks. He died at the 
scene from a shotgun wound to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The second teen-ager was found in a car with friends who were trying to get 
him to a hospital, police said. He had been shot in the back and was taken to 
the trauma center at UC San Diego, where he died a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to release the boys' names until their families were notified.

MAN CHARGED WITH RAPE AFTER ADMITTING KIDNAPING WAS HOAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A handyman, arrested in the rape and kidnaping of his fiancee's 8-year-old 
daughter, has admitted that he took the girl to a motel and then concocted a 
phony story about a break-in and abduction from the family's apartment, police 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Leroy Granger, 34, was being held in the Fullerton City Jail on $50,000 
bail in connection with the kidnaping, sexual assault and rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was found safe late Friday night in the Silver Moon Motel in Anaheim 
after a frantic, daylong search. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God she's alive," said the child's mother, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police said Granger admitted that he staged the break-in at the 
two-bedroom apartment he shared with the child, her mother and her brother to 
make it appear that someone else had abducted her. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Kevin Hamilton would not say if Granger had confessed to raping the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to cover his tracks," Hamilton said. "Even though his story 
about the break-in sounded really far-fetched, we approached it as real because 
you can't rule out anything. His story really unraveled when we found the 
little girl." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, about 20 police officers using bloodhounds searched the 
neighborhood surrounding the 88-unit apartment complex in the 2400 block of 
West Orangethorpe Avenue, where the girl lives. But they couldn't find her. 
</P>
<P>
 The child later told police that she was raped at her apartment and then 
taken, taped and gagged, to the motel. She was told not to leave the room. But 
after seeing her picture on television during a late-night broadcast, she told 
police she ran to the room next door for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said that Granger admitted tying the child's arms, legs and mouth 
with duct tape, putting her inside a laundry basket, covering her with clothes 
and a blanket and smuggling her out of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to believe any of this until I heard it from my daughter," the 
child's exhausted mother said Saturday morning. "I'm shocked and devastated. I 
haven't slept all night. I want to be there when he goes to court I want to see 
him sentenced. I'd like to see justice."

MESSAGE DOUR FOR DODGERS; BASEBALL: THEY SUFFER THEIR SEVENTH LOSS IN NINE 
GAMES, 2-0 TO THE EXPOS, AND DROP BELOW .500. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right after the woman dancing in the stands at Olympic Stadium won $4,500 in a 
promotion and right before Delino DeShields reached the batter's box to lead 
off the sixth inning, the message board at Olympic Stadium flashed an even 
better prize: 
</P>
<P>
 "GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER BABY BOP, LOVE, TISHA." 
</P>
<P>
 Decoded, that meant DeShields' wife, Tisha, is pregnant, which was the only 
good news the Dodgers received in Saturday's 2-0 loss to the Montreal Expos, 
though the timing of the message was questionable.  
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, whose nickname as well as his father's is Bop, was standing at the 
plate when he saw the message, and he looked stunned. After he struck out, he 
looked a little mad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like sinking in my seat," Tisha DeShields said after the game. "I can't 
believe this. I tried to wait (to tell him), but the wives found out about it 
and said they were going to do it. I'm waiting for his reaction now. Bad 
timing." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, visibly disturbed after the game, had this reaction in the 
clubhouse: "I don't have anything to say, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 But DeShields' anger was probably more about the team's seventh loss in nine 
games, which dropped them below .500 (48-49), than the fact that he struck out. 
At least he was still in the clubhouse after the game; most of the players left 
out the back door before the media was let in. The loss decreased the Dodgers' 
lead to two games over the Colorado Rockies and 2 1/2 games over the San 
Francisco Giants in the National League West.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of us playing solid baseball," said Tom Candiotti (7-5), who 
gave up two earned runs over seven innings. "It's more up to us to play 
fundamental baseball. . . . We have to do the things like make good pitches and 
get guys over on base. When you do, you win." 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti has given up four earned runs in 20 innings and three appearances on 
this trip for an 1.80 earned-run average. They got a perfect inning from Ismael 
Valdes, whose blisters are apparently behind them. But they had no hitting, 
being shut out by another left-hander, Jeff Fassero, for 6 2/3 innings and two 
solid relievers, Mel Rojas and John Wetteland, who earned his 17th save. Even 
the Dodgers' league-leading bench couldn't knock in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Fassero (8-6), the Dodgers got five hits but scored no runs and twice 
were caught stealing on pick-off moves. Against Candiotti, the Expos didn't 
fare much better. They scored a run in the first inning on a single by Marquis 
Grissom, a double by Cliff Floyd and a sacrifice fly by Larry Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 After a single in the second inning, Candiotti retired the next 13. Then, in 
the seventh inning, the Expos scored on an infield grounder, a bloop single and 
a line drive single to left that Cory Snyder couldn't get to, then bobbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fassero left the game in the seventh inning after he suffered a strained 
muscle beneath his right shoulder blade while pitching to Tim Wallach, but the 
Dodgers weren't encouraged by seeing Rojas, who has a 1-0 record and five saves 
against the Dodgers this season. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the eighth inning, Manager Tom Lasorda went to his bench, pinch-hitting 
for five consecutive batters. With one out, Chris Gwynn walked and went to 
second on a broken-bat single by Mike Piazza, who, until then, had the day off. 
Wetteland relieved Rojas, and Jeff Treadway flew out to left before Dave Hansen 
popped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetteland followed up with a perfect ninth inning, striking out the first two, 
including DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
 So if DeShields wasn't talking after the game, it could have been because of 
something other than the timing of the message. Tisha had nothing to do with 
that, anyway. The scoreboard operators coded the message in before the game, 
and the computer assigns the rotation. They knew it was coming up before the 
sixth inning, but didn't know DeShields would be batting. When they realized 
what was happening, they said they tried to stop it, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 * ANOTHER LOSS 
</P>

WOODS HAS HACIENDA BY THE TAIL WITH A 62; GOLF: AT 18, HE BREAKS COURSE RECORD 
BY FOUR SHOTS AND LEADS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AMATEUR BY EIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 By the time Tiger Woods finished his course-record round of 62 in the Southern 
California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship on Saturday, the impossible was 
getting old hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibit A: On the embankment right of the third fairway at Hacienda Golf Club 
after an errant tee shot, Woods faced a blind shot. 
</P>
<P>
 His approach shot carried the street running beside the hole, landed short of 
the green, bounced off a three-inch concrete curb that lines the cart path, 
hopped over a bunker guarding the green, and rolled to within a foot of the 
cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Tap. Birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Now imagine that all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods parlayed that outrageous birdie into an eight-under round to take an 
eight-stroke lead with a three-round total of 200, 10-under par. The final 
round is today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the road was the smart shot. I was just trying to hit the green," said 
Woods, 18, from Cypress. Then, breaking a smile, he added, "You kind of get the 
idea when something like that happens that you're on a roll. I did get a lot of 
breaks. But I capitalized on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods began the day with a par 4 on the first hole. He then strung together 
seven consecutive 3s before bogeying the par-four ninth hole for a front-side 
total of 30, five under par. 
</P>
<P>
 On five, Woods' tee shot seemed headed out of bounds, but it hit the cart 
path, hit a tree and bounced back into the fairway. Woods found the green, then 
made a 40-foot putt for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 He bunkered his second shot on the par-five seventh hole, but holed out for an 
eagle-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to get my approach shots close because the greens were jumpy," 
Woods said. "I've been farther under par, but this is the lowest score I've 
ever shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tom Kroll of San Marcos, who was paired with Woods: "I was just watching. 
In fact, I was cheering him on. I wanted him to shoot 53." 
</P>
<P>
 Records shattered by Woods' 62: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hacienda's competitive course record (was 66). 
</P>
<P>
 -- SCGA Amateur record (was 64). 
</P>
<P>
 -- SCGA Amateur three-round total at 200 (was 202). 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament record of 274 will almost certainly fall today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Johnson of Helendale, who, like Kroll, started the day two behind, also 
was paired with Woods, and finished the day in second place at 208 after a 68. 
</P>
<P>
 "208 is a low number to be eight shots behind," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eighth hole, Woods overshot the green and ended up in a back sand trap, 
but he holed the bunker shot for another birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing an 180-yard approach shot on 10, Woods dropped it two feet from the 
hole. Another birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods' birdie was on 14 and typically ridiculous. Off the tee, he landed wide, 
200 yards from the hole, in heavy trees, below a blind rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods launched an iron shot that deftly hooked past a fence of 80-foot oaks 
guarding the green, bounced on the green's back apron and into a rear trench.  
</P>
<P>
 Another chip shot. Another birdie.

THE SHOW MODESTLY GOES ON; GOODWILL GAMES: BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS, OPENING 
CEREMONY IS A SCALED-DOWN PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Boris Petrov's vision, the Kirov Stadium field during the Goodwill Games' 
opening ceremony Saturday would have been transformed into the surface of Mars, 
where three astronauts and three cosmonauts would have touched down together in 
an expression of 21st Century camaraderie between the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the St. Petersburg Organizing Committee slashed his budget by 
two-thirds, from $9 million to $3 million, his grand illusion crashed to earth 
with the force of the Shoemaker-Levy comet. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrov, who also directed opening ceremonies in Moscow for the 1980 Summer 
Olympics and the 1986 Goodwill Games, said he was proud of Saturday's more 
modest presentation, attended by about 70,000 and presided over by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. A deflated Petrov acknowledged, however, that it was 
inferior to his first version. 
</P>
<P>
 As did Petrov, organizers also envisioned an event that was out of this world 
when they were awarded the third Goodwill Games. But although it seems clear 
now that they underestimated the enormity of the challenge of staging the first 
international multi-sport competition in Russia since the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, they, unlike Petrov, remain undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 Lecturing reporters in a news conference before the opening ceremony, St. 
Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, punctuating his remarks with a bellowing 
voice and pointed finger, boldly declared that the Games "will be remembered as 
one of the best sporting events in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Although that prediction is likely to be deposited -- after the closing 
ceremony two weeks from today -- under the category of a politician's 
hyperbole, there are indications that these Goodwill Games will be more 
memorable than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 It might even be said that they have arrived at the threshold of legitimacy. 
Considered strictly a Ted Turner production in 1986 in Moscow and 1990 in 
Seattle, they have attracted the attention and a modest rights fee from a major 
network. While Turner's TBS remains the principle broadcaster, televising 64 
hours over 16 days, ABC will carry 17 hours in three weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, who as recently as four years ago said the Goodwill Games added 
unnecessary clutter to the international sports calendar, gave them his stamp 
of approval. The former Spanish ambassador to the Soviet Union delivered a 
two-minute speech, in Russian, during the opening ceremony. Earlier Saturday, 
he referred to the Games as "an important part of the Olympic movement." 
</P>
<P>
 It also is impossible to argue with Turner's assertion Saturday that there are 
more outstanding athletes here than at any other multi-sport event outside of 
the Olympics. Among the more than 2,000 athletes from 55 countries competing in 
24 sports are many of the world's best in track and field, swimming and diving, 
boxing, weightlifting, gymnastics and figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 The lasting images of the 1994 Goodwill Games, however, probably will be 
provided by this spectacular host city of 5 million constructed in 1703 by 
Peter the Great as Russia's Gateway to the West. It is doubtful he had a clue 
when he was building the city's cornerstone, the Peter and Paul Fortress, that 
it someday would become a venue for beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The star of the Games will be the city of St. Petersburg," said Jack Kelly, 
Goodwill Games president. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city has not been an ideal partner in the triumvirate that also 
includes Turner and the Russian Olympic Committee. Even though the local 
government has been enthusiastic, contributing $140 million of the $210 million 
cost, there were too many obstacles to overcome after the tumultuous changes in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 With several of the 11 venues still undergoing construction last week, the 
rush was so great at the SKA Swimming Pool that a mishap with the filtration 
system prevented the competition from beginning as scheduled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed cycling velodrome remained on the drawing board because of a 
dispute with a trade union. A part for one of the scoreboards at the site for 
track and field, Petrovsky Stadium, was ordered earlier this year from Hungary 
but never arrived. The driver who was entrusted with the part was last seen 
crossing the border into Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket sales have been anemic at best. Organizers said Friday that half of 
530,000 available tickets had been sold. But the English-language St. 
Petersburg Press, quoting sources within the organizing committee, reported 
that the number was significantly less. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices ranged from $2.50 to $35 until Friday, when organizers, acknowledging 
that many residents of the economically depressed region could not afford them, 
cut them by one-third. They also said they were considering adding groups to 
the schoolchildren, retirees, construction workers and Olympic athletes who had 
been promised free admission. But distribution seemed to be as much of a 
barrier as cost as would-be purchasers complained they could not find tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the circumstances, Kelly said the fact that the Games will go on 
is a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we signed the initial contract four years ago, we were dealing with 
Leningrad in the Soviet Union and our partners were the Soviet Sports Committee 
and Soviet television," he said. "If we had had a picture then of the totality 
of the changes that would occur between then and now, I'm not sure we would 
have gone ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 When Turner suggested that might happen in 1992, Sobchak defiantly said St. 
Petersburg would carry on alone, further intensifying criticism from those in 
the city who complained that the millions of dollars going toward the Goodwill 
Games could have been better spent. Sobchak insisted then, as he does now, that 
the Games are an investment in the city's future, advertising to the world that 
St. Petersburg is open for business. 
</P>
<P>
 In that philosophy, he is closely related to Turner. Announcing in 1985 that 
he was founding the Goodwill Games to heal the wounds between the Soviet Union 
and the United States caused by the Summer Olympic boycotts of 1980 in Moscow 
and 1984 in Los Angeles, Turner, in his own mind, succeeded beyond his wildest 
dreams. He has apportioned himself at least a little credit for the end of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, however, is not merely a diplomat. He also is a businessman who knows 
better than anyone what the Goodwill Games have cost him: $44 million in 1986, 
$27 million in '90 and an estimated $10 million this year.  
</P>
<P>
 But he said Saturday that he is paid $500 million a year from cable operators 
to provide original programming, and that the Goodwill Games will remain as 
part of that package for the foreseeable future. The 1998 edition already has 
been awarded to New York. Besides, if they ever become profitable, Turner will 
own them outright. "They're an investment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a language understood by everyone in the capitalist world, including 
Russia. For a more probable preview of the 21st Century, perhaps Petrov should 
have replaced the astronauts and cosmonauts with American and Russian investors 
arriving hand-in-hand at the World Bank.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE MANAGES QUITE NICELY DESPITE THE DISTRACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 By accident I ended up in a room by myself with Buck Showalter, who is the 
sharp young manager of the New York Yankees, and with Reggie Jackson, who is, 
well, Reggie Jackson. We got to talking about an appointment Showalter had 
scheduled for Saturday morning to meet for the first time with one of the 
Yankees' newest and goofiest executives, George Costanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Costanza is a middle-aged man who lives with his parents. He bears an eerie 
resemblance to the excellent actor Jason Alexander and was last seen on the 
season-ending episode of the NBC television program "Seinfeld," a show about 
nothing, learning that he had just been personally approved by George 
Steinbrenner to join the Yankee front office, I forget as what. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traveling secretary," Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the manager had been keeping tabs on the growing number of crazy 
Georges in the company. Showalter and one of his outfielders, Danny Tartabull, 
had been asked to set aside an hour in the morning at Anaheim Stadium to tape a 
brief segment for an upcoming "Seinfeld," possibly something having to do with 
the Seinfeld fly rule. But Buck had reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something might come up to keep me from doing it," he said mysteriously, 
looking at Reggie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh?" I said, brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might be busy," Showalter said, still looking at Reggie. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might be busy," Reggie said, looking at Buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Busy?" I interrogated. 
</P>
<P>
 "With meetings," Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, meetings," Reggie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven hours before a night game? Meetings? 
</P>
<P>
 Inasmuch as the Yankees had just outscored the Angels, 23-10, over two nights, 
I seriously doubted that any emergency situation existed. Then again, from what 
I hear, Steinbrenner is still out there somewhere, making the Yankee manager's 
life miserable, which, of course, is what Steinbrenner does as naturally as 
fish swim. I gather he still incessantly rings the manager's phone, still gives 
him an earful. He just doesn't go public with this designated Hitler act any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Being manager of the Yankees means always having to say you're sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 Showalter has lasted longer than most. He is in his third season as Yankee 
skipper, a job often cruelly thought of as Steinbrenner's marionette. Buck 
looks 38 going on 58. It can't be easy being in that dugout, even when the 
Yanks are in first place, even when the pressure is on low. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Showalter who won his 100th game before his 37th birthday, who guided 
the Yankees to their first winning season after four in a row below .500. Yet 
it is not an easy life. Showalter has been known to sleep inside the stadium 
overnight before a day game. He has a club full of free agents and a fat 
division lead to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recently learned how quickly the lightning can crackle, having made an 
offhand, confidential remark about Barry Bonds and Ken Griffey Jr. lacking a 
certain "respect for the game," then having his basically innocuous comments 
about the players' sloppy dressing habits quoted back as though he had impugned 
Bonds' and Griffey's reputations. Griffey crowed that the Yankees would be the 
first team trying to sign him, as though anyone had ever said anything to the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Buck ducks the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you get asked to do a lot of TV things?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not me," Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How come?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a bore." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't. He merely has never been confused with Billy Martin. The 30th 
different manager the Yankees have had, Showalter is the unassuming son of a 
Pittsburgh Steeler fullback. He played ball at Mississippi State, spent seven 
years hitting .294 in the minors without ever getting one at-bat in the bigs, 
then at a tender age landed one of baseball's meanest jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 He's trying to win a pennant, trying to please George, trying to keep modern 
players happy, trying to prepare for a labor walkout, trying to keep third base 
coach Wave 'Em Home Willie Randolph from sending every runner, trying to feed 
the media animals, trying to step through picketers upset over some other 
Yankee executive's remark, even trying to accommodate a situation-comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie asked, "What's the name of the show?" 
</P>
<P>
 'Seinfeld," Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie nodded in recognition, but said, "Those TV things are always more fun 
in the talking than in the doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Same as managing the Yankees.

SPECIAL REPORT / SOCCER IN AMERICA; TALL ORDER; MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER, SCHEDULED 
TO MAKE ITS DEBUT IN 1995, FACES THE DAUNTING CHALLENGE OF SURVIVING ON THE 
COMPETITIVE AMERICAN SPORTS LANDSCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lee Stern can laugh about it now. He can find humor in a little enterprise he 
once undertook that had its ups and downs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I never was interested in money," Stern said. "Being in soccer 
prevented me from being one of the major owners of the Chicago Bulls."  
</P>
<P>
 Stern, a successful Chicago commodities broker, once was a major force in 
American soccer. He owned the Chicago Sting of the now-defunct North American 
Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned down a chance to be involved with the Bulls because by the time the 
offer was made "the Sting was losing more money than I could think about," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Stern, who also once was an investor in the Chicago White Sox, lost millions 
trying to sell soccer to America.  
</P>
<P>
 So did Texas oilman Lamar Hunt, who once owned the NASL's Dallas Tornado.  
</P>
<P>
 If anyone in the United States has reason to resent even the mere mention of 
the word soccer, it is these gentlemen.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for one month this summer there was little doubt each was running a 
socccer fever. 
</P>
<P>
 They, like many other Americans, were swept up in a euphoric wave of 
excitement over World Cup '94. Hunt had seen 10 games by the third weekend and 
Stern could not be lured away from the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But before anyone declares America a bona fide soccer-crazy nation, there is 
much to be done. The architects of the World Cup organizing committee face a 
daunting task, the development of a professional soccer league that becomes 
part of America.  
</P>
<P>
 That, after all, was the ultimate aim of their monthlong extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 They sold us soccer for a month. Now, can they sell it for a lifetime? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like soccer comes into America today as a virgin sport, untouched 
and untried," said Kyle Rote Jr., one of the biggest American names in the 
sport 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Lee Stern, Lamar Hunt and a host of other successful sports owners 
could not make it work, many wonder how it will be different this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the party will be over in a couple weeks and soccer will be where it 
was," said David Burns of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago company 
that promotes athletes for commercials.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Leigh Steinberg, a sports agent from Newport Beach who represents a 
number of U.S. national team players, is not sure the sport will gain a 
foothold in America. And if it does not, the legacy of the World Cup will be 
nothing more than fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
 After the United States had upset Colombia in the first round, the sport's 
future looked promising. The next day, calls came pouring in, Steinberg said. 
But when the team lost a few days later to Romania, "It hit with a dull thud."  
</P>
<P>
 Such is the fickle nature of the American public. Obscure Olympic athletes 
such as speed skater Dan Jansen and skier Tommy Moe were darlings during the 
Winter Olympics in February but have all but disappeared since. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a trendy country," Steinberg said. "We tend to focus on things that are 
hot. All of a sudden soccer is hot."  
</P>
<P>
 But for how long? 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer community is unswayed by such pessimism. The World Cup captured the 
imagination of a nation, and those who have toiled in the soccer trenches for 
much of their lives believe their sport and time have come.  
</P>
<P>
 It might take five years to find out if they are right. Major League Soccer, 
which is scheduled to open in 12 cities next April, is hoping to lay a 
foundation to sustain the sport. The World Cup was the jump start, and optimism 
is oozing from the Century City offices MLS shared with the World Cup '94 
organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, head of World Cup USA '94, the U.S. Soccer Federation and 
MLS, is part of the reason many believe the new league has a better chance of 
succeeding than past efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Alan came up with this brilliant scheme that might be the only scheme that 
could work," said Rote, a Memphis sports agent.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most sports enterprises, MLS has total ownership. Instead of a 
collection of individual owners, MLS will dictate rules and policy in what 
Rothenberg calls a single-entity league.  
</P>
<P>
 But when the World Cup started June 17, the proposed league had so many 
question marks that a healthy skepticism prevailed. For instance, the day 
before the Cup opener in Chicago, Rothenberg introduced seven cities as charter 
members of MLS, instead of the expected 12. Rothenberg said recently that five 
more cities would be named by Aug. 1, although others say it probably will 
happen sometime in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, major sponsors and financing, the backbone of the single-entity 
league, have not been announced.  
</P>
<P>
 MLS insiders say the World Cup has piqued the interest of potential investors, 
but the fledgling league needs commitment now more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a challenge that I think can succeed," said Harley Frankel, MLS 
senior vice president, who worked as an NBA executive for eight years. "What a 
lot of people miss is, this is not an attempt to have instant success like the 
NBA or baseball is enjoying." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel, once a staff member in the Carter Administration, said the league's 
plan to build slowly is solid, but the unexpected success of the World Cup has 
solidified its position.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has given potential investors more confidence," he said. "It has given 
television more confidence that it will succeed. The World Cup has given us 
more muscle."  
</P>
<P>
 Or as Roy Wegerle of the U.S. national team said, "If this doesn't kick it in, 
nothing will."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, like most new endeavors, MLS faces many obstacles. There is a gulf of 
difference between interest and investment. The league has gained the attention 
of sponsors. MLS announced recently that Mitre will be the official game ball 
and Nike will provide uniforms for six teams. However, sponsors are not 
investors and until the money is raised, there will be no stadiums and no 
players.  
</P>
<P>
 The league hired a Wall Street investment banker to help raise $100 million, a 
move that can be seen as a sign either of strength or weakness. And those who 
invest must overcome the fears of MLS' own five-year projections.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the MLS business plan, the league expects to lose $63.6 million 
from 1993 to 1997, almost $30 million in its first season. The losses are based 
on an average attendance of 12,500 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Clippers, in their 10th season in Los Angeles, averaged 
11,489 in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest challenge facing U.S. soccer is bringing its community 
together with a common purpose. Although that is Rothenberg's aim, his 
stranglehold on the sport has caused ill will.  
</P>
<P>
 Rick Davis, coach and general manager of the Los Angeles Salsa of the American 
Professional Soccer League, has fired a loud salvo. His league is being told it 
will serve as a second division, or minor league, to the MLS.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why has the MLS been given preferred status when the APSL has been going for 
four years now?" asked Davis, a former player with the NASL's Cosmos.  
</P>
<P>
 And there is yet another league trying to start, Chicago entrepreneur Jim 
Paglia's League 1 America. But whereas the APSL and League 1 America covet the 
USSF's designation of Division One status, only MLS has it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, it has Rothenberg, who has gained respect from FIFA, soccer's 
international governing body, because of the success of World Cup '94. 
Rothenberg said that FIFA President Joao Havelange of Brazil told him that the 
World Cup had been the best in the sport's history. When it comes to the MLS 
and the sport's future, Davis thinks an opportunity has been lost. "I am 
disappointed and frustrated that the MLS isn't going to play a game for nearly 
a year after the World Cup," Davis said. "The league should have been ready to 
capitalize on new spectator interest here as soon as the World Cup ended. They 
knew in 1988 that the World Cup was coming here, so they had six years to 
organize and get the pro league going." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the U.S. national team's John Harkes: "If people who are up there in top 
places are doing it for the game and not for making a buck, it will succeed. If 
they're doing it to make a quick buck, it'll be out of there in a heartbeat. 
That's the way it's always been for soccer."  
</P>
<P>
 If MLS sticks to its modest goals in the beginning, it has a chance to gain 
acceptance. Hunt, 62, said he would love to join the fun, but is too old to 
start another adventure. But having been around football much of his life, he 
notes that sports go through cycles in America.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing stays the same," he said, adding that soccer might catch on this 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 To do so, it must compete with a broad menu of sports options, from baseball 
to football to basketball to hockey to college sports.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a culture where one sport dominates," Rote said. "You can't go from 
no passion and no knowledge in one step." 
</P>
<P>
 But the World Cup has at least changed perceptions. The international flavor 
of the matches in the nine host cities was a wonderful experience for many 
Americans. Without the electrifying scene of World Cup competition, soccer 
could lose its dynamics, said Burns, the Chicago agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atmosphere isn't a bunch of little kids running around in shorts for momma 
and papa to watch them," he said. "That's the mistake soccer is making." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, on the other hand, believes soccer has been making it here all along 
because of the number of youngsters playing -- as many as 16.4 million by some 
estimates.  
</P>
<P>
 "This sport is here to stay," he said. "It's just too much fun for kids to 
play."  
</P>
<P>
 Does that translate into a successful pro league?  
</P>
<P>
 It has not in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the World Cup? It might.

JIM MURRAY: THIS GUY CAN HELP YOU DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ordinarily, when a revolutionary new golf club is introduced, it's the work of 
a star player, usually one of the legends of the game. I mean, after all, it 
was Gene Sarazen who invented the sand wedge. And it was Auld Tom Morris who 
came up with the cleek or the mashie niblick. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when a dramatic new driving club made its way into the game a year or so 
ago and soon had golfers from three continents queueing up to get it, the golf 
community expected it to be the product of Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, maybe 
Ben Hogan.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. It was the brainstorm of a guy who never teed it up in anything 
more portentous than a weekend member-guest at Seminole, a guy who never had to 
make up his mind whether to lay up or go for it on the 15th at Augusta on 
Sunday and who never worried about missing the cut at a Honda Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 When the golf world learned that its newest sensation had been discovered, 
developed and manufactured by a guy who grew wine grapes for a living, it was 
stunned.  
</P>
<P>
 It needn't have been. Ely (pronounced Ee -lee) Callaway had a history of 
success at whatever business he chose to tackle, from the rag business in the 
East -- Burlington Industries -- to the wine business in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Ely Callaway well knew the secret to success in business: Get a superior 
product and make sure the public finds out about it. After all, it was Emerson 
who said if you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway probably couldn't read a two-break putt for a British Open. He was a 
14-handicapper who had once won a couple of club championships at home in 
Georgia, but he had never expected golf to be his life's work. When he left 
Seventh Avenue and the textile industry, he came west to Temecula to bottle his 
own wine. Golf would be something he watched on television.  
</P>
<P>
 He eventually sold the winery (to Hiram Walker) for $14 million and, as luck 
would have it, he stopped in a golf shop in Temecula one day, a kind of ma and 
pa store where they had the most exquisitely-crafted hickory shafted clubs. He 
fell in love with them. He not only bought the clubs, he bought the business.  
</P>
<P>
 Ely Callaway never does anything casually. He delved into club manufacture. A 
quick study showed him that the golf club business needed more than hickory 
shafts, it needed an overhaul, a consolidation. And a little mystique.  
</P>
<P>
 You have to know something about the American psyche. Americans, almost to a 
man, are convinced there is in all life's work some secret shortcut to great 
success. There is. It's called hard work. But Americans prefer to think there 
is a gimmick that lets you bypass that, and that the successful know it and the 
rest of us don't. It's what keeps bunco artists in cigars and penthouses.  
</P>
<P>
 Golfers are the worst in this regard. Good golf, like the way to Carnegie 
Hall, is found only in endless practice. But the hackers are sure something is 
being kept from them. The pro shops are always thronged with golfers looking 
for Nirvana.  
</P>
<P>
 So, Ely Callaway gave it to them. First of all, there is very little doubt his 
metal wood driver -- and his three- and seven-woods -- are demonstrably better 
than other clubs on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 He had his better mousetrap, or, in his case, No. 1 wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology was simple, the results dramatic. Callaway hired an industrial 
designer, Richard Helmstetter, who had been designing, of all things, billiard 
cues in Japan, and put him to work on designing the perfect driving club.  
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the head of the club was 25% larger than standard drivers. The club 
was like a football fullback -- big head, no neck. The hosel of the club was 
jettisoned, the shaft buried directly into the club head.  
</P>
<P>
 Who needed a hosel anyway? After all, it's the hosel that causes the shank.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, he had the product. How to get it in the locker rooms?  
</P>
<P>
 The product was good. But so was penicillin, which languished on shelves for a 
decade for lack of promotion. Fulton had trouble selling the steamboat.  
</P>
<P>
 He should have had Ely Callaway.  
</P>
<P>
 First, he needed a catchy name. In World War I, the Germans had a gun designed 
by the Krupp Works that could hit Paris from 60 miles away. Krupp called it 
"Big Bertha" in honor of his daughter. Callaway named his driver after her, 
too.  
</P>
<P>
 Phase 2 found Callaway getting his clubs into the hands of opinion makers from 
the royal family in England to movie stars in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 The reaction was nuclear. Callaway got the best promotion it's possible to 
get, whether it's movies or baking powder -- word of mouth. The Callaway driver 
took the game by storm. Hackers swore by it. So did touring pros.  
</P>
<P>
 You have to understand, golf over the years has had many innovations. 
Fiberglass shafts had their vogue -- until they began to torque out of shape. 
Aluminum shafts had Palmer as a spokesman. They never won a tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Callaway driver was a star. Suddenly, you were nobody if you didn't 
have one in your bag. Partners scolded you, opponents pitied you.  
</P>
<P>
 Ely Callaway is having the time of his life. He occupies a place in the golf 
firmament somewhere between Bobby Jones -- a not-so-distant relative -- and 
Santa Claus. A jovial, cheerful man, this ace of clubs takes the position that 
he is selling dreams. And, on the links, he is. There is nothing that brings a 
smile to the face and a spring to the step of a golfer more than a drive that 
goes 20 yards farther and half a latitude straighter than it used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway doesn't have time for his own game anymore. He lunches at his desk 
these days, next to a phone and fax machine. His factory in Carlsbad is 
expanding so fast you're afraid to park your car outside.  
</P>
<P>
 The graph, of course, has gone steadily up. From a start of $364,000 gross, it 
has climbed to $255 million in nine years. The stock is listed on the Big 
Board.  
</P>
<P>
 The good fortune amuses Callaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went in the wine business, I bought a tract home for $45,000," he 
says. "The other day, I started building a home where the front door costs 
$45,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Building golf dreams is more fun than cutting cloth or bottling Chardonnay. 
But if it has played havoc with his own game, it has rejuvenated those of 
hackers from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 When you talk of the great inventions of man, you might start with the 
electric light, the steam engine or the motion picture but, to the golfer, they 
pale beside the club that can get you out of the sand in one, or off the tee so 
far you beat your brother-in-law two-a-side every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarazen belongs in the Golf Hall of Fame. So do Palmer, Hogan, Snead, 
Nicklaus. But for the high-handicapper who for once has a club in his hand he 
can't shank and top 22 yards off the tee, Ely Callaway belongs there, too.

FALLING ANGELS CAN'T COMPETE WITH YANKEES; BASEBALL: NEW YORK WINS EASILY FOR 
THIRD NIGHT IN A ROW, 7-2. MATTINGLY GETS 2,000TH HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The grumbling is louder in the Angel clubhouse each day. They are sick are of 
hearing the rhetoric about being in a pennant race. They are tired of listening 
to excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels really wanted the baseball world to take them seriously as 
contenders, the New York Yankees have blown their cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees have exploited every flaw in their arsenal the last three days, 
trouncing the Angels once again Saturday night, 7-2, and leaving no doubt to 
the 29,354 at Anaheim Stadium who is in the real pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joke, an absolute joke," one veteran said. "It's like we're not even 
in the same league with these guys. How can anyone say we're in a pennant race? 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anyone really believe that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (42-57), who are a season-low 15 games under .500 once again, have 
barely looked competitive against the Yankees. The Yankees (59-36) are batting 
.371 in the first three games of this series, outscoring the Angels 30-12, with 
46 hits and six home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitching has become so unbearable that Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann, 
seeing that his position players have become so weary from chasing balls hit to 
every crevice of Anaheim Stadium, decided to preserve their energy. He allowed 
the starting position players to show up 30 minutes later than the rest of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've been getting tired out there," Angel left fielder Bo Jackson 
said. "We've been doing a whole lot of running out there in the outfield." 
</P>
<P>
 It was no different Saturday, with rookie Brian Anderson becoming the latest 
Angel starter to give his defense a workout, yielding 11 hits and seven earned 
runs in 4 2/3 innings. In the three games against the Yankees, each starter has 
lasted only 4 2/3 innings, yielding a 14.14 earned-run average, with 29 hits 
and six homers in 14 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it might make some of the veterans nervous that they're throwing a 
bunch of kids out there," Anderson said. "We're learning every day, but 
experience is something you can't teach." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels truly believe they are in a race, however, would they really 
have two rookies in their starting rotation, and another who will celebrate his 
one-year anniversary in the big leagues this week? 
</P>
<P>
 The most frustrating aspect of the whole ordeal is that the Texas Rangers are 
daring anyone to take the American League West, and no one has bothered. The 
Rangers, who reached utopia by climbing above .500 on June 13 with a 31-30 
record, since have gone 15-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it hasn't mattered. The Angels continue to bungle any chances to take 
advantage, going only 16-19 during the same stretch, while remaining five games 
back with only 19 games remaining before the tentative Aug. 16 strike date. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just isn't much time left," Angel third baseman Spike Owen said. "It 
should feel like a pennant race, but it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, this turned into a night of milestones, and not only the Angels' 
dubious feat of having one of their starters yield a homer for the 16th 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly produced his 2,000th career hit in the 
seventh inning off reliever Russ Springer, becoming only the sixth Yankee to 
accomplish the feat. He joins Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Mickey 
Mantle, Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel designated hitter Chili Davis then had his magical moment in the eighth 
inning when he homered off Joe Ausanio for his 1,000th run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, this night was little different than any of the others. There was 
Bernie Williams leading off the game with a single. There was Paul O'Neill 
hitting a two-run homer in the first inning. There were the Yankees leading, 
7-0, in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were the Angel executives, punching up numbers on the telephone 
until their fingers were numb, desperately searching for pitching.

SPECIAL REPORT / SOCCER IN AMERICA; NASL BOOM/BUST A POOR ROLE MODEL; HISTORY: 
COSMOS HAD TO GO FOR BIG FOREIGN NAMES, BUT MLS WILL TRY TO SUCCEED ON THE 
AMERICAN PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The New York Cosmos did everything in a big way. The franchise's collapse was 
no different. From 1975 to the early 1980s, the Cosmos were the flagship 
franchise of the North American Soccer League, America's first and last major 
outdoor professional soccer league.  
</P>
<P>
 When the Cosmos failed, the league failed with them, and with the league went 
all of soccer's credibility as marketable entertainment in the United States, 
the world's largest entertainment market. 
</P>
<P>
 In their heyday, the Cosmos played before crowds of more than 70,000 in Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. They had international star power -- at one 
time the Cosmos had 14 nationalities represented on their roster. And they had 
Pele.  
</P>
<P>
 They were New York, and they were huge.  
</P>
<P>
 And anyone with links to the team is still blamed for ruining soccer in 
America.  
</P>
<P>
 Mark Brickley, the president of Sportslink, a New York sports promotional 
firm, was the vice president of broadcasting and public relations for the 
Cosmos, and he still is defensive about the team.  
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't consider ourselves to be competing with (NASL franchises in) Tulsa 
and Tampa Bay," Brickley said. "We were competing with the Yankees and the Mets 
and Lincoln Center." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cosmos drew 70,000 by signing Pele, Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio 
Chinaglia, former World Cup stars whose skills were diminished when they 
arrived in New York, but whose drawing power was not.  
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, if we're going to do it, we have to get the big-time guys," Brickley 
said. "We knew that (the NASL) would not work on a minor league level. Our 
ethnic fan base demanded the big-time names."  
</P>
<P>
 The Cosmos were owned by Warner Communications, which could afford high-priced 
international talent. The rest of the league, largely owned by individuals or 
small-time partnerships struggling to fill modest payrolls, was outclassed.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Brickley, "They'd say, 'Well, we can't be the NFL, but since my kid plays 
soccer, we can be the Houston or Memphis NASL team.' Those owners that tried to 
keep up quickly went belly up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think they needed to. No league has ever done badly with a dynasty 
in it. All leagues have to have somebody to hate, like the Yankees or Green Bay 
in their heyday." 
</P>
<P>
 With Warner pumping money into the roster, the Cosmos won four championships 
in six years, and the rest of the league, which fluctuated from a peak of 24 
teams to a low of five, had to do something.  
</P>
<P>
 Trying to keep pace, team after team burned itself out.  
</P>
<P>
 Peter Wall played briefly in the NASL before becoming the coach of the 
now-defunct California Surf and L.A. Lazers.  
</P>
<P>
 "The NASL was one of the reasons I came from England," Wall said. "When the 
Cosmos brought in the stars, it pushed the average salary up. The (Cosmos') 
salaries were used as a comparison, just like any other sport."  
</P>
<P>
 Since the NASL, American fans have seen leagues of all shapes and sizes come 
and go. None have brought soccer to the national consciousness, or even network 
TV, the way the NASL tried to.  
</P>
<P>
 "We made some critical mistakes, chief among them expanding from 12 to 24 
teams without researching and carefully planning the ownership groups," 
Brickley said. "Then (when a franchise failed) you couldn't go back into those 
cities because you've left a bad taste in their mouth."  
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Major League Soccer, the first attempt at a high-profile pro league 
since the NASL. 
</P>
<P>
 The MLS is already ahead of the NASL in some ways.  
</P>
<P>
 NASL TV advertising was sold locally. The MLS is recruiting national sponsors. 
The NASL was destructively cavalier about ownership, but the MLS is showing 
selectivity: Only seven of the 12 franchises have been awarded with no evident 
rush to get out the last five. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wall now sees a major appeal for the MLS that the NASL never had: 
home-grown talent.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the NASL, you had only to play two American-born players. I honestly 
believe now that there is more than enough talent in America. And fans 
obviously would rather follow Americans."

SPECIAL REPORT / SOCCER IN AMERICA; WORLD CUP FEVER WORKING AGAINST ESTABLISHED 
APSL; COMPETITION: LEAGUE HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 1990, BUT MLS THREATENS TO 
SHUNT IT ASIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Soccer people are quick to tell you that the successful run of the World Cup 
means big-time U.S. professional soccer is in the on-deck circle.  
</P>
<P>
 They're sure of this because Alan Rothenberg, president of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation and chairman of the organization that ran the World Cup, is also in 
charge of Major League Soccer, the league he says will start next year.  
</P>
<P>
 One problem here.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States already has pro soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called the American Professional Soccer League and it has two key 
elements Rothenberg doesn't -- players and stadiums.  
</P>
<P>
 The league has been in business since 1990, has eight franchises, and is 
adding four for the 1995 season. Seven players on the U.S. World Cup team were 
APSL veterans.  
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup hasn't benefited the APSL in the way league officials figured it 
would when the United States began preparing a few years ago for the world's 
biggest sports event.  
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, we thought having the World Cup in the U.S. would be the 
greatest thing that could possibly happen to us," said William De La Pena, APSL 
chairman and owner of the Los Angeles Salsa, which plays at Cal State 
Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be a great shot in the arm for our league and the growth 
of soccer, but the way it's worked out . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The way it has worked out is that for the APSL, the World Cup was a nightmare 
-- a colossus that generated revenue that might be used to bury the APSL.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Alan Rothenberg has taken over U.S. soccer.  
</P>
<P>
 First, he was elected USSF president in 1990, and had himself put in charge of 
World Cup USA '94, the organization formed to run the event when FIFA, the 
sport's world governing body, awarded it to the United States in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 Then the USSF designated Rothenberg's proposed league as the only Division I 
soccer league in the United States, infuriating APSL officials, who also had 
sought that designation.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, Rothenberg set up the U.S. Soccer Foundation, into which World Cup 
profits will be directed. Rothenberg has said 30% of the profits will be seed 
money for his pro league.  
</P>
<P>
 That could be about $6 million, since he said the tournament would have about 
a $20-million surplus.  
</P>
<P>
 While Rothenberg was building his power base, the APSL was quietly building 
its league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the best players in the country under long-term contracts," said De 
La Pena, 40, who operates five ophthalmology clinics in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties.  
</P>
<P>
 "Two things are going to happen. There will only be the APSL playing next 
year, or we will have two leagues playing against each other. If that happens, 
we wish Rothenberg well.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing personal against Rothenberg -- we just feel the U.S. Soccer 
Federation should negotiate with us, too."  
</P>
<P>
 Says another APSL owner, Martin Nixdorf of the Colorado Foxes, "I think 
Rothenberg would like to put us out of business, but I don't know yet how he 
plans to do that."  
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, through a spokesman, said he would have no comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Salsa and Colorado, the APSL has franchises in Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla.; Houston, Montreal, Seattle, Toronto and Vancouver. Four more will be 
added next year, among them Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
 APSL players earn salaries of $30,000-$60,000. This year, each team plays a 
20-game schedule that began recently and runs to late September. League venues 
range from 6,000 to 76,000 seats. MLS play, Rothenberg says, begins in April, 
1995.  
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa, De La Pena's team, plays in 10,000-seat Cal State Fullerton stadium 
considered to be the best for soccer in Southern California. The team said it 
averaged 5,367 a home date last season.  
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Rothenberg's representatives visited Cal State Fullerton, asking 
to inspect the stadium. De La Pena is still annoyed.  
</P>
<P>
 "They knew when they went down there we had a five-year exclusive lease on 
that facility," De La Pena said.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Bill Shumard, former Cal State Fullerton athletic director, "They pushed 
pretty hard. They promised to enlarge it by 20,000 seats. They wanted the 
school to break the lease, and we told them we weren't about to."  
</P>
<P>
 So, where is all this headed?  
</P>
<P>
 A soccer war, akin to the old NFL-AFL war of the 1960s? The courtroom? A 
merger? A takeover? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way Rothenberg can start a league that's comparable to ours in 
quality is if he brings in a lot of foreign players," said Alan Hinton, 
president and coach of the Seattle Sounders.  
</P>
<P>
 The APSL permits only two foreign players on each team's 18-player game-day 
roster. Rothenberg has said the MLS will allow four foreigners per team.  
</P>
<P>
 "When all the dust settles, this will be all about players," Hinton said.  
</P>
<P>
 "My sincere hope is that we can all sit down around a table and sort all this 
out and do what's right for American soccer."  
</P>
<P>
 Said De La Pena, "Until Rothenberg came along, we were the only ones laying 
out money for U.S. pro soccer. Suddenly, here is Rothenberg with his league, 
backed by World Cup money . . . and all under the auspices of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation."

SPECIAL REPORT / SOCCER IN AMERICA; OH, BY THE WAY: WHERE WILL MLS GET THE 
PLAYERS?; PERSONNEL: TOP U.S. NATIONAL TEAM MEMBERS ARE ALREADY COMMITTED AND 
TRANSFER FEES WILL BE HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In considering who will play in the fledgling organization known as Major 
League Soccer, perhaps the simplest and quickest way of defining the situation 
is to answer the question with a question.  
</P>
<P>
 Who won't play?  
</P>
<P>
 For starters, we'll take a look at the World Cup roster of the U.S. national 
team and start crossing off players who have been under contract and might be 
returning to teams in Mexico and Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 They include goalkeepers Brad Friedel (England) and Juergen Sommer (England), 
defenders Thomas Dooley (Germany) and Cle Kooiman (Mexico), midfielders John 
Harkes (England) and Tab Ramos (Spain), forwards Eric Wynalda (Germany), Frank 
Klopas (Greece), Roy Wegerle (England) and Ernie Stewart (Netherlands). 
Midfielder Hugo Perez seems set to return to Saudi Arabia, where he played the 
1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other Americans who could have been on the World Cup team if not for 
injury or other rationales but are also under contract to European clubs -- 
goalkeeper Kasey Keller (England) and defender Brian Bliss (Germany), to name 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the Americans in the World Cup was double-edged. It promoted 
awareness and marketability of the top players, but, at the same time, teams 
from across the pond couldn't help but notice certain individuals.  
</P>
<P>
 Barely a week into the World Cup, then-national team General Manager Bill 
Nuttall said there was a great deal of interest in at least four Americans. 
Defender Alexi Lalas is negotiating with England's Coventry City, Italy's 
Padova and Germany's FC Bochum, although reports Saturday that a deal had been 
finalized were premature. 
</P>
<P>
 German clubs are said to be eyeing defender Marcelo Balboa and fleet 
forward-midfielder Cobi Jones. Injured midfielder Claudio Reyna appears on his 
way to Bayer Leverkusen. In addition, Joe-Max Moore has been loaned to 
Saarbruken of the German second division. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas and goalkeeper Tony Meola are the sort of charismatic, trend-setting 
players leagues like to build on. Meola might be available this spring. He 
signed with the New York Jets as a kicker.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our top concern is to have players who are capable of an approach to 
entertaining, attacking soccer," said Sunil Gulati of MLS, who was the chief 
international officer for World Cup '94. "Their first responsibility is selling 
the sport on the field. We do plan to work with the community, but their 
primary work has to be on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his probable departure, Lalas was impressed with the MLS. "They've 
looked at past leagues that have failed and why they failed and the leagues 
that have succeeded -- like the J-League in Japan," he said. "The organization 
and research has been tremendous. It pays for me to be optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Any conservative count of the U.S. team provides only two players -- Mike 
Burns and Fernando Clavijo -- not committed, or soon to be committed, to 
contracts elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Where are the rest of the players for the proposed 12-team league coming from? 
 
</P>
<P>
 Gulati said that three foreigners a team will be allowed, possibly four for 
the first season of play. That's 48 more players.  
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to build the league around U.S.-based players," Gulati said. That 
would be the opposite of the late North American Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's clear who won't be in MLS, who will?  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can give you an answer because they don't know. Because there are no 
players," says Al Mistri, soccer coach at Cal State Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 Mistri and others suggest the players might come from the post-college ranks. 
Of the 33 All-Americans each season, about 20 or so are seniors and eligible 
for the MLS player pool.  
</P>
<P>
 But there will be competition for those players, just as there is for every 
other player. The American Professional Soccer League has a large pool of 
players under contract. And even its officials are conservative on estimates of 
capable college players available.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are maybe 20 to 25 players who come out of the U.S. college system 
every year who can play top-level pro soccer immediately," said Alan Hinton, 
president and coach of the Seattle Sounders.  
</P>
<P>
 William De La Pena, APSL commissioner and owner of the Los Angeles Salsa, says 
that number is closer to 10.  
</P>
<P>
 For players, there are other concerns besides money. There has to be a high 
level of play.  
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing for me is that it's got to be competitive," Harkes 
said. "To give all that up to come back here, that's going to be a difficult 
decision. They've got to make it worth my while."  
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda, who recently signed with Bochum, said the new league could not afford 
him. And he's right. There's not only the issue of salaries but also of 
transfer fees, the money that must be paid to a player's club for the rights to 
his contract. And the MLS appears to have underestimated the cost of 
international stars. Its total budget for transfer fees is $20 million. Roberto 
Baggio's latest transfer fee was $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also have to realize they have to compete financially," Lalas said. "I'm 
not naive, the money has to be right. I'm as pure as anybody else, but you 
still have to make a living. And athletics are so different. The frame of time 
when you make your money is so short.  
</P>
<P>
 "But they have to realize they have to compete with player salaries and 
they're going to do that and they're going to have to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 The marketplace is crowded. So many teams, so many leagues, and so few quality 
American players to go around.

SPECIAL REPORT; SOCCER IN AMERICA

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Its roots firmly established in the scores of immigrant communities across the 
country and its rules nurtured in the well-groomed fields of Ivy League, soccer 
has built a substantial following in the United States. But this country's lack 
of success in international competition has relegated the sport to minor league 
status for decades. In the late 1960s, however, soccer gained a foothold. First 
came the professional leagues. Then the ranks of youth soccer began to grow. 
Soccer can now boast of being one of the most-played youth sports in the United 
States. World Cup organizers and U.S. soccer officials are gambling that by 
holding soccer's biggest tournament in America, interest in the professional 
game would prosper.

PADILLA DOESN'T LACK MOTIVATION IN FIRST TITLE DEFENSE AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zack Padilla of Azusa, who won the World Boxing Organization 
junior-welterweight title more than a year ago, defends the title for the first 
time in his home area today at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, headlining a 
CBS-televised card. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla (21-1-1, 13 knockouts) is scheduled to face former World Boxing 
Council featherweight champion Juan LaPorte (40-14, 22 knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
 "Being nervous motivates me, and I'm real nervous -- so I guess I'm 
motivated," Padilla said. "It's on CBS, plus it's the first time I'm defending 
my title here in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I've got my bones jumping right now. I'm more nervous now than when I 
fought for the title." 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his busy style, Padilla won the WBO championship, which is not 
considered a major title, by upsetting Carlos (Bolillo) Gonzalez last June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card is a scheduled 10-rounder between lightweight prospect Shane 
Mosley (12-0, 11 knockouts) and Narciso Valenzuela, who is 35-16-2, including 
recent losses to Oscar De La Hoya and Carlos Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela knocked down De La Hoya in the first round in their meeting last 
Oct. 30 before being knocked out later in the round. Valenzuela, who has lost 
his last four fights, lost a decision to Hernandez earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouts begin at noon. TIM KAWAKAMI

HILL BEATS TATE; MCCALLUM WINS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Virgil Hill retained his World Boxing Assn. light-heavyweight title Saturday 
night with a unanimous decision over Frank Tate, and Mike McCallum of Jamaica 
wrestled the World Boxing Council's light-heavyweight championship from 
Australian Jeff Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 30, successfully defended his title for the record 16th time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill (39-1) dominated Tate (34-4) with left and right jabs. Neither fighter 
went down, though Hill sent Tate reeling into the ropes in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum (47-2-1) won his first light-heavyweight belt with a unanimous 
decision. He has spent most of his career at the middleweight level. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding (23-2) took the fight to the challenger, who countered well with 
uppercuts and picked his way through Harding's churning arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, who had not fought in 19 months, had held the WBC title since Sept. 
1991.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; AS SPORT SINKS, A FIGHT OVER LIFEBOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Were the past few days the opening shots of the last Don King-Bob Arum war? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, the timing is devastatingly perfect. While the sport of boxing sags and 
wheezes toward box office irrelevance, its two most powerful, reviled and 
stubborn figures are reviving a feud that, by now, both know neither can win. 
</P>
<P>
 And, by now, does anybody care?  
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, is nothing new. Over the last two decades, Arum and King 
clawed at each other, and their competition raised boxing to unbelievable 
levels of profitability and prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with both in their seventh decades, King under federal indictment and 
Arum sounding weary of trying to squeeze profits, they hammer at one another as 
the sport decays. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent hostilities started when, after two years of speculation about a 
grand jury investigation, King was charged with fraud involving a $350,000 
insurance claim for a 1991 fight that was canceled. Arum, of course, celebrated 
the indictment, calling King "a cancer on the sport." 
</P>
<P>
 But, anticipating the indictment, King had a counter-attack waiting. Four days 
after the indictment, he shocked the boxing world by signing one of Arum's top 
fighters, Michael Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Arum had paid more attention to taking care of his fighters and less 
calling me a cancer, maybe this wouldn't have happened," King crowed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, King was arraigned in New York on the nine-count indictment and 
released on $250,000 bond. Then he flew to Bismarck, N.D., for a fight card 
tonight. King might be facing a five-year sentence on each of the five counts 
and there are rumblings that more indictments against him are being considered 
in the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum, of course, has his own problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal, a light-flyweight, was perhaps the fighter most closely identified 
with Top Rank, Inc., Arum's company, someone Arum could, without cynicism, 
refer to as "family." Carbajal fought for Arum only a week ago, winning the 
lightly regarded World Boxing Organization title. He never mentioned any 
problems to Arum, then signed with King three days later. 
</P>
<P>
 With No. 1 draw Julio Cesar Chavez in a career free fall and Mike Tyson still 
in jail, King needed Carbajal to shore up his Latino audience -- and to hurt 
Arum.  
</P>
<P>
 Danny Carbajal, Michael's brother and manager, said they felt "overlooked and 
taken for granted" at Top Rank as Arum catered to Roy Jones, Oscar De La Hoya 
and James Toney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I feel betrayed," Arum said the day of the defection. "Here's one 
fighter I didn't tie up with paper because I really didn't feel I had to. I 
could have tied him up for the rest of his life when I gave him $1 million in 
February." 
</P>
<P>
 Arum paid Carbajal a record $1 million for his rematch against Humberto 
(Chiquita) Gonzalez, which Carbajal lost. That being Michael's first 
professional defeat, the Carbajals then reconsidered their way of doing 
business, and, for the first time, listened hard to King. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum continues to threaten a lawsuit if Carbajal does not fulfill what Arum 
says was a spoken commitment to defend his WBO title Sept. 30 at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 After Carbajal's departure, however, some observers were describing Top Rank 
as a business in chaos. If someone as non-controversial and loyal as Carbajal 
could bolt, is anybody on the Top Rank roster a sure thing? 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it a blow? Yeah," Arum said. "But who gives a damn? The Carbajal fights 
were marginally profitable. We made money on them, yeah, but they were 
marginal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carbajal, if anything, has peaked. His last performance with Chiquita was 
nothing to write home about, and his performance on Friday was not great. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's peaked. He's been fighting since he's been a little boy. Other than the 
Chiquita fight, there's really nothing much for him in that division. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a real big blow on a financial basis." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other blips on the Top Rank radar: By necessity, Arum has 
dramatically scaled back expectations for the shows at the Grand Olympic 
Auditorium; another Top Rank fighter, Johnny Tapia, who spent several years in 
prison on drug charges, was arrested again for selling what turned out to be 
soap made to look like cocaine, and Jones, the International Boxing Federation 
middleweight champion, has been at odds with Top Rank and in contact with King 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum links most of it to the general decline in boxing interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't care about the sport, particularly younger people," Arum said. 
"They see it and are repelled by it. People aren't coming out for boxing. It's 
true at the Olympic, it's true at the Forum, it's true at other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're never going to do more than 3,000-4,000 people (at the Olympic), that I 
know. It's not a big living, but we can survive doing it if we're careful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the greatest of times or situations, but you make the best you can, 
hopefully something can happen that changes the perceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as King going to prison? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only King, it's what he's done to corrupt all those boxing 
organizations," Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said King: "(Arum), his mouth dripping with venom, hatred, doesn't realize 
that our destinies are intertwined. It's a situation where what affects one 
directly affects the other indirectly. He said I was a cancer. And he has 
gotten so close to me he has the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are inextricably bound together, me and Bob Arum. If we've both got 
cancer, at least I can deal with it more admirably and can generate more money 
because we know it's a lethal disease. So, with the time that is left, I will 
make Michael Carbajal a superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 Arum's response was equally tinged with frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a business man," Arum said. "I have a lot of things I want to do with my 
life. I'm not going to go after a million fighters that I can't use, where 
there's no real market for them. I realize I'm in a sport that's really 
suffering." Boxing Notes

 Julio Cesar Chavez, in town to promote his Sept. 17 rematch, four years later, 
against Meldrick Taylor at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, acknowledged that he is 
fortunate to have regained his World Boxing Council junior-welterweight title 
and said his recent spate of disappointing performances was the result of a 
voodoo curse. "I didn't believe in it before," he said through an interpreter. 
"But I do now." The source of the curse? "It's something very personal. I won't 
divulge. But a person very close to me." Chavez, who says he owes Frankie 
Randall a second rematch, also said Emanuel Steward will continue as his 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 What was that brouhaha about between heavyweight champion Michael Moorer's 
trainer, Teddy Atlas, and George Foreman on the podium during a news conference 
Thursday? Atlas says that Foreman muttered an obscenity at him when Atlas 
offered his hand moments before the incident and that he went over to Foreman 
to ask if he was joking. When Foreman told him to speak on the microphone so 
everybody could hear, Atlas pushed him, saying he wasn't a carnival jackass. 
Although it looked like campy play-acting, given the startled looks on the 
faces of everybody involved and Atlas' famous temper, it probably was somewhat 
genuine. "I think George is a con artist," Atlas said. "He's done a good job of 
it. I respect what he's done. But I don't know if I respect him as a person." 
Said Foreman: "Somebody better tell that boy that this is all fake."

 On Sept. 10 at Caesars Lake Tahoe, Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez is scheduled

Boxing Council light-flyweight titles since he defeated Michael Carbajal last

live. Calendar

GOLF ROUNDUP; SHEEHAN LEADS AFTER ALFREDSSON COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pain was almost too much for Helen Alfredsson. This was the worst kind of 
hurt, an ache of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel, actually," 
the native of Sweden said. "Hopefully, I can relax tonight and find out what 
happened and find some strength for tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson's unexpected and total collapse Saturday left Patty Sheehan with a 
one-stroke lead after the third round of the U.S. Women's Open at Lake Orion, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson, who shattered Open records for the first two rounds, lost eight 
strokes to par over the final 10 holes. She finished with a five-over-par 76 
and dropped to third place with a 208 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan, seeking her fifth major title and second Open championship in three 
years, curled in a 10-foot birdie putt on 18 for a two-under 69 and the lead at 
206 for three trips around the Old Course at Indianwood Golf and Country Club. 
Tammie Green was second, one shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm a little surprised at this point," said Sheehan, who broke 
Alfredsson's year-old 54-hole Open record. "But I should know better than 
anyone that anything can happen in an Open. There are 18 holes left and there 
is a lot of golf left to play." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tom Wargo wasn't the most-watched American in the British Senior Open this 
week, but he probably should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Wargo, who won the Doug Sanders Celebrity Classic at the end of March, shot a 
one-under 71 and defeated defending champion Bob Charles and Doug Dalziel by 
two shots at Lytham, England.  
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer, whose opening-round of 69 gave him a share of the lead, had a 
two-over 74 Saturday and wound up tied for sixth at even-par 288 after four 
trips over the 6,673-yard Royal Lytham and St. Anne's course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rain halted the third round of the New England Classic at Sutton, Mass., but 
there was little change among the leaders as Ed Fiori kept his one-stroke edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 players still on the course were scheduled to finish their rounds this 
morning before the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiori started and ended the day at 10 under with a lead of one stroke over 
Kenny Perry and David Feherty and two over Guy Boros, Fred Funk and Fran Quinn. 
Fiori and Perry finished 12 holes, Boros and Funk made it through 13 and 
Feherty completed 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crowd favorite Jim Colbert took advantage of perfect weather to shoot a 
seven-under 63 and took a two-stroke lead after 36 holes of the 54-hole 
Southwestern Bell Seniors Classic at Belton, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert's 63 gave him a nine-under 131 total, but it was crowded at the top of 
the leaderboard after sunny, windless conditions led to some of the lowest 
scores in the tournament's five-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Isao Aoki shot a 64 and was tied with Larry Gilbert and first-round leader 
Graham Marsh at 133. Marsh came in with a 67 and Gilbert had a 66.

SWIMMING; SUDDENLY, QUANCE ISN'T ONE OF THE KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Age is creeping up on swimmer Kristine Quance. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, she was the youngest swimmer when the Janet Evans Invitational 
was called the L.A. Invitational. Saturday, Quance, 19, was the oldest 
competitor in the finals of the women's 200-meter breaststroke in the meet at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel 19," Quance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quance, who is ranked third in the world, finished second to 13-year old Junko 
Isoda of Japan. Isoda, who swam 2:32.52, overcame Quance (2:32.78) during the 
last 15 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really was nervous out there," said Quance, who swam her first race since 
injuring her left shoulder. "I haven't raced in a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Quance, a USC freshman who won three NCAA individual titles, will be tested 
today when she is expected to meet high school phenom Allison Wagner of 
Gainesville, Fla., in the 200 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, who turned 17 Thursday, won the 400 individual medley in a meet-record 
4:47.76, bettering her mark of 4:49.31. Jennifer Parmenter, 13, of Canyons 
finished second at 4:55.94. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Van Dyken of ACES Aquatics set a meet record of 25.87 to win the 50 
freestyle. In the preliminaries, Van Dyken swam 26.09 to eclipse the meet 
record of 26.24 set by former USC star Lisa Dorman in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Evans' string of victories ended at two after she finished second to 
Ashley Tappin of Florida Aquatics in the 200 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Tappin, a 1992 Olympic team member, swam 2:02.70 to beat the four-time Olympic 
gold medalist, who was timed in 2:03.52. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the speed to take it out with the sprinters," said Evans, who 
won the 800 freestyle on Thursday and the 400 freestyle Friday. "The race is 
not long enough for me to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who holds three world records and six American records, will compete in 
the 100 backstroke today. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Hudepohl of Stanford Aquatics, a 1992 U.S. Olympic team member, withdrew 
from the 200 freestyle final because of a chest virus. Malcolm Allen of 
Australia won the event in 1:53.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Carvin of Hillenbrand Aquatics swam 4:30.71 to win the 400 individual 
medley.

40,000 KINGDOME TILES TO COME DOWN; STADIUM: THE FACILITY WILL BE CLOSED 
INDEFINITELY. THE COST IS UNKNOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All 40,000 of the Kingdome's precarious ceiling tiles will be pulled down, and 
the Kingdome will be closed indefinitely, county officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not known how long the job will take, what the tiles will be replaced 
with, or how much it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will bust our butts to get the Kingdome open," King County Executive Gary 
Locke said after a news conference Saturday. "But our primary obligation is to 
ensure the safety of the team and the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 More should be known by Monday, said Locke's spokesman, Frank Abe. 
</P>
<P>
 Four tiles fell from the Kingdome ceiling into the stands Tuesday afternoon, 
forcing the Mariners to postpone two scheduled games with Baltimore and move a 
scheduled Boston-Seattle home stand to Fenway Park in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only solution that will assure patrons that absolutely no tiles 
will fall on them," said Jim Napolitano, projects manager for the King County 
Department of Construction and Facilities Management. "This is the only 
absolutely safe method." 
</P>
<P>
 Crews began stripping the aging, water-damaged tiles off early Saturday 
morning and had removed about one-third of one of the Kingdome's 40 roof 
sections by mid-afternoon, exposing the bare, gray concrete underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingdome could be reopened as soon as the 26-pound tiles are removed, 
Napolitano said. The tiles serve no structural purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concrete is ugly, if nothing else," he said. The county is considering 
covering the concrete with cloth, a sprayed-on material, among other options, 
for insulation and acoustics, Napolitano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke said he will ask the Metropolitan King County Council on Monday to 
approve an emergency ordinance allowing the county to waive normal bid 
requirements to make the needed repairs and "address potential safety 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor will have three crews working around the clock and at least two 
more cranes will be added Monday to the one currently erected inside the 
Kingdome, Abe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be too bad, they're coming out fairly fast," Napolitano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year-old tiles were bound to fall sooner or later, said Robert 
LaFraugh, the Seattle branch manager of Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, the 
forensics engineering company investigating the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "These 40,000 tiles represent 40,000 potential sources of failure," he said. 
"This is a systemic problem, not a localized problem."

NAMES AND NUMBERS

 * HEARING FOOTSTEPS? San Francisco shortstop Royce Clayton thinks the Dodgers 
have to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't notice now, they'll notice sooner or later, when we're right up 
on them," Clayton said of the race in the National League West. "Having been 
through this last year (when the Giants tried to hold off the Atlanta Braves), 
it's not a good seat over there. It's an eye-opener and a real reality check. 
It shows you how fast the game can change. It's nice to be on the other end and 
be the chaser. It's definitely more stressful the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 * HOUGH AND PUFF: Charlie Hough, 46, has an 0-5 record since June 14 and a 
degenerative hip condition that will probably require replacement surgery when 
he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Marlins hate the idea of releasing the popular Hough, the majors' 
oldest player, but it's a distinct possibility, with Ryan Bowen and Chris 
Hammond about to leave the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hough himself put it, "Basically, I'm rotting." 
</P>
<P>
 * ANOTHER ZONE: Jose Canseco, with a .242 average and 42 strikeouts in his 
last 132 at-bats through Thursday, is convinced that American League umpires 
are out to get him and is putting together a tape of what he considers unfair 
strike calls. He intends to send it to the league office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating not being able to do what you know you can do with your 
talent," the Texas Rangers' designated hitter said. "It's frustrating, because 
you don't know where your strike zone is. My whole frustration is with the 
strike zone. Everything comes from that." 
</P>
<P>
 * NEW DIMENSIONS: A recent column by John Steadman of the Baltimore Evening 
Sun has been a topic of conversation among Oriole pitchers, who were not 
surprised at Steadman's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Steadman, collaborating with Charles Steinberg, the Orioles' public relations 
director and team dentist, measured the fences at Camden Yards and found the 
dimensions to right-center and left-center field, plus straightaway center, to 
be shorter by as much as 10 feet than the posted distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mussina had fun with the discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't move the fences back, I'm leaving when I'm up for free agency 
and I'm taking him with me," he said, pointing to Ben McDonald. "I'm going to 
go out there with a camcorder and a tape measure and measure them myself. They 
should trade me and Ben for three more hitters who normally hit five home runs 
and who'll hit 20 here." 
</P>
<P>
 * NO STRANGERS: Bobby Brown is retiring as American League president next 
Sunday, but he gets to entertain Albert Belle one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle gets his appeal of a 10-game suspension on Friday for using a corked 
bat. He's the last guy Brown wants to see, considering he's had to discipline 
him in each of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle drew a six-game suspension in 1991 for throwing a baseball at a fan, a 
three-gamer in 1992 for charging the mound after Kansas City's Neal Heaton 
threw consecutive pitches behind Belle, and a three-gamer last year for 
charging the mound after KC's Hipolito Pichardo hit him with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Corked bats? Big deal, said Detroit coach Billy Consolo, who hit nine homers 
in his 10-year big league career. "I corked my bat for seven years, but no one 
ever seemed interested in checking it."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BLAUSER'S HUSTLE HELPS BRAVES BEAT CARDINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The game was tied by a home run in the ninth inning and another homer produced 
the game's final runs, but a ball hit by Jeff Blauser into the hole at 
shortstop in the 12th inning overshadowed the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't sure he could beat the throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you hit the ball to that side of the infield, you have to figure 
Ozzie (Smith) has a chance to make the play," said Blauser, whose run-scoring 
single helped Atlanta win, 8-5, at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the fastest guy in the world, but I was giving it everything I had on 
that play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The infield single gave the Braves a 6-5 lead and kept the inning going. David 
Justice followed with his 15th home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Blauser, who began the game hitless in his previous 15 at-bats, had three 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a couple of breaks," said Blauser, who also scored three runs and 
drove in two. "That's all right. We could use a few breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves had lost five of their last six games and dropped 1 1/2 games 
behind the Montreal Expos in the East Division. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis tied the score in the ninth inning when Luis Alicea hit a rare home 
run against Greg McMichael. The Braves' reliever had not given up a homer in 51 
innings this season, and only one home run in his last 128 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 4, New York 2 -- Matt Williams hit his 36th homer and Barry 
Bonds his 31st at New York in a game delayed for more than four hours because 
of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams hit a two-run shot in the first inning. Bonds led off the ninth with 
his homer for the Giants, who improved to 11-2 since Darryl Strawberry joined 
them July 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds and Williams, batting ahead of Strawberry, have combined for 13 homers 
and 25 runs batted in in the 10 games Strawberry has started. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 5, Florida 4 -- Andres Galarraga drove in four runs with two home 
runs and Charlie Hayes also homered for the Rockies before 70,280 at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga's 29th and 30th homers helped snap Colorado's four-game losing 
streak. Marvin Freeman (9-2) limited the Marlins to two runs and eight hits in 
6 2/3 innings. Freeman didn't have a strike out and didn't walk a batter, but 
got 15 groundball outs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ruffin gave up Kurt Abbott's two-run homer with two outs in the ninth. 
He struck out pinch-hitter Robb Natal for his 15th save  
</P>
<P>
 Houston 11, Pittsburgh 0 -- Jeff Bagwell hit his 30th home run and Shane 
Reynolds (8-4) struck out 11 in his first major-league shutout to lead the 
Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell, who had four hits, drove in four runs, giving him a 94, tops in the 
majors. He became only the third player in franchise history to hit 30 home 
runs in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 3, Chicago 1 -- Jacob Brumfield singled home the go-ahead run in 
the 13th inning for the Reds at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Foster took a three-hitter and a 1-0 lead into the ninth, but the Reds 
scored on consecutive doubles by Brumfield and Barry Larkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Taubensee singled against Chuck Crim (4-4) to start the 13th, advanced on 
Thomas Howard's sacrifice and scored on Brumfield's single. 
</P>
<P>
 After a walk, Brumfield stole third and scored on Jerome Walton's single. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 7, Philadelphia 1 -- Bill Krueger pitched 6 2/3 strong innings at 
Philadelphia and beat the Phillies for the second time since being recalled 
from triple-A Las Vegas on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Bell homered, doubled and singled for the Padres and Brad Ausmus also 
homered. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn had two hits in five at-bats and is batting .393, best in the 
majors.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; SERIES AWAITED BY STRAWBERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry says he is looking forward to playing against the Dodgers on 
Monday, when a three-game series begins against the San Francisco Giants at 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my hometown team and playing the Dodgers has got to be special because 
of all the comments and criticism," Strawberry said. "To be honest, that's one 
of the biggest reasons why I came to the Giants, because of that situation. 
Looking at how far apart we were behind, it's nothing personal, but I just 
wanted to be in that same division and will take it from there when the time 
comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry said he is not seeking revenge; he simply believes the Giants are 
better. "I don't like to lose," he said. "If you have a better team, I believe 
you should win. I believe we have a better team and believe we should win." 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been made of Strawberry facing the Dodgers, especially because of 
comments Manager Tom Lasorda made about Strawberry's drug addiction being a 
weakness and not a disease. Strawberry says he has no animosity toward Lasorda 
or anyone on the team, saying his former teammates are all friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think playing at (Candlestick) will be emotional, but playing those 
last three games there (in Los Angeles) will be," Strawberry said, referring to 
the season-ending series at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio's command of English is limited, so pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski makes it a point to bring in an interpreter, usually Carlos 
Hernandez, during pregame meetings when they go over the hitters or talk about 
Astacio's pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "But during the game, it's difficult to make adjustments out there," 
Perranoski said. "Last night I brought in (Rafael) Bournigal to interpret." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting on the mound that came four Expo batters into Friday's game, 
though, needed little interpretation. Astacio's pitching was the opposite of 
what Perranoski had told Astacio to do. Others who approached the mound for 
that meeting said Perranoski was not very happy, but Perranoski wouldn't 
confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Astacio just had bad location and when he gets the ball up early in the game, 
he's in trouble," Perranoski said. "Any time he has trouble, it's early in the 
game. He'll be fine."

 Orel Hershiser will throw off the mound today, which will determine if he will 
be able to pitch Tuesday or be put on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been throwing daily (since he suffered a strain to his left side) and 
with real good effort, but a lot of things can change when you throw off an 
incline," said Pat Screnar, Dodger physical therapist. MARYANN HUDSON

 Angel left fielder Bo Jackson, who was booed in the eighth inning Friday night 
after misplaying two balls, says he and his teammates are disgusted by the 
fans' behavior at Anaheim Stadium this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like this in my life," said Jackson, perhaps the 
fans' most popular player."It's no wonder why we play like . . . . here. Guys 
can't wait to get on the road with the kind of fans we've got here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating to the point where we're losing, and then we've got to take 
on not only the opposite team, the umpires, but even our own fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might as well be playing on the road 162 games a year with the way we're 
treated." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are 20-31 at home, the third-worst in baseball. They are 22-26 on 
the road, better than 13 major league teams.

 Yankee starter Jim Abbott, who was grieving over his dog that was killed 
Thursday when it ran on the street in front of his Connecticut home, was 
greeted Saturday with a surprise present. Pitching coach Billy Connors brought 
him a springer spaniel puppy, fresh with a red ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe he did that for me," Abbott said. "That's something 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott, whom the Angels will strongly pursue as a free agent in the 
off-season, starts today against the Angels, facing his best friend, Mark 
Langston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like every time I pitch against the Angels I get Mark or Chuck 
(Finley)," Abbott said, "they're not making it too easy on me. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; DYKSTRA, HOLLINS BACK -- FOR A 
WHILE 
</P>

<P>
 The Philadelphia Phillies activated Lenny Dykstra and Dave Hollins from the 
disabled list and optioned pitchers Andy Carter and Paul Quantrill to triple-A 
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra and Hollins were in the lineup for Saturday night's game against the 
San Diego Padres, Dykstra in center field and Hollins in right. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollins, normally a third baseman, left the game in the seventh inning 
complaining of pain in his left hand. He will have X-rays today to confirm 
whether he had fractured the hamate bone in his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season Hollins broke another bone in the same hand, but last year 
broke the hamate bone in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hand was getting a little tired as the game went on," Hollins said. "In my 
third at-bat I felt something like a break in my hand. It's just a nightmarish 
season for me." 
</P>

<P>
 The Minnesota Twins activated right-hander Pat Mahomes and designated hitter 
Dave Winfield from the disabled list. . . . Reliever Gene Harris, who had been 
pitching for the Tigers' triple-A affiliate in Toledo on a rehabilitation 
assignment, was activated from the disabled list. The Tigers placed pitcher 
Greg Gohr on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to July 20.

DAVIS, MATTINGLY PRODUCE BIG NUMBERS; MILESTONES: ANGELS' DH COLLECTS 1,000TH 
CAREER RBI AND YANKEES' FIRST BASEMAN CONNECTS FOR 2,000TH CAREER HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There were two milestones reached by two elegant players Saturday night at 
Anaheim Stadium, each one remarkable, each one almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis recorded his 1,000th run batted in when he homered in the eighth 
inning, a feat that enlivened another dreary night for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mattingly singled to center field in the seventh inning for his 2,000th 
career hit. There figure to be many more hits for Mattingly, and many more 
victories for the first-place New York Yankees, who terrorized Angel pitching 
for the third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and Mattingly each received standing ovations from the Anaheim Stadium 
crowd of 29,354. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis had rounded the bases and was in the dugout when the announcement was 
made to the crowd. And with his team down, 7-2, there didn't seem much reason 
to celebrate, so, he stayed on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mattingly's single reached safe haven in center field, many in the crowd 
jumped to their feet to cheer. The crescendo grew. The ball was thrown in and 
secured by a Yankee bat boy. Finally, Mattingly tipped his helmet to the crowd. 
The noise continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis became the 177th major league player, joining Mattingly among others, to 
have 1,000 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any kind of achievement like that just means you've stayed around and been 
productive," said Davis, whose first RBI came on a solo homer off Mario Soto in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly is the 197th player to record 2,000 hits and the sixth Yankee, 
joining Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio and 
Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, 2,000 hits is not a place to stop for me," Mattingly said. "Being 
thrown into that category is pretty special." 
</P>
<P>
 But then he said he wasn't sure he'd reach the 3,000-hit plateau. The grind of 
staying healthy and productive is getting tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, I don't think I'll make it," he said. "I don't think I'll play that 
long. I have had to do more and more work just to stay competitive. I'm still 
playing major league baseball, still having a good time. But in reference to 
3,000 hits, I don't think I'll make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis wasn't sure he'd reach the 1,000-RBI mark this season. After all, he 
began the year needing 70, a pretty fair total for one season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis, 34, has put together one of the finest years of his career. The 
Angels keep losing, but he keeps hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's homer off Yankee reliever Joe Ausanio was his 21st this season. 
Davis hit 27 homers with 112 RBIs in 153 games in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good night to reach that milestone," Davis said. "A guy I respect, a 
great guy.. . . It was nice to get mine on the same night (Mattingly) got his." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly said he was pleased he reached his milestone with Rod Carew, Angel 
hitting coach, in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great to look over in the other dugout and see Rod Carew," Mattingly 
said. "I wanted to be just like Carew when I was a kid. I used to imitate him 
and his stance when I was in high school. I wanted to slap the ball to right 
field just like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Mattingly was asked what meant more, 1,000 RBIs or 2,000 hits. He 
couldn't pick one or the other, more amazed that others thought so much of each 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very good feeling," he said. "One of those round numbers people like 
to talk about."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; HOMERING INDIANS CLOSE IN ON WHITE SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Albert Belle was shut out Saturday. After four consecutive days of hitting a 
home run, he was kept in the park by Chicago pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, however, drive in four runs in the Indians' 11-2 victory in Cleveland 
in which Paul Sorrento homered for the fifth time in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been that way lately for the Indians, who had scored 25 runs in the 
first three games of this four-game series with Chicago -- two of which the 
Indians have won -- and have moved within one game of the White Sox in the AL 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just having fun playing," Indian hitting coach Charlie Manuel said. 
"Every time somebody hits the ball hard, somebody else wants to duplicate it or 
do it better. At the bottom of our lineup, we've got power that most lineups 
don't have. I don't think they've touched the surface of their ability yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight Cleveland hitters have already reached double figures in home runs. As a 
team, the Indians are three away from matching last year's total of 141 homers. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle has remained in Cleveland's lineup while he appeals his 10-day 
suspension for using a corked bat in Chicago last weekend. The appeal will be 
heard Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a two-run single, a run-scoring single and drove in another run when he 
was hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Grimsley (2-1) came within one out of pitching his first shutout, 
leaving after giving up run-scoring singles to Joey Cora and Norberto Martin in 
the ninth inning. Grimsley walked Chicago's Frank Thomas four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 6-3, Seattle 5-6 -- Ken Griffey Jr. led off the 11th inning with his 
36th homer and the Mariners won at Boston for a split of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox won the opener when Joe Hesketh gave Boston a rare victory by a 
starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-game series was moved from Seattle to Fenway Park after ceiling 
panels fell at the Kingdome earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey, tied with Matt Williams for the major-league homer lead, connected 
against Jose Melendez (0-1) for an opposite-field drive into the screen in left 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners added two more runs in the 11th on an RBI single by Reggie 
Jefferson and a squeeze bunt by Chris Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opener, the victory by Hesketh (6-5) was only the 11th by a Boston 
starter in the last 51 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Milwaukee 1 -- Pedro Munoz homered and had an RBI single and Dave 
Stevens pitched one-hit ball over 5 1/3 innings of relief as the Twins won at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens (3-2) started the fourth inning in relief of Pat Mahomes and finished 
with three strikeouts and two walks. Mark Guthrie got the final two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to throw it over the plate and let them hit it," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz hit his ninth home run leading off the eighth inning against reliever 
Mike Ignasiak. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Detroit 1 -- David Cone pitched two-hit ball over eight innings 
and struck out a season-high 12 as the Royals won at Detroit to end a 
three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone (14-4), who won his fourth consecutive decision, gave up a leadoff single 
to Tony Phillips and walked Lou Whitaker, then retired 16 in a row before 
Phillips drew a one-out walk in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips moved to third on a single by Whitaker and scored Detroit's only run 
when Travis Fryman grounded into a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 9, Texas 1 -- Randy Knorr homered twice and drove in four runs in a 
victory at Toronto, the Blue Jays' seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Knorr had a two-run single during a six-run first inning. He added two solo 
home runs in his first multi-homer game in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 6, Baltimore 3 -- Todd Van Poppel pitched seven strong innings and 
Ruben Sierra and Scott Brosius homered, leading the Athletics to a victory at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Poppel (6-9) gave up one run and three hits for his first victory since 
beating the Orioles in Baltimore on July 7.

FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; GANDY SIGNS, SLEEPS ON IT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie tackle Wayne Gandy signed a five-year deal for $5.15 million Saturday 
morning, and then begged off afternoon practice to rest at a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams advised Gandy, who is their No. 1 draft pick and projected to start 
at left tackle, that it was important for him not to skip any workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gandy, on the advice of his agent, Neil Schwartz, decided Friday night 
that he would sign Saturday and catch up on his sleep after making a late-night 
flight here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, while happy to have Gandy under contract, were not pleased with his 
immediate decision to nap. Instead of appearing at UC Irvine for a news 
conference, the team told Gandy to stay away from training camp and talk with 
the media by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's human," said Schwartz, who attended the afternoon practice. "You don't 
know how draining the past two days have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy will receive a $2 million signing bonus and yearly salaries of $420,000, 
$525,000, $630,000, $735,000 and $840,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to give a little," Gandy said before retiring. "More than we expected, 
but the money is right and we think we came out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy missed the opening of camp because he had demanded a four-year deal, 
while the Rams insisted on five years. The Rams declined to say who came out on 
top, but Gandy signed for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad to get him," Coach Chuck Knox said. "I was told he had some 
things to take care of and he will be here (this morning)." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy will be assigned to the opposition's best pass rusher each week if he 
lives up to expectations, and will open against Arizona's Clyde Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody starts out as a rookie and it's time for me to grow up," Gandy 
said. "I just might have to grow up a little earlier than other rookies." T.J.

YANKEE EXECUTIVE ACCUSED OF RACIST REMARKS RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York Yankee executive Richard Kraft, under fire for the past week after 
allegedly referring to black youths as "monkeys" in a magazine interview, 
announced his resignation Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my personal decision," Kraft said in a statement issued by the 
Yankees."It's the right thing to do for my health and for the Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft has denied making the statements quoted in the article in New York 
magazine. Stress over the controversy aggravated Kraft's heart condition, which 
was a factor in his decision, the Yankees said. 
</P>
<P>
 He stepped down from his job as vice president for community relations only 
hours after dozens of protesters from the National Rainbow Coalition marched 
outside Yankee Stadium carrying signs that read, "We're Not Monkeys, We're 
People." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Al Sharpton, who led the protest, said the resignation was a direct 
result of the pressure brought by minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Mr. Kraft's health went bad in the last few minutes," Sharpton 
said. "I think the Yankees' health went bad when they saw scores of people 
marching in the rain who would keep coming back."

FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; QUARTERBACKS ARE DOMINANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider quarterbacks dominated a five-drive controlled scrimmage at Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Working against the second-team defense, starter Jeff Hostetler completed 
seven of nine passes for 94 yards, including an 18-yard touchdown pass to 
reserve tight end Kevin Smith. In his only drive, Hostetler completed three 
passes for 22 yards to wide receiver Tim Brown and two passes for 29 yards to 
tight end Andrew Glover. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Vince Evans completed seven of eight passes for 63 yards and led the 
second-unit offense to a 47-yard field goal by Jeff Jaeger in two drives 
against the first-team defense. Rocket Ismail caught three passes from Evans 
for 20 yards. Daryl Hobbs and Tom Rathman each caught two passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-teamer Billy Joe Hobert had two incompletions in his first three 
attempts but showed his mobility with a 36-yard scramble. He then finished with 
three consecutive completions, including a 36-yarder to John Morton and a 
six-yard touchdown to Joe Kralik. 
</P>
<P>
 While the passing game completed 18 of 23 passes for 213 yards and two 
touchdowns, the running game struggled in a scrimmage format that signaled a 
ballcarrier tackled once he was touched by a defender. Running backs Tyrone 
Montgomery, Harvey Williams and Calvin Jones combined for 14 yards in nine 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, the (scrimmage) was pretty good," Coach Art Shell said. 
"The key thing is for each individual to grow and become better. Then, as we 
get close to the season, for us to come together as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Raiders had several players stand out, including rookie 
linebacker James Folston, drafted out of Northeast Louisiana in the second 
round, who had one sack against the first-team offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will not practice today and will leave for Barcelona on Monday 
morning to prepare for an exhibition against the Denver Broncos July 31. LONNIE

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG; IF THIS SHOE FIT THEY COULDN'T WEAR IT 
</P>

By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When reporters returned to the media center from the Goodwill Games opening 
ceremony Saturday night, the giant inflatable sneaker that had been hanging 
from the ceiling was history. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I forgot to pack one of those sliding devices that shoe salesmen use 
to measure feet, it is difficult to report with any degree of accuracy the size 
of the sneaker. But it was bigger than Bob Lanier's. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd guess about a 72E. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how much amusement it brought to the media, the sneaker had to 
go. The problem was that it bore the symbol of a famous West Coast shoe 
company, while the Goodwill Games are sponsored by a famous East Coast shoe 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 I won't mention any brand names unless they pay me. Suffice it to say that 
when the sneaker was deflated, it made a swooshing sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound from the Russian organizers was more of a groan as they realized 
they had failed their first test in Sports Marketing 101. Even though they are 
new to capitalism, they had hoped to use the Goodwill Games to prove that they 
can be players in the billion dollar business of sports. That translates to 
about a jillion rubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the man who was commissioned to create the mother of all sneakers 
asked what brand, they forgot that they were sponsored by a shoe company -- the 
same one that sponsors Russia's Olympians -- and told him to wing it. 
</P>
<P>
 A basketball fan, he decided that he wanted his shoe to be like Mike's. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, which has pretty much mastered this game, a promoter 
would not have waited to be asked what kind of shoe. It's as instinctive as 
bending over to pick up found money. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Russians have been ordered to the back of the class, where they will go 
as soon as they evict the merchants from the media center store who are selling 
a U.S. film that is a major rival to the Japanese one that is sponsoring the 
Games. RANDY HARVEY

PREP FOOTBALL / SHRINE ALL-STAR GAME; OFFENSES STRUGGLE IN 7-7 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The top high school graduated senior football players in the state showed 
every sign of a seven-month layoff Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in the 43rd Shrine North-South all-star game at Citrus College, the 
teams struggled to a 7-7 tie before 7,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, which matches players from Northern California against those from 
Southern California, was the first for many since December. Despite one week of 
practice, most of the players seemed a step out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
 The offenses struggled, in particular, with the teams combining for 334 yards 
and mounting only one sustained drive each. Even with lineups that featured 
some of the most productive running backs and quarterbacks in the state last 
season, neither side could effectively move the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The South, which leads the series, 21-16-6, had several chances to break the 
tie late in the fourth quarter. Its last hope came with 30 seconds remaining 
when Pene Talamaivao of Pomona Ganesha recovered a fumble by quarterback Brad 
Martin of Fresno Clovis West at the North 28-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 With All-American kicker Adam Abrams of La Jolla Bishop's on the sideline, 
South Coach Tom Hoak of Rialto Eisenhower knew his team still had a good shot 
to pull out the victory. Two plays later, however, quarterback Steve Campbell 
of Norco had a pass batted down, but the officials ruled it a fumble and Vince 
Amey of Logan recovered it to end the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, voted the South's most valuable player, was 28-0 the last two 
seasons, and the tie left him frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a bad call and I don't understand it," said Campbell, who completed 
five of 13 passes for 74 yards. "The guy clearly batted it down, yet they ruled 
it a fumble. It was my understanding the refs were supposed to let us play in 
this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Why Hoak was going for a pass play with 15 seconds remaining is uncertain, but 
Abrams said he was ready to run out on the field when the possession suddenly 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just trying to get the ball a little closer to the goal post, and in 
a tight game like this I was hoping I could make the difference," said Abrams, 
who made 14 of 18 field goals last season. "I am a little disappointed I didn't 
have more of a chance tonight."

BLADES DENT BULLFROGS' SUPREMACY; ROLLER HOCKEY: L.A. WINS, 7-4, IN FRONT OF 
13,101 AT THE POND TO MOVE INTO FIRST-PLACE TIE WITH ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With his famous father watching from the stands, Coach Bobby Hull Jr. led his 
Los Angeles Blades to a 7-4 victory over the Bullfrogs before an announced 
crowd of 13,101 at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Charron scored four goals in the first seven minutes of the third 
quarter and goalie Max Mikhailovsky had a franchise-record 50 saves to lead the 
Blades (11-3) into a first-place tie with the Bullfrogs (11-4) in the Pacific 
Division of Roller Hockey International. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has reached a new level," Hull said. "Early in the season, we 
didn't know what it took to win in this league. Now we know how to compete with 
the best, and now we know who the real best team in the league is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades, who won their seventh consecutive game, trailed, 1-0, at halftime, 
but Mikhailovsky kept it close. The Bullfrogs managed only a goal by Rick 
Judson despite outshooting the Blades, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played a great first half, we just didn't bury the puck in the 
net," Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier said. "Max stood on his head." 
</P>
<P>
 With Mikhailovsky keeping pucks out of the net, Charron was shoving them into 
the Bullfrogs' goal. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he scored an unassisted goal 37 seconds into the third quarter. Then 
after Bullfrog forward Kevin Kerr received a two-minute and game-misconduct 
penalty for holding an opponent's stick, Charron scored on the ensuing penalty 
shot to give the Blades a 2-1 lead with 11 minutes 3 seconds remaining in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Charron beat Bullfrogs goalie Chris Gordon for two more goals in the quarter 
to push the lead to 4-1. Charron has eight goals in his last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs tried to rally. Goals by Brad McCaughey and Savo Mitrovic cut 
the lead to 4-3 early in the fourth quarter, but the Blades' Nick Vachon helped 
blunt the comeback attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitrovic scored twice in the fourth quarter, but both times Vachon answered 
with a goal for the Blades. Tony Gruba scored with 3:32 remaining for the final 
margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This win was huge for us," Charron said. "It couldn't be bigger. They've had 
a psychological edge on us in the past, but tonight we broke that."

SHRINE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME; ROMERO PROVES THAT HE'S GOOD CATCH FOR ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Romero has been waiting quietly and patiently to prove he deserved to be 
among the best California high school football players. 
</P>
<P>
 People whispered that the 5-foot-11, 175-pound wide receiver from L.A. Baptist 
High did not belong. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero proved them wrong at the Shrine all-star game, leading the South with 
two catches for 30 yards in a 7-7 tie with the North on Saturday night in front 
of 7,600 fans at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 When Romero reported to practice for the Daily News all-star game in June, 
other players in the game said flatly that they thought he did not deserved to 
be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really weighed on my mind in the Daily News game," he said. "I thought it 
was better to just ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero wound up catching the game-winning touchdown in that game, and wanted 
to show that he could do the same against the state's best as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put a lot of pressure on myself so I could prove I was able to play with 
the big boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players weren't real vocal about it (at the Shrine game), but they were 
at the Daily News game. Hopefully I proved that I can do big things at the 
big-school level." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, his performance was hardly spectacular, but Romero did show he 
was athletic enough to compete at a high level. 
</P>
<P>
 One play saw the Arizona-bound receiver catch up to a badly underthrown ball 
on a reverse pass by Glenn Thompkins, only to have a defender strip him of the 
catch when he came down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came close," he said. "Glenn kind of underthrew it. That was where my track 
(experience) came in, and I was able to jump for it.' 
</P>
<P>
 The South could manage to complete only eight of 25 attempts for 107 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught a couple of passes, and that was really satisfying," he said. "I 
thought they took me out a couple of times when I thought I should have been in 
there, but that's just the game of football. I had a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming freshmen are expected at Arizona's preseason camp by Aug. 7, and 
Romero is eager to prove himself again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arizona lost two receivers (to graduation), and we're going to have three new 
guys competing coming in," he said. "There's going to be five guys competing 
for two positions and I am looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero caught 87 passes for 1,568 yards and 15 touchdowns at L.A. Baptist. He 
was named small schools player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports magazine.

SHRINE ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME; FITTINGLY, THE GAME ENDS IN A TIE, 7-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Missed opportunities in the final quarter plagued both teams and the 43rd 
North-South Shrine all-star football game ended in a 7-7 tie in front of 7,600 
Saturday at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 7-7, each team fumbled in its opponent's territory, but 
neither turnover was converted and the game ended in a tie for only the sixth 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked to win this one," said South tight end John McLaughlin 
(Hart), who is headed for Notre Dame. "We came out here and totally 
underestimated them. Even in the pregame -- we came out all hyped up. We 
thought we were gonna blow them out of the water." McLaughlin, who went both 
ways, had three tackles and 1 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team looked all that spiffy, so a tie seemed only fitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The North had a chance to take a lead midway through the fourth quarter after 
Marlon Farlow of Eisenhower fumbled at the South 37. 
</P>
<P>
 But, after two incomplete passes by Brian Vye of Leland and a five-yard run by 
Ali Evans (15 carries, 57 yards) of Vallejo, the North tried a 50-yard field 
goal by Jeremy Wilgus. His attempt fell about five yards short. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with just 23 seconds remaining in the game, the North returned the favor 
when quarterback Brad Martin fumbled at the North 28 and Pene Talamaivao fell 
on it to give the South one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But on third and nine with five seconds remaining, quarterback Steve 
Campbell's forward pass was ruled a fumble and the North took over at its 32. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I didn't think I had that great a game," said Campbell, who 
finished five of 13 for 74 yards and took home the South's most valuable player 
award. "(But), that's a game-breaking play right there. That just killed the 
game for us and I didn't agree (with the call), obviously." 
</P>
<P>
 The North took advantage of a shanked 14-yard punt by Adam Abrams of The 
Bishop's School to score the game's opening points.  
</P>
<P>
 The North set up shop at the South 33 on its second possession and capped a 
nine-play drive on Mario Washington's four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The South evened the score early in the third quarter on a 13-yard halfback 
flare pass from Campbell to Buena's George Keiaho, who is bound for Washington. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Keiaho caught the ball near the right sideline and scampered another 11 yards 
for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams had trouble sustaining drives throughout and neither team rolled up 
more than 150 offensive yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The South had just 68 offensive yards at halftime and nearly one-third of 
those yards came on a 22-yard run by Sylmar's Tyrone Crenshaw, the two-time 
All-City Section 4-A player of the year who is headed to Michigan State.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; DARKNESS HALTS GAME IN NINTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What happens when you combine baseball teams thin on pitching, sloppy 
defenses, a 5 p.m. start and a field with no lights? 
</P>
<P>
 Come to Birmingham High this morning and find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North and Encino ran out of daylight before the end of their American 
Legion District 20 playoff game on Saturday at Birmingham. The game was called 
with Valley North leading, 13-10, and batting in the top of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams will pick up that game at 10 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 If Valley North wins, it will play Sun Valley, which eliminated Van Nuys East, 
7-6, earlier Saturday at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley would have to beat Valley North twice to advance to the Area 6 
playoffs at UCLA, but undefeated Valley North would have to win only once under 
the double-elimination format. 
</P>
<P>
 If Encino beats Valley North, though, Encino would play Sun Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The winner of that game would play Valley North later today for the District 
20 championship. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some debate after the game was called, at about 8:05 p.m., over 
whether it should have been called earlier. Encino took a 10-9 lead into the 
ninth inning, but Valley North scored four runs and was still batting when the 
game was called. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino Coach Scott Muckey said he understood the umpires' desire to start the 
ninth, despite the poor visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have gotten three outs we wouldn't have had to come back," Muckey 
said. "I think it's pretty bad that we had to play defense in the dark, but 
there's nothing you can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North Coach Pete Redfern, whose team trailed, 10-7, after five innings, 
was obviously happy to be coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great comeback by these guys," Redfern said. "They just keep showing 
heart, heart, heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North's comeback was aided by several Encino defensive mishaps. Encino 
made six errors in the game, contributing to five unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of disappointing," Muckey said. "We've been doing it with the 
gloves all year, so you're going to have a bad game sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North's Ray Daryabigi had four hits. LaCour had three hits and Danny 
Martin had two for Valley North. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who stands to pick up the victory if Valley North holds the lead this 
morning, pitched four scoreless innings before the game was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley 7, Van Nuys East 6 -- Sun Valley scored four runs in the top of the 
ninth to eliminate Van Nuys East (17-7-1). 
</P>
<P>
 With the bases loaded and none out, pinch-hitter Mario Gomez ripped a single 
down the right-field line, driving in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 A third run scored, tying the game, when outfielder Francisco Dongo's throw 
sailed past the catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Montenegro drove in Jaime Cerna with the go-ahead run later in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys East right-hander Rusty Howard (3-1) was the victim of Sun Valley's 
rally in the ninth.  
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys East starter Matt Egan pitched seven strong innings, giving up one 
earned run. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Vizcarra (3-1) picked up the victory in relief for Sun Valley (18-6-1).

 It started as idle banter between shots. It grew into half-serious joking. 
</P>
<P>
 A trio of Valley area players, with applause for another ringing in their 
ears, were more than a little distracted by the boisterous gallery following 
the group behind them in the third round of the 95th Southern California Golf 
Assn. Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cheer. Another. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Wright of Ventura, one of the area trio, turned to his playing partners 
and cracked: "We're playing pretty good and nobody's cheering for us. " 
</P>
<P>
 Added Charlie Wi of North Hills, who played alongside Wright in virtual 
anonymity: "I almost wish I was watching, not playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Grown men and college hot-shots were left in the dust Saturday by 18-year-old 
phenom Tiger Woods of Cypress, who shot a course-record eight-under-par 62 at 
Hacienda Golf Club to take a commanding eight-shot lead with one round 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, Wright and playing partner Don Baker of Canoga Park all played fairly well 
or better, but they were mere cannon fodder for Woods, who shot 30 on the front 
nine to break away from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, a former PGA Tour pro who regained his amateur status, couldn't play 
much better. He hit 13 of 14 fairways and 15 of 18 greens in regulation to 
finish with a two-under 68 that left him tied with Wi for third at one-under 
209. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Woods is at 200, a whopping 10 under. Hacienda's membership, not to 
mention the rest of the field, was stunned. Before Woods' 62, no player had 
shot lower than 68. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's about as good as it gets," said Baker, 43, analyzing his own solid 
round. "What else can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not much, except watch the fireworks and wear earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods' score shattered the competitive course record of 66 at Hacienda set by 
Dave Olsen of Toluca Lake in 1992 and broke the SCGA Amateur record of 64 set 
by former Taft High standout Duffy Waldorf at Stockdale Country Club in 
Bakersfield in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tom Kroll of San Marcos, who shot 70 while playing with Woods: "That's 
the best time I've ever had while getting beat by eight shots. Watching him 
play was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, 22, stubbornly refused to concede the title, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just have to play real aggressive and not do anything stupid," Wi said. 
"I just wish I had the opportunity to play like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wi's 68 was superlative enough in its own right. He used only 28 putts and 
recorded his lone bogey when he missed a 2 1/2-footer on the fourth hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 18, and Jason Gore of Valencia each shot 75 to fall well off the pace. 
Wright, who shot 40 on the back nine after hitting his tee shot out of bounds 
on No. 10, is alone in eighth at 216. Gore, 20, who double-bogeyed the ninth 
and 15th holes, is tied for ninth at 217. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Bell of Studio City -- who shot 78 to leave him at 222 -- had a hole in 
one on the sixth hole, an uphill, 205-yard par three. Bell, who played at USC, 
used a four-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Sheff, a member of the Oakwood Country Club in Glendale, shot 75 and is 
at 225, along with James Camaione of the Crystalaire Country Club in the 
Antelope Valley. Camaione shot 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Kinsel of Glendale shot 76 and is at 227, followed at 229 by Mike Tingus 
of Calabasas, who shot 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ladin of Westlake Village, the oldest player in the field at 61, 
struggled to an 82 and fell to 231.

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF WONG; DE LA MAZA NOW A PAIN TO BATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being the hard-working sort, Roland De La Maza joined some of his fellow 
Columbus, Ga., Redstixx pitchers and threw a little extra one morning in early 
May, even though he was the starting pitcher the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of his workout, the right-hander from St. Genevieve High felt 
pain in his pitching shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon he was barely able to reach home plate with his pitches, and he figured 
something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rested a few days and came back, but I couldn't go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor's examination revealed that De La Maza had tendinitis in his pitching 
shoulder. He was put on the disabled list for 6 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents in the Class-A South Atlantic League probably wish he was still 
there. In 13 starts this season, he is 8-1 with a 2.72 earned-run average with 
the Cleveland Indians' affiliate. He has walked only 16 in 72 2/3 innings with 
58 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a couple of rough outings," De La Maza said. "The hitters are good. 
But then I started doing well, and it goes to show that good pitching will beat 
good hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Maza attributes his sore shoulder to overwork. He pitched only 100 
innings last season at Class-A Watertown in the New York-Penn League, but 
instead of resting in the off-season he too often pitched to friends during 
recreation games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's more of a mental thing," he said of his injury. "Sometimes, when I'm 
on the mound, I'm waiting for the pain to come, but it feels good once I get 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Movin' on up: Pitcher Ken Kendrena was promoted to the Florida Marlins' 
Double-A Eastern League affiliate in Portland, Me., on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Cal State Northridge reliever was 5-1 with a 1.18 ERA, 32 
strikeouts and 10 walks in 38 innings at Class-A Brevard County. 
</P>
<P>
 At Portland, Kendrena has pitched in four games, all as a reliever. In eight 
innings, he has a 5.63 ERA and no decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mirror, mirror: When Manager Dave Anderson of the Class-A Jamestown Jammers 
decided his team needed another middle infielder at the start of the season, he 
chose Bryan Corey, a former standout from Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 1993 and played last season in 
Bristol, Va., in the rookie Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey reminds Anderson, a former Dodger shortstop, a little of himself during 
his playing days. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could play all infield positions, which I could do," Anderson said. "He 
doesn't complain about things and he's been a big plus for our team." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's real quiet, does whatever you ask him to do," Anderson said. "I didn't 
say too much, either. It's hard to say too much with Tommy (Lasorda) around 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You pulling my leg?: Reserve first baseman Robby Welles of Jamestown actually 
thought his teammates were playing a joke on him when a reporter called his 
hotel room in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, can you hold on for a second?" Welles said. He then ran around the hotel 
to check if anyone was on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Welles hit .342 with 14 home runs and 58 runs batted in at Pierce College in 
1992 before he transferred in 1993 to Pepperdine, where he suffered an arm 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even throw a baseball the whole year," he said. "I had a good year 
with the bat and I went in the 17th round, which is pretty good considering how 
I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Corey, Welles is used sparingly. Welles starts only against left-handed 
pitchers. But the Jammers have not gone up against that many left-handers.  
</P>
<P>
 This season, he is batting .200 with two RBIs and one home run in 40 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big kid with some pop," Anderson said. "He hasn't had a chance to 
perform that much, but he does have power."

HOW THE RAMS LINE UP FOR '94; ANALYSIS; RAMS FORGET PAST, FIND CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The Rams are back to work, and aren't you thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 The team that went 5-11 a year ago after finishing 6-10 and 3-13 campaigns has 
reassembled to try, try again. 
</P>
<P>
 While most observers have them pegged to go to Baltimore or St. Louis, the 
players and coaches seem to think they are headed for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 You laugh, but facts are the Rams took this business of football seriously 
during the off-season. Apartment dwellers who overlook Rams Park immediately 
noticed the difference -- they no longer lived in fear of misguided footballs 
once Jim Everett was banished to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Rams really do have some guy named "Chris" starting at 
quarterback, and one to back him up, too, they have positioned themselves to 
play old-time Seattle Seahawk football. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chris Miller and Chris Chandler, the Rams have the arms to complete 
high-percentage passes, while not ignoring Flipper Anderson deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team goal is to complete 58% of our passes, but I'd like to hit 62 to 
65%," Miller said. "I think it's very reasonable to reach those numbers based 
on what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Miller has been everything the Rams wanted in a quarterback. He not 
only completes his passes, but also compliments his receivers for fulfilling 
their assigned duties. Anderson went diving for a Miller pass the other day, 
and as one Ram official noted, "You didn't see him doing that a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 For Miller and the Rams to succeed, however, something will need to be done 
with the offensive line. This is no Great Wall and now there are plans to 
employ a rookie at left tackle to protect Miller's blindside. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gandy, the team's No. 1 draft pick from Auburn, was too tired to make it 
to the team's Saturday afternoon practice after signing a $5-million-plus 
contract. No hurry, it seems, because in the meantime some guy named Clarence 
Jones is protecting Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the potential to challenge for a playoff position if certain things 
happen," Coach Chuck Knox said. "One, we need to stiffen our offensive line . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 Did he say, "stiffs"? The Rams will start Darryl Ashmore in Jackie Slater's 
place at right tackle and will position Indianapolis reject Bill Schultz to 
beat out Tom Newberry at left guard. Offensive line coach Jim Erkenbeck will 
earn his paycheck this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for a second, third and fourth receiver to accompany Anderson also 
will dominate the Rams' summertime fun, but if all else fails, there's always 
Bettis, Bettis and more Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Rams have the potential to be exciting and successful. The 
addition of Dallas defensive tackle Jimmie Jones, Raider linebacker Joe Kelly, 
Charger safety Marquez Pope and Cleveland cornerback Terry Taylor should help 
keep the Rams in every game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacks could come in bunches with Robert Young and Sean Gilbert on the prowl. 
And if the equipment manager elects to issue hands to the secondary this season 
-- after a year in which their cornerbacks and safeties combined for seven 
interceptions -- the Rams will have a chance to improve their NFL last-place 
finish in takeaways. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of special teams coach Wayne Sevier, which might have been the 
team's best off-season acquisition, will allow Knox the luxury of relying 
heavily on that phase of the game as he did previously in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been an excellent off-season in terms of filling some holes and in 
the off-season conditioning work we've gotten done," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have more team speed, appear deeper and won't be forced to start 
Wymon Henderson at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 But season-ticket sales, which are off more than 30%, indicate fans do not 
share Knox's enthusiasm. The team hasn't had a winning season since 1989 and a 
move elsewhere appears a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of that should take us off track," Knox said. "You handle that by 
winning. It would be great for us to win and attract fans to that stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have to give them something to tie to, and that's winning. And then 
maybe, when it's all said and done, we can help give some people reasons to 
stay here."

HOW THE RAMS LINE UP FOR '94; ON OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fullback 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starter: Tim Lester 
</P>
<P>
 * The Intern: James Bostic 
</P>
<P>
 * The Unknown: Howard Griffith 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: That's MISTER Lester 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Lester's the man, the talented one who clears the way for Bettis 
when running wide. Bostic better suited to run with the ball than block, which 
suggests he grab a seat on the bench and make himself comfortable. Why does 
Griffith persist in joining teams with good backs? Chargers liked him but 
didn't need him. Tight End 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starter: Troy Drayton 
</P>
<P>
 * Short On Beef: Travis McNeal, Rickey Brady 
</P>
<P>
 * Taking Up Space: Yonnie Jackson 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Bring back Pat Carter 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: A year ago Drayton was being compared to former Charger 
pass-catching tight end Kellen Winslow. Drayton now being likened to The Fridge 
after summer eating binge. Drayton's best asset is catching the ball, so why 
become a two-ton tackle? Carter contributed handsomely to Bettis' success on 
ground, but he's in Houston now. Gaping hole at left tackle will require help 
from tight end, but McNeal and Brady aren't Carter. Center 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starter: Bern Brostek 
</P>
<P>
 * Lotto Winner: Blair Bush 
</P>
<P>
 * Just Hangin' Around: Brad Fichtel 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Unchallenged starter 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Rams' line in shambles as camp opens, but Brostek provides 
stability up the gut. Bush holds on to best job in America, pulling down big 
bucks to waddle onto the field four or five times a game to work as deep 
snapper. Fichtel dines on Ram food for another year, waits for Brostek to slip 
on ice patch. Guard 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starters: Leo Goeas, Tom Newberry 
</P>
<P>
 * Starter In Waiting: Bill Schultz 
</P>
<P>
 * Future Bouncers: Keith Loneker, Jeff Pahukoa, Chuck Belin 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Newberry in trouble 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Newberry has guaranteed contract that prevented team from 
releasing him during off-season. Team contends privately that his play has 
dropped off and every effort will be made to replace him in starting lineup. 
Schultz, a tough guy with experience as a starter, is early favorite although 
he might also get look at tackle. There is some sentiment for Loneker, but 
unless they're talking about using him to load the moving vans at season's end, 
they've been watching too many "Death Wish" movies. Goeas didn't miss a down 
and proved to be key acquisition a year ago. He has ability to play tackle, but 
he won't get the call unless all else fails. Quarterback 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starter: Chris Miller 
</P>
<P>
 * Accident Insurance: Chris Chandler 
</P>
<P>
 * Clipboard Duel: T.J. Rubley vs. Jamie Martin 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: No wimp at QB 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Miller wears No. 13 and in his spare time breaks mirrors and 
invites black cats to prance before him. The guy has had two operations on the 
same knee the past two seasons and now wants to play for the Rams, a team with 
no competent left tackle to protect his blind side. If allowed to remain 
healthy, he's accurate, tough-minded and capable of wounding defenses packed in 
tight to stop Bettis. Chandler is a good golfer; 15-24 as a starting 
quarterback. Rubley appears tight, rattled by acquisition of Miller and 
Chandler. Martin was just a warm body a year ago, but insiders say he might 
have edge on Rubley to hold clipboard. Tackle 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starters: Darryl Ashmore, Wayne Gandy 
</P>
<P>
 * "Baywatch" Rejects: Clarence Jones, Ron Edwards, Justin Starck 
</P>
<P>
 * Future Broadcaster: Jackie Slater 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Watch the sacks pile up 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: One word of advice for Miller: "Duck." before draft, Rams put out 
word they wouldn't take tackle because rookies historically don't fare well. 
After taking Gandy they said there are always exceptions. But Gandy skipped 
June off-season workouts while negotiating a contract and will be the only 
thing standing between Miller and a pair of crutches. The ball boys have 
contributed more than Ashmore the past two years, and now he replaces a legend 
at right tackle in Slater. Jones failed to impress in off-season tryout, but 
became available later for cheaper price and now rates praise from Rams. 
Tailback 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starter: Jerome Bettis 
</P>
<P>
 * True Grit: David Lang, Cleveland Gary, Johnny Bailey 
</P>
<P>
 * Say Goodby: Beno Bryant 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Ernie Zampese has moved to Dallas to coordinate offense for 
Troy Aikman, leaving running backs coach Chick Harris to direct Ram offense. 
Guess who gets the ball? Bettis, Bettis and more Bettis. Gary reported to Rams 
unhappy a year ago, but showed something by plugging away without complaint. 
Reliance on Bettis makes Gary a most valuable understudy. Lang is only running 
back on roster with home-run pop, but he's still bothered by sore knee and 
won't be ready for start of camp. Bailey escapes Buddy Ryan, agrees to do 
anything Chuck Knox wants. Wide Receivers 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starter: Flipper Anderson 
</P>
<P>
 * Alvin Harper Audition: Jesse Hester, Chris Brantley, Sean LaChapelle, Nate 
Lewis, Greg McMurtry, Todd Kinchen, Isaac Bruce, Richard Buchanan 
</P>
<P>
 * Camp Fodder: Jeff Jones, Jermaine Ross, Turhon O'Bannon 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Hand the ball to Bettis 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Henry Ellard has moved on to Washington, while Anderson begins 
play minus obvious companion on opposite side of the field. Anderson enters 
final year of his contract, thereby providing motivation to catch the ball this 
season. Cast of thousands has been assembled to make up for failed attempt to 
land Haywood Jeffires and Alvin Harper. Rookies will get best look and Brantley 
has already flashed go-deep speed. Bruce, team's No. 2 choice, makes it no 
matter what he does. McMurtry makes up for tight end shortage with ability to 
go across middle. Kinchen still struggling with sore knee and LaChapelle, alias 
"The Turtle," must overcome loss of his faithful companion, Jim Everett. Lewis 
needs to pick it up after sluggish first impression.

 Sean Woodside solidified his position atop the Sportsman points standings with 
his fourth main-event victory in five weeks and two other divisions featured 
new points leaders to highlight Saturday night's racing at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodside entered the night with a 40-point lead over Gary Sigman, who failed 
to finish the 40-lap feature race. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Daniels of San Bernardino finished second, followed by Sean Monroe of Los 
Angeles and Simi Valley's Steve Nickolai. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Kelley failed to win a race, but still managed to move to the top of the 
Pro Stock points standings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old Arleta resident entered the 15-lap figure 8 main event with an 
eight-point advantage over Simi Valley's Scott Dinger after finishing second in 
both the 25-lap oval feature and four-lap trophy dash, and third in an 
eight-lap heat race. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinger began with a one-point lead over Kelley, but finished ninth in the oval 
feature to relinquish the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerrit Cromsigt held off a late challenge from Kelley to register his third 
consecutive oval feature win and fourth main-event victory in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Results from the figure 8 main event were unavailable by press time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mini Stock division, Terry Limberopoulos took the points lead with his

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westlake Senators 14-and-under baseball traveling team qualified for the 
Continental Amateur Baseball Assn. World Series by winning a recent state 
tournament held in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senators, composed primarily of players from the Valley and Ventura 
County, defeated South Gate twice to win the state tournament and had a 5-1 
record overall. In an earlier district tournament, the Senators won four in a 
row after dropping their first game. 
</P>
<P>
 The CABA World Series will be held Aug. 4-15 in Dublin, Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
 Several area Little League all-star teams have passed their first test on the 
long road to the World Series, winning district championships to advance to 
sectional play. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 40, which includes most of the San Fernando Valley, Northridge won

HOW THE RAMS LINE UP FOR '94; ON DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tackles 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starters: Sean Gilbert, Jimmie Jones 
</P>
<P>
 * Sleeper: D'Marco Farr 
</P>
<P>
 * Bit Players: Marc Boutte, David Rocker, Maa Tanuvasa, Jeff Esters 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Thunder & Lightning 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: If Jones is as good as Ram coaches say, Gilbert's life becomes 
easier and the outside pass rush becomes even more effective. If everyone had 
the intensity of Gilbert, Rams would be prepped for that NFC championship 
showdown with Dallas. Rams won free-agent bidding war with Minnesota for Farr. 
Boutte failed to take the heat off Gilbert last year and Rocker disappeared 
after making impression in training camp. Jones has inside speed and Gilbert 
packs punch, which provides foundation for one of best front fours in game. 
Ends 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starters: Fred Stokes, Robert Young 
</P>
<P>
 * Heir Apparent: Brad Ottis 
</P>
<P>
 * Good luck: Gerald Robinson, Kevin Patrick 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Take Young in sack pool 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: In last eight games Young has had nine sacks, and he's beginning 
only his fourth year, but coming off serious knee injury. Stokes had 9.5 sacks, 
but needs a healthy Young on the field to keep offenses honest and give him a 
chance to reach the quarterback. Ottis gets time to develop before making run 
for Stokes' job. Coaches like Robinson, which suggests he might be in 
possession of blackmail material. Outside Linebackers 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starters: Henry Rolling, Roman Phifer 
</P>
<P>
 * Mr. Inspiration: Chris Martin 
</P>
<P>
 * Special Teamers: Andy Mason, Ernest Jones 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Keep an eye on Mason 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Phifer led team in tackles and has blossomed into dominant 
defender. Rolling has more to offer, but injuries put damper on last season, 
allowing Martin more playing time. Jones will get time and roster spot because 
of lofty draft position (third round). Mason, a long shot as a rookie free 
agent from Washington, has speed and has added weight, giving him chance to 
beat the odds. Middle Linebacker 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starter: Shane Conlan 
</P>
<P>
 * Key Addition: Joe Kelly 
</P>
<P>
 * Up Against It: Tom Homco, Brett Collins 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Ban the run-and-shoot 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Run-and-shoot offenses keep Conlan on sideline, but when afforded 
opportunity to play, Conlan cleans up. Kelly leaves Raiders, joins Rams, but 
coaches insist he's a smart guy. Kelly gives defense veteran upgrade and might 
challenge Rolling on outside. Collins wages desperation battle to hang on as 
Conlan's caddie. Cornerbacks 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starters: Todd Lyght, Steve Israel 
</P>
<P>
 * Nickel Backs: Terry Taylor, Robert Bailey 
</P>
<P>
 * Wasting Time: Wymon Henderson, Dexter Davis, Mitchell Price 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Pro Bowl bid for Lyght 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Rams finished season with likes of Henderson and Davis covering 
Rice and Taylor, and now you know why the team compiled a 5-11 record. Knee 
injury stopped Lyght from completing quality season. Team success and a number 
of interceptions will give Lyght a chance at gaining Pro Bowl recognition. 
Israel most improved player on team a year ago and ready for start. Bailey and 
Taylor give Rams fighting chance on obvious passing downs and keep Henderson 
and Davis out of lineup. Safety 
</P>
<P>
 * The Starters: Anthony Newman, Deral Boykin 
</P>
<P>
 * Future Star: Keith Lyle 
</P>
<P>
 * Solid Depth: Marquez Pope, Toby Wright, Clifford Hicks, David Wilson 
</P>
<P>
 * At First Glance: Pressure on Newman 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Newman emerged as team leader last season, but now needs to make 
some plays. Newman did not have an interception and will be pushed by an 
impressive-looking Lyle. Wright has big-hit reputation, but Boykin gets early 
nod on last year's work. Pope, who played out of position at corner for 
Chargers, has come on strong as potential starter at safety. Upgrade at this 
position demonstrates Rams' overall improvement during off-season.

BEAT THE CLOCK; WAYNE 'BUZZER-BEATER' WILLIAMS IS LOOKING FOR ONE MORE SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Williams, never too shy to tell a coach exactly what he thinks, tried to 
get a word in during a timeout in an ASICS Summer Pro League game at the Bren 
Center the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 Only nine-tenths of a second remained. Williams' team trailed by three points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach," the former Cal State Fullerton player said, interrupting Mike Arnold, 
"put me in. I'm the Buzzer-Beater." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold ignored him, and Williams took a half-sullen stroll to the end of the 
bench. His teammates know his history -- the 25-footer that beat Nevada Las 
Vegas in overtime his freshman year, the half-dozen or so other desperate 
heaves he made to win games or beat halftime clocks during his three years as a 
Titan. They remember all that -- and Williams' penchant for second-guessing a 
coach, the way he did John Sneed at Fullerton for most of three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 They laughed, patted him on the butt. Williams took it good-naturedly, then 
watched as teammate Jeff Von Lutzow, the former UC Irvine player, missed the 
desperation three-pointer at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Summer Pro League is not so much about winning games, but about winning 
attention, and Williams, his college career finally over at 24 after playing 
his final season at Cal State San Bernardino, is hoping for a chance to play 
overseas.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's much easier for a big guy. That's where the market is," Williams said. 
"The teams overseas usually already have their point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I want to continue to play. I'm going to keep trying until I think I'm 
too old to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' first college season was probably his best, but it began bizarrely 
-- an omen for a career that took him through two schools and three coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason practice was just under way in 1988 when George McQuarn quit 
abruptly as the Titans' coach. Williams wondered if he should transfer, but 
decided to stay and play for Sneed. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, it looked like a good decision. Williams started at the point as 
a freshman, and the team went 16-13 behind the often spectacular play of 
Williams, Mark Hill and -- most of all -- Cedric Ceballos, who was on his way 
to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 By Year 2, things were souring. Williams wondered aloud why the Titans didn't 
play more man defense and why they didn't run more. He considered transferring, 
but Sneed, in a move he would come to regret, urged him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 1991 season, the players were in open revolt. Williams 
proved one thing: He has a point guard's leadership skills. After a loss to 
Pacific in the 1991 Big West Conference tournament ended the Titans' 14-14 
season, Williams and Joe Small complained to the press about Sneed's discipline 
methods, his strategies and his substitution patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Sneed's downfall didn't come until the end of the next season, the 
outcome was set. His relationships with most of his players and co-workers were 
strained enough that it would have taken an NCAA tournament appearance to save 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wouldn't last the summer. He was declared academically ineligible and 
left school, transferring to San Bernardino. He left Fullerton with 744 assists 
in three seasons -- only 207 shy of Leon Wood's career record. Williams was 
gone, but at the end of the next season, Sneed was, too. Bill Shumard, then 
athletic director, decided not to renew Sneed's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just me," Williams protests now. "It was me speaking for the team, 
but other players felt that way. When I spoke up, everybody made me the 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams says he could have stayed at Fullerton, using a redshirt year to 
recover his eligibility, but he doubts it would have turned out well at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he enrolled at San Bernardino to play for Reggie Morris, who had been 
his coach at Los Angeles Manual Arts High School. Williams sat out one season 
under transfer rules, then another to continue working on his academics 
(Division II programs don't have the same five-year limit on a player's career 
that Division I programs have.) 
</P>
<P>
 He was San Bernardino's best player last season, but still, controversy 
accompanied him to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams admits he and Develle Walker, who had been his high school teammate, 
got into a fight during a pickup game at the school gym last September. But he 
denies the accusation that he pulled a gun out of his gym bag and threatened 
Walker with it. The San Bernardino County district attorney declined to pursue 
the case, but Morris later said that he thought the publicity contributed to 
the end of his coaching tenure at the conclusion of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he feels for Morris -- and says that though other players didn't 
get along with Morris, he certainly did. And he insists the allegation against 
him was false. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not true, not true," he said. "If I did that in a gym full of people, why 
didn't anybody else see it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Williams looked like he had a good college career ahead of him. 
Now, he only has a tumultuous one behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I'm disappointed about is that I didn't get to finish at 
Fullerton like I wanted to," he said.

CENTURY'S IKE HARMON PLANS TRANSFER TO SANTA ANA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ROHWER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ike Harmon, a 6-foot-5 junior forward who helped lead Century High to its 
first playoff victory in basketball this past season, will transfer to Santa 
Ana Valley this fall, his brother Thomas said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, Harmon led the Centurions' junior varsity in scoring.Last year, 
he was a starter on the varsity, playing beside Thomas, a 6-4 center who was a 
Times all-county first-team selection and Pacific Coast League co-player of the 
year as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Ike and Thomas are the youngest of eight children born to Thomas Sr. and Neda 
Harmon. They have six sisters, ranging in age from 27 to 33, many of whom were 
standout athletes at Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ike Harmon has played three games with the Falcons in summer tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rich Prospero's program at Santa Ana Valley attracted a lot of attention 
last season with the addition of guard Olujimi Mann from Mater Dei, one of 
three transfers last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, now a junior, was a Times all-county selection last season and helped 
the Falcons (26-4) reach the Southern Section Division I-AA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Century Coach Greg Coombs, who has reportedly filed a grievance with the 
Southern Section office, did not return phone calls Saturday. BOB ROHWER

HOLLYWOOD PARK; MULTIFACETED SILVER MUSIC WINS SWAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Silver Music might not be the best 3-year-old in the country, but the gray son 
of Silver Ghost is versatile and consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming to California earlier this year, the Virginia-bred hasn't been 
worse than second in five starts, and nearly four months after becoming a 
stakes winner on turf, he did the same on the main track in the $213,800 Swaps 
at Hollywood Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race suited for his late-running style, Silver Music, the 2-1 second 
choice, moved up on the outside down the back stretch, then went on to win by 
four lengths under Chris Antley in 2:00 3/5 for the 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic Gold, the 3-1 third choice who led by a length at the quarter-pole, 
finished second, three-quarters of a length in front of 17-10 favorite Valiant 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Lauren and M. Roy Cohen, the son of Mr. Prospector has won five of 17 
and his ability to handle dirt or turf gives trainer Wally Dollase many 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollase, who has eight victories from only 23 starters at the Hollywood Park 
meeting, believes the colt might be better on the main track, but he could 
return to the turf in the La Jolla Handicap at Del Mar on Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried him on both surfaces and now he looks superior on the dirt," 
Dollase said. "The whole secret to this horse is that he's so easy to manage 
and easy to rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody else out there is running their eyeballs out and this guy is just 
saying, 'Don't run away, boys, I'll catch you.' I can't be responsible for 
that. He's just one of those horses who has a good mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had many too many Mr. Prospector line horses and this horse is not 
an imposing individual at all. But he has guts, quality or class . . . whatever 
it is. I mean, he's like a puppy dog in the paddock, so calm and quiet. He just 
trains like a quality animal and I think it must be the quality of that Mr. 
Prospector line." 
</P>
<P>
 Antley, who has lost only once in four tries with Silver Music, is also 
impressed by the Virginia-bred's versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse is really something," he said. "Dirt, grass, distance. He's won at 
6 1/2 furlongs on the turf (the Baldwin Stakes at Santa Anita) then come back 
and won at 1 1/4 miles on the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had me a little worried today on the turn. He actually slowed down his run 
because he had been running on the bridle all the way down the backside. Around 
the turn, he eased up a bit, but he (surged) again in the lane. Then, in the 
last eighth of a mile, he found his best stride again." 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Nature, in his first start on the Hollywood Park main track since his 
16-1 upset of Brocco in the Hollywood Futurity last Dec. 19, set the pace for 
six furlongs, dropped back, then came on again and finished nearly two lengths 
in front of Pollock's Luck. Valiant Nature is winless in his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the lead, but he couldn't keep up at the half-mile pole," jockey 
Laffit Pincay said. "Then, coming down the stretch, he started coming on again. 
I almost got second." 
</P>
<P>
 After Pollock's Luck, Wild Invader and R Friar Tuck completed the order of 
finish. The last three finishers in the Swaps were the first three in the 
Affirmed Handicap three weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla, a 14-1 shot when he upset Bien Bien and Arcangues in the 
Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 30, will be a much shorter price in the $250,000 
Sunset Handicap today. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with Sir Mark Sykes, the 7-year-old roan is the 8-5 morning-line 
favorite for the Sunset, which is run at 1 1/2 miles on the turf. Gary Stevens, 
who rode Grand Flotilla for the first time in the Turf Handicap, will again be 
aboard for trainer Jenine Sahadi. Sir Mark Sykes, fourth at 31-1 in the Golden 
Gate Handicap in his U.S. debut on June 18, will be ridden by Corey Black. 
</P>
<P>
 Mashaallah, who added Lasix and won the restricted Jim Murray Handicap in his 
second American race, is the 2-1 second choice. The rest of the field includes 
Stark South, Emerald Jig, Semillon and Liyoun. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other stake on the card, Golden Klair is the 8-5 favorite in the 
$300,000 Vanity Handicap at 1 1/8 miles. Andestine, who was third behind Golden 
Klair in the Hawthorne Handicap before beating her in the Milady, is the 5-2 
second choice. The other entrants are Mz. Zill Bear, Exchange, Fondly 
Remembered, Potridee, Wendy's Daughter and Southern Truce. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Music paid $6 and earned $123,800 for his owners. . . . Samourzakan, 
owned in part by Hollywood Park CEO R.D. Hubbard and trained by Bob Hess Jr., 
won the $100,000 Laurance Armour Handicap at Arlington Park. Juvenal Diaz rode 
the 5-year-old Shardari horse, who won for the first time in five American 
races. . . . Tempest Dancer, making her first start since January, won the 
$105,750 Ellis Park Budweiser Breeders' Cup. Ridden by Fabio Arguello Jr. and 
trained by Brad MacDonald, Tempest Dancer paid $16.20 and covered the seven 
furlongs in 1:23. Favored Arches Of Gold was second. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Purple and the filly Serena's Song were among eight 2-year-olds entered 
for Monday's $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile Championship. The other six entrants 
were Fox Mountain, Sierra Diablo, Cold N Calculating, Tyson's Revenge, Cyrano 
and Desert Pirate. . . . Corey Nakatani will be at Arlington Park today to ride 
Eagle Eyed for trainer Bobby Frankel in the $300,000 American Derby. Eagle Eyed 
won the Arlington Classic in his last start. Also in the Derby, which will be 
simulcast between the third and fourth races at Hollywood Park, is Cinema 
Handicap runner-up Vaudeville.

JOBS DISAPPEAR; NEWCOMERS TO ORANGE COUNTY, MOSTLY ASIANS AND LATINOS, FACE 
LEAN PROSPECTS AS THE COUNTY'S ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY 
</P>

 Ask Tho Phan what job he is seeking, and the 21-year-old newcomer from Vietnam 
provides a quick answer. "Electrical assembly," he says, his boyish face 
beaming. "I want the job with electrical assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 It may not seem like a dream job, but even before arriving in Westminster four 
months ago, Phan had heard reports of compatriots who found work in electronics 
assembly and turned them into careers, moving up to positions as inspectors, 
technicians and supervisors. He had heard that electronics plants hired 
unskilled workers who spoke little English and paid much better than low-wage 
jobs in hotels, restaurants and other service businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can work in restaurant," Phan says, between English classes at St. Anselm's 
Cross-Cultural Community Center in Garden Grove, which is helping him find 
work. But Phan frowns at that thought, and he adds quickly, "I want electrical 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 The stories Phan heard were true a few years ago, but today he faces a vastly 
different Orange County job market -- one where electronics assembly openings 
are scarce. Once plentiful, much of that work has been wiped out by the 
recession, deep cuts in aerospace, factory automation and the relocation of 
manufacturing plants to places like Texas and Mexico. Even as the local economy 
shows signs of resurgence, electronics assembly jobs will probably never 
return, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robots and machines are now doing what human beings did, so there's a 
tendency for these assembly jobs not to come back even if the economy starts 
showing strong expansion," says Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest impact from these lost jobs will be felt by new arrivals to Orange 
County, especially Asian and Latino refugees and immigrants, who found in them 
an easy entry into the U.S. work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Blank, executive director at St. Anselm's community center, a 
nonprofit group that has helped thousands of mostly Southeast Asian refugees 
find employment, says Asians, in particular, preferred electronics assembly 
work because such jobs are culturally more acceptable than working in a 
restaurant or hotel. "It's technical, and they could write home and be proud of 
it," she said, "even if all they were doing was sitting and pushing buttons all 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Blank says, they're having to settle for dead-end jobs sewing shirts 
or packing medicine into cartons for minimum wage, because electronics 
factories just aren't hiring as they used to. "It's been very devastating," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While an exact tally of electronics assembly jobs lost in the county is not 
available, extrapolations from broader industry data suggest that the toll has 
been heavy, probably into the thousands. Between 1988 and May, 1994, Orange 
County lost 35% of its employment -- or 13,200 jobs -- in the electronic 
equipment industry, which, as a subcontractor to aerospace and defense firms, 
employs the most electronics assemblers. That percentage drop was nearly twice 
the rate of decline for manufacturing employment overall in Orange County, 
according to the state's Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Aerospace companies have also directly eliminated hundreds of assembly workers 
in recent years, and more layoffs could be on the way. For example, Hughes 
Aircraft, which in the past year has laid off about 100 assemblers at its 
Fullerton plant, is considering closing the entire factory. A decision is 
expected in mid-August, and a closure would mean another 250 electronics 
assemblers would be out of work, union officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmer Batac, 36, says he was among 40 Hughes workers in Fullerton who were 
laid off in May. The Tustin resident was hired as an electronics assembler at 
Hughes in 1981, two years after he came to California from the Philippines. 
"The job provided me with a good livelihood," he says, noting that he had an 
hourly wage of more than $14. But now, Batac says he's considering leaving the 
state and exploring a career in nursing. "Electronics assembly, it's sad," says 
Batac. "We need a war to get these jobs back." 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of computer hardware products also employ electronics assemblers 
and a few -- like Orange County's Kingston Technology and Viking Components, 
both makers of memory upgrade products -- have been adding workers. But many 
others have cut back. Last year, Helix Circuits and Diceon Electronics, both 
manufacturers of printed circuit boards in Irvine, shut manufacturing plants 
that together eliminated more than 200 assembly jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 And AST Research Inc. in Irvine, the world's fifth-largest personal-computer 
manufacturer, pruned its local work force late last year by 650 -- including 
about 450 assembly-line jobs -- while adding 500 employees to its Texas plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood of (future) hiring is pretty slim," says a spokeswoman for ITT 
Cannon, a Santa Ana maker of electronic connectors, echoing comments made by 
other small and large electronics companies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's loss of electronics assembly jobs is part of a nationwide 
trend in which such jobs have been declining since reaching a peak of 360,000 
in the mid-1980s, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1993 the 
nation's employment in this occupation dropped to 315,000, with two-thirds of 
these jobs held by women. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuong Dobyns, a job developer for Catholic Charities in Santa Ana for 15 
years, says there are 50% fewer electronics assembly openings today than three 
years ago. And she complains that the electronics plants hiring today are 
offering less pay than in the past, because employers have a bigger pool of 
jobless workers -- including more with previous assembly experience. As such, 
electronics companies are being more selective, requiring better English skills 
and more work experience, Dobyns says. "This makes it tough for new 
immigrants." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Electronics assemblers typically learn on the job, and their work includes 
reading diagrams, soldering, fabricating and fastening components, such as 
capacitors. In Orange County, these jobs pay on average about $7 an hour, with 
most also providing medical insurance plus other employee benefits, private and 
state-sponsored surveys show. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Thomas, vice president of Microsemi Corp., a maker of semiconductors in 
Santa Ana, remembers when times were different. Through the booming 1970s and 
up to the late '80s, he says, electronics assembly openings were so abundant in 
Orange County that "we were begging people to work." But when the defense 
industry began retrenching a few years ago, Microsemi's orders suffered, and in 
January, 1992, Thomas says, the company trimmed about 100 jobs locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he says, Microsemi's employment in Santa Ana has held steady, 
about 425 of which 44% are Asian, mostly Vietnamese, and another 30% Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Such demographics are not unusual for electronics plants in Orange County. 
Bill Thomson, personnel manager at Interstate Electronics in Anaheim, says 
Asians and Latinos make up the majority of the assemblers at his plant. 
Interstate, a subcontractor to Rockwell and Hughes, currently employs 87 
electronics assemblers -- down from twice that number several years ago. 
Thomson says assemblers have ample opportunities for advancement and that their 
average pay at Interstate is $10 to $12 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Menendez, 39, got in easily as an assembler at Microsemi during the 
hiring boom, back in May, 1980, and has made the most of her opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Menendez had arrived in Santa Ana a year earlier from Uruapan, Mexico. She was 
24 then, and "my whole fortune," she says, was a suitcase of clothes and $450 
that she had saved over the years as a secretary in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first U.S. job was in a Westminster factory inspecting kitchen and 
bathroom tiles. Menendez says she stood all day, dropping heavy tiles from one 
hand to the other, listening to the sound for hints on how sturdy each tile 
was. "It was a hard job," she recalls with a grimace. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tile plant closed, Menendez applied at Microsemi, a company she had 
heard about through a relative. That same week, she was hired on the assembly 
line at $3.90 an hour -- 80 cents above the federal minimum wage at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time my English was not that good, but it was still better than the 
Vietnamese supervisor there," Menendez says. "My supervisor hired me, and said, 
'You speak Spanish well, so you can help me with other Spanish speakers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Menendez has been promoted several times, to jobs as lead 
worker, inspector and supervisor. Currently she works as a quality-control 
supervisor and makes $13.90 an hour -- a wage that has helped Menendez and her 
husband, a print-shop worker, buy a spacious four-bedroom house in Chino for 
themselves and their three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Menendez is now taking classes in business administration at Chaffey College 
in Rancho Cucamonga. "The company is paying for everything," she says proudly, 
"even the parking." 
</P>
<P>
 Queenie Phu, another Microsemi worker who started as an assembler and worked 
her way up to an office job, says: "I did not know much English and I had no 
background in electronics. At first I didn't know what I was doing." Phu, who 
is Chinese, came to Microsemi in 1980, two years after arriving in the United 
States from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Phu says the job helped her adjust to her new life here because she had 
friends and co-workers at the plant who spoke Vietnamese and Chinese, and she 
could feel comfortable bringing ethnic food to the company lunchroom. "I was 
lucky," she says. "Long time ago, there was such a big demand for electrical 
workers. They gave me an interview and I went to work right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Thomas says Microsemi has just one opening at the plant for an 
assembly-type job. And the competition is intense. "We get a hundred 
applications a day for that single job," says Thomas, who is still screening 
the applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Woo, executive director of the Community Resources Opportunity Project, a 
nonprofit organization that helps Latino and Asian immigrants in Orange County 
find work, blames electronics firms for the loss of assembly jobs. "We have a 
strong immigrant population here, but they still take the jobs to foreign 
markets," he complains. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woo also sees some good in what has happened to the electronics industry. 
"It's forcing our community to be more entrepreneurial," Woo says, adding that 
his organization is putting together a proposal to build an electronics factory 
that would employ up to 400 assembly workers. Woo declined to be more specific, 
but he says of his and other job-placement organizations, "We need to be more 
creative with unskilled labor." 
</P>
<P>
 The steady loss of electronics jobs has brought some changes. In vocational 
schools, Asian and Latino students who once might have gone through three 
months of training in electronics assembly are now preparing for careers in 
computer science and library science, program directors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing Taylor, a 15-year electronics instructor at Rancho Santiago College, 
remembers his typical class in the 1980s. "At that time, 85% were Asians, and 
they went straight to assembly. There were jobs then, and it meant immediate 
employment at above-minimum wage." These days Taylor sees fewer Asian students, 
and he says "most of them are looking to go on to four-year colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still hundreds of new arrivals who cling to old dreams of what 
the job market once was. And most have found nothing but bitter disappointment. 
Among them is 28-year-old Dung Trinh of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinh, a relative newcomer from Vietnam, last year quit his part-time 
electronics assembly job in Corona because he could not get enough work. Ever 
since, Trinh has been looking hard for another assembly job, but has come up 
empty. "In Vietnam, I repair fans," he says. "I look for four, five months for 
job. But companies (are not) hiring." 
</P>
<P>
 Dobyns, of Catholic Charities, who is trying to help Trinh find work, says she 
has taken Trinh to various electronics assembly plants in the county to no 
avail. Dobyns believes his halting English has kept him from getting hired, 
even though most of those plants have Vietnamese-speaking supervisors. A few 
years ago, Dobyns says, Trinh would have gotten in the door easily. For 
newcomers seeking work, she says, "right now is not a good time." Shrinking Job 
Supply 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing jobs in Orange County have been disappearing steadily since the 
late 1980s, particularly in the electronic-equipment industry, where 35% of the 
jobs have been eliminated since 1988, in thousands: 
</P>
<P>
 Total manufacturing jobs 1994*: 205.5 
</P>
<P>
 Total electronic-equipment jobs 1994*: 24.5 
</P>

JAMES FLANIGAN: BEHIND SPENDTHRIFT STATISTICS, U.S. HAS SAVING GRACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The baleful news on retirement saving is only partly right, but nothing is 
more frightening in personal finance these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. savings rate remains stuck below 4% of disposable income, according 
to Commerce Department statistics. The rate was more than 7% for three decades 
after World War II and 6% in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest baby boomers, the roughly 30% of the population born between 1946 
and 1964, are now 48 -- sigh -- and yet they don't seem to be saving heavily 
for retirement. Surveys by brokerage and investment firms say that many of the 
77 million baby boomers underestimate how much money they will need for 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is not encouraging. Most of the 1,400 respondents to a Fidelity 
Investments poll said they found that trying to save 6% to 8% of pretax income 
was boring and difficult and that they would not do it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is in spite of widespread worries about old-age poverty, which are fed by 
dire warnings that corporate pensions can no longer be counted on and a common 
suspicion that Social Security will simply run out of money, condemning people 
now in their 30s to eventual penury. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of the future hurt the present. America's low savings rates is a big 
reason why Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan thinks the U.S. 
economy can't grow without sparking high inflation. So fears about saving 
indirectly cause higher interest rates, which hobble the economy, making it 
harder to save. We're in a vicious circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most fears are overblown. To begin with, there is more saving than 
statistics indicate. The Commerce Department's figures are overly simplistic. 
They take after-tax personal income of all Americans, $4.81 trillion, subtract 
total personal spending, $4.62 trillion, and call the remainder -- $193 billion 
-- savings. No distinctions are made; spending on a college education is 
classed the same as spending on a candy bar. 
</P>
<P>
 But a college education is a form of investment, hence savings, argue many 
economists. David Bradford of Princeton University says that saving should be 
defined as adding to the wealth of the nation. A college education is saving 
because it improves human capital -- "a form of wealth that swamps all others 
in importance," Bradford says. 
</P>
<P>
 American education over recent decades is an unappreciated story: In 1960, 
only 41% of all Americans finished high school. Now 80% do. In 1960, 7.7% of 
the population completed four years of college. Now the figure is more than 
20%. The advances are notable among all races and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The $40 billion that individuals spend on tuition each year, and the $60 
billion that state, local and federal governments spend, is truly investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing also is a factor of national wealth and therefore saving. But you 
don't have to be an economist to see that makes sense. The 60 million U.S. 
homeowners all see their houses as wealth and a nest egg for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Calculated in the broader perspective of wealth, the real U.S. savings rate is 
more comparable to the high savings rates of Japan and many countries in 
Europe, in which higher education and home ownership are not as widespread 
among the population. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean all is rosy. Years of lagging income gains for U.S. workers 
and lagging corporate profits have affected American saving, says economist 
Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 But pensions and Social Security are not the problem, even though they receive 
a lot of mistaken publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 In pensions the trend is back to employer guarantees of retirement income as a 
percentage of pay, after a decade in which defined-contribution plans grew 
rapidly. In defined-contribution plans, employees make investment decisions 
about their own retirement funds, to which employers contribute but make no 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem was that employees often invested too conservatively, choosing 
fixed-interest guaranteed investment contracts rather than going for higher 
returns in common stock mutual funds, as professional investors would advise. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, to which some 200 companies are turning, is called a cash 
balance account. Employers contribute a percentage of the employee's wage and 
guarantee a return on investment of the funds. The money is managed 
professionally, explains Mark Maselli, a partner in Kwasha Lipton, a benefits 
consulting firm in Ft. Lee, N.J., that devised the first cash balance plan for 
Bank of America in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security is in good shape after being adjusted in 1983 to allow for 
Medicare expenditures and the fact that Americans are living longer. The system 
will need adjustment again early in the next century, says Eugene Steurle, 
co-author of "Retooling Social Security for the 21st Century." But meanwhile, 
it will run in surplus until roughly 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 So the real problem with retirement saving is that the baby boom generation 
hasn't got serious about putting money aside for retirement. One explanation is 
that many boomers had children later in life and are now paying college 
tuitions rather than investing in IRA and 401(k) accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 When they do invest, they might take a look at a survey that U.S. Trust Co. 
took among wealthy Americans -- those with $3 million net worth or $200,000 
annual incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 What do the rich do with their money? They put 37% of it into common stocks or 
stock mutual funds -- 19% in blue chips, 10% in small companies and 8% in 
equity mutual funds. They put relatively little in bonds, other than 10% in 
tax-exempt municipal bonds. And they keep more than 20% in bank accounts, money 
funds and Treasury bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: We should all save because we can look forward to more years 
of retirement than ever. Life expectancy when Social Security began in 1935 was 
about 64 years for women, 59 years for men. Today it is about 80 years for 
women and 73 for men. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, the national health has improved along with the national wealth.

THE 10 COSTLIEST CAR-BUYING TRAPS; AUTOS: DO A LITTLE HOMEWORK AND YOU CAN

</P>
<P>
 Americans in near-record numbers are expected to visit auto showrooms this 
car-buying season to replace aging vehicles that have limped through the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Power Associates, the automotive research firm, estimates that more than 
15.5 million cars will change hands this year. That would make 1994 second in 
car sales to 1986, when 16 million cars were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're among the recovery-charged car-buying masses, the good news and bad 
news can be compressed into one simple sentence: Buying a car hasn't changed 
much over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a few dealerships -- mostly those selling Saturns -- where haggling 
over prices is out, getting a good deal on a car still boils down to the 
ancient art of negotiation. If you're a good bargainer, you can save thousands 
of dollars, but if you fall into one of several car-buying traps, you will pay 
dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 10 of the most costly pitfalls: 1. Not knowing the dealer's price 
</P>
<P>
 The starting point of any price negotiation should be what the car actually 
cost the dealership. Generally, that cost bears no relation to the sticker 
price on the window. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you learn the dealer's price? There are essentially two sources: The 
Kelly Blue Book or a service, such as Consumer Reports' New Car Price Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of the Blue Book is that it is comprehensive and can usually be 
found in any public library. You can check the invoice prices of several cars 
all at once -- and all for free. The Consumer Reports service, on the other 
hand, costs roughly $10 a car. (The price drops if you order reports on several 
cars.) 
</P>
<P>
 What this service has that the Blue Book doesn't are tips on dealing with the 
dealers and information on factory rebates. These rebates, which can range from 
a few hundred dollars to several thousand, in effect lower the dealer's cost 
below his invoice price. The Consumer Reports package also includes information 
about the costs and advisability of various factory options and option 
packages. The service can be reached at (800) 933-5555. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of organizations, such as auto clubs and credit unions, offer similar 
services, but they may be available only to members. 2. Getting pushed into a 
lease 
</P>
<P>
 A lease can be great if you're the right type of driver -- someone who drives 
only late-model cars, doesn't drive a lot and is good at math. If you drive 
cars until they expire, drive more than 15,000 miles a year and don't have a 
present-value calculator -- or a clue as to how one works -- leasing could cost 
you a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, leases are popular. They accounted for roughly 25% of the new-car 
turnover in 1993. Customers are lured into them by the promise of low monthly 
payments, but many buyers don't realize that there are several other balls in 
the air -- among them financing costs, mileage limits, wear and tear on the 
car, the lease term, the "residual" (the amount you'd pay to buy the car at the 
end of the lease) and the down payment, usually called a "capital reduction." 
</P>
<P>
 And leasing companies often require you to buy high-coverage auto insurance, 
which can add hundreds of dollars to the annual cost of the car. (See Trap No. 
6.) 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping your eye on all these variables can be difficult if you're not 
exceptionally well-prepared when you walk into the dealership. And unless 
you're planning to lease when you walk in, you're unlikely to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 If you plan to buy, don't get sidetracked into a lease. If you plan to lease, 
brush up on your algebra. You'll need it. 3. Negotiating car price and 
financing in one package 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you've got a lot of cash, you're going to need to finance the car, 
either through the dealer or a financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping for auto loan rates can be as easy as checking the newspaper, but 
many people fail to do it before they car-shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The end result is they get snookered. How? "You want a lower price? Sure," the 
dealer says. "I'll give you this $8,000 car for $7,000, with 12% financing over 
five years." 
</P>
<P>
 A great deal? Not really. Assuming you're a good credit risk, market auto loan 
rates are currently in the 8% range. That higher dealer interest rate would eat 
up any "savings" on the sale price. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the dealer's deal would cost you about $156 a month, or $9,360 
over the five years, not including tax or license fees. What if you say, "I'll 
take the $7,000 price, but I'll get my financing elsewhere?" At an 8% rate, 
you'd pay $142 a month, or $8,520 over the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say that dealers always offer bad financing rates. On the 
contrary, sometimes you can get a great deal with dealer financing, but you 
should first negotiate the car's price. Then negotiate the financing 
separately. Wrapping them together can obscure the price of one or the other, 
and that can cost you. 4. Shopping in the showroom 
</P>
<P>
 You need a new car. You want it to be red. But the model? Not so sure. So you 
decide to visit a few dealerships and shop -- just as you would for electronics 
or shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Big mistake, says Harry Snyder, co-director of Consumers Union's San Francisco 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 A car is the average consumer's second-biggest lifetime purchase, following 
only a house, he notes, and the transaction therefore warrants preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, there's plenty of material to help you prepare. Consumer Reports' 
April car-buying issue or its annual Car Buying Guide, both available in public 
libraries, can get you started. And as long as you're in the library, consult 
the newspaper files or on-line services for articles reporting J.D. Power's 
customer satisfaction ratings for various makes and models. 
</P>
<P>
 All this reading has two points. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it helps you determine which cars have good track records, reasonable 
repair and maintenance costs and hold up well in a crash. Second, your research 
can help clarify what kind of car you really need. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a family car? A pleasure vehicle? How will it serve your driving needs 
and patterns? That shiny two-door sedan may look great in the showroom and on 
the freeway, but it would be a curse with a passenger and a child seat -- or 
when it was your turn to ferry around the Little League team. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyer remorse tends to hit in the weeks following delivery, says Larry 
Peterson, president of Consumer Automotive Resource Services in Eugene, Ore. By 
then, your new car is a used car, worth thousands of dollars less than what you 
paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose a few likely models first. Then head to the showroom for a test drive. 
5. Falling in love 
</P>
<P>
 A good salesperson can see the twinkle in your eye when you're enchanted by a 
particular car, says Peterson. And that twinkle will cost you; a clever vendor 
will work on your emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd look great in this car," the dealer will say. "A lot of successful 
people buy this car. It's a sign that you've made it. A symbol of your success. 
Sure, it costs more, but most valuable things do." And off you float into 
Freeway Dreamland, where other drivers enviously eye your personalized plates 
as you pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Snap out of it! You don't need a V-6 engine in bumper-to-bumper traffic. And 
any woman who dates you for your car will dump you just as quickly when she 
finds out what the car payments are doing to your bank balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring along a reasonable friend -- one who is good at pulling you back to 
reality -- on your car-buying excursions, suggests Consumers Union's Snyder. 
Failing that, simply go for a cup of coffee before you buy,says Peterson. You 
may see the car differently if you step away for a moment. 6. Flunking the 
insurance test 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know how much more it will cost to insure a Chevrolet Camaro than a 
similarly priced Ford Taurus? Depending on your age and driving record, the 
answer may astound you, says Morey Stettner, author of "BuyerBeware: An 
Industry Insider Shows You How to Win the Insurance Game." 
</P>
<P>
 The actual cost will depend on your age, driving record and ZIP Code. But to 
get an idea, consider Sarah, a 35-year-old teacher who lives in Santa Monica. A 
standard policy with State Farm Insurance will cost her $1,624 annually on a 
new Taurus, compared to $2,668 for the Camaro -- a whopping $1,044 difference. 
If you are young and have a checkered -- or limited -- driving history or poor 
grades in school, the difference could be substantially more. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you are leasing, your leasing company may require you to carry more 
insurance, with lower deductibles, than most states' insurance laws -- or most 
moderate-income drivers -- would require. The company doesn't want to take the 
chance that you'll get in an accident and not have the money to pay for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the boosted coverage will cost more; the difference will vary 
widely with the type of car, your address and driving record. However, it's 
safe to say you could spend $200 to $1,000 more on insurance each year if you 
lease rather than buy. 7. Buying off the lot 
</P>
<P>
 Car dealers like it when you buy cars off the lot, for the simple reason that 
it reduces their inventory, which cuts their costs. And, of course, an 
immediate sale means an immediate commission, which is enough to warm any 
salesperson's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the buyer, buying off the lot can be problematic for the simplest of 
reasons: It's unlikely that the exact car you want is there, in the right color 
and with just the right options.When you buy off the lot, you usually get some 
things you don't want, and the car might be missing other options you do want. 
You can have the missing options added at the dealership, but beware: The 
warranty may not cover a dealer-added option. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, you've got to pay for all the options -- even if they weren't 
what you had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers often say they'll give you a great deal if you buy a car off the lot, 
and some do. But if the car comes loaded with a lot of unwanted options, that 
good deal still may cost hundreds of dollars more than the car you wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 If you know what you want and it's not there, keep shopping -- or order it. 
You may have to wait a while, but console yourself with the knowledge that you 
can buy something nice with the savings. 8. Loading up on options 
</P>
<P>
 Have you stopped to figure out exactly what you'd like on your car and how 
much you can afford to pay for it? That's a surprisingly important question, 
considering that the cost of a car can rise as much as 50% when it's loaded 
rather than stripped. 
</P>
<P>
 Some options -- automatic transmission, for example, or three-point seat 
restraints -- are worth having for reasons of safety, resale value and 
insurance costs, says Snyder.  
</P>
<P>
 But upgraded sound systems, special seats, alloy wheels, tinted glass and 
special coatings on the paint or seats usually don't pay off. If they mean a 
lot to you, go ahead and buy them. But realize that you're paying merely for 
your enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson suggests making a list of the options you want and things you'd buy 
if the price were right -- and then sticking to the list. 9. Buying the 
extended warranty 
</P>
<P>
 The car you buy ought to come with a good factory warranty guaranteeing that 
if anything goes wrong during the first year or two, the manufacturer will fix 
it for free, says Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Extended warranties, which cost $200 a year or more, are frequently a waste of 
money, Snyder says. They generally force you to get service at a particular 
location. They often become invalid if you fail to maintain regular 
maintenance. And if the company that provided the warranty disappears or goes 
bankrupt, there are few, if any, ways to enforce the contract. 10. Forgetting 
the mechanical check 
</P>
<P>
 If you're buying new, you don't need a mechanical check because you've got a 
warranty. But many people who buy used cars make the mistake of trusting the 
seller's assurances that the car is in good condition, says Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman recently bought a $5,000 pickup that drove like a dream at the 
dealership. The next morning, when the truck was cold, the gear shift wouldn't 
budge, Peterson says. The pickup had been "doctored" for sale -- something a 
good mechanic would have detected in a flash. The buyer hadn't checked. 
</P>
<P>
 Another serious problem with used cars is odometer tampering. That's when 
somebody turns back the mileage meter to indicate the car has been driven, say, 
40,000 miles when the real mileage is approaching 100,000. Those miles are the 
difference between buying a used car and a relic. 
</P>
<P>
 Odometer tampering can be hard to detect, but a good mechanic can give you an 
opinion as to whether the mileage reading appears to be accurate. You have to 
ask, however; it's not a standard part of a mechanical check. The Cyberspace

WILL WIRELESS LICENSE AUCTION SELL SOME INTERESTS SHORT?; TECHNOLOGY: CRITICS 
ASK WHETHER IT'S WISE TO SELL THE AIRWAVES WITHOUT SEEING WHO MIGHT BEST SERVE 
THE PUBLIC INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visions of a booming mass market in wireless communications have lured some of 
the biggest names in technology to the nation's capital this week to ante up 
millions of dollars in the government's first auction of the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Federal Communications Commission will begin soliciting bids 
for 10 nationwide licenses for a new paging technology called narrow band 
personal communications service. It will also start auctioning about 600 
licenses for a new wireless service called Interactive Video and Data Service 
(IVDS) that will allow viewers to respond to broadcast and cable programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, widely viewed as a litmus test of the value of wireless 
communications to the emerging information highway, is the first of a series of 
controversial license sales expected to generate $7 billion to $10 billion for 
the federal government over the next five years. Such sums would rival what 
Uncle Sam has raised over the past 40 years selling government offshore oil 
drilling rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow-band PCS and IVDS auctions are the forerunners for the sale next 
year of licenses for even more advanced wireless services. One is called 
broad-band PCS, a cellular phone competitor that will offer two-way voice and 
data transmission through small, lightweight transceivers. The other is 
multipoint distribution service, a cellular-style video service that can 
provide interactive TV, data transmission and telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts believe the increasingly mobile American work force -- and the 
proliferation of ever-more-powerful portable computers -- will fuel demand for 
always-in-touch communications. Clinton Administration officials, including 
Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown and Vice President Al Gore, have championed 
wireless technologies as a source of hundreds of thousands of new jobs and 
increased American competitiveness. Experts say the wireless industry will 
mushroom into a $40-billion-a-year business with more than 90 million 
subscribers by the year 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking here about actually building a fast lane on the information 
superhighway -- a technology that will be major part of the wireless networks 
of the future," said Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the FCC. "This will be the 
biggest government auction in terms of sheer revenue generated." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt added that because of special bidding incentives offered to encourage 
disadvantaged groups, the auction will also "be the single most important 
economic opportunity made available to women or minorities in our country's 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 The lofty expectations have overshadowed some critics' concerns about whether 
it is wise for the federal government to sell a public resource such as the 
airwaves to private companies without determining which provider might best 
serve the public interest -- the standard applied to broadcasters and common 
carriers such as telephone companies. Questions also have been raised about 
whether women, minorities and small businesses will genuinely be beneficiaries 
of the auction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the FCC has allocated communications licenses by lottery or by 
administrative hearings that compared competing applicants on the basis of 
ability to serve the public interest. So the prospect of an auction has not 
pleased critics who believe the Clinton Administration is looking at the FCC as 
a high-tech cash cow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the (rules) go far enough to ensure there is going to be real 
diversity of ownership," said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center 
for Media Education, a Washington, D.C. public interest group. The new wireless 
technology, he added, looks as if "it's going to end up in the hands of the 
present media industry." 
</P>
<P>
 But some would-be entrepreneurs disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Batiste, a former Washington-based investment banker, is among the nine 
minority, women and small business PCS bidders hoping to get in on the ground 
floor of the telecommunications revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this idealism that we all have -- that minorities participating in 
this capitalist system can improve their lives," he said. "You can't think you 
will be a millionaire tomorrow but it will be a great opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential payoff of wireless technology has not been lost on some of 
telecommunications' heaviest hitters, either -- companies such as Microsoft, 
AT&T, Motorola and BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
 They are bidding on licenses through subsidiaries or have formed alliances 
with many of the 29 narrow-band PCS and 472 IVDS bidders who have already 
submitted deposits to the FCC totaling $30 million. The contestants hope to add 
a new interactive dimension to TV watching as well as to transform electronic 
pagers -- now mostly identified with doctors, salespeople and drug dealers -- 
into a consumer product. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft has teamed with Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp. in 
hopes of targeting "mobile professionals" with a narrow-band PCS service that 
will offer two-way messaging to users of laptop computers and special paging 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, through its venture capital unit, has joined with Cell Net Data Systems 
of San Carlos to try and get PCS licenses for providing consumer paging as well 
as two-way communications for commercial equipment-monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents foresee the day when parents routinely use pagers to keep in touch 
with their children. Businesses might use them to lower the cost of monitoring 
everything from security systems and utility meters to vending machines and 
other devices whose status can now only be gleaned through periodic -- but 
expensive -- on-site visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pagers aren't a status symbol like cellular phones; the industry hasn't done 
a good job of marketing them as a consumer product . . ., but I think that will 
change" with the advent of competing nationwide paging systems, said Stan 
Williams, director of corporate development for New York-based CCI Data Inc., 
which plans to participate in Monday's auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrow-band PCS will improve on today's pagers by allowing them to become 
smaller and more powerful and by allowing the devices to acknowledge 
electronically that a message has been received. PCS pagers will also be able 
to send and receive data. 
</P>
<P>
 TV, too, will gain flexibility with IVDS, which uses radio waves and 
satellites to provide an electronic return path that viewers can use to respond 
to what they watch on television. The system, which will connect to TVs through 
a set-top box and display on-screen icons to prompt viewers, offers a 
rudimentary but low-cost way to provide interactive television. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the promise of the two new technologies, some experts warn of a huge 
shakeout in the wireless industry a few years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for existing paging services, they note, have already begun to decline 
in anticipation of PCS. And following a recent award of wireless services in 
Britain, one of the victors gave back its license to the government, saying the 
market was not big enough to support four players, according to Lawrence 
Hickey, an analyst at First Analysis Corp. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Once PCS is up an running in the U.S., local markets may be choked with up to 
10 wireless competitors apiece: two existing cellular phone providers, seven 
PCS providers and a new wireless mobile communications service that's being 
launched by MCI Communications Corp. and Nextel Communications Inc. of 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Lexington, Mass.-based consulting firm Mercer Management asked 
industry executives this spring how many wireless competitors each market would 
still have a decade from now, the consensus estimate was three. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of new (wireless) capacity is about to come on line, and there could be 
some fallout," said R. Preston McAfee, a University of Texas economics 
professor who is an an expert on auctions. "The key to survival of the industry 
is going to be finding new uses for" paging services. 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of the bidders contacted by The Times would comment on its 
bidding strategy, companies such as Paging Network Inc. of Dallas have 
indicated that they will be aggressive bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 The PCS bids will be entered on computer terminals and conducted in 
simultaneous multiple rounds. That means participants will have the opportunity 
to raise their initial bids in subsequent rounds or drop out of competition 
should circumstances warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 The IVDS auctions will be conducted in old-fashioned style, where participants 
shout their bids to an auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 nationwide narrow band PCS licenses are expected to fetch around $4 
million to $6 million apiece. The IVDS licenses, because they only offer 
regional coverage, will go for much less. 
</P>
<P>
 But the price of the licenses will just be the beginning of the huge capital 
expenditures that will be required to get the wireless technologies up and 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams of CCI Data Inc. said that each of the transponders required to 
gather and transmit paging signals costs more than $30,000; thousands will be 
required to provide nationwide coverage. Microsoft and MTel have estimated that 
their nationwide system will cost at least $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to be very pragmatic about this going in," said Larsh 
Johnson, vice president of product development at Cell Net Data Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his partner AT&T has deep pockets, Johnson said he has been especially 
careful to prepare himself emotionally for the auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some investors have been enamored by the media hype, but others who have been 
in the business awhile and . . . know the challenges people face," he said. "I 
know my limits; I'm not going to get swept up in the hype." Dividing the 
Airwaves 
</P>
<P>
 Radio waves of varying widths, or frequencies, are used to carry different 
kinds of communications signals, from radio and television broadcasts to 
cellular telephone calls to satellite communications. On Monday, the Federal 
Communications Commission will begin auctioning a portion of this spectrum -- 
with frequencies between 1,850 megahertz and 1,990 megahertz -- to be used for 
new telephone and paging systems known as Personal Communication Services.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: WHAT'S SIGNIFICANCE OF NEW AD RULES ON 
FUNDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're anxious to choose a high-performing mutual fund, but you're stumped by 
this type of question: 
</P>
<P>
 When three funds advertise that they're No. 1 in their class, and it's the 
same class, which do you believe?  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the answer was: all of them. That's because mutual fund 
companies had few advertising guidelines that forced apples-to-apples 
comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month approved 
new truth-in-advertising regulations that change all that. The rules set 
standard guidelines for how fund companies can advertise their rankings, among 
other things. Rankings have proliferated over the past two years as mutual 
funds have soared in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some answers to questions about the regulations and how you can use 
fund rankings to choose an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How will the new rules help me? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The rules say that if an investment company chooses to advertise its 
ranking, it must disclose who did the ranking and the criteria used. It must 
also disclose the time frame -- for example, were the funds ranked according to 
quarterly, annual or semiannual performance? It must also include how the 
advertised fund fared over one-, five- and 10-year periods, if it has been in 
business long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ranking consists of symbols, such as stars or checks, the fund company 
must say in the advertisement what they mean. For instance, a three-star 
ranking by Morningstar Mutual Funds, a noted Chicago-based fund-rating service, 
may sound good unless you know that three stars means the fund scored in the 
middle 35% of all funds ranked -- better than 32.5% of the industry but worse 
than 32.5% of it, based on performance and risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment companies cannot advertise a ranking put out by a related company. 
For instance, XYZ Mutual Funds cannot rank its own five funds, rating them 1 
through 5, and advertise these rankings. And it cannot advertise how it rates 
when ranked only by size. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if accounting for sales charges and fees would affect the ranking, 
this fact must be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why were the rules necessary? 
</P>
<P>
 A. When new fund rankings come out, investors begin to pour money into the 
top-rated funds. But many of the rankings that have been published in fund 
advertisements have been misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Los Angeles-based Pilgrim Group ran an advertisement last year 
that gave the impression that its funds ranked No. 1 through No. 5 in 1992 
performance. In fact, says Don Phillips, publisher of Morningstar, none of the 
funds ranked in the top 100 for industry performance. Pilgrim could make the 
claim by using a plethora of different rankings, sliced into narrow investment 
categories. But the only disclosure of this fact came in a footnote that said 
funds were ranked "in their category." 
</P>
<P>
 "That Pilgrim could twist its often-poor performance record to create 
marketing material that makes it look like the industry's most-successful 
manager presents an important lesson in the use and abuse of statistics in the 
fund industry today," Phillips wrote in an article about the ad, titled "Lies, 
Damn Lies, and Fund Advertisements." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim General Counsel Theodore J. Cohen says the company does not believe 
its advertisement was misleading but welcomes the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers' advertising guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Templeton Funds likes to trumpet the fact that it has the 
top-ranked global fund over the past 30 years. It's also the only U.S. global 
fund with a 30-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, advertisements noting this 30-year ranking will also note how 
Templeton's Growth Fund has fared over periods when there was competition. In 
the one-year period ended June 30, it ranked 21st of 75 funds; it was first of 
25 funds during the five years ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When do the new advertising rules go into effect and who enforces them? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The NASD will begin to review fund advertisements immediately to see if 
they comply with the new regulations, which technically are already in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an NASD spokesperson says it will take some time -- probably three to 
six months -- before all fund companies are in compliance. After that, any fund 
company that breaks the rules can be fined or kicked out of the NASD, which 
would bar the investment company from selling its shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are rankings a good way to choose a mutual fund? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Looking at how a particular fund has ranked over several periods -- 
importantly, the one-, five- and 10-year periods that now must be included in 
advertisements -- is a good way to start winnowing the choices. With more than 
5,000 funds, you could save time and energy by immediately excluding 
consistently poor performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that initial screening is done, however, these rankings become less 
important. Past returns are not a good indication of future performance. 
Indeed, a stunning short-term performance often indicates that the fund is 
taking big risks, and you are just as likely to lose big as you are to gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So what are performance statistics good for? 
</P>
<P>
 A. They're good at indicating volatility, which is the overall price swings 
both up and down. Volatility is an indication of risk. And if that's important 
to you -- as it should be -- look at annual performance for each of the last 
several years, as well as the average performance statistics that would be 
noted in ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What other factors should I consider when choosing a mutual fund? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Consider whether the fund's investment objectives mesh with yours, the 
experience and integrity of the fund manager, whether there are restrictions on 
cashing out or transferring your funds, and any other issues that may make 
investing in this particular fund more or less convenient for you personally, 
such as local offices or toll-free phone numbers.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; TOUGH ROW TO HOE; INDEPENDENT AND OUTSPOKEN HORTENSE 
MILLER, WHO HAS BEEN GARDENING ON A RUGGED LAGUNA BEACH HILLSIDE SINCE 1959, 
WONDERS WHO WILL REAP WHAT SHE HAS SOWN WHEN SHE NO LONGER CAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a teacher showing off prized student artwork on back-to-school night, 
Hortense Miller walks through her famous garden, pointing out the monstera 
deliciosa from Mexico here and the Belle of Portugal with its 50-foot long 
vines there. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's botanical oasis, which weathered fires both last year and in 1979, is 
on the steep eastern side of rugged Boat Canyon. Dubbed a "walk on the wild 
side" by Horticulture magazine, it is considered one of the best private 
gardens in America and draws visitors from around the world.  
</P>
<P>
 She began planting her garden in 1959 and has tended it every day ("a day I 
can't go outdoors is a day lost"). But at 85, Miller says she's "a little 
worried about what will happen with the garden after my death." 
</P>
<P>
 With no heirs and wanting to see her botanical legacy live on, Miller deeded 
her property to the city of Laguna Beach in 1977 -- a move that infuriated some 
of her Allview Terrace neighbors, who feared that opening the garden to public 
tours would cause traffic problems on their private street. "You would have 
thought I was opening a brothel," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deed, the city is required to maintain her property as a 
garden after she dies, "and I don't mean a kindergarten or a beer garden," 
Miller says. If they fail to uphold their end of the bargain, she says, "they 
lose it, and it would go to the Nature Conservancy." 
</P>
<P>
 In an agreement with the city, the Friends of the Hortense Miller Garden will 
maintain the garden, provided the group generates adequate funding. "But the 
future of the garden," says Friends member Pat Worthington, "really depends on 
attracting the right person to undertake the hands-on leadership role in the 
garden -- there's got to be another Hortense in the future somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's one thing Hortense does not represent, it's a committee. She is an 
extremely independent, unique individual, and her garden reflects that. So the 
Friends are going to be faced with the choice of whether to pick another very 
independent person and give them free rein -- in which case the garden will 
continue to be an individual, unique entity -- or try to run it by committee, 
in which case it will eventually be of no interest." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the former Midwestern schoolteacher -- long ago called "one 
of the great American gardeners" by House and Garden magazine -- continues 
doing what she does best: tending her sprawling garden filled with more than 
1,000 species of foreign and native plants and trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingerly descending a few steps to the second level of the garden -- past the 
Chinese jasmine and the African geraniums and the Japanese anemone -- Miller 
pauses on the narrow, mulch-topped path to admire a sprawling bougainvillea.  
</P>
<P>
 Planted 30 years ago from a one-gallon can, it now climbs halfway up a 
towering sugar gum eucalyptus tree and creeps 40 feet along the deer fence, a 
homemade affair Miller fashioned from bamboo, bender board and one-inch gas 
pipes held together with a continuous line of Manila hemp -- "That's the best 
rope there is, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who moved to Laguna in 1952, says she couldn't grow the colorful 
tropical vines in the small garden she used to have at her home north of 
Chicago. She first fell in love with bougainvillea when she and her late 
husband, Oscar, visited Mexico in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to Laguna because I wanted to be the mother of a bougainvillea," says 
Miller, gently pulling down a thorny green branch festooned with delicate, 
tissue-paper-thin red bracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like bougainvilleas better than children," she adds mischievously, a 
characteristically cheery laugh blossoming forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has the friendly yet no-nonsense demeanor of someone who spent 25 
years in classrooms, is described by friends as an independent, intelligent, 
opinionated, well-traveled, well-read woman whose knowledge of things botanical 
is no less than encyclopedic. But she has never belonged to a garden club. 
"They're too silly," she says, adding, "I've never been a joiner." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she good-naturedly says she's reached an age where people tend to 
want to hug her ("They didn't do that when I was 60; I look innocent now, I 
guess"), she's as opinionated as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her special concerns are the environment and the need to curb Earth's 
population, which has grown from less than 2 billion when she was born in 1908 
to nearly 6 billion today and is expected to triple again in the next 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in real trouble," she says. "What I object to is that they're killing 
off the country and the animals. It's going to be a dull world when it's 
nothing but us and potatoes -- potatoes because they give you the most food per 
acre of any crop." So, she adds with a laugh, "live another 50 years, and 
you're going to eat potatoes for breakfast and for lunch and for supper." 
</P>
<P>
 A chat with Miller is likely to leap from talk of a new book she's read to an 
obscure historical fact, from an anecdote from her world travels to art. 
Miller, who studied for a year at the Art Institute of Chicago, painted 
detailed watercolor still lifes of plants in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the most fascinating woman I have ever met," says Ginny Worthington, an 
amateur gardener who met Miller in the early '70s and founded the Friends of 
the Hortense Miller Garden in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing age keeps Miller from doing much physical labor in her garden, which 
has more than 400 steps and numerous paths zigzagging across the lush hillside. 
She pays two gardeners to work 10 hours a week, but that doesn't mean she 
doesn't still get into the garden up to three times a day, cleaning up and 
feeding a pair of ravens that drop by every afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just amazed at how much work she actually does in the garden," says Debra 
Raeber, a member of the friends group who helps out in the garden from time to 
time. "We walk around the garden, and the next thing I know she's pulling weeds 
or has her arms full of branches. I don't know many other 85-year-olds with so 
much energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also has a symbiotic relationship with the critters that show up in her 
garden. She used to feed the gray foxes that appeared outside her bedroom every 
night. She also has to keep a watch out for occasional rattlesnakes. One recent 
evening she nearly stepped on a rattler that had found its way into her living 
room. But she remained unfazed: She calmly put a metal wastebasket over the 
snake, then slipped a cookie sheet underneath it and let the uninvited visitor 
go at the northern end of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 To know the real Hortense Miller, advises one friend, read "The Garden 
Writings of Hortense Miller," a paperback anthology of articles she has written 
for the group's quarterly newsletter.  
</P>
<P>
 The paperback book, which is sold by the organization, is akin to Henry David 
Thoreau's "Walden": Miller's ongoing observations on the plants, animals and 
doings in the garden over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller made her national writing debut in 1992, artfully describing her garden 
in an issue of Fine Gardening and amazing the magazine's editors with her 
distinctive literary voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Her evocative prose -- "When the fog is low, it comes up the canyon like a 
snake following its curves" -- is as opinionated and entertaining as her 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 A wry sense of humor, undoubtedly abetted by a lifetime of reading her 
favorite author, Mark Twain, runs through Miller's writing like the blue 
morning glories that lace through her favorite bougainvillea: "A garden without 
animals is like a florist's refrigerator," and, "People can't imagine that what 
they buy in a gallon pot can cover a wall, grow two stories high, cover a 
hillside." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller hasn't owned a TV -- "I'd get mad spending a half-hour looking at that 
slop" -- or even a radio in 35 years, preferring to spend her evenings reading. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the books in the floor-to-ceiling bookcase in her living room are 
on gardening. The other half -- and those in another bulging bookcase in her 
bedroom -- are filled with an eclectic assortment of novels and nonfiction. 
She's currently reading "Reflections of an Evolutionary Biologist" by John 
Tyler Bonner, "The Dictionary of Accepted Ideas" by Gustave Flaubert and an 
anthology of the writings of Dorothy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading and the garden have been the most important things to me," Miller 
said. But there's no question which receives the priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The garden has won," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's sprawling garden represents the fulfillment of a lifelong dream 
nurtured during a childhood in St. Louis, where she grew up in a two-family 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family had only a tiny, back-yard garden where, she recalled, they grew 
day lilies, irises and pansies. But she also remembers picking violets and 
spring beauties that grew wild in the park down the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family had room for a larger garden when they moved to a house in the 
suburbs when she was a teen-ager. "The garden was full of plum trees that were 
wonderful in the spring. I just hated to go to school that first week in April; 
the garden was just all white plum blossoms." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was her father's garden. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until she married husband Oscar, a Chicago lawyer, that she was able 
to have a garden in the lot adjoining their house, but the cold northern 
Illinois weather appealed to neither her nor her plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn by the mild climate and the lure of having a "year-round garden," the 
Millers moved to Laguna Beach in 1952 after he retired. During their first 
seven years in Laguna, they lived in a house with a garden only large enough 
for her to putter in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they bought the spacious lot overlooking Boat Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers had the house built with a garden in mind, with overhangs and 
trellises for dozens of vines. The house itself -- a classic '50s modern design 
with lots of glass, brick and a wrap-around deck overlooking the garden -- 
gives the impression of being in a treehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardening quickly became the focal point of Miller's life: Her husband died a 
month after they moved and, she recalled, "I just had this garden. It was an 
enormous toy. I was just delighted with it." 
</P>
<P>
 With help from her gardener, she began by planting next to the house, then 
gradually moved down the hillside covered with thick coastal sagebrush. She was 
undaunted by the steep lay of the land. "It makes the garden more interesting," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than keeping the garden in tune with its canyon locale and free of 
"marble statues and balustrades," Miller insists she had no grand design in 
mind when she began planting. 
</P>
<P>
 That's still her philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't make any plans," she says. "I just buy something and walk around and 
look for a place to stick it. And if it doesn't do, I put something else in. I 
like anything that takes care of itself and just grows. I don't like to have to 
coddle them and beg them and watch them and compliment them and urge them to 
grow." 
</P>
<P>
 House and Garden was the first national magazine to discover Miller's garden 
in 1965, calling it an "intensely personal garden" and a "portrait of 
horticultural excellence." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, it has been featured in numerous magazines and newspapers and 
a handful of books: It was one of only three gardens west of the Mississippi 
mentioned in Ronald King's "The Quest for Paradise, a History of the World's 
Gardens" and is featured in "Beautiful Gardens" by Eric Johnson and Scott 
Millard, "America's Great Private Gardens" by Stanley Schuler and "Visions of 
Paradise" by Marina Schinz.  
</P>
<P>
 Early on, the garden began attracting visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she deeded her property to the city in 1977, tours arranged through the 
city's Recreation Department have been conducted by members of the friends 
group on Tuesdays through Saturdays. Still the teacher, Miller always joins the 
tours. "You know, if you've got an audience, you talk," she says. She also 
leads occasional tours on her own. "Yesterday I had two people from Houston. 
They called me up and I said, 'Yes, come.' Delightful people." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, however, downplays her role in creating her acclaimed garden.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't create it," she quickly counters. "I buy plants, and I put them in 
the ground. and they grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, it is suggested, it would be more appropriate to say she instigated 
the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," she says, "I did have art training, and maybe I placed things right, 
and if they grow, I don't interfere with them. They know what they're doing at 
least as well as I know what I'm doing. Most people want to be boss in the 
garden, but I don't. And this garden's too big for me to boss." 
</P>
<P>
 For a time last October, the boss was a wind-whipped brush fire that roared 
down the canyon, burning the sagebrush at the bottom of the garden and a number 
of trees before firemen stopped it. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden was less fortunate in 1979 when a brush fire destroyed most of it. 
Within four years, however, it had grown back and, she said, "looked the same 
as ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Had the recent fire taken her house, Miller said she would have walked away. 
She said she's too old to rebuild and start over. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Miller can imagine life without her garden.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it would knock me out," she said. "It's the one thing that I want. The 
canyon with no people in it, the loneliness is delightful. And it's quiet. I 
don't like noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Docent-led tours are held Tuesday through Saturday at the Hortense Miller 
Garden, Laguna Beach. For reservations and information, call (714) 497-3311, 
Ext. 426.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: CAMPAIGN '94: MUCH ADO ABOUT PRACTICALLY NOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, Robin Abcarian's column is published Wednesdays and Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say, have you heard people talking about the tough-talking former Marine and 
the steely grandmother with a heart? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not the latest thriller to hit the big screen. It's not that trashy 
bestseller everyone's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the race for California governor. 
</P>
<P>
 And everywhere you go, nobody is talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess that's because most people don't vote, and those of us who do have 
already made up our minds about who we want for governor. The polls show that. 
They also show that the voters capable of swaying the election will come from a 
narrow category: disaffected Democrats and Republicans who are willing to 
switch allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a relatively small number of people will likely determine in November 
whether Pete Wilson gets yet another term or the state gets yet another Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 With two moderate candidates trying like mad to distinguish themselves for the 
disgruntled few, the fight turns on nuances, personalities and who can make the 
most ado about nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Political campaigns seem to get more and more insulting to the voters' 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Has a political commercial ever really changed your mind on an issue or a 
candidate? 
</P>
<P>
 If you are an engaged voter, you can't help but watch them believing -- or at 
least hoping -- they are not intended for you. It's not just that they are made 
for the undecided or the uninformed. They seem to be made for morons. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issues are far too complicated to distill. So from both sides, we get 
sweeping generalities and unprovable assertions, and the truth ends up more 
twisted than quake-ravaged rebar. 
</P>
<P>
 A "tax cut for the rich" accusation leveled by one candidate at another turns 
out to be a failure to extend a temporary tax increase after the end of 1995. 
It's too complicated to explain, really, so why bother? 
</P>
<P>
 And black-and-white footage of people streaming across a border is supposed to 
convince us not that the impoverished will risk their lives for work -- that's 
what I think every time I see it -- but that the opposing candidate is soft on 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, the only aspect of this election season that promises to provide any 
fun is the slugfest being waged by our candidates for U.S. Senate. Or by one of 
them anyway. I wouldn't mind reading about more stupid candidate tricks, which 
Michael Huffington is pioneering as an election tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in Washington, Huffington crashed a small, private Democratic 
fund-raiser -- after alerting the press, naturally -- in order to accuse his 
opponent, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and her hostess of misrepresenting his 
positions. Where did they do this? On the party invitations.  
</P>
<P>
 Hey, why deal with the issues that people really care about when creating 
meaningless confrontations is so much easier? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the watchdogs of government -- that would be us -- are to blame for 
allowing the candidates to exploit non-critical issues. In the absence of major 
ideological differences, we tend to blow the minor ones out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's our fault the Wilson camp is so devoted to flaying Kathleen Brown 
for having moral qualms over the death penalty. Brown says she will enforce the 
law, she says she will appoint judges who will uphold the death penalty. So why 
is this an issue? 
</P>
<P>
 It's grossly unfair for Wilson to harp on the pangs of conscience experienced 
by Brown's father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, when he weighed the fate of Death Row 
prisoners during his term of office. Pat Brown sent 36 prisoners to the gas 
chamber and granted clemency to 23. That's a lot of death on any man's hands. 
No wonder he tried to abolish the death penalty. He had more firsthand 
experience with it than almost anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 And, frankly, I'm more comfortable with the notion of a chief executive who 
expresses ethical misgivings over killing criminals than with one who blithely 
states -- as Wilson does -- that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime in 
the absence of any hard proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has sent only one man to the gas chamber since he took office in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the resurrection of the death penalty has done nothing to solve the 
big problems we face. It doesn't improve schools, it doesn't keep libraries 
open, get people off welfare, bring back jobs or make streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a crowd pleaser, though. Much ado about practically nothing.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; CONNOISSEURS OF HEIRLOOM FURNITURE CLAMOR FOR HIS 
CREATIONS. THE STATE CLAMORS TO MOVE HIS RAMBLING, TREASURE-FILLED HOME TO MAKE 
WAY FOR A FREEWAY. BUT SAM MALOOF REMAINS SERENE AMID A CHANGING WORLD.; A MAN 
OF THE WOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not far from the Alta Loma lemon grove harboring Sam Maloof's home and 
workshop, a shiny city sign proclaims Maloof Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The street wasn't named for Sam, who is merely the region's, and the world's, 
best-known woodworker. It honors, rather, a distant relative who earned his 
fortune selling cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Southern California's autopia is finally losing patience with the 
woodworker, who by most indications is woefully out of step with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, where developers can level a citrus grove and toss up a thousand-unit 
"community" quicker than a tree trunk adds a ring, Maloof has worked for four 
decades on a single, rambling home. 
</P>
<P>
 And that home stands squarely in the way of commuters restless to sprint from 
San Dimas to San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, wide scabs of tumbleweed-strewn, freeway-ready landscape already rip 
right up to an island of trees surrounding Maloof's place. You can almost hear 
the honk of a million horns demanding that this stretch of the Foothill Freeway 
go through. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sam Maloof is not a man to be rushed. Nor one to let eight lanes of 
concrete and Bott's Dots destroy his serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 For 45 years, Maloof has earned his living by creating furniture that pushes 
hard against that snooty line segregating craft from fine art. From the first 
chairs he chiseled, glued and clamped in the garage of a small Ontario tract 
house, the evolution of Maloof's designs has been slow and subtle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not overwhelmed," Jonathan Fairbanks, a curator at the Museum of Fine 
Arts, Boston, wrote of his first encounter with Maloof's furniture, at a New 
York exhibition in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 In this age of artistic mega-extravaganzas and superduper-stars, that sounds 
like a slam. It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks' introduction to Maloof's 1983 book, "Sam Maloof, Woodworker" 
(Kodansha International), goes on to extol "the authority and intensity" of the 
artisan's designs, while providing descriptions that other critics echo: Quiet 
. Sensitive . Serious . Spare . Graceful . Timeless . 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture companies eager to mass-produce his designs have offered Maloof 
contracts that would have earned him millions. He turns them down. With the 
help of three assistants, he chips away at a 500-order waiting list, crafting 
50 to 60 pieces a year -- less than a small factory might do in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've taken a very plodding course," the 78-year-old craftsman says in a voice 
as warm as well-polished walnut. "I've never been interested in fads. A lot of 
young woodworkers are very, very good. The sophistication and craftsmanship in 
what they do is amazing. But a lot of the work seems not to have soul." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hand-carved sign that marks Sam and Freda Maloof's place is weathered and 
hard to spot in a forest of shrubs. Visitors who drive past find themselves 
wandering through the cultural context that has swallowed up the Maloofs' 
incongruous habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles to the east, ghost town-like relics emerge from the smog. 
Boarded-up stores and gas stations built from river rock are scattered among 
neighborhoods where rusted cars litter yards overgrown with brittle weeds. Keep 
going and the graffiti starts. Drugs are dealt. Hookers stroll in the midday 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 In other directions, the same rocky soil optimistically sprouts baby boom 
towns. Precisely landscaped streets link look-alike tracts to the sustaining 
In-N-Out-Soup Plantation-Kragan-Payless-Petco-Blockbuster-Chuck E. 
Cheese's-Wienerschnitzel-Nurseryland-McDonald's-Daily Donuts-PIP-U.S. 
Nails-Wherehouse-Play Co.-Spires-Auto Express-Mervyn's-Chili's-Pep Boys sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheel into Maloof's brick and concrete driveway, though, and Southern 
California's Juiced-up, World-Cupped, flesh-eating, yammering boom of 
hyperbolized banality is left snapping at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Abruptly, the second hand on a watch seems to spin more slowly. A thick canopy 
of olive and avocado leaves caresses the car, cooling and oxygenating the air. 
A whiff of citrus brings back another California, calming jangled nerves like a 
pleasant, post-nap yawn.  
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere deep in the lemon grove, a mockingbird yaks. Then, the soft 
chip-chip-chip of a chisel cutting hardwood leads a visitor through one of 
several big wooden doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside his workshop, Maloof sits with his legs splayed on the concrete floor, 
tinkering with a troublesome joint in a Zircote wood rocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Gnarled and missing the tip of an index finger, Maloof's thick hands look as 
if they could squeeze syrup from a hunk of maple. But his firm handshake is as 
gentle as the brown eyes gleaming behind thick-lensed bifocals. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes interrupting his work to show a stranger around seem like the 
greatest pleasure he's had in weeks -- although admirers from Presidents to 
Nobel laureates drop by virtually every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Simon Rodia's towers in Watts, Maloof's home is a monument to the 
creative impulse. Unlike those towers, which seem to reflect a reckless 
scramble for the sky, Maloof's home clings respectfully to the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, its totality is impossible to grasp. What's clear is that 
the conglomeration of living space, workshops and studios have spread through 
the grove with the slow, organic aesthetics of a tree. A growing limb took an 
odd twist. Maloof sculpted an exterior post to mimic it. Where roots surface, 
walks rise in response. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, big windows draw in the surrounding jungle and douse the warm redwood 
walls with cool light filtered through leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was going to be a studio, then I decided to make a house of it," Maloof 
says, gesturing to a kitchen with cabinets and counters of mahogany, maple, 
walnut and a rock-hard wood called apitone, which a friend salvaged from 
packing crates and Maloof couldn't bring himself to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," he continues, stepping into another room, "I had to put a new roof on, 
so I decided to build an upstairs." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the tour goes. As the house spills from one room to the next, artistic 
surprises appear at every turn -- from boldly dovetailed window frames to the 
intricately carved latches and knobs Maloof has put on massive sculpted doors 
and hollow Home Depot doors alike. Then there's the hand-cut staircase that 
spirals up to a gallery-like loft. 
</P>
<P>
 Even standing still, a visitor finds it difficult to focus on one thing for 
long. Turn a corner and a bronze hand protrudes from a corkwood wall, 
mechanical wooden toys adorn coffee tables, mobiles of bleached bones dangle in 
alcoves, intricate Native American baskets hover in the rafters, kachina dolls 
float on a blue wall, and African weavings share space with Freda's paintings 
of Hopi dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest presence in any room, though, is Maloof's own work -- tables, 
cradles, chests of drawers, settees. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In one upstairs space, the craftsman nudges a rocker made of Makassar ebony, 
and it's off and endlessly rocking, rocking, rocking in perfect balance on a 
polished walnut floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think wood is the most sensuous material to work with," Maloof says. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam's furniture," Fairbanks wrote in "Woodworker," "embodies intangible 
qualities that transcend the sensory delights of sight and touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ela, director of Los Angeles' Craft and Folk Art Museum, takes a 
similar view. "There's a universality about Sam's work," he says, "an honesty 
about the way he uses materials and the way he communicates." 
</P>
<P>
 That honesty gets its fullest expression in Sam and Freda's home, says Ela, 
whose museum will host a major Maloof retrospective in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a calm and spirituality that make it like an oasis. Anyone who goes 
there is refreshed and moved. . . . His home is a wonderful testament to how 
you can live life in a meaningful way by being true to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Lebanese immigrants, Maloof lived in several Southern California 
towns with his parents and eight siblings before they settled into a small 
house in Ontario. By all accounts, Maloof's tight-knit clan generated 
sufficient warmth to embrace any neighbors who might be lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 From an early age, Maloof was the kid to call for wooden toys and intricate 
dollhouse furniture, and his family still uses the plywood-and-dowel spatula he 
built, at age 10, for turning loaves of Lebanese bread.  
</P>
<P>
 Maloof never attended college. Except for a high school woodworking course -- 
which he failed because he couldn't afford the wood, he says -- his craft and 
design skills are entirely self-taught. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam and Freda met in 1947, when he was working as a graphics art apprentice to 
the painter Millard Sheets and she was about to enroll in a master's program at 
Claremont's Scripps College, where Sheets taught.  
</P>
<P>
 As Freda tells the story, they spotted each other simultaneously across a 
crowded quad, and she wove her way through the throng to say hello. 
</P>
<P>
 Her blue eyes fix flirtatiously on her husband as he continues: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've often asked her, 'How come you walked through that whole crowd to talk 
to me?' She always answers, 'If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you.' And 
she never has." 
</P>
<P>
 What Sam found in Freda, besides talent and beauty, he says, was the deep 
moral support he needed to finally try to make a living at the craft he loved. 
She kept him on track when the rewards for his craftsmanship were slim. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, though, word of mouth drew admirers. Now, most major art museums 
have displayed Maloof's work -- and some, including the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art, let patrons plop down on it. 
</P>
<P>
 A Maloof rocker was the first piece of furniture to become part of the 
official White House art collection -- he has a photo of Ronald Reagan rocking 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another photograph shows Jimmy Carter standing behind a Maloof chair, upon 
which Rosalynn and a grandchild sit. Carter, who has been to the Maloofs' for 
dinner, signed another photo: "To my woodworking hero." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become good friends," Maloof says.  
</P>
<P>
 Maloof's list of honors spans five decades: National Endowment for the Arts 
grants, an American Craft Council gold medal, recognition from the Kahlil 
Gibran Foundation. In 1985 the MacArthur Foundation gave him one of its 
"genius" awards -- $375,000 in his case. 
</P>
<P>
 Maloof recalls how later that year he balked at the door of the auditorium 
where he was to speak to the physicists, renowned poets and learned scholars 
attending a conference of MacArthur fellows.  
</P>
<P>
 Freda, he says, listened to his fears, then tore his prepared speech to 
shreds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll bet not one of these people can make a chair," she snapped. "Just get up 
and talk about what you do." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech was such a hit he gave a command performance, Maloof says, his 
voice tinged with both humility and pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Maloof yarn puts his sense of self in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 One day he was giving one of his standard lectures to a group of woodworkers. 
"There is a communion," he said, "between an object maker and the material he 
is working with. And there is a triune between the object maker, his material 
and his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then," Maloof continued, "there is something much greater, that 
transcends into God the creator of all things, who uses our hands as his tools 
to make these beautiful objects." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Maloof says, a man in the audience fired up his hand and 
shouted, "Sam, you're all wet. God doesn't have anything to do with it. You're 
the creator!"  
</P>
<P>
 Maloof laughed. But he held his humble ground. "I respectfully disagree," he 
said. With typical directness, Maloof sums up his thoughts on the matter: "Ego 
destroys." 
</P>
<P>
 Such modesty creates a void into which praise naturally flows. 
</P>
<P>
 A UPI columnist called him "the poet of the bandsaw."  
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Globe spoke of the strength, lyricism and "almost mystical 
simplicity" in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 People magazine labeled Maloof "a Hemingway in hardwood" and quoted a curator 
at the Smithsonian on his appeal: "With every piece they purchase, people feel 
they've collected Sam as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling, Maloof says, is mutual. He counts most of his clients as friends, 
and in some cases the relationships have gone on for generations, with the 
children and grandchildren of original clients now commissioning work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the start, Maloof was uncomfortable charging the "obscene" amount of 
$35 for a chair, he says. It has been up to Freda to keep his generosity under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Freda works in an office off the kitchen, shuffling through the 
correspondence and orders that conceal two walnut tables. Maloof stopped 
accepting down payments long ago. "It put too much pressure on me," he says. 
Today, the price for a basic rocker is about $12,000, with some pieces going 
for $30,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, as Maloof reports with mild amazement, a table that originally 
fetched $900, with a set of 10 $250 chairs, is rumored to have just sold at 
auction for $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lynch, whose success as a manager of Fidelity's massive Magellan mutual 
fund made him an Ultimate Master of the Wall Street Universe, has several 
Maloof pieces among the Chippendale, Hepplewhite and Queen Anne furniture in 
his Marblehead, Mass., home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynch leaves no doubt that the investment value of Maloof's work is far 
less important than the human qualities and the friendship it represents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam's not what you'd expect," Lynch says. "He's so down to earth . . . so 
enthusiastic. My goodness, on a scale of 1 to 10, he's about a 303. Whenever 
you talk to him or Freda, you feel better. . . . Sam's a throwback to another 
century." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from past interviews, Maloof has polished and refined his thoughts 
over the years, but his core philosophy remains essentially the same -- 
especially now, as he continues in physical therapy to recover from a heart 
attack four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "My woodwork is very important to me, but it certainly doesn't take the place 
of my family or my friends," says Maloof, whose son lives with his family on 
the property and whose daughter lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always seek material security. But I think that if they found 
spiritual security, everything else would fall in place." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A few years after Maloof won the MacArthur, author Denise Shekerjian wrote an 
exploration of creativity titled "Uncommon Genius -- How Great Ideas Are Born" 
(Penguin, 1991). The book examined the work of 40 scientists, artists, 
activists, writers and thinkers of big thoughts, among them John Ashbery, 
Joseph Brodsky, Henry Louis Gates, Stephen Jay Gould -- and Maloof.  
</P>
<P>
 In his signed copy, Maloof -- the only designer to receive a MacArthur -- has 
underlined several of Shekerjian's ruminations, including this one: 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do people turn for the courage to run along ahead of the others or to 
lag behind awhile to look more closely at something while the masses skip on, 
blithely, contentedly?" 
</P>
<P>
 Maloof is neither purist nor ascetic. Seated at a local chain restaurant, he 
lavishes passionate attention on a gooey barbecue beef sandwich, remaining 
oblivious to the fake wood table under his plate. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a new Infiniti in his garage. And Freda has one too. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, by all indications, Maloof's genius -- and it has been called that -- 
stems from his courage to set his own pace, from his rootedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when he and Freda returned from a trip, she pointed out a eucalyptus 
stump whose roots had been exposed by a storm. People had often told Maloof 
that his pedestal tables "looked as if they had grown right out of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
 In the tree's roots, he now saw the unconscious blueprint of his design. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, as they walked in a grove near Santa Barbara, their daughter 
held up a eucalyptus seed: "Dad," she said, "look at God's sculpture." 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, he writes: "I believe no man has ever designed anything that 
approaches the complexity of the simplest flower or the grandeur of a great 
redwood tree." 
</P>
<P>
 That connection to nature makes his imminent uprooting by a freeway all the 
more wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, as Caltrans accelerated its four-decades-old plan to complete a route 
along the San Gabriel foothills, architects declared Maloof's six-acre spread 
eligible for the National Registry of Historic Places.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindell Marsh -- an attorney who usually litigates for endangered species with 
wings, fins or fur -- began working to see what could be done to save Maloof's 
life's work. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation explored the possibility of routing 
around the house, of building a bridge over it or of tunneling underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 After long discussion, Maloof has tentatively agreed to let the powers that be 
pick up his house and move it -- lock, stock and spiral staircase -- to another 
lemon grove nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 As a Caltrans environmental planner puts it, "that is not going to be an 
inexpensive thing to do." It is, however, a solution he can live with, Maloof 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 One muggy day, he and a potter friend of 40 years drove to check out one 
possible site. Standing on the edge of a ravine where rocks have spilled down 
from Cucamonga Peak for eons, he points with enthusiasm at native walnut and a 
scraggly eucalyptus that will offer shade.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, it looks as if the old house and workshop will be turned 
into a cultural center, and Maloof will build another home on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll design it," he says, eyes lighting up. "Even at my age, I'm quite 
excited about going out on an adventure like this, incorporating a lot of ideas 
I have." 
</P>
<P>
 On the ride home, Maloof points out all the orchards and chicken ranches that 
became housing tracts; the vineyards that became strip malls. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he steps into his driveway, he's again pondering the less cheerful 
side of change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an awful trauma," he says of his confrontation with the freeway. 
"I've known about it for some years, hoping it would just go away. Now I've 
resigned myself to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this," he says, gesturing to a gate with intricately carved redwood 
facade, "is a hand-built house. So there's a bit of me in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the trees a crow squawks. Leaves rustle. The sound of a wind chime 
mixes with the ecstatic chatter of a rain bird. 
</P>
<P>
 A landscape architect, Maloof says, is studying the possibility of relocating 
the flora that is integral to his home's design. But some of the trees are just 
too big and old to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 He points up through the foliage to a towering sycamore, with limbs as thick 
as his own barrel chest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty years ago, I dug a sapling out of the wash during a storm," he says. 
"It was the size of my little finger. Look at it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more impressive is the avocado tree, a huge meandering hunk of living 
wood, with branches that reach out and stroke the house. That tree, Sam says, 
is the reason he bought the place. A limb that cracked off in a storm, he says, 
is now a ceiling beam. 
</P>
<P>
 In the epilogue of "Sam Maloof, Woodworker," Maloof talks about the cyclical 
aspect of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of me goes with each piece that I make; how good it is that in making 
each new piece a renewal takes place. So it continues: a renewal in my 
commitment to my work and to what I believe." 
</P>
<P>
 When the house is finally moved, and the chain saw crew steps in, the sawyers 
may want to pause, to think for a moment about Maloof's priorities, so 
anachronistic to the times. The final photograph in Maloof's book, after all, 
is not of a table, or cradle, or music stand or of Sam. It's a full page, full 
color shot of that avocado tree's ancient and magnificent trunk. Sam Maloof 
Age: 78 
</P>
<P>
 Native: Yes. Born in Chino, lives in Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married for 47 years to Freda Maloof. Two grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Family, friends and wood, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 On his work: "Each time a piece goes out, I start on a new piece, so there is 
renewal after renewal. It's like picking a flower: Each time you pick one, a 
new one blooms." 
</P>
<P>
 On retiring: "My son and the fellows who work for me will eventually take over 
the shop. But I'm not going to retire, and I'll have to live to be a 100 to 
finish everything. I still get as much of a kick going into my shop each 
morning as I did 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 On "trade secrets": "It upsets me terribly when I hear of craftsmen saying, 'I 
can't tell you because it is a secret.' I do not have any such precious 
secrets. What I know is available for the asking. If nothing else, sharing my 
experience and knowledge may save a struggling craftsman hours of frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 On sharing: "If you do not give of yourself, then you gain nothing. . . . I 
mean the spiritual giving. I have tried to do this. Perhaps I have succeeded, 
perhaps not, though I hope that I have."

FIELD OF DREAMS; OFFICER HELPS COMMUNITY REALIZE GOAL FOR A LOT TO BLOOM WITH 
SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wearing an uneasy smile and a corsage on her blue uniform, Officer Amanda 
Serrano waved politely when the crowd cheered her name, but it was obvious she 
wasn't caught up in the day's festivities to honor the opening of a Westlake 
youth soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just too nervous," the Los Angeles police officer said while watching 
scores of gleeful children romp across the field during the July 15 event. 
"This is our baby. I want everything to be just right." 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of the field atop a lot that had sat vacant for 14 years is being 
hailed by locals as a model of what can be done when private businesses, 
residents and the government work together. 
</P>
<P>
 And Serrano, they say, was right in the middle making things happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the catalyst," said Paul Gamberg, president of a neighborhood 
association. "She was a fulcrum, a physical lever that made this happen . . . 
she reached out and picked the team that put this together. The quality of 
leadership that Mandy has is intention without reservation. She was a 
people-mover." 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano said residents had often told her that a field was needed to provide 
some recreation outlet for the children who live in the densely populated area. 
The closest park is three miles away, and many families don't have access to 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 When some locals suggested the site at 3rd and Bixel streets -- a lot known 
years ago as Crown Hill that had become the site for homeless encampments -- 
Serrano started knocking on doors and making phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ketchum Downtown YMCA was looking for a place to put a field, and it 
enlisted in the effort. Soon, Cathay City Development, the Hong Kong-based 
owners of the lot, were being called upon to temporarily donate the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year's worth of legwork, the "Field of Dreams" organizers persuaded 
Cathay to let the parcel be converted into a soccer field until a development 
project comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people came together to make this happen," Serrano said. "I helped, 
but I certainly wasn't the only one." 
</P>
<P>
 For Serrano, the field is not just a playground, it's a haven. "The kids 
around here play soccer in the streets, and that's a prescription for trouble. 
It's a real simple formula." 
</P>
<P>
 The streets hold other dangers for youngsters, she said. The field will offer 
organized soccer leagues and lessons by October, after-school options that 
might keep some youths from finding their way into trouble with gangs or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano, a four-year officer of the Rampart Division, is assigned to the 
department's Police Assisted Community Enhancement program. She and seven other 
senior lead officers in the division work closely with the community to find 
long-term answers to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approach is to identify potential problems before they occur and find 
ways to get to the root of problems that already exist," said Sgt. Ralph 
McComb, Serrano's former supervisor who attended the soccer field opening. 
"With this project, she turned this trash heap place into something the 
community could be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 The field was just the first phase of Serrano's plan for the neighborhood, 
which she describes as a troubled area with "dedicated, energetic residents 
that have a strong sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
 She also hopes to see a building being vacated by the Chamber of Commerce turn 
into a youth center by the end of the year. The office building, just a block 
away from the new soccer field, has a sprawling kitchen and indoor and outdoor 
dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The site would be perfect for a community center to give area youths a place 
to study arts and crafts, get tutoring and even learn about photography in a 
planned photo darkroom. "It's almost a done deal," Serrano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge native left a career in banking to become a policewoman six 
years ago because she wanted to help children, she said. She hopes to someday 
become a child-abuse investigator, but in the meantime she said she will enjoy 
her community policing post's challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the advantages of my type of assignment is I don't just meet people 
who are suspects and victims. I get to encounter people in positive ways," 
Serrano said. "And it's rewarding when things get done."

DOCTOR ALLEGES BIAS IN LAWSUIT AGAINST HOSPITAL; MEDICINE: THE FORMER HEAD OF 
THE NEPHROLOGY DIVISION AT KING-DREW MEDICAL CENTER SAYS AGE AND RACE 
DISCRIMINATION PROMPTED HIS OUSTER. THREE OTHER DOCTORS HAVE FILED SIMILAR 
SUITS AGAINST THE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 17 years, Dr. Roman Patel headed the nephrology division at Martin Luther 
King-Drew Medical Center, believing he was doing a competent job. So when he 
said he was told he would be replaced in his post, he was baffled. 
</P>
<P>
 Befuddlement turned to anger and Patel filed a lawsuit July 14 against the 
hospital, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science and the dean of 
the medical college, alleging that he was wrongly removed from his post. Patel, 
59, charges in his Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit that hospital officials 
acted out of racial and age bias and violated his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said they could not respond to the charges because they had 
not been served with any papers regarding Patel's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel's suit is among four recent claims against the institution alleging 
discrimination. In January, Dr. William Shoemaker, 71, chairman of King-Drew's 
emergency department, sued the hospital, claiming he was unfairly reassigned 
because of race and age bias. Suits by two other doctors also allege race 
discrimination. Patel is East Indian, while two of the other doctors are white 
and one is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the three lawsuits are pending in Superior Court; the third is on 
appeal. The hospital denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel, who assumed his post in 1975, claimed that he was removed in July, 
1992, "with no allegation of misfeasance or misconduct. (Patel) was simply told 
that he would be removed in favor of another individual," his suit states. 
Patel's suit also says that he was forced to transfer to another department to 
escape the humiliation his removal caused. Dr. Harry Ward has been chief of the 
nephrology division since July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel is seeking lost wages and benefits and unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not be reached for comment regarding the lawsuit or his status at the 
hospital. His attorney, Marcia Vincent of Newport Beach, refused to comment, 
stating that it was premature to discuss the case since not all of the 
defendants have been notified of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Joe Duff, legal adviser for the medical college, said Patel's 
personnel records list him as being on medical leave without pay since January, 
1993. There is no indication in Patel's personnel records that he was removed 
from his position, Duff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel records also show that Patel worked in internal medicine and family 
medicine, two specialty areas at the hospital, Duff said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Patel claimed that he was not considered for the hospital post 
of chair of the department of medicine after serving as interim chairman from 
1989 to 1991 and receiving "outstanding" performance ratings. Duff said Patel 
served in the post from late 1989 to October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, Patel claims, younger, less experienced black doctors got the 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having someone younger than you get a job doesn't prove age discrimination," 
Duff said. "We're prohibited from discriminating intentionally on the basis of 
age." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Typically what happens is that somebody serves as interim chair 
while officials search for a permanent chair. Being interim chair doesn't give 
you special standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. A. Paul Kelly, who had served as interim chair of the same post in 1986, 
was appointed department chair instead of Patel, Duff said.  
</P>
<P>
 Patel's suit against the hospital also claims that he was being paid less than 
younger, less experienced doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Duff said that allegation was unfounded: "Chairs get a supplement to their 
salary, what we would call an administrative supplement. (Patel) also got a 
bonus (when he was chair) too."

<P>
 Call him the Pied Piper of South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Arrington, 40, is tooting his horn and banging his drums to lead local 
disadvantaged youths away from the "rats" of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Through World Flaggs USA, a nonprofit music and education program Arrington 
founded two years ago from the ashes of the Crenshaw district computer business 
he lost in the riots, Arrington hopes to one day produce a 300-unit 
drum-and-bugle corps consisting of children from inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is necessary to keep the children's time constructive rather than 
them becoming professional spray-painters or gang members," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the assistance of the property owner and various corporate sponsors, 
Arrington took one year to refurbish the once abandoned office building at 6519 
S. Vermont Ave. where he now runs World Flaggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this month, Arrington has gathered about 50 6- to 12-year-olds at 
Budlong Elementary School, where they practice drumming, bugling and marching 
for two to four hours, three days a week. The instruction is free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this because I like to experience more things as I grow up," said 
Nicolas Smith, 9, a member of the horn section. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn how to do stuff like this because when I grow up, I can go on 
talent shows," said his twin, Nicole, who also wants to become a bugler. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no horns. No drums. And no uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the drummers pound their drumsticks on slabs of wood stacked on milk 
crates. The buglers blow air out of mouthpieces and the color guard marches 
around the blacktop with flagless wooden poles. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I'm hollering for help," Arrington said. "If we can get the money 
and equipment we need, we can make it from there. It's getting to the point 
where I don't have that much time to instruct the kids because I'm trying to 
pull enough money to keep the program going." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the property owner's help, World Flaggs is two months behind on rent 
and utilities. "If we have to move, that might kill the program," Arrington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a detailed budget outlined by Arrington, World Flaggs needs approximately 
$220,000 for musical instruments and uniforms and about $30,000 a year to cover 
its daily operations. Once the corps is on its feet, income from performance 
fees and competitions should help fatten the coffers, according to the budget 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arrington said he had difficulty recruiting local vendors for World 
Flaggs, the organization has received cash and equipment donations from large 
sponsors such as Pioneer Electronics, Home Base, Kodak and U.S. Gypsum Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Arrington imported his knowledge as a drummer from Chicago's West Side, a part 
of the city similar to south Los Angeles. He was a drummer on various 
drum-and-bugle corps in three states from the ages of 11 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 After a shaky career as a jazz drummer, for various local and national acts, 
he went into painting but never stopped dreaming about organizing his own 
drum-and-bugle corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to stay together until it comes together," Arrington said. "We 
only have one direction, and that's forward."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: FUNERAL DIRECTOR MUST CURTAIL ACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state received a temporary restraining order against Willie Frank Houston, 
a South-Central funeral director who allegedly continued to operate his funeral 
homes despite losing his operating licenses last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary restraining order granted July 14 to the State Board of Funeral 
Directors and Embalmers required Houston to curtail all funeral director 
activities at the Houston and Peoples Funeral Home, 4250 S. Central Ave., and 
at Houston's Mortuary, 9201-9203 S. Vermont Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston said he hasn't offered any services since his licenses were revoked 
June 23. "I've had seven or eight accusations, but none of them have been 
proven in court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral director said he sold the three-home company, which also included 
a home in Pomona, to a South Africa-based corporation on June 28. The Rhodesia 
Intercontinental Corp. has already filed for a license with the state board to 
operate, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Yanes, executive director of the board, said the state hasn't proven 
the recent charges against Houston. "But we do have declarations made under 
penalty of perjury by at least three families involved, which say (Houston) was 
agreeing to perform funeral services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston lost the licenses to run the funeral homes after a state 
investigation. Houston was found to have violated more than 50 state laws, 
including switching of bodies, burial of wrong bodies, unlicensed embalming and 
failure to release the body of a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanes said the temporary restraining order was granted until a July 28 hearing 
for a permanent injunction in a Superior Court takes place.  
</P>
<P>
 The state is also seeking about $10,000 in damages and restitution for the 
families allegedly harmed by Houston, Yanes said. It will also demand 
reimbursement of investigative and legal costs associated with the case, more 
than $50,000. ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; EX-TEACHER, YMCA IN LEGAL DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A white dance instructor has filed suit against the YMCA of Metropolitan Los 
Angeles and its Crenshaw and Inglewood branches, charging racial 
discrimination, wrongful discharge and defamation of character. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Maria Sistare-Meyer of Santa Monica offered dance classes through her 
business, Children in Motion, at the Crenshaw YMCA, 1006 E. 28th St., and at 
the Inglewood Family YMCA, 319 E. Kelso St. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed May 25 in Los Angeles Superior Court, Sistare-Meyer claims 
that despite what she said was the overall success of her program, black 
supervisors at the two YMCA branches conspired to break her contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Rosen, president of Metro YMCA, called the accusations "unfounded, 
meritless and absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Sistare-Meyer is seeking about $100,000 in general and compensatory damages. 
"If we prove there was intentional and malicious conduct in terminating my 
client because of race, then we'll ask for well over $1 million in punitive 
damages," said Drew Pomerance, Sistare-Meyer's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Sistare-Meyer was hired by the Crenshaw YMCA in 
1991, and the two parties agreed on a contract for Children in Motion to 
provide dance programs. As specified in the agreement, Sistare-Meyer appointed 
two African Americans to teach the dance classes.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit claims that conflicts between Children in Motion instructors and the 
Crenshaw YMCA staff began in January, 1993. Sistare-Meyer alleges that Crenshaw 
YMCA staff failed to open gymnasiums on time for the dance classes to begin and 
called the instructors "Uncle Tommettes." Despite her complaints to Crenshaw 
YMCA officials, no action was taken, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 By February, 1993, Sistare-Meyer said she faced similar animosity at the 
Inglewood location, where she also had entered into a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Her company was terminated by the Crenshaw facility without explanation on 
March 1, 1993, the suit states, although her contract was not set to expire 
until June, 1993. She was told that the Inglewood location was also canceling 
its contract that same day. The termination cost her $46,000 in income, the 
suit states. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen contends that Sistare-Meyer was an independent contractor, not an 
employee. Dimissing an independent contractor is not like terminating an 
employee, Rosen said. "The basis of the suit is false because she was never an 
employee. The YMCA no longer required the service of that independent 
contractor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of what the YMCA stands for -- diversification of races, ages and 
gender -- Rosen said that for the YMCA to single out one individual "makes no 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "She made a claim, which is not true. Then she filed suit on those grounds. 
Then she attached false accusations (of racial discrimination and defamation)," 
he said. "They are not going to get a settlement. We are going to court." 
</P>
<P>
 The dance instructor claims that Crenshaw YMCA officials told parents that 
Children in Motion stopped offering dance instruction without any explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 When she complained to the Metropolitan YMCA, Sistare-Meyer contends, 
officials turned the issue over to an insurance-claims adjuster, who offered a 
"token sum of money" to drop the matter and release the YMCA from all claims.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; HOTEL OWNER FIGHTS OPERATING CONTROLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a Skid Row hotel has appealed a decision by city officials to 
impose strict operating conditions at the two-story building, which police say 
is a source for prostitution and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung Chuan Wang filed the appeal July 14 -- the last day before the 16 
conditions were to take effect at the Modoc Hotel, 819 S. Towne Ave., city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals, Wang claimed 
that the operating requirements, which ranged from installation of no-loitering 
signs to hiring of a 24-hour security guard, are unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision by the city is nothing more than a governmental attempt to 
shift the burden and responsibility of curing society's ills upon a private 
party," according to the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, who has twice been convicted of slum violations, also denied allegations 
made about the property during a June 23 public hearing. School officials and 
parents testified that drug needles were found across the street from the hotel 
near 9th Street School. 
</P>
<P>
 Such testimony and police records concerning prostitution arrests persuaded 
Jon S. Perica, associate zoning administrator, to impose the conditions earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 An appeal hearing is expected to be scheduled by September, officials said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; EXHIBIT SPOTLIGHTS TERMINAL ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forced to evacuate his childhood home near San Pedro Bay during World War II, 
Kenji Yamamotopacked the only valuable possessions he had -- his clothing, 
shoes and a portable radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a .22-gauge rifle and took it to the Japanese community hall," where it 
was confiscated by American soldiers, Yamamoto said. "They said they would give 
it back, but I never saw that (again.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Yamamoto, 76, now lives in Boyle Heights. He was among the last to see 
Terminal Island as a thriving, 3,000-member Japanese community of fishermen, 
fish-cannery workers and grocers. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid rumors that the village on Fish Harbor was a spy colony, American 
soldiers evicted at gunpoint all people of Japanese descent on Feb. 25, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 In 48 hours, the community was destroyed. Terminal Island was later turned 
into a military base, and Japanese-owned stores, fishing boats and other 
property were razed or taken over by outsiders or industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the island now stands as a slab of landfill in Los Angeles Harbor, 
Little Tokyo's Japanese American National Museum for the first time is 
revisiting the lost community through an exhibit of historic photographs and 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Island in Time: The Terminal Island Story" opened Saturday and will run 
through Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The close-knit group of Terminal Islanders, who still hold annual reunions 
around Los Angeles County, formed a campaign committee earlier this year and 
raised more than $200,000 for the exhibit -- twice its $100,000 target, 
Yamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money has gone to pay for labor and equipment costs for the 
exhibit, which features 70 historic photographs and 40 artifacts, including a 
scaled-down model of a Japanese fishing boat, a handmade box containing fishing 
hooks and bait, newspapers of that period and report cards. Most of the items 
were loaned by former Terminal Islanders, said Chris Komai, a museum spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Money left over will help establish a permanent Terminal Island collection and 
possibly allow for a traveling show, Komai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first (exhibit) inside the museum to be financed by a private 
group," he said. "We're interested in having them tell their own story." 
</P>
<P>
 The Terminal Islanders hope mementos from the past will raise public awareness 
of their former community and their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people, even the people from Japan, don't know about Terminal 
Island," said Yamamoto, whose family moved there from Long Beach when he was a 
year old. He evacuated at age 25, a single man working for his brother-in-law's 
grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important for younger Japanese Americans to understand what their 
first-generation relatives -- the Issei -- had to endure during World War II, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit could encourage them "to carry on and appreciate what the previous 
generation did for them," Yamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, we couldn't live anywhere we want," he said. "There was a lot 
of prejudice and a lot of the whites didn't want to associate with the Oriental 
and minority." 
</P>
<P>
 Though as a child he was sheltered from much of the racial tension of the 
Great Depression and World War II, Yamamoto did recall one run-in with a white 
fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the Japanese attack on Manchuria, the man threatened the 
15-year-old boy: "All you Japs are going to be kicked out of this island," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, we didn't pay him no mind," Yamamoto said. "We couldn't do anything 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the forced evacuation of the fishing community was also stirred by 
racial fear, he said. But in Yamamoto's view, it also netted some positive 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 While at the Manzanar internment camp in the Owens Valley, the retired grocery 
store worker married another Terminal Islander, Hideko, whose grandmother was 
the first to open a market in the Japanese community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good thing that we got evacuated from the island, to go into other 
societies and make new friends," Yamamoto said. TOMMY LI

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 31-year-old woman accused of firing a weapon at children near an elementary 
school will be arraigned Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court on charges of 
assault with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Judge Suzanne E. Person ordered Charlotte De La Torre to 
stand trial on the two assault charges but dismissed a pair of attempted murder 
counts during a recent preliminary hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Person said testimony from three prosecution witnesses -- a student, a 
pedestrian and a Los Angeles police officer -- failed to show that De La Torre 
acted with premeditation or malice during the May 19 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge kept the defendant's bail at $2 million. If convicted, she could 
receive up to 11 years in state prison, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Torre was arrested and charged shortly after she allegedly fired a 
weapon at two girls walking home from Castelar Street School, 840 Yale St. 
Neither was injured. Several shell casings and a 12-gauge shotgun believed to 
have been used in the shooting were recovered by police. 
</P>
<P>
 During a July 15 preliminary hearing, Officer John Cronshaw said one of the 
girls told him that they bolted for cover behind a green car near Alpine Street 
and Hill Place. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very shaken up," he said. "They were very hesitant to speak to me 
and required a lot of calming and reassurance that the person who made them 
afraid was not going to harm them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the hearing, a boy told the judge that he and five friends ran away 
from an armed woman because they thought she was firing at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Chamberlain, a passerby, said she saw six children running away from 
the scene of the shooting. Neither she nor the boy mentioned the two girls whom 
prosecutors cited in their complaint against De La Torre. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted Person to dismiss the attempted murder charges for lack of 
evidence, despite Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Meister's argument that De La Torre 
"was heavily armed . . . and was in a rage of some sort." 
</P>
<P>
 Meister later hinted at a motive for the defendant's alleged outburst by 
telling the judge that "she shot at the kids because they made her dog bark." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of De La Torre's family have said previously that the woman was 
shooting at her roommate's car, rather than at the children. A mental illness 
had led her to believe someone was trying to harm her, her family said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have entered a plea of not guilty, and we'll enter a plea of not guilty at 
her arraignment," said De La Torre's public defender, Susan Aaronson. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; SURGE SEEN IN FAKE-ID BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Walking along busy Pacific Boulevard, a street crowded with shops and 
restaurants, pedestrians are likely to hear " mica, mica " being muttered in 
their direction by several people hanging out at intersections or sitting on 
the hoods of parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 If any interest is expressed, men with Mexico City accents approach and ask in 
Spanish what type of identification card is wanted: Social Security, resident 
alien or driver's license. One hundred dollars will get you all three. 
</P>
<P>
 " Mica (pronounced MEE-cah) is the word these guys use to describe fake IDs," 
said police Officer Danny Dominguez. Dominguez regularly patrols Pacific 
Boulevard and its environs by mountain bike or squad car. A six-year officer, 
Dominguez, 37, has seen a sharp increase in the Southeast cities' counterfeit 
identification industry. 
</P>
<P>
 So have many Huntington Park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walk to work in the morning, they come up to me and ask: 'You want 
mica? You want mica? ,' " said Patricia Guerra, 19, who sells fresh juice at El 
Gallo Giro restaurant at Pacific Boulevard and Florence Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, police raided a pharmacy and a bar in the 6900 block of Pacific 
Boulevard and recovered a laminating machine, photo equipment and fraudulent 
California driver's licenses and resident alien, Social Security and state 
identification cards. Twenty-nine were arrested in the raid, 25 of whom were 
deported to Mexico by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the city's counterfeit ID industry continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as there's a demand for these cards, people will sell them," 
Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said local store owners increasingly complain of a rise in fake-ID 
sales, saying such illegal activity hurts their businesses. Friction between 
store owners and those enterprising enough to capitalize on the situation of 
poor immigrants illustrates the scope of this growing problem, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those transporting illegal immigrants across the border and those providing 
them with phony identification sometimes work together, said Detective Chuck 
Antuna of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Antuna, who has tracked ID counterfeiters for the past four years, said that 
for about $1,000 a coyote will transport an individual from Tijuana to Los 
Angeles. Included in the deal is a set of counterfeit identification cards and 
a trip to a temporary agency for job placement. Since many employers only hire 
temps for a few days, they don't check identification too closely, Antuna said. 
</P>
<P>
 When those in possession of the fake documents are discovered, however, they 
are often surprised to be detained and deported. "A lot of the (immigrants) 
from deeper in Mexico think this is the way it works here," said Dominguez. 
"They aren't aware the cards they have are illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 According to evidence collected by local police and the Sheriff's Department, 
a sophisticated organization with origins in the Mexico City underworld has 
firmly established itself in the local trade of illegal IDs. The "DF" gang, 
street parlance for the Mexican government's Federal District encompassing 
Mexico City, is comprised almost entirely of streetwise men from the Mexican 
capital. Members dress, act and talk differently from other gangs in the area, 
law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After training in Mexico City's busy center, where they sell fake ID cards to 
fresh rural arrivals, DF members then come to Los Angeles, where the big money 
is to be made, Antuna said. On an average day, a miquero, someone who sells 
micas, makes about $300 here, compared to about $9 back in Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They resemble more organized crime than street crime," said Sgt. James Lally 
of the Sheriff's Department. "It's not like anything we've seen in the last 20 
years." SIMON ROMERO

 "I've always been interested in what our paramedics do, so now I know," said a 
relieved Mayor Ric Loya, who is recovering just fine after being hauled out of 
a recent council meeting on a stretcher after he collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old mayor was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood and 
discharged two days later.Loya, who takes heart medication, said his collapse 
was not a heart attack but a "type of spasm."  
</P>
<P>
 He has resumed his mayoral and high school teaching duties. Loya collapsed 
shortly after the opening of the July 5 council meeting, only hours after 
Mexico's overtime loss to Bulgaria in World Cup play.  
</P>
<P>
 With several helicopters overhead and extra police in riot gear, the air was 
tense that afternoon. Loya said that he felt exhausted by the time the meeting 
began. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: SOUTHWEST; TIGHTENING BONDS BY SHARING STORIES

<P>
 Twirling a wooden staff festooned with silver ribbons with the deftness of a 
drum majorette, Ellaraino led a curious group of parents and children into a 
world few said they had visited before: storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a make-believe world that has something for people of all ages, said the 
actress-turned-storyteller, her radiant smile undimmed by dubious looks from 
the audience. "You know why I love to tell stories? Because in stories, you can 
be anything you want to be. Anything!" 
</P>
<P>
 And for the next hour, they are, adults and children alike, assuming roles as 
goats, old women, leopards, horses, even yams. Lighthearted though it was, the 
session at the Head Start center on Western Avenue had serious intentions of 
planting seeds of literacy, a knowledge of ancient African culture, and perhaps 
most important, a sense of family togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to encourage families to start traditions by telling personal 
stories," said Ellaraino, colorfully dressed in African garb and surrounded by 
African dolls, figurines and other tools of her trade. "It doesn't matter that 
you haven't heard any before. You can start where you are." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly storytelling workshop is the newest and most creative program 
launched thus far at the Head Start Family Service Center at 6801 S. Western 
Ave. The year-old facility provides a variety of services aimed at improving 
family life for its low-income clients. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only three Head Start Family Service Centers operated by the county, 
the center opened last year in response to the 1992 riots and the need to 
address such problems as illiteracy, substance abuse and unemployment with free 
classes and job training. The center serves qualifying families living in the 
area bounded by Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, the Harbor Freeway on the east, 
Adams Boulevard on the north and Imperial Highway on the south.  
</P>
<P>
 The pilot storytelling program, says social worker Cheryl Darden, brings 
together several important elements in a single, enjoyable activity. "It fits 
in with what we do here because it serves the whole household," said Darden, a 
family service specialist at Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
 During the workshop, Ellaraino literally kept her audience on their toes. She 
called upon them to help act out stories, gathered them in semicircles for 
"ring" games, and paraded them around the room in a dramatization of an African 
folk tale about an old woman trying to cross a river. 
</P>
<P>
 Each tale imparted a message: the travails of "The Knee High Man" encouraged 
listeners to be satisfied with their physical appearance, while the " hujambao 
" chanting game called upon each participant to describe what they want to 
achieve in life. Hujambao is a Swahili greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be an adult," Darlene Walker said with a laugh during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the 15 other participants, Walker began the session sitting in a chair 
with her son in her lap, but when the storytelling began, she was quickly on 
her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun," said Walker, who has been coming to the center since it 
opened and describes herself as a "neighborhood nanny." "The good thing is, it 
got me out of the house and away from the television set." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellaraino, a veteran film actress who turned to storytelling six years ago, 
said she hopes to build family solidarity, something she said has eroded too 
much over the years in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got inspired to do this after I heard my son tell a story his father had 
told him," she said. "He told it so vividly, so well. The seed was planted for 
me. . . . I realized that you can be very creative about doing things with 
family, which is something we've forgotten. You don't need money. You only need 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 The storytelling is part of the California Arts Council's Artist in Residence 
program. Information: (213) 750-1203. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CHIEF AUTO PLAYS ITS PART IN STUDENT HIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chief Auto Parts, a national chain that operates 64 outlets in central Los 
Angeles, has formed a partnership at Dorsey High School that trains and places 
students in sales and other positions at its stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy to be working," said 19-year-old Marvin Gonzalez as he stocked 
shelves on a recent morning at the Chief Auto store at Crenshaw Boulevard and 
Rodeo Road. "I had been looking for work before school let out. . . . I'm glad 
I applied and passed the interview. I like it here." 
</P>
<P>
 Launched last spring, the program is the brainchild of Deron Williams, an aide 
for 10th District City Councilman Nate Holden. Williams said he was inspired to 
contact Chief Auto with the idea of forming a corporate-community partnership 
after Chief built the store at Crenshaw Boulevard and Rodeo Road, which had 
been a vacant site. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he had been considering the idea since a Pep Boys store on 
Crenshaw near Jefferson closed after the riots two years ago and did not 
reopen. The store has become a Crenshaw-district eyesore, filled with trash and 
scrawled over with graffiti. Williams said he was looking for a way to counter 
that closure when Chief Auto opened its Crenshaw/Rodeo store last year. 
</P>
<P>
 After talking with Chief Auto regional managers at the opening, Williams said 
they quickly formulated plans for the auto parts chain to adopt Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like a natural thing," Williams said. "Everyone was looking for 
ways to be good corporate citizens. Chief does a lot of business in the 
community, so it was very easy to convince them to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program provides Dorsey auto shop students with monthly lectures and 
training sessions in several aspects of the automotive business, including 
parts sales, cash register operation, customer service, automotive repairs and 
work ethics. Seven students from the class were hired to work at Chief Auto's 
central Los Angeles stores. Chief officials say they plan to hire a group of 
about 10 each financial quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Merino, 18, said his job at the Crenshaw/Rodeo Chief Auto store fits 
with his plans to work in the automotive industry. "I get to do a little of 
everything -- sell, help customers find the parts they need, stock," said 
Merino, who graduated from Dorsey in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun. . . . I had thought at first of being a mechanic, but I 
like this kind of work better. You don't get dirty. And it's so close I can 
walk to work." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; FOR TEEN, REWARD IS IN VOLUNTEERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many volunteer workers, Bianca Arzola says the rewards come every day, 
when she helps children and teen-agers learn a new skill or have a little fun. 
But this award-winning volunteer is a little out of the ordinary: She's 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way of Greater Los Angeles recently named Bianca its Youth 
Volunteer of the Year for her work at the Crippled Children's Society's East 
Los Angeles service center. That was followed by a similar honor from the 
Crippled Children's Society naming Bianca its Outstanding Volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotionally, they know how to treat people," the Belvedere Middle School 
graduate said of her charges. "Whenever they see me in the street, they hug me 
and say, 'Hi.' I like that because sometimes your own friends won't say 'Hi' or 
they ignore you."  
</P>
<P>
 Bianca, who will start classes at Garfield High School this fall, has been one 
of the center's most dependable and responsible volunteers, said director 
Nadine Munguia. The center, 154 N. Gage Ave., depends on volunteers to help the 
staff of four oversee 24 youths in the daily program and at least 15 Friday 
nights and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's like a staff person to me," Munguia said. "I guess we hear so many 
negative things about our youth today. Well, here she is. She's from this area 
and she's an example for her friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Just over two years ago Bianca stepped into the center for the first time with 
a friend, Christina Mendoza, whose brother is disabled. Bianca liked it from 
the start, and has volunteered daily after school and on Saturdays ever since.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to worry about how you look or what you're wearing," she said. 
"They just like you for who you are."  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes she'll make their snacks or help push their wheelchairs. Other days 
she'll help them in the swimming pool or be with them when they go on outings. 
Volunteers teach the clients how to take a bus, shop for food and prepare their 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole philosophy is to make them as independent as possible," Munguia 
said. Bianca is "there every day when she could probably be doing something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother NAME has joked that Munguia should adopt her because she sees her 
daughter so much every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Munguia even helped Bianca and her friends run the Los Angeles Marathon in 
March, training with them for months and then crossing the finish line with 
them. Even then, Bianca helped out the center by collecting donations for every 
mile she completed.  
</P>
<P>
 With the training she has acquired, Bianca said she wants to work with 
disabled children or in the child-development field. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has already told Munguia that she hopes to be hired when the center 
moves to a new, larger location that will need more staff. The move won't 
happen for two more years, Munguia said, but Bianca has arranged her high 
school schedule to allow for time after school at the center.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen somebody so committed," Munguia said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: PANEL TO REVIEW ADELANTE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Community Advisory Committee will hear a progress report on the Adelante 
Eastside study and review its recommendations at a Wednesday meeting in El 
Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, also called the Eastside Redevelopment Feasibility Study, was 
completed two years ago, but officials are following through on the study's 
recommendations that commercial and industrial corridors be developed to 
increase the local tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 An ongoing study of local commercial and industrial areas will determine 
whether government redevelopment funds can be used to revitalize those 
corridors in Boyle Heights and El Sereno.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the Adelante Eastside study's findings was that most residents in a 
10-square-mile area of Boyle Heights and El Sereno leave the area to shop. It 
also found that most of the local housing is among the city's oldest and in 
desperate need of repair. For now, though, officials have dropped the housing 
component of the revitalization efforts and are focusing on the commercial and 
industrial corridors.  
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will begin at 6 p.m. at the El Sereno Senior Citizens Center, 4818 
Klamath Place.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; KOREAN GROCERS FACE LEGAL SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Koreatown-based advocacy organization received a major setback last week in 
its campaign to help grocers escape city regulations imposed on rebuilding 
efforts after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean-American Grocers' Victims Assn. lost its bid to overturn a March 
state Court of Appeal decision on the issue when the California Supreme Court 
refused to hear the case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The association has argued that the regulations, which include requirements 
such as on-site security guards and limited hours of operation, are unfair 
because they are not applied to grocers whose establishments were not damaged 
in the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "These regulations are sporadic and they penalize these people for being 
unfortunate," said Mehee Kim, a spokeswoman for the association.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a victims' issue; it is a community issue and a fairness issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said the Supreme Court decision was "very discouraging" to the grocers 
represented by her group and the Korean-American Legal Advocacy Foundation, 
which had assisted with the legal work.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to decide what to do next," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's leaders said they will monitor similar cases that dispute the 
fairness of store regulations in Oakland and Hermosa Beach. Kim said those 
cases might lead to precedents that could be favorable to the local grocers' 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is backing an Assembly bill that would exempt liquor store owners 
whose businesses were destroyed during the riots from a range of requirements, 
including the hiring of full-time security guards. The Assembly passed the bill 
and sent it to the state Senate, where Mayor Richard Riordan asked to have it 
put on inactive status, vouching to seek a local solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the eight grocers who brought the suit, and the dozens of others 
affected by the regulations, will have to hope for the best, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot we can do," Kim said. GEOFF BOUCHER

</P>
<P>
 Founders Marissa B. Castro and Michael Balaoing established the internship 
program to give young Filipino Americans a taste of how decisions are made in 
legislative offices at the federal, state and local levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 interns, ranging from recent high school graduates to college seniors, 
will work for 10 weeks in a legislative office. 
</P>
<P>
 Assignments include the offices of U.S. senators and representatives, state 
Assembly members, the state treasurer, County Board of Supervisors, the Los 
Angeles Board of Education, City Council members and the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program is not just an opportunity to land an internship with a 
politician or add a line to someone's resume," Balaoing said. "This is about 
molding individuals and a team to make meaningful and lasting contributions to 
our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they form the largest Asian Pacific population group in California, 
Filipino Americans still lack the political access and clout required to get 
their concerns addressed, Balaoing said. 
</P>
<P>
 The internship program is designed to acquaint young Filipino Americans with 
the political process and, through a series of workshops, develop their 
public-speaking skills and problem-solving abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a passing of the torch" to a younger generation of leaders, said 
Joel Jacinto, executive director of Search to Involve Pilipino Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Philip Vera Cruz, co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, and 
Royal Morales, director of the Pacific Asian Alcohol Program, set a high 
standard for community activists, Jacinto told the interns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a challenge to you to continue our struggle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Intern Steve Chiong, who will be working in Mayor Richard Riordan's office, 
said he is looking forward to "testing the waters of the public sector." 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often Filipinos are ignored and it's time we are recognized in our 
communities," said Chiong, a Belmont High School graduate and a student at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 The internship is sponsored by a coalition of groups, including Search to 
Involve and the Network to Improve the Pilipino American Community Today.  
</P>
<P>
 Each intern receives a $500 stipend. 
</P>
<P>
 Among last year's group of interns, all six who had finished their studies and 
were seeking jobs found employment in legislative offices or social service 
agencies, Jacinto said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's interns are: Chiong, Art Concordia, Desi Danganan, Arnel Dino, 
Edna Flores, Marco Jastilliana, Victoria Leonido, Donna Pascua, Anthony Simbol, 
James Sison and Valerie Villaraza.

COVER STORY; SWING-SWIFT KIDS; AS THE NUMBER OF WORKERS WITH IRREGULAR HOURS 
GROWS, MANY PARENTS ARE TURNING TO 24-HOUR CHILD CARE. 'I SEE A LOT OF 
LOW-INCOME MOTHERS WHO TRULY CARE ABOUT THEIR KIDS, BUT HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO 
TAKE A NIGHT JOB OR AN OVERNIGHT JOB,' SAYS ONE LICENSED PROVIDER. 'EVERY

<P>
 Bundled in a nylon jacket and a pink-and-white teddy bear jumpsuit, Shanice 
Cannon peeks out of Agnes Lewis' living room window, checking to see if her 
mother's Toyota Camry has pulled into the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanice's mother, Sharon, is running a little late, but the 15-month-old baby 
is hardly perturbed as she happily wriggles in Lewis' lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing seems to be out of the ordinary at the Lewis household -- which has 
served as a family child care facility for the past 13 years -- except for one 
thing: It's nearly 1 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of employees working swing and graveyard shifts, weekends and 
other irregular hours grows, many parents -- particularly single parents -- are 
turning to late-night and overnight child care. Although few child care centers 
provide overnight care, nearly 200 licensed family care providers in the Los 
Angeles area now offer such services out of their homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, people have all kinds of jobs with all kinds of hours, so it makes 
sense to offer 24-hour care," said Lewis, an Inglewood family care provider who 
watches children from such areas as the Crenshaw district and Ladera Heights. 
"A lot of people turn to family care because child care centers aren't always 
willing to be flexible with parents who work odd hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon, a single parent who lives just south of Ladera Heights, was referred 
to Lewis by Crystal Stairs, one of 10 child care resource and referral agencies 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter sorter for the U.S. Postal Service, 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon works from 3:30 p.m. to midnight. Her schedule isn't ideal, but it's an 
improvement over the 6 p.m.-to-2:30 a.m. shift that she used to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing the best I can," said Cannon, who is pregnant with her second 
child. "It's hard because I don't have anyone who can help me out. If Agnes 
wasn't around, I'd probably have to quit my job." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Central Los Angeles area bounded roughly by Beverly Hills, Monterey 
Park, Hollywood and Gardena, there are 178 licensed family care providers who 
offer 24-hour care, according to Crystal Stairs, the Mexican-American 
Opportunity Foundation, and Child and Family Services, three child care 
resource and referral agencies that service the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for round-the-clock care persists because of the prevalence of single 
parents, the increasing number of non-traditional jobs and the weak economy, 
said Cecilia Rojas, an outreach specialist for Crystal Stairs, which services 
South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 27% of children under 18 lived with only one parent, up from 12% in 
1970, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And on the job front, 14 million 
full-time employees -- 18% of the nation's full-time work force -- worked 
something other than a daytime shift in 1991. This represents an addition of 2 
million such workers over the previous six years, according to the U.S. Bureau 
of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The government agency also estimates that the top five growth occupations in 
the 1990s will be waiters and waitresses, registered nurses, janitors and 
cleaners, managers and cashiers -- all of which require long hours and some 
off-hour shift work. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are accepting whatever job they can get, even though it may require 
them to work non-traditional hours," Rojas said. "It's just a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need for 24-hour care, especially for single parents, because many 
don't have anyone else who can watch their children," said Pat Onuorah, who 
offers 24-hour family care at her Ladera Heights home. "I see a lot of 
low-income mothers who truly care about their kids, but have no choice but to 
take a night job or an overnight job. Every night, I have at least one child 
who stays over." 
</P>
<P>
 Onuorah is licensed to care for 12 children at any given time, a typical 
number for family care providers. And like most providers, Onuorah, who works 
at the Watts Health Foundation during the day, hires assistants to help her 
watch children and prepare meals. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, about a dozen children were sprawled on Onuorah's living 
room floor, playing games, eating spaghetti and watching the video "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 One baby in the room was scheduled to stay with Onuorah for four days. "He's 
very adaptable and independent," Onuorah said of the 15-month-old boy, whose 
mother is a flight attendant. "He's been going to baby-sitters ever since he 
was born." 
</P>
<P>
 Another 14-month-old baby, Mary Anyim, is also a regular overnight guest at 
Onuorah's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to take care of business or if I want to go out at night, I bring 
her here," said Mary's mother, Theresa, a single parent who lives nearby. "She 
likes it here. When I bring her here, I don't worry because everything is like 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Thursday, Eric Scaraglino, 3, spends the night at Elizabeth Wolfe's 
Hollywood home, while his mother, Rose, attends a parents' support group 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time he stayed over, I cried and cried," said Scaraglino, a single 
parent from Palms whose son is hearing-impaired. "It was the first time he had 
been away from me, and I was devastated. Now, (Wolfe) is part of our family. I 
don't have any family in California, so she's like Eric's grandma." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Wolfe said she was willing to offer 24-hour child care in her 
home because she enjoys the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "After my husband passed away, it just made sense for me to do this," said 
Wolfe, who has served as a family care provider for the past 10 years. "It's 
like therapy for me to have the kids around. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Family care providers charge $50 to $125 per week, although some licensed 
providers may charge extra for overnight or weekend care. To be licensed by the 
state Department of Social Services, family providers must meet certain 
requirements, which include attending a licensing seminar, being fingerprinted 
and having their homes deemed safe for children. 
</P>
<P>
 While many family care providers are willing to offer overnight care, few, if 
any, child care centers in Los Angeles provide 24-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to find many child care centers willing to provide that type 
of care because it's not profitable at all," said Tammy Baker, manager of Child 
and Family Services, which services the Downtown, Hollywood and Mid-City areas. 
"You need to pay your workers overtime and it's hard to maintain a steady 
clientele." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents with non-traditional work schedules also prefer leaving their 
children in a home setting rather than an institutionalized child care 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to drop your child off at night in their pajamas, would you want 
to take them to a place where the person who answers the door is wearing 
pajamas and your child can snuggle up in a bed in their home?" Baker asked. "Or 
would you want to go to a place with fluorescent lights, where they put your 
child on a cot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Every afternoon, when Cannon drops Shanice off at Lewis' home at about 3:15, 
Lewis makes it a point to tell Shanice, "Your mommy's going to work now. She'll 
be back tonight to pick you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon then kisses her baby goodby, and waves to her as she walks to her car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important for them to wave to each other," Lewis said. "That way, 
Shanice knows she's coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 After watching her mother's car drive away, Shanice goes inside to play with 
the seven other children under Lewis' care. A few hours later, after most of 
the other children have gone home, Lewis and Shanice have dinner. Shanice is 
then tucked into bed, only to be stirred out of sleep shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ready to see Mama?" Lewis asks Shanice, as she lifts the sleepy but 
smiling child from her crib. "It's time to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lewis first started watching Shanice early this year, Shanice would cry 
and hold on tight to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her mother would sit in her car and hear her screaming inside," Lewis said. 
"That made her feel so bad. She kept saying, 'Hopefully, one of these days, I 
won't have to work.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite the reluctance of some parents to leave their children in overnight 
care, many have no other options. Few companies -- even those with employees 
working irregular hours -- have considered round-the-clock child care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of 24-hour care has been brought up from time to time, and the 
unions have asked about it," said Sylvia Woodside, a human services manager for 
the U.S. Postal Service in Los Angeles. "But we've held off because of the lack 
of funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Childrens Hospital Los Angeles used to offer 24-hour child care to its 
employees, but the program was discontinued because the hospital couldn't 
maintain a steady enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there's a hesitancy to put kids in a center at night," said Darcy 
Williams, who runs the hospital's child care program. "All the guilt that women 
feel about leaving their child at a center is compounded at night. We're 
considering bringing back 24-hour care, but we would only do so with trained 
people and lots of planning. It's a very distant thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so at other large companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing the need for quality night and overnight child care, Mobil Oil Corp. 
teamed up with Torrance YWCA to open a 24-hour child care center that will 
primarily service Mobil employees. The center will be open until midnight 
starting this fall, and will start its 24-hour program next summer, YWCA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nighttime care is a key concern at Mobil, where about 400 of the refinery's 
1,000 employees work night hours, company spokesman Barry Engleberg said. A 
typical night shift starts at 6 p.m. and lasts until 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our workers are shift workers, and we found that when something happened to 
disrupt a parent's child-care situation, people would call in sick," Engleberg 
said. "So, we approached the YWCA about 24-hour care and invested about $50,000 
in the new facility." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the Whitney Young Child Development Center in San Francisco has 
offered 24-hour child care out of its Hunter's Point facility. Every night, 15 
to 20 children stay overnight, director Careth Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has received national acclaim for its 24-hour service, but Reid 
said she still has misgivings about her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't convince me that it's OK to wake a kid up at 4 a.m., rain or shine, 
and put them in a car, and then drop them off at a child care center while you 
dash off to work," Reid said. "It's also not OK for a kid to come to the center 
after school by bus, and then get picked up at 2:15 in the morning. There has 
to be other ways." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reid knows there is no other way for many parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are raising their children alone and do not have the financial means to 
hire a nanny or baby-sitter, Reid said. Many are also working odd hours or have 
two jobs so they can support their families, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has studied the effect of overnight care on children, some 
child care professionals are worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward F. Zigler, a professor of psychology at Yale University and a national 
child-care expert, said waking a child in the middle of the night disrupts the 
child's sleep patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Children could also develop emotional problems if they are shuffled from one 
bed to another. "Children can adapt themselves to everything, but children want 
to sleep in their own beds," he said. "They get frightened of strange people 
and places." 
</P>
<P>
 But Darcelle Dixon-Hunt, an accountant who lives in Ladera Heights, said her 
three children look forward to spending the night at Onuorah's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids love it when they stay overnight at Pat's house," said Dixon-Hunt, 
who works out of her home but frequently attends night meetings and takes 
out-of-town business trips. "A lot of times, they don't want to come home."

FREMONT HIGH'S SCOTT IS SPENDING HIS SUMMER RUNNING AROUND COUNTRY; TRACK: HE'S 
COMPETED IN MEETS FROM OAKLAND TO TENNESSEE, AND IS HEADING TO FLORIDA FOR THE 
JUNIOR OLYMPICS CHAMPIONSHIPS.

 Clarence Scott will have his share of summer travel tales -- and some medals 
-- to share with his classmates at Fremont High this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior has been to Tennessee and spent last week in Oakland. This week, 
he's off to Gainesville to compete in the Junior Olympics national track and 
field championships Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing for the L.A. Jets, Scott, 16, won the intermediate division (ages 
15-16) in the long jump with a personal-best 23 feet, 8 inches in the Region 15 
championships last month at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He also teamed with Muir's Obea Moore, Kenyon Rambo of Long Beach Poly and 
Lonnie Cruel of Carson on the Jets' victorious 400- and 1,600-meter relay 
teams. The top three finishers in each event advanced to the national meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott also has qualified for next month's Amateur Athletic Union junior 
national championships in Cocoa Beach, Fla., by capturing the long jump and 
finishing second in the 100 meters in 10.83 seconds in the Region 13 meet at 
Contra Costa College last weekend. In June, Scott, who has run 21.64 in the 200 
this summer, won the long jump in the Youth Athletics national meet in 
Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have asked me if I'm burned out competing in so many meets, 
but I haven't really thought about it," Scott said. "I feel I've gotten faster 
and learned a lot of things this summer." 
</P>

 L.A. Promotions has been ousted from East Los Angeles College for breach of 
its $1-million, five-year stadium renovation agreement, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was declared "null and void for noncompliance" after L.A. 
Promotions failed to pay $150,000 in annual rent for use of Weingart Stadium, 
according to Nicholas Tan, East L.A. College vice president of administrative 
services. Tan said it was uncertain whether the school would take any further 
action against L.A. Promotions.  
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Promotions replaced the artificial turf installed for the 1984 Olympic 
field hockey competition with grass and added gates to the tunnels of the 
44-year-old facility as part of the 1993 agreement. But other improvements to 
the 22,000-seat stadium, including refurbishing the locker rooms, press box and 
bleachers, and resurfacing the parking lot, were not completed. In return for 
the renovations, the stadium was leased to L.A. Promotions for international 
soccer tournaments and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative for L.A. Promotions said the company had no comment. 
</P>

 Jordan High graduate Gene Gaines has been inducted in the Canadian Football 
League Hall of Fame. A UCLA defensive back, Gaines played for the Ottawa Rough 
Riders from 1962-69 and the Montreal Alouettes in 1961 and 1970-76.

 Four East L.A. College pitchers will attend four-year universities. Chris 
Romero and Aaron Magdaleno are headed for Cal State Northridge and USC, while 
Sammy Loza and Javier Macias have signed with the University of Wyoming. 
Infielders Leonard Rodriguez and Ted Persell will attend San Francisco State 
and Cal Poly Pomona. . . . Sprinter Leo Settle, who helped Dorsey High to its 
second consecutive City Section track title in May, has signed a letter of 
intent to attend Purdue University. Settle finished second in the 100 and 200 
meters and also ran on the Dons' City champion 400- and 1,600-meter relay 
teams.

RECRUITERS LOOK ON AS QBS SHOW THEIR STUFF

 There was no lack of quarterback talent -- past or present -- in the inaugural 
Air-7 Quarterback Challenge last week at Wilson High School.  
</P>
<P>
 The July 16 event, organized by former Mules' All-City quarterback Steve 
Clarkson, and sponsored by Gatorade and Jack in the Box, attracted 64 
quarterbacks and their receivers to the inner city from as far north as 
Sacramento's Bear River High School (senior John Anderson) and as far south as 
San Diego's Morse High School (senior Rashard Cook). 
</P>
<P>
 Clarkson, the 1978 City Player of the Year, said it was a pleasure to put on 
the event "because we were able to assemble some of the best talent in the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Air-7 Quarterback Challenge, free of charge, was the first of its kind in 
California. It tested skills of some of the state's top talent as college 
recruiters and scouting services looked on. Each participant was videotaped 
performing essential quarterback skills and then rated by a panel of judges. 
The categories: 
</P>
<P>
 * Throwing for distance; 
</P>
<P>
 * Pass routes (hitting receivers on their breaks while running curl, out, 
post, streak, outside comeback and post/corner patterns); 
</P>
<P>
 * Scramble techniques (running an obstacle course); 
</P>
<P>
 * Rapid-fire (two throws within a 15-second period at bull's-eye targets.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Read-and-react drill for the top 10 finishers in the earlier events. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos signal-caller Kevin Feterik, a junior, won the overall 
competition, tying or taking first place in three of five events. The rest of 
the top 10, in order: Sylmar's Greg Marquez, Westlake's Brian Shubin, Cerritos' 
Ryan Matthews, Upland's Davey Goggin, La Puente Bishop Amat's James Free, San 
Diego Grossmont's Mike Van Raaphorst, Santa Monica St. Monica's Steven Pulley, 
San Diego Morse's Rashard Cook and Gardena Serra's Tommy Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook captured the distance throw with a toss of 66 yards, Marquez took the 
pass routes competition, Feterik won the scramble drill, tied Van Raaphorst in 
the rapid-fire competition and tied Coggin in the finale, the read-and-react 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition was judged by former Carson coach Gene Vollnogle, former 
three-time City Section Player of the Year and ex-Wilson quarterback Ron 
Cuccia, former Carson quarterbacks Perry Klein (Atlanta Falcons) and John Walsh 
(BYU), and Notre Dame tight end Oscar McBride. Other top performers included 
Ramona's Kris Olson, La Habra's Sonje Berg, L.A. Murphy's Danny Ragsdale and 
Chris Pappas, who as a senior last season was the quarterback for City 3-A 
champion San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central City was represented by Wilson quarterbacks Eddie Gonzales, the 
area's leading passer in 1993, and the Mules' junior transfer Brian McGann. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarkson conducted the event along with the help of several volunteers from 
Para-Dice Scouting, Cal-Hi Sports magazine and the Wilson High School football 
team and boosters. The Mules' football team and booster club will receive all 
of the concession profits from the event.

VALLEY BRIEFING: CHANGING FORTUNES; THE EVOLUTION OF THE VALLEY'S ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Researched by MAYERENE BARKER and DAVID BRADY / Los Angeles Times 
</P>

<P>
 Described by Father Juan Crespi as "pleasant and spacious" in 1769, the San 
Fernando Valley can trace its economic beginnings to the Native Americans who 
made their home here for hundreds of years before the first white men arrived. 
After the establishment of the San Fernando Mission, Indian labor provided the 
basis for the region's early prosperity under the direction of the Spanish 
fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 150 years, following an influx of settlers and developers, the 
Valley was transformed from wheat fields and orange groves to movie studios and 
factories producing everything from airplanes to automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it is a different Valley, a region struggling to recover from years of 
crippling recession and the jolting chaos of the Northridge earthquake. But 
despite the hard times, some see a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 John Rooney, president of the Valley Economic Development Center, says that 
the recent crises have served as a wake-up call for businesses. "It's clear, 
after the recession, that we have to look to international markets," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to David S. Honda, the center's chairman, the Valley's cultural and 
industrial diversity has been its greatest strength throughout history -- a

The Lockheed Legacy 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 60 years, the Lockheed Corp. dominated the Valley's economic 
landscape as one of the nation's leading manufacturers of aircraft, missiles 
and rockets. For decades, its Burbank plant was the Valley's largest employer 
-- a distinction that came to a swift end after the end of the Cold War and the 
start of defense industry downsizing. A brief chronology of the company's 
Valley history: 
</P>
<P>
 1928: Fifteen years after Allan and Malcolm Loughead fly their first aircraft, 
Lockheed sets up shop in Burbank where they produce the popular Vega airplane. 
A year later, the company is in the hands of the Detroit Aircraft Co., which 
goes bankrupt during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 1932: Financier Robert Gross purchases the Burbank site for $40,000, forming 
the corporation that exists today. 
</P>
<P>
 1940s: During World War II, the company escalates production of the P-38 
fighter, Hudson bomber, B-17 Flying Fortress, C-69 Constellation transport, 
PV-1 Ventura and the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 1951: Built with the U.S. Air Force, an Antelope Valley facility opens in 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 1953: The company's 25,000th airplane rolls off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 1974: Lockheed leads the Valley's industries with $3 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 1986: A new corporate headquarters is established in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>

are razed. Currently, Lockheed's Valley employees number less than 5,000.
