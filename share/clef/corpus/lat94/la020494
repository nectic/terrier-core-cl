 L.A. demands a refund, Mr. Mayor: We were suspicious when we heard Richard 
Riordan declare during his campaign that he would take the job for $1 a year. 
And in the kind of investigative journalism for which Only in L.A. has become 
famous, we have determined that he's being paid more than that. A confidential 
document (see photo) procured by our staff investigators show that His Honor is 
raking in 4 cents per pay period. That's $1.04 a year where we come from.

 More pre-shocks: The eerie signs were evident before Jan. 17. Several readers 
have pointed out that the cover story in the Auto Club magazine, Avenues -- 
which hit the stands before the temblor hit the Southland -- was "Quake Safe." 
Fedco's shopping bags, printed up several weeks ago, contain a quake warning. 
And Ken Rosenhek sent his friend Linda Fitzpatrick a calendar titled "Life's 
Little Destruction," whose message for Jan. 17 is: "Don't do anything today." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the Channel 5 movie that began at 4 a.m., 31 minutes before the 
quake. Its title: "At the Earth's Core."

<P>
 You can say that again.

 Quake denial: Residents might not have been so prepared, however, if they were 
reading "Southern California Geology and Los Angeles Earthquakes" by R.T. Hill. 
The introduction, faxed to us by Dave Reichert of West L.A., states that the 
scholarly work "proves that this area is not only free from a probability of 
severe seismic disturbances but has the least to fear from 'Acts of God' of any 
city under the American flag."

 Thanks for the info, Hill. It was written in 1925.

THE PAST IS OVER -- SO IS THE EMBARGO; CLINTON LIFTS THE 19-YEAR-OLD TRADING 
BAN -- AND MAYBE LONG-RANGE HOPES ABOUT VIETNAM, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Difficult as it was for President Clinton, lifting the trade embargo against 
Vietnam was the only way to go. It is indeed time to move on, toward closure of 
an unpopular war whose scars remain etched on the nation's psyche and on 
individual lives. Even so, as the President made clear in his announcement 
Thursday, ending the 19-year trading ban does not mean normalization of 
relations between the two countries. For that, Hanoi must and should do more. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Vietnam must continue to cooperate in accounting for the more than 
2,200 military personnel still missing in the Vietnam War and in providing 
information on MIA-POWs. Hanoi's recent cooperation prompted the President's 
action. But quite rightly, Clinton said that establishing of relations depends 
on Hanoi supplying "more progress, more cooperation and more answers." 
</P>
<P>
 The President is of course hardly unaware that many critics of this decision 
have an abiding faith that Hanoi forever will be perfidious. Consider the views 
expressed in today's Commentary page by two former national security officials 
of the Reagan and Bush era, both Vietnam veterans. Clinton, however, believes 
that lifting the trade embargo was "the best way to resolve the fate of those 
who remain missing and about whom we are not sure." We share that view -- 
though in the end only Hanoi's action will determine which side is right. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Hanoi should pursue the genuine human rights dialogue Clinton wants 
through a liaison office to be set up in Vietnam to provide services for 
Americans there. The Vietnamese American community in Southern California is, 
at best, cautiously embracing the end of the embargo; it remains concerned 
about Hanoi's human rights practices and its treatment of political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending the embargo is not simply an economic opportunity, though the United 
States was the last major industrial nation to refuse to do business with 
Vietnam. It should present an opportunity to further address the unanswered 
questions, pain and heartaches of the families of the MIA-POWs. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the dramatic shift in policy toward Vietnam, the President 
acknowledged the unhappiness among these families and said he shared their goal 
of getting the fullest possible accounting of their loved ones. We all do.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton could have ducked this decision. It was a politically sensitive issue 
under any circumstances -- and it was even more sensitive for a President who 
did not support the Vietnam War, a stand that became a campaign issue. But he 
is attempting to take the nation beyond its deep wounds to a new beginning with 
Vietnam. This is what a President should do.

HUMANE AND NECESSARY BORDER CONTROL; NEW PLAN WILL HELP -- BUT THERE'S SO MUCH 
MORE TO BE DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's plan for a two-year "border initiative" to slow 
illegal immigration -- and attack a variety of problems associated with it -- 
is encouraging, even if it doesn't go as far as it could in dealing with a 
complex phenomenon that has been with us a long time and is not going to fade 
away in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal is encouraging in that it shows President Clinton and Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno are now trying to do something about immigration problems, 
moving to both calm hysteria and address the real challenge. Although 
immigration problems are not as severe as some restrictionists claim, this 
initiative is important because it shows the Administration is aware that U.S. 
immigration controls indeed are in need of rapid modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 The $540-million-plus initiative, outlined Thursday by Reno and Doris 
Meissner, commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, will 
assign 400 more Border Patrol agents to the busiest sector of the U.S.-Mexico 
border, south of San Diego. It also includes funds to identify illegal 
immigrants held in state prisons and to deport them. 
</P>
<P>
 These law enforcement measures will be applauded by those who fear the country 
is under siege by illegal border-crossers. So will more money for the INS to 
enforce the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which banned the 
employment of illegal immigrants. Jobs are what lure most illegal immigrants to 
this country, and anything that makes it harder for non-citizens to find work 
helps diminish the flow. Unfortunately, the most effective tool to enforce that 
law, a counterfeit-proof Social Security card, still is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 As important as added manpower is to the INS, the agency also must put more 
money into getting the equipment it needs to enforce immigration laws more 
efficiently. That means not just border lights and new vehicles but computers. 
The INS has lagged woefully behind other federal agencies, including other 
border agencies like the Customs Service, in the use of electronic data. It is 
noteworthy that Meissner has included $83 million in this funding proposal to 
computerize INS databases. While only a start, that can help prepare the INS 
for what surely will be an even bigger workload in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also encouraging that this border initiative balances its law 
enforcement components with $54 million to speed up the asylum procedure for 
legitimate refugees by more rapidly screening out fraudulent claims, and $30 
million to ease the naturalization process for 8 million legal immigrants who 
are eligible to become citizens. To use computer terminology, the INS must make 
naturalization more "user-friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Congress -- which must approve some of the funds to be used 
under the plan -- must see this border initiative as a whole and not pick it 
apart by trying, for example, to hire more Border Patrol agents instead of 
buying the necessary computers. To simply spend money on law enforcement 
without dealing with other facets of the immigration phenomenon would repeat 
the mistakes of the past -- not just 1986 but as far back as the 1920s, when 
Congress created the Border Patrol. Throwing money at problems along the border 
won't make them go away. It has to be "spent smart," to use Meissner's apt 
phrase. This new infusion of border-control money will be spent smart if it is 
spent not just on current immigration problems but in streamlining the INS so 
it is a more effective agency for the proper, humane and necessary control of 
immigration.

FARRAKHAN CONDEMNS -- OR DOES HE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At long last, Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan has disciplined an aide 
who made vicious remarks about Jews, Catholics, gays and others in a November 
speech at a New Jersey college. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan suspended the speaker, Khalid Abdul Mohammad, from important posts 
in the Nation of Islam "until he demonstrates that he is willing to conform to 
the manner of representing Allah and the honorable Elijah Muhammad," the late 
founder of the black religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking this overdue action was a significant step for Farrakhan. Still, what 
took him so long? And why the qualifications? 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan initially refused to condemn the speech. The Muslim minister, who 
himself has been an unrepentant hatemonger at times, was put off by the 
denunciations from the Anti-Defamation League and other groups. But as Khalid 
Abdul Mohammad's bigoted and false remarks were publicized, a number of 
prominent black leaders issued rebukes; amongthem were U.S. Sen. Carol 
Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.), Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), who heads the Congressional 
Black Caucus, William Gray of the United Negro College Fund, the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson and the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., NAACP executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the growing firestorm, Farrakhan finally spoke: "I found the speech after 
listening to it in context to be in a manner repugnant, malicious, 
mean-spirited and spoken in mockery of individuals and people, which is against 
the spirit of Islam." However, he undercut his point by also saying, "While I 
stand by the truth that he spoke I must condemn in the strongest terms the 
manner in which those truths were represented." Huh? What truth? 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan can't have it both ways. This controversy raises questions about 
what he is up to. How sincere is he? 
</P>
<P>
 What's sad is the huge waste of energy. Solving the serious problems that 
beset many urban black areas would be easier with Farrakhan's help, because the 
Nation of Islam performs much useful community work and has a following. But 
until Farrakhan and his aides stop spreading hatred, it will be impossible for 
many people to see this.

ANTI-ABORTION PROTEST RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial, "Good Ruling, Bad Law" (Jan. 25), was good but didn't 
explore the full impact of the U.S. Supreme Court decision permitting use of 
RICO against anti-abortion protesters. You rightly described RICO's purpose as 
punishing persons who engage in a conspiracy where intimidation and violence 
are used to achieve their goals. You also touched on the abuses because the 
RICO law is overly broad and vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Many groups along with Operation Rescue will be subject to this broader 
interpretation of RICO. The Mexican American Legal Defense Fund may find itself 
embroiled in criminal litigation if it supports more takeovers of facilities at 
UCLA. ACT UP may also be subject to RICO if it organizes or assists 
organizations that vandalize Catholic churches. 
</P>
<P>
 While the National Organization for Women states it will only use RICO in 
cases where violence is involved, it is only one pool of potential plaintiffs 
for whom RICO will be an option. The nuclear industry, toxic waste handlers, 
logging companies and the military are under no obligation to follow NOW's 
self-imposed limits on the use of RICO. 
</P>
<P>
 All our First Amendment rights have been dealt a blow by the court's decision 
to extend RICO to purely political and moral issues. Isn't it ironic that the 
single greatest restriction on our right to protest, by means of civil 
disobedience, has come about while a liberal, Democratic Administration is in 
power.  
</P>
<P>
 SEAN McCARTHY

<P>
 * You state that in light of the ruling these protest groups should 
acknowledge that their First Amendment right does not apply. The fact is that 
the First Amendment right was not raised as a defense because Operation Rescue 
believed that RICO did not apply. The First Amendment right will be argued in a 
Florida case. Many legal experts believe that the First Amendment right defense 
will prevail.

 * For 21 years an American holocaust has been carried on against the unborn. 
There have been more than 20 million innocent victims slaughtered on the altar 
of "choice." Those who are trying to stop this violence against the unborn 
because of strongly held moral convictions now face the threat of RICO. While 
we applaud the quiet heroism of Oskar Schindler and what he did to save some 
Jews from the Nazi Holocaust, we would make criminals of those who are his 
equivalent today. I am confident that history will affirm that pro-life 
activists are heroes cut from the same cloth as Schindler.

LITIGATION RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Barry Keene complains in a letter to you (Jan. 7) about the "unwarranted 
litigation" and an "out-of-control civil liability system." Keene is dealing 
with lawyer-bashing rhetoric, not with facts.The fact is, California is not a 
particularly litigious state. 
</P>
<P>
 First, in a Jan. 17 report examining the rate of lawsuits and other related 
issues, Forbes magazine concluded: "Three states with bad reputations for 
litigiousness -- New York, California and Texas -- ranked surprisingly low: New 
York in 8th place, California in 13th and Texas in 18th." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, on Jan. 20 the Commission on the Future of the California Courts 
issued the results of a two-year study. This is what the report, "Justice in 
the Balance 2020," concluded about civil justice today: "It is generally known 
that California's courts have seen a massive increase in civil litigation in 
the last 30 years; what is not as well known is that the growth in civil 
dockets has closely tracked that of the population. On a per-capita basis 
Californians are only marginally more litigious today than they were in 1960. 
Indeed, Californians enjoy a civil dispute filing rate of 'only' 6,000 cases 
per 100,000 residents, well below the national median."

EARTHQUAKE ASSISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Someone Has to Say It: We Need a Tax," Commentary, Jan. 27: 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with Catherine O'Neill's contention that California has to come up 
with some money now if it expects Congress to go along with the President's 
promises on quake relief. Maybe this even requires a temporary tax. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't let stand O'Neill's castigation of the citizenry for throwing 
politicians out who suggest raising taxes, or her scorn for spineless (but only 
Republican spineless) politicians. With all the obvious waste in Sacramento and 
Washington, do you suppose the voters have figured out that wasteful spending 
is a big problem and more tax dollars will only cause more runaway spending? Is 
it possible that voters notice that temporary taxes and fees have a way of 
becoming permanent? 
</P>
<P>
 Please inform O'Neill that the percentage of national income going to 
government is on a long-term up-trend, approaching 50% by some estimates. 
California is one of the highest tax states in the union. Maybe the citizens 
don't understand why government, in a crisis like the quake, can't do what 
citizens do in a personal crisis -- reorder priorities and temporarily reduce 
spending elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>

 * Earthquakes may not be predictable but the cry for more taxes certainly is! 
And here's O'Neill to tell us that "we need a tax" when, on the front page of 
the very same issue is the revelation "Millions in Earthquake Safety Funds 
Unspent"! If there is any wonder why many of us are resistant to more taxes, 
it's because of the repeatedly confirmed suspicions that the money raised will 
be unspent, misspent, misappropriated, "skimmed" or otherwise misused. Well, 
the $376 million is about half of the money O'Neill wants for quake recovery. 
All she has to do is figure out how to get it.

 * May I suggest two ways to help eliminate the fraud in relief lines due to 
the earthquake? One -- nearly every person carries some type of identification, 
such as a driver's license, that shows the address of the person. This can 
prove whether the person lives in the endangered area. Two -- why not use the 
system used by most theme parks to stamp the back of the hand with a substance 
that can't be washed off? This will prevent cheaters from applying at more than 
one station.

 * Is it any wonder that more and more people are turned off by their elected 
officials? Fourteen California Republican members of Congress failed to sign a 
letter sent by the delegation asking President Clinton to provide quick 
financial aid for quake victims ("Quake Financing -- Let's Get Real," 
editorial, Jan. 27). Their spokesman, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington 
Beach), used the occasion to attack non-earthquake issues, like immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 How many of those 14 Republicans would have been first to sign such a letter 
had their districts been severely hit? When will these so-called "leaders" stop 
being such ideologues and deal with the merits of issues? But I digress and ask 
too much of them.

<P>
 * After having suffered through riots, floods and fires, Southern California 
has now been struck by a devastating earthquake. No one denies the urgent need 
for help, nor the federal government's duty to provide it, but while President 
Clinton stands ready to extend it, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) asks that 
arrangements be made to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Dole propose to do that? By slightly raising taxes on the wealthiest 
in our society who can best afford it? Certainly not! By doing away with 
lingering tax-shelter loopholes that result in millionaires paying less in 
taxes than working people? Out of the question! No, what the senator proposes 
is that emergency aid be paid for by government spending cuts elsewhere. But 
where? Certainly not by cutting military expenditures. Of course we know the 
senator's answer: cut entitlements. Reduce welfare payments, Medicaid, food 
stamp programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the public really willing to go along with that? The duty of neighbors to 
help neighbors in need is deeply rooted in American tradition going back to the 
days of the frontier. But now, in modern times, when an emergency arises, 
should we continue the more recent traditions of the Reagan-Bush years to let 
the poorest, the neediest in our society pay for it, or will we rise to the 
notion of the new Administration that we should all pay our fair share, 
realizing that "fair" must at least to some extent be determined by ability to 
pay?

 * Apparently, Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the Department of Food and 
Agriculture, is bugged by the fact that people are opposed to being sprayed 
with malathion. His comment that "we won't walk away from this one" (Jan. 25) 
reveals the same bureaucratic tunnel-vision mentality that exposed hundreds of 
people to radioactivity without their consent.This guy thinks he's at war with 
the people. Unfortunately, it's our tax dollars that have provided him with an 
air force prepared to wage chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to hold accountable those who would play Russian roulette with the 
public's health and safety. It's time to look at the big picture and ask 
ourselves how is it possible that such deeds can be perpetrated on us when it 
is we who empower them? Why do we tolerate a system that lets special interests 
(agribusiness in this case) manipulate state and federal agencies to the extent 
the public is placed at risk?

LIFTING THE EMBARGO IS A TRAGIC MISTAKE; VIETNAM: ENDING SANCTIONS WITHOUT REAL 
RESULTS ON MIAS MAKES US TOTALLY RELIANT ON HANOI'S 'GOODWILL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD T. CHILDRESS and CARL W. FORD JR., Richard T. Childress was director 
of political-military affairs and Asian affairs at the National Security 
Council from 1981 to 1989. Carl W. Ford Jr. was an aide to Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) on the Foreign Relations Committee and principal deputy assistant 
secretary of defense from 1989 to 1993. Both are Vietnam veterans.

<P>
 The President's announcement Thursday that he is lifting the trade embargo on 
Vietnam and establishing a political liaison office in Hanoi was done in the 
name of the prisoner-of-war, missing-in-action issue, but was, in reality, an 
attempt to reconcile a self-created dilemma of pledging principle to the issue 
with "a wink and a nod." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of this dilemma is Hanoi's continuing failure to cooperate fully 
with U.S. POW / MIA investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has made several strong statements on U.S. policy toward Vietnam. The 
most important is a requirement that Hanoi make tangible progress in accounting 
for missing Americans before the Administration moves forward on the trade 
embargo. Last summer, the President outlined four criteria for judging the 
seriousness of Vietnam's cooperation. These included repatriation of remains, 
provision of archival materials related to missing Americans, resolution of 
last-known-alive discrepancy cases and cooperation on resolving Laotian POW / 
MIA cases. No objective and informed observer can honestly attest that any of 
these criteria have been met. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials gave the Vietnamese government a list of 84 cases 
that they expected help on before they could recommend lifting the trade 
embargo. In each, U.S. officials believe that persuasive evidence exists that 
Hanoi knows what happened to the men. Accounting for these Americans would 
provide a concrete demonstration of Vietnam's willingness to address some of 
the President's stated concerns. It would also serve as a promissory note by 
the Vietnamese to proceed with the hundreds of cases beyond the 84 that they 
could easily resolve. Recent Administration statements suggest that Vietnam has 
made measurable progress in each of the specific areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Administration's assertions, Hanoi's record of stonewalling and 
cynical manipulation for more than 20 years cannot be ignored. It is 
demonstrated in the thousands of formerly classified documents on file at the 
National Archives. One finds in these files that the cooperation forced on the 
Vietnamese in recent years -- including their handing over internal documents 
and photographs -- instead of clearing the record, demonstrates persuasively 
that they are still holding back evidence on hundreds more Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese went to great lengths to keep track of enemy personnel who came 
under their control, alive or dead. All units had been instructed on procedures 
to follow in the event they killed or captured an American -- including 
immediate notification to higher headquarters.  
</P>
<P>
 At aircraft crash sites, for example, teams carefully collected any artifacts. 
Items were catalogued, photographed and inspected for intelligence value. In 
some instances, Russian and Chinese intelligence specialists were also allowed 
access to the sites. Recovered materials were sent to regional storage sites or 
to Hanoi. Most of this material is still being held. 
</P>
<P>
 Dead Americans were similarly photographed and catalogued. Remains were often 
buried immediately at crash sites and locations of the graves recorded. A year 
or more later, teams recovered the remains, preserved them as they did for 
their own and reburied or stored them above ground in designated locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this process, detailed records were kept. Although over the years 
Hanoi has returned some of these remains, U.S. intelligence estimates that the 
Vietnamese could readily provide hundreds more. Cooperation is more than just a 
humanitarian gesture on Vietnam's part; it is a crucial step in resolving the 
question of Americans who may still be in Indochina -- the discrepancy cases. 
Unless U.S. officials can document more accurately who died, they cannot 
determine who may have survived but did not return.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Vietnamese officials continue to hold back key documents they know are 
crucial to the accounting process, while providing a large volume of 
inconsequential materials to create the impression of cooperation and progress. 
Now the same officials, using words strikingly similar to those they have used 
for two decades, are again claiming that they hold no more American remains. As 
with the documents, these denials ring hollow. Vietnamese records and 
photographs provided since 1992 back up previous intelligence and diplomatic 
admissions that they continue to hold hundreds of remains, or can provide 
persuasive explanations why some remains may not be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the Administration, apparently in an attempt to demonstrate progress, 
cite the repatriation of 67 individual remains this year as the third-highest 
since the end of the war. What they are not saying is that for the most part, 
these are fragmentary remains turned over by villagers and fragments from crash 
sites, some of which show previous excavation activity by Vietnam. 
Historically, only 10% to 20% of such remains are American. And it is a new 
process of counting. 
</P>
<P>
 To the best of our knowledge, Vietnam has not provided a single set of remains 
from the list of 84 MIAs given to them months ago. Until they do, it is not 
credible to assert that the President's criteria on the repatriation of remains 
has been met. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Vietnamese have provided more than 21,000 documents, photos and 
artifacts since 1992, only 1% has pertained to missing Americans. The bulk of 
the information is on Americans returned from captivity in 1973 or previously 
accounted for during the war or subsequent repatriation. We should of course 
give Hanoi credit for the materials provided thus far, but volume can never 
substitute for quality.  
</P>
<P>
 On Laos, Vietnamese documents and information also hold the key, and they have 
not yet been provided. 
</P>
<P>
 In one year, the Clinton Administration has moved further and faster toward 
meeting Vietnam's stated humanitarian, economic and political objectives and 
needs, provided more subsidies to Vietnamese officials for POW / MIA activities 
and given them more public praise on this issue than any preceding 
administration. Unfortunately, it has not persuaded Hanoi to share with us the 
vital information we know they still hold. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time they were praising the Vietnamese, U.S. officials removed the 
National League of Families from the interagency process and abolished the POW 
/ MIA interagency group. They have refused to provide the league with timely 
reports on joint activities or evaluations, even unclassified ones. More 
important, the Administration also eliminated league participation in 
negotiations in Hanoi. League participation in interagency deliberations was 
vitally important because of its members' expertise, and their interaction with 
the Vietnamese was crucial in demonstrating our seriousness and solidarity in 
negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
 We believe that lifting the trade embargo and normalizing relations with 
Vietnam would be in the U.S. and Asian regional interest, and might have helped 
provide additional information on the POW / MIA issue, if serious negotiations 
had followed the President's criteria. But lifting the trade embargo now 
without achieving real results is a tragic mistake. It will dash the hopes of 
the families who have been waiting so long for answers, place the 
Administration in the position of relying solely on Hanoi's "goodwill" and risk 
eroding further the American peoples' trust in government. What we need from 
our officials now is honesty, candor and negotiations, not hype.  
</P>
<P>
 The success or failure of Clinton's decision will be easy to measure, based on 
the response from Hanoi on the President's own POW / MIA criteria.

PERSPECTIVE ON EARTHQUAKE RELIEF; A WAY TO HELP VICTIMS HELP THEMSELVES; 
GRANTING A FULL FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTION FOR CASUALTY LOSSES IS FAIR, GIVEN THE 
IMPOSSIBILITY OF FULL INSURANCE COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. KOLKEY, Daniel M. Kolkey, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn & 
Crutcher, lives near the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are the forgotten quake victims, in danger of falling (literally) through 
the cracks. They live in homes with broken water heaters, shattered 
televisions, collapsed chimneys and cracked walls, repairs for which will run 
into the thousands of dollars. They don't qualify for housing assistance, but 
they need assistance with their housing. They are taxpayers for whom the only 
federal relief is a loan from Washington -- that is, they can borrow back (with 
interest) some of their past tax contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for the federal government to help these disaster victims 
help themselves -- without red tape, lines or handouts -- by allowing them to 
deduct the full amount of their losses from their taxes. Under Section 165 of 
the Internal Revenue Code, you can deduct only that portion of your loss above 
10% of your gross adjusted income, plus another $100. For example, someone with 
a $40,000 adjusted gross income cannot deduct the first $4,100 of damage; 
someone earning $80,000 cannot deduct the first $8,100 in damage. In other 
words, a large number of needy quake victims cannot recover a penny. Yet, 
according to a Los Angeles Times poll, 42% of those within five miles of the 
quake's epicenter reported cracked walls, shattered windows or worse. And 25% 
estimated damages of at least $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The elimination of this unreasonably high obstacle to deducting losses makes 
particular sense for quake victims: They cannot easily insure against limited 
(but expensive) losses, because earthquake insurance, unlike that for many 
other types of natural disasters -- fire, flood and wind -- has very high 
deductibles, often 10% of a policy's value. Combined with the unreasonably high 
10% restriction on tax deductions, many quake victims are left between a rock 
and a hard place. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what are the objections to offering some tax relief? 
</P>
<P>
 * If the restriction is lifted for earthquake victims, it will have to be 
lifted for any victim of a natural disaster. The simplest answer to this 
objection is perhaps that it should be. However, it need not. Congress could 
eliminate the restriction only for those disasters eligible for federal 
disaster relief assistance. Or, the restriction on deductions could be lifted 
for those disasters, like quakes, where high insurance deductibles make it more 
difficult to insure fully against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Granting a full deduction for quake victims would cost the federal 
government too much money. For at least the past five years, California 
taxpayers have paid more to the federal government than the state receives 
back. In that light, it is not too much to ask that the federal government 
allow California quake victims to keep more of their earnings in their hour of 
need. Certainly, federal assistance to those who suffer a natural disaster is 
one of government's more legitimate functions. Besides, federal concerns over 
cost would be more persuasive if federal funds weren't presently being wasted. 
But the commendably prompt federal earthquake assistance has been afflicted 
with fraud in the distribution of food stamps and housing vouchers. A tax 
deduction, at least, allows legitimate victims to take prompt action while 
granting the government time to verify eligibility, as it does with any 
deduction.  
</P>
<P>
 * A full deduction benefits those in higher tax brackets more than those in 
lower tax brackets. However, that is true of all deductions. Taxpayers in 
higher brackets benefit more from deductions because they pay a larger 
percentage of their income in taxes. This objection, taken to its logical 
conclusion, would argue against any deductions (including the home mortgage 
interest deduction) because those in higher brackets always benefit more. Have 
we really reached the point where we will object to any policy that assists the 
very taxpayers whose taxes support the government's largess? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who support lifting the unduly high 10% restriction on deductions for 
quake losses should write the President, our senators and representatives. Let 
our elected officials know that how they treat us on April 15 will influence 
how we treat them on Nov. 8. As Winston Churchill observed, democracy is not a 
spectator sport.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / PAUL DEAN: LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL; WHAT'S WELL-BEHAVED, 
LOTS OF FUN, RELIABLE AND GOOD LOOKING TO BOOT? MUST BE A CELICA. THE ONLY 
DRAWBACK IS PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For six generations -- that's 26 in automobile years -- Toyota's Celica has 
been the little rascal of the litter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Celica only adds to that aura and cheeky allure. 
</P>
<P>
 The car remains small and pert, not quite a red-blooded sports car, certainly 
no tame, two-door variant of a family sedan, but a lively, sporty, friendly 
coupe built for those who like to let a car romp in its sneakers once in a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
 Celica's lines are completely fresh and quite daring. Its combination of 
inset, lightly flared, doe-eyed and bull's-eye headlights is borrowed from the 
Lexus SC300. The rounded roof line and sides, and slightly puffed-out rear end 
comes from the all-potent Supra. The message here: If you have to crib, always 
go for the most appealing features and keep it in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two four-cylinder engine packages in the lineup -- a 1.8-liter 
developing 110 horsepower for the base Celica ST, and a 2.2-liter good for 135 
horsepower in the more gymnastic GT. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver and passenger-side air bags are standard on both models. Anti-lock 
brakes are an $825 option. If the Celica GT were a pizza, everything on it 
would include optional cruise control, leather trim package, 15-inch alloy 
wheels, power moon roof, eight-speaker sound system with equalizer and 
diversity antenna, rear spoiler, and a buttoned-down suspension for more 
serious road work. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, of course, Toyota reliability that each year comes closer to resolving 
the theory of perpetual motion. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is wrong with this picture of good looks and healthy technology? 
</P>
<P>
 Price. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the dollar has bashed the yen senseless. The Celica -- 
unlike portions of Camry and Corolla production -- is manufactured entirely in 
Japan. So while domestic builders are raising 1994 prices by $400 or less, 
stickers on 1994 Celicas will be between $1,500 and $1,800 higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Toyota's options are typically a smidge more expensive than the 
competition -- air conditioning, for example, in a Celica is $975 versus $850 
in its archrival, the Mazda MX-6. 
</P>
<P>
 So although a base model Celica ST sounds within budget at $16,508, a few 
basic goodies -- such as air conditioning and anti-lock brakes -- will easily 
ring up the price to $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even young bloods with more hormones than sense might have trouble justifying 
$18,898 for a Celica GT -- rapidly inflated to $24,719 by options and primarily 
three items: air conditioning ($975), premium sound ($1,200) and sport package 
($1,565) with its leather-faced seats, stiffer suspension, and more floggable 
tires and wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 And there still is no V-6 engine -- unlike the heavier, quicker, roomier Ford 
Probe and Mazda MX-6. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But let's not dismiss Toyota so easily. 
</P>
<P>
 For there is the definite lure of Celica's engineering quality, full attention 
paid to tight assembly, and the discernible superiority of Toyota mechanicals. 
Solid systems produce veracity of handling, a confidence that no matter what is 
asked of the vehicle, no matter the emergency action or driver reaction, the 
car likely will not fail and will do its best to sort things out. 
</P>
<P>
 Such depth of quality is measured by subtleties. How solid the closing of 
doors with no latch rattles, window clatters or similar aftershocks? How true 
the touch of turn signals or the lack of slop in cranking down windows? 
</P>
<P>
 In such matters, Toyota has all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 We drove the potent GT and tamer ST, both with five-speeds because automatic 
transmissions muffle the feel of a car better than stroking the cat in oven 
mitts. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it, the GT is a two-place roller skate, a greased dodgem in 
traffic. The ST is milder, but not by much. In fact, bearing price differential 
in mind, we seriously doubt the GT's quicker acceleration and equipment 
upgrades are worth the extra $2,390. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrap-around interiors -- cockpit style with the hefty center divider of 
console armrest and gearshift table -- are identical. 
</P>
<P>
 It's cuddly inside, maybe a little too snug for those broad of beam or tall of 
torso. But the placement of instruments and manual controls, improved 
visibility, the range of seat adjustment -- complete with height settings -- 
and the grip of those chairs are high examples of maximum consideration for 
those who must occupy or will be slung around inside this vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for back seats. Like all sport coupes and 2+2s, they are upholstered 
dents. One adult, sentenced to sprawl across both, didn't stop complaining from 
Encino to LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celica comes as notchback or hatchback. Both rear openings are effortless 
and the baggage room is larger than one would expect in a sport coupe. But 
lift-overs are thigh-high, which isn't overly polite. 
</P>
<P>
 On freeway and highway, the Celica ST is not likely to bring fear to the eyes 
of Mustang GT owners. But in the hands of the capable, the car's agility in 
maneuvering around traffic and darting through diminishing gaps more than makes 
up for any lack of flat-out dead-straight power. 
</P>
<P>
 Brakes grab as they should. Setting up for corners and powering through them 
brings a tell-all response from the steering. Shifting has been smoothed out, 
not to the point of being a glycerin vacuum, but with enough resistance to 
allow a feeling passage through the gears. 
</P>
<P>
 The ST's initial acceleration, with zero to 60 m.p.h. times in the low nines, 
is not as limp as one might expect from a base model. But there's a tendency 
for power to peak early and maintaining rapid, jinking progress over the 
asphalt requires a fair amount of dexterity with the gearbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the road and engine noise associated with earlier Celicas has been 
dampened. But once you put spurs to that relatively small twin-cam engine, the 
mechanical gnashing starts and it certainly is loud enough to intrude on 
conversational moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not an object of cardinal value, this is a pleasant, well-behaved car 
that in caring hands will deliver incessant fun. 
</P>
<P>

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: BUT WHAT OF THE BARNEYS' OPENING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's happening at Barneys? 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't been asked that question lately, you probably don't know -- or 
care -- about the answer. That's cool. But we think gossiping about the New 
York-based store's long-awaited Beverly Hills debut is a refreshing break from 
"Disasters Bring Out the Best In Us" stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last fall, insiders say, Barneys reps swooped into town, looking for a 
charity to honor at the store's opening celebration. Months passed. Last week, 
the store advertised for sales help. This week, workers hosed off the imposing 
five-story structure's tiled entry and put finishing touches on the decorative 
wrought iron work. Yet still no word on opening festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not even a note saying, 'It was very nice meeting you,' " said a liaison 
between the store and various charities. "It's alienated a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 That's something L.A.'s high-end stores try hard to avoid. Hooking up with the 
right charities -- whose members have style, influence and sizable clothing 
allowances -- can bring in a steady stream of loyal customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armani store, for example, is ingratiating itself with the Children's 
Action Network -- founders include Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg, Nancy 
Daly, Lorraine and Sid Sheinberg -- today and Saturday by donating a hefty 20% 
of members' purchases to the charity. Next week, a select group of women will 
descend on Chanel for lunch and a look at the label's spring collection. 
Proceeds from the $200-a-ticket event go to Education First! a group led by 
Lynda (Mrs. Peter) Guber.  
</P>
<P>
 Barneys will open "either March 4 or 5" is all a store publicist in New York 
could tell us, adding: "I can't be quoted." Those who can be quoted were 
apparently too busy to talk. But we hear locals can look forward to a very 
early, very no-frills breakfast on that day, followed by a stampede to the 
clothing racks. Good News, Bad News: Much to the relief of women who color 
their hair, a study by the American Cancer Society concludes that using 
permanent hair dyes does not increase a woman's overall risk of dying of 
cancer. But the nationwide study, published this week in the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute, found that women who had used black hair dye for 20 
years or more had about four times greater risk of dying of non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma and multiple myeloma than those who never used dye. 
</P>
<P>
 That group of women, all 30 and older, represented only 0.6% of the 180,000 
women in the study who dyed their hair at all, and there were only five deaths 
involved, the researchers said. Franny and Janny: When that most un-nannyish of 
nannies Fran Drescher appears on "Arsenio" on Feb. 8, she'll be dressed for the 
occasion in Todd Oldham. And she didn't pay retail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, what a surprise," you're saying. But that wasn't always the case. 
Drescher -- who showed us how to work an outfit in "The Big Picture" -- had to 
be shown the celebrity-discount shopping ropes by the Star's fashion guru, 
Janet Charlton. Charlton introduced Drescher, star of CBS' "The Nanny," to 
Oldham, and the rest is probably fashion history. The only problem, complained 
Drescher at a recent fashion soiree, is that she's too thin to fit into 
Oldham's sample sizes. Poor baby. Forever Young: We couldn't wait to scrutinize 
Shirley Lord, beauty director for Vogue magazine. And she didn't let us down, 
showing up for breakfast with flawless skin, a most flattering shade of pink 
lipstick, just the right amount of jewelry and a great haircut. This was after 
tinkering late into the night with complicated seating arrangements for a Conde 
Nast dinner in her honor two days hence in New York.

 "I used to work for (Vogue Editor) Anna Wintour's father on Fleet Street," 
Lord said of her time as a young journalist in London. "A marvelous editor. But 
I don't dare mention that around the office," she said with a laugh, "no one 
looks older than 16." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord was in Los Angeles to promote her new book, "My Sister's Keeper," a saga 
of ambition, romance and greed set in the cut-throat cosmetics business -- all 
fiction, of course. Fiction meets reality, though, in the beauty world's 
exhaustive search for an anti-aging potion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wants the knife, when a creme will do?" Lord said. "There's alpha hydroxy 
acids, Retin-A, lipids . . . and now the French are using estrogen replacement 
therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 And which products does Lord favor? Erno Laszlo, always, for cleansing. "After 
that, I try everything." No Crumbling Foundations Here: Speaking of good 
grooming, makeup maven Eugenia Weston wants us to look good when the Big One 
hits.  
</P>
<P>
 Cynics may scoff at the notion that adding lipstick to your emergency quake 
kit can "help calm the psyche and restore a sense of outer- and inner-harmony." 
But we'd argue that lining our lips masterfully in M.A.C's plum liner gives us 
an edge in a world gone mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are Weston's six quake-kit essentials: a lipstick that doubles as a 
blush, a conditioning stick (such as Vitamin E) for eyes and lips, a toner for 
cleansing, mascara, a concealer wand that doubles as foundation, and a 
medium-brown pencil for brows and eye shadow. Sui Talk: Anna Sui will open a 
boutique at Bullock's Beverly Center on March 3 and hopes they'll put up a few 
Aubrey Beardsley posters to capture the mood of her La Brea Avenue shop.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is a woman who goes to tea at Campanile in an Edwardian brown 
velvet tunic from her fall collection and carries an old lady pocket book in 
muddy-color tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sui frequently visits Los Angeles, she has yet to catch sight of her 
glitziest customers -- Julia Roberts and Winona Ryder. She did, however, spy 
Ryder in a magazine, dressed in a Sui chiffon and velvet evening dress. "I 
search out Movieline, Entertainment Weekly, and I love the Star. They're the 
best fashion magazines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sui said her friend Marc Jacobs is all but back in business, designing a 
collection for Iceberg, an Italian jeans label. (So is Sui.) And he's talking 
about showing a collection of his own during New York fashion week in March. 
Let It Snow . . . Not!: The owners of Mann's Chinese Theatre nixed New York 
designer Isaac Mizrahi's plan to have snow fall from the ceiling and cover the 
theater during a segment in his May 5 fashion show for AIDS Project Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 But the chain-smoking Mizrahi, in town this week to scope out the venue, will 
have his way on plenty of other aspects of the show, from custom-made stage 
costumes to a premiere showing of a film about . . . Isaac Mizrahi. We wouldn't 
miss it.

YOUR WHEELS / RALPH VARTABEDIAN: BUICK DESIGNS FOR SENIORS -- QUIETLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Question: I am 75 and have a Toyota Celica, which is dependable but difficult 
to get into. Can you suggest which mid-size new car is easiest to get in and 
out of and which cars appeal most to older people? S.F.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: For decades, auto makers have focused a disproportionate amount of 
their marketing efforts on younger motorists, designing everything to appeal to 
people under 40. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the American public ages, design trends will shift. In addition, 
automobile designers are getting much more sophisticated about ergonomic 
features that will add to the ease and comfort of every age group. What 
improves comfort for a 75-year-old driver like yourself can also appeal to a 
35-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no automobile line identifies with older drivers more than General 
Motors' Buick division, which designs cars with the special needs of older 
drivers in mind, although it does not advertise cars that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Roe, section head for Buick's human factors group, says Buick has long 
considered designing and marketing a car specifically for older drivers but has 
always backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is concern that people may not want to be identified as older oriented 
by the car they drive," Roe says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addressing the needs of older drivers, Buick designers say they consider 
everything from overall dimensions to minor accessories. For example, Buick 
designs its floor and column shifts for people with arthritis who can't exert a 
lot of thumb pressure to release the safety button on a floor shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Something as basic as ease of entry and exit involves a lot of design issues. 
Buick recently hired a designer whose thesis for a doctorate was on analyzing 
body motions in entering and exiting a car, Roe says. 
</P>
<P>
 The major considerations in entry are the rocker panel height, floor pan 
height, seat height, door opening and roof panel height. Obviously, entry is 
easiest if a motorist can pivot into a seat without climbing up or lowering the 
body. One of the easiest vehicles for an older driver to enter is a compact 
pickup, Roe says. The seat height for a Chevy S10, for example, is 260 
millimeters above the ground, just about perfect for the average-size person. 
</P>
<P>
 Most family sedans have seat heights of 260 to 270 millimeters, but they have 
rocker panels drivers must lift their feet over, and they sometimes have seats 
placed further inside the vehicle than a small pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports cars are the most challenging vehicles for entry and exit. Cars such as 
the Pontiac Firebird have seats down at the 170 millimeter level, low enough 
that you have to use muscle to lower yourself into the seat and to climb out. 
</P>
<P>
 At the high end are minivans. The Chevy Lumina APV has a seat 380 millimeters 
from the ground, higher than even a full-size pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cars, big or small, provide the same door opening space. A two-door coupe 
has a larger door, but that is to provide access to the rear. The door of a 
four-door sedan, because it is smaller, can be opened wider in tight spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although seat height and related dimensions are not available to the average 
car buyer, you can probably find a car that fits your body with a reasonable 
amount of shopping.

 The Scene: Wednesday's premiere of HBO's "State of Emergency" at the Directors 
Guild. An hors d'oeuvres reception preceded the screening; desserts came 
afterward.One reason the food was served first: The film's graphic depiction of 
an overcrowded, under-equipped county emergency room was, in the words of one 
guest, "not exactly appetite inducing." Some guests left the theater during the 
hemoglobin-heavy operation scenes. "By watching the audience," one woman said, 
"you could tell who dissected the frog in biology class and who didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars, Joe Mantegna, Lynn Whitfield, Paul Dooley and 
Melinda Dillon; director Lesli Linka Glatter; plus 550 guests, including Howard 
Hesseman, Clarence Williams, Eric Stoltz, Ayre Gross, and artists Clayton 
Campbell and Lita Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: The film's co-screenwriter, Dr. Lance Gentile, joked that what he'd 
learned as a doctor was to never say "Oops!" if something slips while working 
on a patient. Always say "There!" He also said his one overriding thought at 
the premiere was: "This is my Warholian 15 minutes and they're counting down." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical Advice: Director Glatter's words on L.A. emergency room care after 
months of research: "If you're in bad shape -- I mean really, really bad shape 
-- you're better off at County-USC because they have the surgeons on duty. But 
after they treat you, get moved." 
</P>
<P>
 Trend: The paparazzi now bring Game Boys and Sega Game Gear to amuse 
themselves while they await celebrity arrivals. One photographer said playing 
the games has helped him develop patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagline: Chatting about the state of cable TV, Howard Hesseman said: "It's 
getting really goofy out there. Without some kind of Information Highway 
Patrol, we'll end up with a hermaphrodite bowling channel. And there's probably 
an audience for it."

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; THE PATH TO WOMANHOOD CUTS ACROSS 2 COLOR LINES; COFFEE 
WILL MAKE YOU BLACK, BY APRIL SINCLAIR ; HYPERION: $19.95, 239 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERONICA CHAMBERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alongtime favorite as a work in progress on the Northern California reading 
circuit, April Sinclair's off-beat debut novel, "Coffee Will Make You Black," 
tells the story of Stevie, a black girl growing up in the 1960s on Chicago's 
South Side. Whether she's dealing with a subject as monumental as the civil 
rights movement or as intimate as Stevie's first sexual encounters, Sinclair 
never fails to make you laugh and never sacrifices the narrative to make a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama, are you a virgin?" is the first line in the book, and in one simple 
sentence we see both Stevie's naivete and her boldness. She is bold because 
Mama is a no-nonsense woman intent on bettering her family's -- and in 
particularly Stevie's -- lot. Mama, the first black teller at First National 
Bank, like so many blacks of her generation, is obsessed with skin color; 
hence, the novel's title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coffee will make you black" was said to discourage children from drinking 
coffee, because no one wanted to be as dark as coffee. "The only thing I want 
black is a Cadillac," was another popular saying. In the '50s and '60s, there 
were a hundred maxims that prized light-skinned blacks over their darker 
brothers and sisters. Sinclair makes good use of them all, with the 
anthropological flair that Zora Neale Hurston employed in "Their Eyes Were 
Watching God." 
</P>
<P>
 While Stevie's mother, a dark-skinned woman, holds on to outdated notions of 
skin color, Stevie's grandmother, a progressive business owner, is quick to 
jump onto the '60s bandwagon of "Black is beautiful." When Stevie decides to 
shun her mother's teaching and get an Afro, it is her grandmother's pride that 
gives her strength to do so: 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandma, how come your skin's so soft and smooth? Do you use Ivory liquid?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Chile, good black don't crack," Grandma answers. Grandma carries herself like 
a queen. She's tall and big-boned and wears her gray hair in French braids. She 
has what she calls laughing eyes and says she's proud of her large nose and 
full lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevie's world is the South Side of Chicago, but Sinclair doesn't objectify 
the neighborhood and gives the story all the tenderness of "Our Town." She 
steers clear of both the harsh ghetto portrayal of TV's "Good Times" and the 
theatrical drama of "A Raisin in the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even at an early age, the people around Stevie work hard not to insulate 
her from what they see as the hard, cold realities of a black woman's 
existence. As her best friend's mother tells her: "There is nobody out there 
for you. If you make it in this world, you're gonna have to make it by your 
lonesome. Do you hear me? Cinderella was not written about the Negro woman. Do 
you understand?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning of the novel, Stevie is obsessed with being cool; pretty 
soon, she achieves her goal. Her spunk and outspokenness enable her to become 
best friends with the most popular girl in the school, Carla. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the civil rights movement grows and Stevie enters high school, she 
begins to shift her priorities. She is no easy revolutionary, but within her 
things are changing. It is in these deft passages that we see Sinclair's 
talents as a writer emerge. One of the most moving moments in the book is when 
Stevie's mother, so often distant and reserved, surprises her with a present -- 
a bag full of bleaching creams: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Mama, where have you been? Don't you know that black is beautiful?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I know that black is supposed to be beautiful, but you use these bleaching 
creams, just in case.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up from the angle I was drawing. 'Just in case what, Mama?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Just in case it's a fad and people go back to thinking the way they've 
always thought. Don't fool yourself. Deep down, black men are still 
colorstruck. . . . You're from the wrong side of the tracks. You can't afford 
to be too dark on top of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stevie dates several guys throughout the course of the book, she is 
most troubled by her friendship with an older, white woman -- Nurse Horn. 
Whether it's a school-girl crush or something more, Stevie's feelings bother 
her . . . and her cool best friend, Carla. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the novel, it is unclear what Stevie's sexual orientation is. 
What is clear is that Stevie is a wonderful character, whose bold curiosity and 
witty self-confidence -- through Sinclair's straight-talking words -- make her 
easy to love.

BRIT LAWMAKERS TAKE ISSUE WITH 'NAME OF FATHER'; MOVIES: JIM SHERIDAN'S FILM 
ABOUT THE GUILDFORD FOUR RECEIVES A SPECIAL SCREENING AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. 
IT GETS MIXED REVIEWS, WITH MOST CRITICIZING ITS ACCURACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As advance screenings of major movies go, it wasn't exactly conventional. Only 
5% of those invited showed up, and the film was temporarily halted halfway 
through because the audience had other important business to attend to. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the special screening this week for British lawmakers of Jim Sheridan's 
film "In the Name of the Father," held in Committee Room 20 at the seat of 
Britain's Parliament -- Westminster's House of Commons -- was widely judged a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, is about Gerry Conlon, one of the 
Guildford Four -- three Irishmen and a woman convicted of planting a bomb in a 
pub in 1974 that killed five and injured 64. Their convictions were overturned 
after appeals, by which time they had been in jail for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Name of the Father" opens here next Friday, as British politicians are 
wrestling with the prospect of a peace accord over the future of Northern 
Ireland, and debating whether to negotiate with the Irish Republican Army, 
which admits numerous terrorist acts over the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The screening was organized by New Consensus, a Parliamentary caucus of 
lawmakers from various parties. Later, opposition Labour MP Harry Barnes, joint 
president of the caucus, gave "In the Name of the Father" a mixed reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "If art could be divorced from life, which it can't," said Barnes, "this film 
would be artistically and dramatically brilliant. In turning reality into 
drama, some license is inevitable. However, this stunning and well-acted film 
rather oversimplifies and cuts too many corners. Unintentionally it hides 
important parts of the history of a terrible miscarriage of justice that 
happened to the Guildford Four . . . the film is superb but flawed." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes added that Conlon's alibi for the night of the Guildford bombings was 
actually revealed by a police inquiry, and that the film failed to show the 
efforts of British MPs in righting the wrong against the Four. "These points 
illustrate that the legal system is not entirely vicious, corrupt and 
anti-Irish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative MP Peter Bottomley, another joint president of New Consensus, 
said: "People I spoke to afterward were glad they had seen it." Some members of 
his party thought Sheridan had given a false account of how Irish Republican 
prisoners were treated. But, said Bottomley, others might modify their 
attitudes slightly toward Northern Ireland because of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 35 lawmakers, of a possible 650, attended the screening; while that 
sounds like a low figure, New Consensus chair Gary Kent described it as "a high 
attendance for a special-interest event." The MPs were joined by peace 
activists, peers from the House of Lords and a police representative. 
</P>
<P>
 The film was halted halfway through, as lawmakers were called to the Commons 
chamber to vote on a crucial finance bill. After it finally ended, Sheridan 
took questions, defending the film against charges of inaccuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Sheridan called the screening "a useful exercise. I think some MPs were 
shocked by the film," he said. He responded to those who wondered if the film's 
inaccuracies (like the fact that Conlon and his father never shared a jail 
cell) did not strengthen the case against the Guildford Four. "But there is no 
case against the Four," he said. "I started with the presumption they were 
innocent."  
</P>
<P>
 While it remains to be seen how the British moviegoing public will receive the 
film, the media have already weighed in -- mostly negatively. Sheridan 
personally has felt some heat: "One or two journalists have been a bit nasty," 
he said, "but I think they felt they had to be." On BBC Radio's influential 
talk show "Start the Week," for example, questions directed at Sheridan were 
tough but not hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 But an article in the current Spectator magazine lambastes the film. Its 
author, Alasdair Palmer, who has worked on several TV docudramas, writes: "For 
the majority of people who will leave the cinema thinking they have seen a 
shocking true story, the film is not so much a failure as a fraud. The whole 
attempt to make any kind of political statement is fatally compromised by the 
blatant falsehoods it contains. For most of the people who see it -- and they 
will be Americans -- this will be the only version they know."

POD PEOPLE RETURN, RE-ENERGIZED

 "They're out there, they're everywhere. They get you while you sleep." And now 
they're back. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Body Snatchers" is at least the third version of Jack Finney's classic 
pulp science-fiction tale of sinister pods from outer space who take over 
unsuspecting humans and turn them into unfeeling automatons. Director Don 
Siegel did the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" in 1956, and given 
that Phil Kaufman didn't even come close to improving on it in 1978, Abel 
Ferrara may seem foolhardy to try it again today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ferrara hasn't merely remade "Body Snatchers"; he has reimagined and 
reinvigorated it, using the best of special-effects talent and cool directorial 
skill to turn out a splendidly creepy and unsettling piece of genre filmmaking 
that knows how to scare you and isn't afraid to try. 
</P>
<P>
 The people "Body Snatchers" have scared the most, apparently, are the 
executives at Warner Bros., who have been sitting on this disturbing chiller 
for at least a year, and are only now giving it the kind of limited release 
(one puny theater, the Festival in Westwood) usually associated with delicate 
tea-bag dramas, not brazen epics of paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 For one of the things that Ferrara and his five credited screenwriters 
(screenplay by Stuart Gordon & Dennis Paoli and Nicholas St. John, story by 
Raymond Cistheri and Larry Cohen) have done is change the emphasis from the 
protest against conformity that characterized the Siegel version to a look at 
the more modern terror of paranoia, of not knowing who is going to turn on you 
or when the betrayal will take place. 
</P>
<P>
 To restrict himself within the limits of the remake of a classic may seem like 
an odd choice for as visceral director as Ferrara, a man with a reputation for 
doing out-there outlaw cinema ranging from his early "Ms. 45" to the more 
recent "Bad Lieutenant." 
</P>
<P>
 But these restrictions don't negate Ferrara's abilities, they merely focus 
them. And because "Body Snatchers' " story is so familiar to so many filmgoers, 
the film benefits considerably from his ability to energize a situation, to 
keep audiences fixed on the screen though they know what's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Clocking in at a lean 90 minutes, "Body Snatchers" also has the advantage of 
wasting no time getting into the story, shrewdly set this time at an Army base 
in the South where people are so habitually obedient it is doubly difficult to 
determine who is a soulless pod and who is just following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 New at the base are the Malone family, father Steve (Terry Kinney) being a 
visiting scientist from the Environmental Protection Agency assigned to 
investigate hazardous waste. With him are his second wife, Carol (Meg Tilly), 
their 5-year-old son Andy (Reilly Murphy) and heroine Marti (Gabrielle Anwar), 
Steve's rebellious daughter from his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 While Steve pokes around the base and commiserates with Maj. Collins (an edgy 
Forest Whitaker), the head of medical care who has a slew of patients 
"exhibiting paranoia about other people's identities," Marti is hanging out 
with Jenn (Christine Elise), the commander's wayward daughter, and a handsome 
helicopter pilot named Tim (Billy Wirth). But these young people barely have 
time to get acquainted before the pods take over with a vengeance and 
pandemonium breaks out all over. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of the latest in movie magic technology, special makeup 
artists Tom Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman have endowed this version of "Body 
Snatchers" with the most graphic version yet of how the pods go about their 
nefarious business. Definitely not for the squeamish, the film's ghoulish 
transformation scenes are both beautiful and repellent, filmed with awe and a 
touch of mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Horrific as all this is, "Body Snatchers" has more than technology going for 
it. Both composer Joe Delia, who wrote a classically disturbing score, and 
cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, whose searchlight-lit scene of the pods being 
harvested is completely chilling, are major forces in helping Ferrara create 
the film's palpable sense of unease and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 From these big concerns to small but unforgettable moments like the pods' 
hair-raising warning signal, director Ferrara has envisioned this movie whole 
from beginning to end. The world does not quite look the same when "Body 
Snatchers" is over, and there is little more you can ask of a 
science-fiction/horror film than that.

SIGNATURE OF QUIRKY COMEDY, GREAT CHARACTERS AND SMART DIALOGUE. THOUGH 
SPLENDID IN PARTS, IT'S A DISJOINTED WHOLE.

 Just about the first thing anyone says to struggling actor Matt Hobbs, the 
center of James L. Brooks' idiosyncratic and entertaining "I'll Do Anything," 
is this heartfelt declaration from the woman who is briefly to be his wife: 
"Your feeling toward your work is one of the things I love most about you." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an admiration that writer-director Brooks not surprisingly shares. 
Because many of the traits that characterize actors, from a focus on insecurity 
to unapologetic emotionality and the willingness to take huge risks in front of 
as wide an audience as possible, can be applied to his work as well, especially 
to his marvelous last two films, "Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News." 
</P>
<P>
 So it's also no surprise that while his first feature since 1987 is in part a 
warm tribute to the acting profession, Brooks would hardly leave it at that. 
"I'll Do Anything" is also a two-couple romantic comedy, a study of an 
especially prickly father-daughter relationship and a gleeful skewering of 
aspects of modern Hollywood. It was even at one point supposed to be a musical, 
but something like nine songs by Prince, one by Sinead O'Connor and 
choreography by Twyla Tharp got very publicly left by the wayside when test 
audiences balked at their inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left after the music is what audiences have always responded to in 
Brooks' work: the cockeyed sense of life, the daring and quirky comedy, the 
great torrents of words that practically explode out of the air. No one writes 
characters quite like this, in fact no one since Joseph L. Mankiewicz decades 
ago has so consistently put such smart dialogue on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But in trying to do so much, Brooks inevitably runs the risk of stumbling. His 
films have always been loose-limbed balancing acts, with audiences wondering 
whether he'll manage to stay on the wire or not. With "I'll Do Anything," 
Brooks doesn't actually fall off, but he does slip. 
</P>
<P>
 For though it includes many laugh-out-loud moments and fine and lively 
performances by stars Nick Nolte, Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Joely 
Richardson, Tracey Ullman and tiny dynamo Whittni Wright, this film falls short 
of holding together. A triumph of individual parts more than a coherent whole, 
"Anything" has a ragged, haphazard feel, possibly rooted in the way it was 
conceived, that ends in dissatisfaction despite the considerable pleasures it 
provides along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the film's greatest pleasure is its cast of characters, all of whom 
(including clever cameos by Ian McKellen, Robert Joy, Harry Shearer and Rosie 
O'Donnell) manage to be thoroughly engaging despite being burdened, in typical 
Brooks fashion, with more than their share of neurotic, obsessive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's a measure of how psychologically shaky everyone in "I'll Do 
Anything" is that unemployed actor Matt Hobbs (Nolte) comes off as almost 
stable by comparison. When the film's main action begins, Matt is divorced from 
ex-wife Beth (Ullman) and hasn't seen 6-year-old daughter Jeannie (Wright) in 
three years, a situation that is about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 For though the out-of-work Matt pleads that "the only full-time job I seem to 
have is not showing how scared I am," Beth, a fanatical mother who believes 
"there is no such thing as spoiling a child," has compelling reasons why 
Jeannie simply has to spend an indefinite period of time with her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrified at the thought, Matt in desperation calls up Cathy Breslow 
(Richardson), an attractive production company executive he'd met at an acting 
class to see if she knows of any jobs. Through Cathy he ends up working for her 
boss, producer Burke Adler of Popcorn Pictures (Albert Brooks), and Burke's 
trusted market research associate, Nan Mulhanney (Julie Kavner). 
</P>
<P>
 Though it probably wasn't planned that way, the relationship between Burke and 
Nan turns out to be the most involving part of "Anything." While not related, 
the two Brookses have always been on the same wavelength, and Albert's role as 
the tortured, tyrannical schlock producer who can't have lunch because "that's 
when everyone returns my calls because they're trying to miss me" is even 
stronger than the one in "Broadcast News" that won him an Oscar nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 With the looks of his face rapidly changing from horror to befuddlement to 
desperation, Brooks' Burke gleefully raises the energy level of the film 
whenever he's on screen. And Kavner's Nan does a beautiful job opposite him as 
the doyenne of test screenings who is compelled by virtue of an unlikely 
combination of prescription drugs to tell all the truth all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 While Burke and Nan think they have a difficult relationship, the most 
torturous ones in the film are the interactions Matt has both with his daughter 
and with Cathy, a bright but overmatched executive who means well but, as the 
personification of the uncertain nature of the movie business, has to carry 
rather more metaphorical baggage than is good for the part. 
</P>
<P>
 As for young Jeannie, she turns out to be a remarkably self-possessed, 
intensely bratty little person who totally flummoxes her dad without half 
trying. Wright, an amazing performer who had just turned 4 when she auditioned 
for this complex child's role, has no difficulty holding her own against Nolte, 
who in his turn delivers one of the most relaxed and natural performances he's 
given recently. 
</P>
<P>
 As funny and moving as it all can be, laced with the cockeyed grace of 
struggling humanity, even this brief retelling of the film's diverse story 
lines shows why it was difficult to pull together. Though all its plots deal 
with relationships, they do not have much of a relationship with each other, 
and in the absence of a strong narrative through line, "I'll Do Anything" can 
do no more than offer a glimpse of the promised land, not a trip inside.

 Holding Up the Beef: A judge has temporarily barred CBS News from broadcasting 
a hidden-camera videotape made inside a South Dakota meatpacking plant. The 
network planned to use the tape of the Federal Beef Processors Inc. plant on 
Wednesday's "48 Hours" in a story about the threat of meat contamination by E. 
coli bacteria. The tape included video of rotten meat in the plant's de-boning 
room, according to court documents. CBS said the ban would harm the network's 
First Amendment rights and the public's right to know about contaminated meat, 
but Circuit Judge Jeff Davis banned the tape until he could rule on Federal 
Beef's claim that the network got the video improperly (a Federal Beef employee 
allegedly sneaked a hidden camera into the plant). The judge said broadcasting 
the tape could harm the local economy in ways that could not be repaired 
through a lawsuit. MOVIES

 Flutist Criticized for Reprimand: Well-known flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal is 
drawing criticism for interrupting his recent Kennedy Center concert mid-piece 
to reprimand a child he found disruptive. "If she's going to fidget, you'll 
have to take her out of here," Rampal said during Saturday's performance. The 
9-year-old's mother was furious. "Even if my child was acting horribly, I don't 
think he'd have the right to treat her so rudely," said Francine Gugerty of 
Bethesda, Md., whose daughter Carly burst into tears and cried for the rest of 
the concert. Rampal tried to explain his actions to the audience, saying, "I'm 
sorry, but this has been going on since the beginning of the concert. I like 
children, but they do get bored, and at a concert, we like to give the best of 
ourselves." Still, Douglas Wheeler, managing director of the Washington 
Performing Arts Society, which presented the classical music concert and 
offered reduced-price tickets for children, wasn't pleased. "We wouldn't offer 
tickets at $5 each if we didn't want children to come," he said. QUICK TAKES

MOVIE REVIEW; 'PATROLMAN': COX'S STUNNING ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Highway Patrolman" (at the Nuart) is maverick director Alex Cox's finest film 
to date and represents his best work since his terrific debut feature, the 
funky, surreal 1984 "Repo Man." This film, in Spanish with English subtitles, 
opens just the way one would expect of Cox -- with a darkly satirical take on 
his subject, an idealistic young Mexican's training at the National Highway 
Patrol Academy in Mexico City. But the British-born Cox and his 
producer-screenwriter, Lorenzo O'Brien, a Peruvian raised in Mexico, gradually 
get more serious once their wiry, wistful hero (Roberto Sosa) takes up his 
first assignment in a remote town in Durango. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that working in a foreign language has given Cox the necessary 
freedom and detachment not to worry about being hip and to take the plunge into 
classic screen storytelling, backed by O'Brien's superbly structured script. 
</P>
<P>
 While it rightly skewers American hypocrisy and complicity in Mexican 
drug-trafficking, "Highway Patrolman" abounds in the timeless virtues of 
traditional filmmaking. Indeed, there is an epic quality, moral as well as 
visual, to the hero's odyssey that recalls the Westerns of John Ford and such 
John Huston films as "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and "Under the Volcano." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately Sosa's earnest, likable Pedro Rojas discovers the 
impossibility of adhering to the straight and narrow. On the one hand, he's too 
underpaid to resist accepting the occasional "mordita" once he's a husband and 
father; on the other, a strict enforcement of the law becomes a hardship and 
injustice upon people who are simply struggling to survive. If he is to 
survive, Pedro must learn to steer a sensible course between extremes and 
discover within himself his own strength and his own code of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, he will be put to the test time and again, and in the process he 
discovers his sticking point is drugs, which are transported regularly through 
the region and which are all too available to the locals. Although he marries 
the hearty, plain-spoken Griselda (Zaide Silvia Gutierrez, who has the looks 
and personality of Mercedes Ruehl), he is drawn to the beautiful but 
drug-addicted prostitute Maribel (Vanessa Bauche).  
</P>
<P>
 Sosa is such a focused actor that we're able to believe firmly in Pedro -- to 
never lose sight of the fact that he is an ordinary man, dogged in his 
determination and intense in his concentration, but in no way a superman. In 
its way, "Highway Patrolman" is a coming-of-age film, both for its hero and for 
Cox himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Highway Patrolman" is also a beautiful, gritty film, shot by Miguel Garzon 
and scored evocatively by Zander Schloss. It's steeped in the atmosphere of 
vast, desert-like vistas slashed by highways sizzling in the heat. A lurid, 
seedy "Zona Rosa" brothel contrasts with Griselda's large and inviting old 
family home. While it's a sad commentary on the state of foreign-language film 
distribution that "Highway Patrolman," which surfaced at UCLA in November, 
1992, as part of a contemporary Mexican film series and which bears a 1991 
copyright, is only now being released, we can be only be grateful that it has 
arrived at last.

MOVIE REVIEW; MORE GIGGLES THAN GROANS IN 'ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's talk elasticity: When Jim Carrey goes on a crying jag, his enormous 
mouth turns into such a gaping canyon that your mind might wander to wondering 
just how many whole grapefruits could be stuffed into it. When he deigns to 
close those choppers, he doesn't so much smile as he clenches every muscle 
within a six-inch radius of his overbite into a maniacal grin that makes him 
look like a handsomely dimpled gerbil. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, you think, is a guy who may have spent too much time working out at the 
facial-tic gym. The term rubber-mugged hardly begins to suffice, when even 
Carrey's tiniest expressions of physicality are so broadly exaggerated he makes 
Jim Varney look like Charles Bronson by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 A movie with such a relentlessly manic guy at its constant center sounds as if 
it would probably be irritating as hell. And to a lot of people, it will be. 
But "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" (general release), uneven as its farcical 
pleasures may be, proves perfectly capable of inducing the most unexpected 
giggle fits. Carrey's refusal to be anything less than utterly inhuman on 
screen is heroic on its own brave, nutty, pretty funny terms. He's so 
over-energized from the start you keep thinking he'll wear out his welcome 
pronto; an hour and a half later, his lunacy is still hard to take your eyes 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey, best known as a stand-up comic and TV sketch artist (of "In Living 
Color" fame), plays a celebrated "pet dick," or finder of missing mammals. A 
lot of his work involves recovering cats and dogs in disputed divorce cases. 
("Make any good collars lately?" mock the police. "Or were they leashes?") But 
he stumbles across bigger fish to fry when he's called in to look for the 
missing aquatic mascot of Miami's pro football franchise, which has been 
dolphin-napped just before a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way he gets romantically involved with a team rep (Courteney Cox, 
not having much to do but look comely in the Priscilla Presley role) and 
crosses swords with an adversarial police lieutenant (Sean Young, enjoying yet 
another self-parodying part in which she gets to be called "psycho-woman"). 
</P>
<P>
 Puerility does sometimes reach its limits here. And the movie is necessarily 
limited by Carrey's never getting to evolve beyond cartoon-character status; 
he's like Roger Rabbit or Howard the Duck, so far adrift is his two-dimensional 
lunacy from the "straight" world. But as live-action cartoons go, he's a fairly 
inspired one. 
</P>
<P>
 Ace winds up wildly patronizing virtually everyone he comes across, in that 
popular post-modern way. But lest the picture bog down completely in the ironic 
comedy of condescension (a la, say, Chevy Chase's singularly smug "Fletch" 
sleuth), the hero is also afforded a childlike bond with the mutts, fish and 
fowl of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Tom Shadyac (who co-wrote with Jack Bernstein and Carrey) just barely 
holds back from overplaying the Dr. Doolittle angle. But it's nice that for 
almost every wicked put-down Ace Ventura dishes out, he also gets to enjoy an 
innocent moment of purely animalistic joie de vivre , like the way he sticks 
his head out the car window every time he drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Who among us -- possibly excepting pro-vivisection radicals or the severely 
Jerry Lewis-phobic -- is prepared to resist a hero so liberated he lives his 
entire life doggy-style?

MOVIE REVIEW; 'GUNMEN' AN ULTRAVIOLENT BUDDY FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Gunmen" (selected theaters) is the kind of picture people are talking about 
when they express concern over excessive screen violence. Murky in plot, 
sketchy in characterization, routinely crafted -- except for Hiro Narita's fine 
noirish camerawork -- it exists only as an excuse to depict the piling up of 
bullet-riddled corpses. Considering its relentless mediocrity, it is amazing 
that it was actually previewed for critics rather than opening cold. 
</P>
<P>
 All you really need to know about its needlessly convoluted story is that it 
struggles in vain to play as a buddy movie, teaming up a straight-arrow bounty 
hunter (Mario Van Peebles), under contract to the Drug Enforcement Agency, and 
a goofy, small-time smuggler (Christopher Lambert) who inadvertently may hold 
the key to the location of a huge drug fortune. The film's locale is the 
fictional South American country of Boa Vista -- it seems lots like Colombia -- 
and was filmed in Puerto Vallarta. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Peebles manages to work up a modicum of credibility, but Lambert's part is 
so underwritten that his attempt to play it like Jean-Paul Belmondo in a comic 
action caper of the '60s makes the guy come across as merely being stupid 
rather than amusing.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, there is a slew of bad guys who throughout the movie are constantly 
trying to gun down or otherwise eliminate Van Peebles and Lambert -- and lots 
of other people as well. Patrick Stewart is a drug kingpin so nasty that he 
buries his bride alive, Denis Leary is a gleeful killer, and Sally Kirkland is 
vivid but wasted in a small part as an arms dealer. The real culprits of 
"Gunmen," however, are director Deran Sarafian and writer Stephen Sommers.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BRIDE' IS A DELIGHTFUL MARTIAL ARTS ROMANCE

 "The Bride With White Hair" (Monica 4-Plex), aswirl with color and movement, 
is the period martial arts fantasy at its most romantic -- and a textbook 
example of the virtues of taking genre material seriously. It has the look and 
feel of a sophisticated comic-book adventure, yet it is also genuinely poignant 
as well as witty and amusing. In drawing upon an ancient love story in Chinese 
literature director, Ronnie Yu and his co-writers reveal just how rich the 
possibilities are within the vital Hong Kong cinema.

the dying. A contingent of men have come to obtain the rose for the ailing 
emperor, but the man tells them he is saving it for someone else. Soon we've 
moved a decade back in time, when the man, Zhou Yihang (Leslie Chung), is the 
heir apparent to his mentor, the chief of the eight traditional martial arts 
clans in Chung Yuan, the heartland of China. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhou's bright future is forever changed with a chance encounter with the 
beautiful Lian Nichang (Brigitte Lin), as skilled as he is in the martial arts. 
Raised by wolves, she unfortunately had subsequently been adopted by crazed, 
extravagantly decadent Siamese twins, a brother and sister (Ng Chun-Yu, Lui 
Sau-Ling), who head an outlawed clan and have formed a cult around themselves. 
It doesn't help matters that the brother is in love with Nichang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bride With White Hair" unfolds amid the most magnificent sets and 
costumes as a kind of martial arts "Romeo and Juliet" as Zhou and Nichang 
discover they cannot deny their love for each other despite the fact they 
belong to enemy clans. Its most inspired touch occurs when Zhou, transformed by 
love, starts to question the eight clans' constant warring with peaceful 
foreign tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yu directs with passion and authority, shaping action sequences, sensual love 
scenes and campy bacchanals at the Siamese twins' court into a stunning, 
lyrical whole. "The Bride With White Hair" is fun, lively yet exquisitely 
tender, suffused, finally, with a sweet sadness.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'MY FATHER' A SORDID REMAKE OF A SEX COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The arrival of "My Father, the Hero" (citywide) begs the question: Why does 
Hollywood persist in remaking French sex comedies? Most of the originals -- 
including "The Tall Blonde Man With One Black Shoe" and "Les Fugitifs," remade 
as "Three Fugitives" -- weren't all that sexy or funny to begin with. And with 
the exception of "Three Men and a Little Lady," none of these remakes, which 
also include "The Toy," "Blame It on Rio," "Partners" and "Buddy Buddy," has 
been a smash hit. Or sexy. Or funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Father, the Hero," remade from a French comedy virtually unseen in this 
country, at least has Gerard Depardieu in the cast, which gives it a pedigree. 
Depardieu, who has appeared in every French film for the past 20 years, give or 
take a few, makes his third appearance in a Hollywood movie. (The first two 
were "Green Card" and "1492: Conquest of Paradise.") It's enjoyable watching 
Depardieu wrap his mouth around the English language; he seems to enjoy it as 
much as we do. Less enjoyable is watching Depardieu (or, in long shot, his 
stunt double) water skiing and wallowing through treacherous shoals. (A friend 
said he reminded her of Shamu.) 
</P>
<P>
 Depardieu may be fun to watch but he's not enough reason to see the movie. The 
plot is one of those ooo-la-la jobs that was probably pretty smarmy even in the 
original (except the French can get away with these things better than we can). 
It's about what happens when Andre (Depardieu), an errant, divorced dad, takes 
his 14-year-old daughter, Nicole (Katherine Heigl), to a Bahamas resort for a 
quality-time vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Nicole falls for a hunky local, Ben (Dalton James), she concocts a 
jealousy-making scheme to rope him in: She pretends Andre is actually her lover 
and an international spy. (The father-daughter relationship is supposed to be a 
ruse to get around the illegalities.) The vacationers all think Andre is a 
child molester and give him scorching stares; Nicole, meanwhile, with her 
princessy, sweet-young-thing wiles, enjoys teasing the resort's male staff and 
playing up her role as kept woman (or child-woman). 
</P>
<P>
 Does this sound like the comic premise we've all been waiting for? The 
screenwriters, Francis Veber and Charlie Peters, have worked on many of the 
previous France-to-Hollywood adaptations. (Peters contributed to the script for 
"Blame It on Rio," which also dabbled in incest yuks.) Along with director 
Steve Miner, they try to muffle the essential sleaziness of the plot while at 
the same time playing up to it. Nicole is ogled not only by the local guys but 
by the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something sordid about the way the filmmakers offer up this -- shall 
we say questionable -- entertainment as a refreshment.

JAZZ NOTES: A STELLAR GROUP OF ARTISTS HEADED THIS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the earthquake and its aftershocks still have many Southern California 
residents a bit unnerved, the shifting earth apparently isn't keeping some of 
the world's top jazz performers from coming to town. In the next two weeks, 
such notable artists as Kenny Burrell, Eliane Elias, Cassandra Wilson, Ronny 
Jordan, Joe Williams, Joe Zawinul, Charlie Haden's Quartet West, Roy Hargrove, 
Gene Harris, Nat Adderley and the Black/Note ensemble will be spotlighted 
throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Burrell, who continues a three-night stand tonight and Saturday at 
the Jazz Bakery in Culver City, is the Detroit native whose golden tone and 
right-on-the-money rhythmic flair have made him a consistent favorite in jazz 
circles since the late '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, New York resident Burrell has spent part of each year in Los 
Angeles, teaching a winter quarter class in Ellingtonia at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell sees Ellington's music as continually growing in stature. "He is one 
of, if not the , most important musician of the 20th Century," Burrell says. 
"His music is so valuable, so American. He uses the American sound in his 
music, getting the essence of what this country is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Haden and trumpeter Hargrove hold forth tonight at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, and singer Williams delivers Saturday at 
the Irvine Barclay Theater in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Black/Note, which appears tonight and Saturday at Atlas on Wilshire, is the 
vigorous, youthful L.A.-based quintet led by bassist Mark Shelby. "We're trying 
to present a sound of our own, not sounding like groups of the past," says 
Shelby. "We're not hard bop, not be-bop, not cool, but maybe a fusion of all 
three." 
</P>
<P>
 Next Tuesday, the bluesy, crowd-pleasing pianist Gene Harris and his dynamic 
quartet -- featuring guitarist Ron Eschete, bassist Luther Hughes and drummer 
Paul Humphrey -- begin a seven-night stand at Catalina Bar & Grill. 
Keyboardist-composer Joe Zawinul, making a rare club appearance, follows Harris 
into Catalina's on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, singer Cassandra Wilson, whose "Blue Light 'Til Dawn" album is 
No. 4 on the current Billboard magazine jazz chart, slides into the Troubadour 
in West Hollywood. Pianist Elias holds forth at Ambassador Auditorium in 
Pasadena the same night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Light" finds Wilson exploring vehicles not associated with jazz singers, 
from Joni Mitchell's "Black Crow" and Van Morrison's "Tupelo Honey" to the 
Robert Johnson blues "Hellhound on My Trail." The vocalist says the project, 
which differs greatly from her past albums, is her way of revisiting her past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up doing folk music and blues, and I had basically forgotten this part 
of my musical life because I had taken on the jazz mantle," Wilson said from a 
hotel in Seattle, where she appeared recently. "It's important for your growth 
and development to go beyond what people expect, and to look inside. You see 
all kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Wilson into the Troubadour will be British guitarist Ronny Jordan, 
who appears Feb. 11. (He also plays the Strand in Redondo Beach on Feb. 13, the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Feb. 14, and Ole Madrid in San Diego on 
Feb. 15.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's "The Quiet Revolution" album is No. 9 on the Billboard contemporary 
jazz chart and spotlights the guitarist, 31, blending jazz moods with hip-hop 
rhythms and some rapping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect the great jazz people of the yesteryear, like Wes Montgomery, but I 
do feel now's the time for new ideas and new directions," said Jordan from his 
home in London. "Jazz and hip-hop can go together, but it has to be done by a 
jazz musician, because the improvisation is the flavor of jazz. And it should 
be a young jazz musician who's not stuck in the old ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Jordan's appearances at the Troubadour mark a change in the club's 
booking policy, which has eschewed jazz in the past. "We're hoping to do more 
jazz. We'll see how these two go," says a spokesperson for the club, "We're 
definitely developing an open market right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cornetist Adderley takes part in a benefit for his late brother, Julian 
"Cannonball" Adderley, when his quintet, and an all-star big band play on Feb. 
12 at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center, a new hall on the campus of Cal 
State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A new, untitled work by trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater, commissioned by the 
International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation and co-funded by a grant from the 
Rockefeller Foundation and AT&T, will be premiered at the event. The piece, 
dedicated to altoist Adderley, will be performed by a large ensemble featuring 
Adderley, Bridgewater, altoists Vincent Herring and Antonio Hart, trombonists 
Thurman Green and Garnett Brown, bassist Walter Booker and drummer Jimmy Cobb.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; IL FORNAIO PUTS THE DIN BACK IN DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The enormous Il Fornaio in Pasadena resembles nothing so much as a gymnasium. 
The main dining room is a vast expanse of springy wood floors and white walls 
with a well-stocked bar on one side, a frenetically busy kitchen on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 When this room is filled, which it is nightly, there is a din such as one 
experiences at a high school basketball game: loud, busy, excited. The noise of 
human voices, background music, pots and pans and swinging doors bounces, 
reverberates, creates a screen of privacy in this fantastically wide-open room. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the scores of people on display, you can't hear what the people next 
to you are saying. The only reason you hear your dinner date is that he or she 
is yelling at you. The clamor is at such a pitch, one would not be surprised to 
see a troupe of acrobats tumble down the aisles, or hear a sudden operatic 
interlude, and yet the closest we get to this is when waiters gather around a 
table to sing a rather dolorous happy birthday in Italian. Invariably, at some 
point during a meal at Il Fornaio, often about 20 minutes in, I give up. I stop 
trying to have a coherent conversation. I'm exhausted.  
</P>
<P>
 There are certain things to appreciate at this mama of all Il Fornaio's: It 
is, for example, family friendly, a popular spot to take your college-aged 
children to dinner or, conversely, your parents. One evening, we sit next to a 
family with three daughters. The table is strewn with pizza and pasta. Mother 
and father converse. One daughter reads a book. The two younger daughters are 
peacefully, happily ensconced under the table, the tablecloth like a tent; 
their connection to the table, a long, rubber rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
 Another virtue is the bakery area, itself almost as large as, say, the entire 
Il Fornaio in the Westside Pavilion. You can order decent coffees and pastries 
and panini to eat inside at small round tables, or to take outside to tables in 
a sunny, cobbled alley where there are just enough passersby to make things 
interesting. But skip the muffins: They're oily and tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a reservation, you can often snag a seat at the counter and watch the 
breakneck pace of the pasta and pizza cooks. I tried this seat several times, 
for lunch and dinner, and invariably left feeling drained by the nonstop 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can wait for a table. Sometimes, the wait isn't too long: The 
restaurant saves a certain percentage of seats for walk-in customers. Even with 
reservations, you may have to wait. We made reservations days in advance for 
Sunday evening, arrived on time and were promptly offered the two worst tables 
in the house: one by the front desk and one by the kitchen door. We had to wait 
20 minutes for anything else. (The hostess never did find a taker for that 
table by the kitchen.) 
</P>
<P>
 The wait for a seat is apt to be the first of several delays. For all the 
clatter and expenditure of energy, the service here is actually sluggish. It's 
a trick to have salad, entree and dessert in less than two hours -- so the 
two-hour parking validation comes in handy. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it all worth it? Ever hopeful, ever willing to be seduced by good looks and 
the manic veneer of professionalism, I was consistently disappointed. Carpaccio 
is topped with less than top-notch Parmesan. A coil of prosciutto, mozzarella 
and arugula looks prettier than it tastes. Topped with wild mushrooms, an 
arborio rice pancake is inexplicably set adrift in acidic, overwhelming tomato 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 A special ravioli filled with broccoli rabe provides a fierce, medicinal stab 
of bitterness, not balanced in the least by a gluey cream sauce rumored to 
contain goat cheese. An oblong pizza with potato, fresh tomato and artichokes 
is another inexplicable combination. A simple plate of green-and-white linguine 
with shrimp is far more palatable.  
</P>
<P>
 A 22-ounce porterhouse is a lovely, venerable piece of meat served with 
roasted potatoes, freshly sauteed spinach and undercooked chalky white beans. 
The whole Cornish hen looks great, but the sauce is too sweet and full of 
alcohol and the accompanying soft polenta leaves an unpleasant, fatty, floury 
coating in the mouth. Salmon is overcooked and dry.  
</P>
<P>
 The best moment of each meal seems to be the coffee, specifically espresso 
with a thick, tawny crema, which goes great with the tangerine creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Il Fornaio, 24 West Union St., Pasadena. Lunch and dinner seven days. Full 
Bar. Valet and validated parking. Major credit cards. Dinner for two, food 
only, $30-$70.

MUSIC REVIEWS; AN AMBITIOUS EFFORT BY PACIFIC SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the Pacific Symphony's concert Wednesday night at Orange County 
Performing Arts Center was a noble and ambitious effort, the results ran only 
surface deep. 
</P>
<P>
 This was partially the fault of the music at hand. John Corigliano's 1968 
Piano Concerto, which formed the main part of the first half, is a big, 
hyper-athletic, theatrical work, a young man's composition (the composer was 30 
at the time of its premiere) that tries hard to dazzle, and succeeds, but does 
little else. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most satisfying way to listen to the work, written in this 
composer's trademark eclectic style, is to spot the quotes -- from Bartok, from 
Stravinsky, from Copland, from the Dies Irae, and on and on. Corigliano slants 
this mix very much toward the muscular, driving, brutal end of the spectrum -- 
with heavy doses of aggressive brass and percussion and pounding piano -- but 
occasionally breaks things up with an all-too-sweet, Americana-type lyricism. 
The combination is accessible and exciting and about as subtle and nourishing 
as a Stallone movie. 
</P>
<P>
 It does supply, however, four movements (and 35 minutes) of very high octane 
fuel for pianist and orchestra, and it served well to display the virtuoso 
talents of French Canadian soloist Alain Lefevre, conductor Carl St. Clair and 
the Pacific Symphony -- all of whom will record the work this week. They are 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the concert (and also slated for recording) was the first orchestral 
performance of the five-minute "Postcard" by Pacific Symphony's 
composer-in-residence Frank Ticheli. It's a splashy and metrically romping 
piece, quirky and pleasing, crescendoing off the page. St. Clair et al. played 
it with polish and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor led a solid but all-too-routine performance of Beethoven's Fifth 
to conclude. Proper instrumental balances proved a major oversight here, 
robbing the music of detail and depth as well as of the exuberance the composer 
achieved by tossing his ideas throughout the orchestra.TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; ORPHEUS ESSAYS BOCCHERINI, BERG WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra has been widening the boundaries of repertory a 
conductorless ensemble can handle ever since its founding in 1972. The least 
likely music to succeed with such an approach -- a work by Alban Berg -- may 
have been the most powerful and successful in a concert Wednesday at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the musicians announced their ease and mastery of ensemble with 
virtuosic flair in Boccherini's Symphony in D minor, Opus 12, No. 4 ("La Casa 
del Diavolo"), which opened the program. The crisp, clean, urgent bowings, the 
precision of the starts and stops and the variety and control of dynamics 
vanquished any doubts about the approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart's Piano Concerto in B-flat, K. 456, and Dvorak's Serenade in D minor 
for Winds, also on the program, should be prime candidates for this kind of 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, soloist Radu Lupu proved a cerebral Mozart interpreter, 
emphasizing dexterity and speed over song and character, although he 
occasionally allowed himself the option of applying pedal to create coloristic 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupu was playing on a modern Steinway grand, and the volume of the sound he 
produced, even through light, pointillistic attack and fingering, sounded 
large, out of proportion to the accompaniment provided by the 23 or so 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians seemed to have little choice other than to respond with short, 
dry, characterless phrasings. The whiplash bowing that had served Boccherini so 
effectively earlier began to sound manneristic and oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in short, a tough, tense, driven, bright, alert and cold performance 
of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, the chamber orchestra split into strings and winds to 
play, respectively, Three Pieces from Berg's "Lyric Suite" and Dvorak's 
Serenade. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berg's complex music, the musicians showed the same technical 
accomplishment heard before, but added to it a degree of personal intensity. 
The visceral upsurge of emotion that began in the cellos in the Adagio -- to 
single out only the most dramatic sequence -- led to relentless waves of 
passion, a heart-breaking dissolution, a recall to life and a final suspension 
of breath. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance of the Dvorak, which followed, ventured earnestness, bucolic 
charm and folk dance vigor, but could not entirely vanquish Berg's last 
question mark. CHRIS PASLES

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: BEHIND THE SCENES WITH 'BENNY & JOON' DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "How do people affect each other when they love each other and want to do good 
by each other?" 
</P>
<P>
 For film director Jeremiah Chechik, that question is the essence of his 
quietly affecting 1993 sleeper hit "Benny & Joon." Sometimes, he adds, they end 
up obsessively controlling another to the point "where you destroy the thing 
that you want to nourish and nurture and protect." 
</P>
<P>
 Chechik's articulate, intelligent and knowledgeable discussion of that process 
as the film unfolds on a separate analog track is the backbone of MGM/UA's 
special laser release on Wednesday of "Benny & Joon: Deluxe Director's Edition" 
($70). 
</P>
<P>
 While the film is also available on a fine letterboxed CLV MGM/UA edition 
($40), this letterboxed CAV edition on three discs offers a number of pleasures 
that enhance the film experience. Besides Chechik's informative comments, there 
is also another alternate track that includes two pieces of the effective 
musical soundtrack that were dropped in favor of two songs, including the 
film's popular theme song by the Proclaimers ("I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"). On 
the third disc, there is some intelligent supplementary material including an 
illuminating discussion and examples of costume, makeup and lighting tests by 
cinematographer John Schwartzman, a snipped scene that was better left on the 
cutting room floor, the poorly done theatrical trailer, the Proclaimers' 
spirited music video of the theme song, and the amusing mock horror film "The 
Prom Queen Mutilator" shown briefly on TV during the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Aidan Quinn as Benny, Mary Stuart Masterson as his mentally disturbed sister, 
Joon, and Johnny Depp as Sam, the odd Buster Keaton-like figure who enters and 
forever changes their lives, all etch unforgettable characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechik, who began his career directing commercials, praises the actors for 
performances so sincere that the honesty of the characters' behavior doesn't 
seem forced. Depp's tender and affecting performance, which Chechik explains 
"represents the joy, the existential part of one's heart," gains in stature as 
Chechik explains the actor's contributions to the film. Depp watched the works 
of silent film stars Keaton, Chaplin and others for weeks to perfect the adept 
moves that pay homage to them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most intriguing aspects of Chechik's analog track lies in his 
discussion of the evolution of the film, how it changed from the story of a Los 
Angeles-based psychiatrist managing a weird young street performer into "a 
romance on the brink of reality," as it is subtitled. It's clear from the 
director's discussion how much he cares about his "fairy tale," its "metaphoric 
characters" and what they have to tell us about ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechik's perceptive discussion, improvised haltingly, is particularly 
effective as the film unfolds scene by scene. This is a laser for anyone who 
cares about the art and craft of filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of music, camera and lighting are among the details analyzed by 
Chechik and his articulate cinematographer. 
</P>
<P>
 This laser production comes up with an original idea enabling the viewer to 
listen to the lovely alternate score by Rachel Portman as the opening credits 
unfold, and then to watch the film again as it was released with the 
Proclaimers' anthem. A viewer can hear the different moods created by pop song 
or evocative score and decide which one works better. Who can resist the 
Proclaimers' driving music? The decision, however, to use a pop vocal over the 
love scene instead of Portman's sensitive music may have been an error in 
judgment. Watching the scene with the alternative track gives it a power and a 
poignancy that the pop song overwhelms.  
</P>
<P>
 Chechik believes that his movie "is about love." There's no better Valentine 
gift to love, movies and their creation than this handsome laser production, 
co-produced by MGM/UA's George Feltenstein and Alan Fisch.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: 'LET THERE BE DRUMS!' A SALUTE TO YOU-KNOW-WHAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you just check the song titles on the first volume in the latest Rhino 
Records compilation series, it's easy to assume that it's the start of yet 
another collection of rock oldies. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the absence of Elvis Presley (licensing problems), the album lineup 
reads like a Hall of Fame salute -- from Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock" 
and Little Richard's "Long Tall Sally" to Buddy Holly's "Peggy Sue" and Fats 
Domino's "The Fat Man." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another level to the album and the series. Where most surveys of 
rock concentrate on singers and guitarists, this series salutes the drummers. 
</P>
<P>
 Volume one of "Max Weinberg Presents: Let There Be Drums!" focuses on 18 of 
Weinberg's favorite drum performances from the '50s, complete with liner notes 
explaining his choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc opens and closes, appropriately, with drum-dominated instrumental 
hits -- 1959's "Teen Beat" and 1961's "Let There Be Drums" -- by Sandy Nelson, 
the first drummer to achieve star status in rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nelson was a sort of missing link between the drummers of the '50s and those 
of the '60s," writes Weinberg, who was the drummer in Bruce Springsteen's E 
Street Band and is now bandleader for NBC-TV's "Late Night With Conan O'Brien." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Nelson) played with a big band feel, but appreciated the power of rock 'n' 
roll instrumentation. . . . Inspired by the great jazz drummer Gene Krupa . . . 
, Nelson (through his own hit records) gave rock 'n' roll drummers, especially 
young ones, the hope that they, too, might be recognized for their 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Other drummers toasted in volume one include Billy Guesack, the New York 
session drummer who played on "Rock Around the Clock"; Frank Kirkland, who 
played the trademark drum beat on Bo Diddley's "Bo Diddley"; Earl Palmer, the 
acclaimed New Orleans drummer who played on "Long Tall Sally"; and James Van 
Eaton, the much-lauded Memphis drummer on Jerry Lee Lewis' hits, including 
"High School Confidential." 
</P>
<P>
 Volumes 2 and 3 are devoted to '60s and '70s recordings, respectively. Both 
also feature 18 selections and liner notes by Weinberg. The tracks on Vol. 2 
range from such rock gems as Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Born on the Bayou" 
(drummer: Doug Clifford) and the Band's "Up on Cripple Creek" (Levon Helm) to 
such R&B classics as Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman" (Roger Hawkins) 
and Booker T. & the MG's' "Green Onions" (Al Jackson Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
 Vol. 3's entries range from the Rolling Stones' "Rocks Off" (Charlie Watts) 
and James Taylor's "Fire and Rain" (Russ Kunkel) to Gary Wright's "Dream 
Weaver" (Jim Keltner) and Weinberg's own performance on Springsteen's "Candy's 
Room." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reasons he selected "Candy's Room" from all his recordings with the 
E Street Band, Weinberg writes, was that "the song was always just fun to play 
-- and that's basically the reason that I became a drummer."

HOME TECH / VIDEO: REMEMBER WHEN FIGURE SKATING WAS ROMANTIC . . . ? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to Tonya Harding -- or at least to the people around her -- the image 
of figure skating has been taking a beating. If you yearn to return to those 
thrilling days of yesteryear, when figure skaters were wholesome and angelic, 
try a Sonja Henie movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's Sonja Henie?" many will ask. 
</P>
<P>
 She's the Norwegian Olympic-champion figure skater -- a medal winner in the 
Olympics from 1928 to 1936 -- who was an American movie star in the late '30s 
and '40s. To take advantage of the current focus on skaters, FoxVideo is 
releasing seven of her movies on home video Feb. 16, at $20 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Henie was to figure skating what Esther Williams was to swimming. Tuneful 
romantic comedies were tailored for her, centering around her skating talents, 
of course. The showpieces of these movies are spectacular ice ballets -- which 
put to shame anything you'll ever see in the Ice Capades. 
</P>
<P>
 In her prime, Henie was a perky, girl-next-door kind of blonde. She wasn't 
much of an actress, but she didn't have to be. Those fairy-tale plots didn't 
require much acting skill. Most of the time all she had to do was look radiant. 
She invariably worked with actors and performers noted for their strong 
personalities -- like Tyrone Power, Ray Milland, Caesar Romero and Don Ameche. 
</P>
<P>
 These movies never pretend to be anything but pure escapism and are generally 
very charming. 
</P>
<P>
 The movies are "Thin Ice" (1937), with Tyrone Power; "One in a Million" 
(1937), with Adolphe Menjou; "My Lucky Star" (1938), with Richard Greene; 
"Happy Landing" (1938), with Don Ameche; "Everything Happens at Night" (1939), 
featuring Robert Cummings; "Iceland" (1942), co-starring John Payne, and 
"Wintertime" (1943), with Caesar Romero and Cornel Wilde. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Henie films were the early ones. Her fabled snow-queen charm was at 
its freshest in those days and the scripts and direction were much better. By 
the mid-'40s, the Henie vehicles had started to creak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thin Ice," a Cinderella tale featuring Power as a prince, may be the most 
engaging of this group of releases and perhaps her best film. Henie clearly had 
a special chemistry with Power -- probably because he was also her off-screen 
beau. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first film, "One in a Million," is also a charmer. If you're into ice 
ballets, see "My Lucky Star," which ends with the eye-popping "Alice in 
Wonderland" production number. Even if you hate the romantic parts, 
fast-forward to the end and feast your eyes on that ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Winter Olympics: With the Winter Olympics just around the corner, 
retailers will be showcasing Olympics-related tapes -- which means Paramount's 
"Downhill Racer" will be on prominent display once again. If you've never seen 
this 1969 drama, you're in for a treat. Robert Redford, in one of the best 
performances of his career, plays a champion skier who's an egomaniac. The many 
pluses include the spine-tingling ski sequences and Gene Hackman's stunning 
performance as a tough ski coach. It's among the best films ever made about a 
sports figure, up there with the 1963 Richard Harris drama, "This Sporting 
Life." 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Poetic Justice" (Columbia TriStar, no set price). When director John 
Singleton's follow-up to "Boyz N' the Hood" came out, it was nicknamed "Bored 
in the Hood." In this meandering, cliched road movie, a hairdresser/poet (Janet 
Jackson) heads to Oakland from L.A. with a mailman (Tupac Shakur) and two other 
friends. The tired old plot is not invigorated by its hip, young, black cast.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kalifornia" (PolyGram, no set price). Another road movie, about two couples 
heading West. This motley crew includes a crazed killer (Brad Pitt), his 
juvenile girlfriend (Juliette Lewis), an academic (Brad Duchovny) writing about 
serial killers and his lover (Michelle Forbes). Implausibilities abound and the 
cast, particularly Pitt, often wildly overacts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Un Coeur En Hiver" (Republic, no set price). Enthralling, cerebral French 
drama (with subtitles) that pulls you into the Angst of a violin craftsman 
(Daniel Auteuil) who's an emotional cripple. He's trapped in a triangle with a 
violinist (Emanuelle Beart) and his business partner (Andre Dussollier). If you 
like moody foreign-language dramas, don't miss this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced: Columbia TriStar's "The Age of Innocence," with Daniel 
Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer, comes out April 6. 
</P>
<P>

McCoy," "Indochine" and "That Night" (Wednesday); "The Secret Garden" (Feb. 
15); "Man Without a Face," "The Program," "Benefit of the Doubt" and "Calendar 
Girl" (Feb. 16); "For Love or Money," "Son of the Pink Panther," "Dazed and 
Confused," "Son-in-Law," "Needful Things," "Strictly Ballroom" and "Boxing 
Helena" (Feb. 23); "Much Ado About Nothing," "The Good Son" and "Striking 
Distance" (March 2); "The Fox and the Hound" (March 4); "Manhattan Murder 
Mystery," "Judgment Night," "King of the Hill" and "So I Married an Axe 
Murderer" (March 9); "Gettysburg" and "Bopha!" (March 16); "The Fugitive"

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'FIRM' STILL GETS THE MOST CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rental chart leader "The Firm" continues to hold off "Sleepless in Seattle" 
(No. 2) and "Dave" (No. 3), though various retailers report that in their 
stores "Sleepless" and "Dave" are the top rentals. Part of the dominance of 
"The Firm" is due to repeat business--which in turn is largely due to the 
appeal of star Tom Cruise to female fans.Don't be surprised if "Sleepless" and 
"Dave" spend their Top 5 tenures playing second fiddle to "The Firm." "Heart 
and Souls," the Robert Downey Jr. comedy aimed at the "Ghost" audience, did 
fair box-office business ($16.4 million) and was expected to be a strong rental 
attraction--but hasn't been so far. It opened at No. 16 last week and then 
climbed to No. 14. "Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday" premiered at No. 26 
and should do good business among fans of gory horror movies. 03,29,06,08 Rank 
Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1. "The Firm" 1 5 2. "Sleepless in Seattle" 2 6 3.

like a shoo-in for the Top 10, entered the rental chart last week at No. 18 but 
moved up just two notches to No. 16 this week. You'd expect a stronger 
performance from a movie that grossed nearly $28 million and got so many rave 
reviews. One theory is that lack of star power--the major roles are played by 
unknowns--is hampering its rental market performance in some areas.

THEATER BEAT: HIGHLIGHTING THE COMEDY IN 'SUMMER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anybody gets away with writing the same play over and over again, it's 
Tennessee Williams. His "Suddenly Last Summer" at the West Coast Ensemble may 
not be his finest work, but the one-act's images still soar miles above the 
prosaic rhetoric that's today's norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams used his family members as inspiration for his characters, and you 
see reflections of his puritanical mother and institutionalized elder sister in 
this play. Yet it's primarily the poetic descriptions that make certain moments 
of "Suddenly Last Summer" transcendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Cukrowicz (a reserved Rodger Burt), a struggling physician who has 
pioneered a lobotomy technique, is summoned by the venerable Mrs. Venable (the 
Hepburnesque Irene Roseen). The lady, it seems, wants the young doctor (shades 
of "Summer and Smoke") to examine her troublesome niece Catherine (the measured 
but volatile Carol Davis) to see if the girl might be a candidate for the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with willful Catherine is that she persists in telling an 
unflattering (although perhaps true) story about the death, last summer, of 
Mrs. Venable's only son, a poet. Naturally, the entire play builds toward 
Catherine's recitation of the odyssey she and the poet shared in a hot Mexican 
beach town. And it's worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the story, the central conflict pits Catherine, her mother (flighty 
Rachael Winfree) and brother (gawky David Youse) -- who are Mrs. Venable's poor 
relations by marriage -- against the upper crusty matriarch and her limitless 
denial. In a way, it's a comic flip side to the infighting in "Cat on a Hot Tin 
Roof." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, director Claudia Jaffee lets her mostly able cast go full tilt 
with the comedy, bringing out an often underplayed side of Williams. But she 
hasn't made the harrowing moments as credible as could be, partly due to 
hamfistedly cinematic music cues and other leaden devices. You don't need a 
swelling soundtrack to make Williams' point; the crescendos are right there in 
the text. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Suddenly Last Summer," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood Blvd., 
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends March 13. $13. (213) 
871-1052. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes. Unfinished Plays, Provocative 
Voices 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither "The Silence of a Kiss" nor "La Llorona Loca" is in finished form yet, 
but this pair of parables at the Celebration Theatre nonetheless offers a 
favorable introduction to two provocative voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to Monica Palacios, best known for her solo performance "Latin Lezbo 
Comic," to cast the legendary Mexican wailing ghost La Llorona as a lesbian. In 
this brief three-character sketch, Palacios outlines a revisionist explanation 
of how the famously foul-tempered female, who drowned her own kids, came to be 
in such a bad mood. It's like no version you've heard before. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios has a hip way with anachronisms and speech quirks, not to mention a 
ribald sense of humor. But this piece is more narrative than dramatic right 
now, and needs to be taken out of the third person before her irreverence can 
play for what it's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Reyes' "The Silence of a Kiss" is a meandering yarn about a 
marginally employed New York actor (Gary O'Brien) and the sexually and 
nationally ambiguous "immigrant" (Paul Jerome) with whom he has an affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship ranges from attenuated kissing sequences to a "Pygmalion" 
parody, in which the actor attempts to teach his non-speaking love the language 
of "Lady Di," substituting "the subway in Manhattan" for "the rain in Spain." 
There are ideas and metaphors here that deserved to be expanded, as well as 
many that should be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Silence of a Kiss" and "La Llorona Loca," Celebration Theatre, 7051-B 
Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood. Mondays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 22. $8.

</P>
<P>
 Lots of Pretense, Little Romance 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With two delusional, homicidal romantics as protagonists, "Caribbean Romance" 
at the Tamarind can't be as maudlin as it seems. But then again, maybe it can. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sterritt's comedy strains toward significance, but reaches 
pretentiousness instead. It opens with the slinky heroine Taffy (Joy 
Kilpatrick, who tries awfully hard) lying on her bed in a Key West hotel. It's 
New Year's Eve and she's dreaming of Fidel Castro (miscast Josef Pilato), while 
waiting for a boat captain who will ferry her to Cuba to save El Fidel and his 
floundering regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud (stiff John D'Aquino) shows up instead, and he and Taffy begin a 
protracted seduction that sounds as though it were written by someone who's 
spent way too much time in the self-help section at Crown Books. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterritt mistakenly waits until late in Act II to tell us much about Taffy's 
past, and Bud's background is merely a stock abusive-Dad anecdote. What's more, 
Taffy does little more than go on, ad nauseam, about how the world needs 
"romance" and not isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John York, who could have mitigated the problems with a more abstract 
staging, slows down an already labored text. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Caribbean Romance," Tamarind Theatre, 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood. 
Mondays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 23. $12. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 
hours. 'Frankie and Johnny' Keeps Cooking 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Terrence McNally's "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," in a 
well-crafted production at the Odyssey, has gotten more attention than it 
deserves, probably because it's such a meaty vehicle for actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen in recent years at the Taper as well as onscreen, it's the story of a 
low-rent tryst between a waitress and a cook. She's the aggressor who brings 
him home, presumably for a one-night stand. But when she goes to turn him out, 
he not only won't go, but also insists on insinuating himself into her life. 
We're talking marriage and babies here. 
</P>
<P>
 The gimmick is the gender-role reversal, with the emotionally armored female 
and the clingy male. But the characters (especially the woman) don't ring true, 
despite finely textured portrayals by both Robert Chimento and Joan Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, 2055 S. 
Sepulveda Blvd., West L.A. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5:30 p.m. Ends 
March 6. $15.50-$19.50. (310) 477-2055. Running time: 2 hours. 'Desired 
Effect': Of Human Bondage 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tie me up. Tie me down. Make me watch bad plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Pedro Almodovar may have done it better, but playwright Troy Tradup 
also fixates on the bondage-love connection in "The Desired Effect" at the 
Limelight Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lover (David Trudell) kidnaps the Loved (Gil Ferrales) because he thinks 
they exchanged meaningful glances in the office. But the Loved isn't into it. 
He resists. He argues. He pleads. Then the captor unties the captive and they 
consummate the relationship -- which is where it gets really silly. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem isn't so much that the scenario is thin, but that the dialogue is 
artless. There are a few tense laughs, mostly thanks to Trudell's catty line 
readings, but this amateurish work reads like an acting exercise. And director 
Daniel Emil Mulia hasn't done much to help.

BRINGING BACK THE CABARET; THE FORM IS MAKING A COMEBACK AT NEWLY OPENED TONTO 
& DIETZ. THE SPACE IS TINY, BUT THE IDEAS ARE BIG.

<P>
 Once upon a time, there was something called cabaret. It was an eclectic 
entertainment, with something for everyone, but it was smart and funny, 
intelligent and intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs Susan Dietz and Marilyn Shapiro are bringing the form back at 
their new intimate coffee cabaret, Tonto & Dietz on Ventura Boulevard. Their 
space is tiny, but their ideas are sizable. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietz, who has been a mover in Los Angeles theater for some time, from 
Equity-waiver to the Pasadena Playhouse and Beverly Hills' Canon Theatre, has 
been out of theater since 1990, with the exception of "Four Fathers," which she 
produced at the Tiffany Theatre last year. The stress and strain persuaded her 
to limit her activities to her main business. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about two years ago, her friend Shapiro called her and said, "You know 
what the Valley needs? The Valley needs a cabaret." Dietz agreed. Six months 
later Shapiro called again. "Would you be willing to invest in this thing?" 
Maybe. Another six months went by. Once more the phone rang. Shapiro now asked 
the important question. "Would you be willing to do this with me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dietz said, "At the time my business was extremely slow. I have a management 
company, and I was in development hell, and nothing much was going on." She 
said yes. Shapiro smiled, Dietz smiled, and they set out on the search for a 
space that ended in the Gaslight Alley Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted a nice, small, intimate place where a lot of our friends and a lot 
of people we admire could do their work without the pressure of 600 seats to 
fill. And, we thought the Valley was sort of hungry for a performing venue. 
I've had theaters everywhere, and the bulk of my audience comes from the 
Valley, no matter where I'm producing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tonto & Dietz will be featuring single performers, play and poetry 
readings, and monologuist Paul Linke will be performing his new piece there as 
a possible beginning of a Monday-night monologue series, the opening weekend 
show is something that will give modern audiences a hint of what cabaret is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening is called "An Off-Broadway Cabaret," made up of material from 
off-Broadway hit musicals down through the years. It's directed by Lara Teeter, 
with musical direction by Shelly Markham. Teeter has performed, directed and 
choreographed in theaters from coast to coast, and has been featured in 
Broadway's "Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" and "7 Brides for 7 Brothers," 
among others, and was nominated for a Tony Award for the Broadway revival of 
"On Your Toes," in the role created by Ray Bolger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the intimate size of Tonto & Dietz, Teeter recalls: "In 'The Empty 
Space,' Peter Brook talks about theater being in any space. The best theater he 
ever saw was in a tiny behind-the-counter coffeehouse underground sort of 
space, where people crowded around. Twelve people watched a brilliant piece of 
theater. You can do anything anywhere. Like Suzie says, when you have a space 
where your production values are down, you have to boil it to the purest form." 
</P>
<P>
 That form is the essence of cabaret. In the four-member ensemble that 
comprises "An Off-Broadway Cabaret," Bonnie Franklin knows a little bit about 
the genre. Tony-nominated for her role in "Applause" on Broadway, and star of 
the long-running series "One Day at a Time," she has just returned from a 
month's engagement doing -- that's right -- cabaret at New York's Algonquin 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin is grateful that the style is coming back. "There's more and more of 
a cabaret thing happening in this country. The wild thing is that there really 
isn't a lot of it out here in Los Angeles, and there isn't a lot throughout the 
country. To find places to go before you get to New York is very difficult. 
There really is an untapped audience that's hungry for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Franklin, Teri Ralston (Broadway's "Company," "A Little Night 
Music") and Byron Nease (just back from playing Raoul in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 
"Phantom of the Opera"), the show features Gary Sandy, who began his career on 
soaps and went on to a Broadway debut in Franco Zeffirelli's "Saturday, Sunday, 
Monday" and as the Pirate King in the Broadway production of "The Pirates of 
Penzance." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy is pleased as punch about the -- for him -- new cabaret appearance. "I'm 
coming at everything from a totally different standpoint. I see myself just 
totally as a performer. That's all I've ever been. So I try to push myself into 
different kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Teeter calls Sandy the group's Method performer. "That's a compliment," Teeter 
is quick to add. "In the truest sense of the word, Gary has to understand the 
motivation. He asks the questions that stimulate the piece in the direction it 
should go." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a clue to the type of material in the show and to Dietz's interest in 
this sort of venue. "I've always been a producer who's been interested in the 
text. And this is a way of getting back to the text. It's really about the 
material in its purest form. To me, that's the most satisfying thing about the 
whole experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin agrees, saying, "You've got Jacques Brel, and Kurt Weill, and 'Little 
Mary Sunshine' and 'Dames at Sea,' and 'Godspell' and 'The Fantasticks.' You've 
got all this wonderful material that played off-Broadway, and some people have 
never heard it. I hadn't heard some of the pieces before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy adds, "From a performer's standpoint, it's like if you've never done 
stand-up before, what it would be like to get up there, in a little club and 
say, 'All right, here I am.' That's not easy. I've been used to playing to 
10,000 people in whatever big musical it was. With this, you'd better have your 
act together. Anybody who's never been to this kind of thing before, it's just 
going to knock them out. There's this intimacy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The intimacy, the sounds, the text. That's what cabaret is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Teeter refers to it as "the intimate moment with the performer. We have 500 
television channels, and then we have 'Sunset Boulevard.' But this intimacy is 
something that L. A. needs so desperately, particularly right now with the 
earthquake." Teeter laughs. "I sound like a politician." 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the company of "Sunset Boulevard" at the Shubert Theatre, Teeter 
says the ensemble of that show, those who play the bit roles, have the bios of 
star-quality people. 
</P>
<P>
 At a sudden thought, Franklin smiles at Dietz and says, "They'll probably all 
be doing their acts at Tonto & Dietz." Where and When What: "An Off-Broadway 
Cabaret." Location: Tonto & Dietz Coffee Cabaret, Gaslight Alley Shopping 
Center, 12747 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. Hours: 8 and 10:30 p.m. Fridays and 
Saturdays. 3 and 7 p.m. Sundays. Ends March 6. Price: $15. Call: (818)

BLAZERS HEATING UP; BAND THAT PLAYS MEXICAN FOLK AND ROCK SHARES ROOTS WITH LOS 
LOBOS. IT MAY BE READY TO CLAIM ITS OWN PIECE OF THE LIMELIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

about music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cultural mix in the music of the Blazers was perhaps inevitable. The 
band's devotion to the sounds of Mexican folk, to country and, especially, to 
roots-flavored rock 'n' roll can be traced back to the neighborhoods of East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the rock quartet's members grew up there while attending high school 
and playing music with a handful of buddies who would later form a band called 
Los Lobos. By the end of the '80s, that eclectic Tex-Mex rock act would have a 
No. 1 single and an endless stream of critical acclaim. But it's only now, with 
their own debut album and a coming national tour, that the Blazers look ready 
to reach for some success of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up in East Los Angeles, there were a lot of talented musicians, a lot 
of real good rock players," says singer-guitarist Ruben Guaderrama. "It was 
always real puzzling to a lot of them how to make that step, how to get further 
ahead. And we've been knocking our head up for years and years, and one thing 
we realized is there is no formula. We were told that before, but we know 
firsthand now." 
</P>
<P>
 One indication of the band's improving fortunes is its show tonight at the 
Palomino in North Hollywood, marking the Blazers' second headlining gig at the 
club. The band is certain to perform songs from its coming "Short Fuse" album, 
due this month from Rounder Records and produced by Los Lobos singer-guitarist 
Cesar Rosas. (The Blazers will return to the Palomino for its record release 
party March 26.)  
</P>
<P>
 But on this recent Saturday morning, the band members are still a little 
bleary-eyed from a show the night before. Guaderrama, singer-guitarist Manuel 
Gonzales, bassist Lee Stuart and drummer Ruben Carlos Gonzalez sit on their 
manager's back patio in Montebello, eating chorizo burritos, talking and joking 
about the band's career thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart, who's actually from West Covina, talks of the three-week van tours, 
bouncing from town to town, as far east as the Mississippi, the whole group 
sometimes getting just $60 for a night's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really makes a unit, though," says Stuart, sporting sunglasses and a 
ponytail. "I've been looking for a band like this my whole career. You feel 
like you're 21 years old again, sleeping on floors, sneaking into motels, 
eating one meal a day. No bickering or fighting. Just waiting to get to the 
next gig, and jamming your heart out. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time a kid came up to us, and he was all excited because he had never 
heard a band with live drums, real drums," Stuart adds. "He'd heard all this 
electronic stuff. It blew his mind. So I'm hoping there is a bubbling 
underneath of people who really want to see people play, make mistakes, warts 
and all, out of tune, whatever. It's the energy." 
</P>
<P>
 That energy emerges on stage and on record both through the band's Chuck 
Berry-style rockers and in such quieter romantic ballads as "Mi Ultima 
Parranda," sung in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's things that everybody can relate to, everybody has been through at one 
time or another," Guaderrama says of the songs. "In a way you can consider that 
folk music, because it is for the people, regular folks." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the band has earned a loyal local following with that sound, a number 
of major pop figures have also discovered the Blazers. One night in 1992, Bob 
Dylan drifted into the Palomino during a performance, and soon invited the band 
to open his show at the Pantages Theater a few nights later. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the nicest guy," says Guaderrama. "We were all sitting around him like 
he was a priest or something." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pantages show, the Blazers met some other major musical figures, from 
George Harrison and Ringo Starr to Bruce Springsteen. But that night was no 
more memorable for Guaderrama than the first musical event he attended, as a 
6-year-old, when he was brought to the concert of a major Mexican singer. 
Guaderrama then understood the power of music. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came on stage on his horse, with a full-dressed, 30-piece mariachi band. 
The hair behind your neck stands up. What is this excitement? I was just a 
little kid, but there was something there. There is something to it." Where and 
When What: The Blazers at The Palomino, 6907 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. 
Hours: 9 tonight. Price: $6.50. Call: (818) 764-4010.

PLAYING TO THE CROWD; DRUMMER DAVID BASSE SAYS HIS GOAL IS TO GET PEOPLE 
INVOLVED. HE DOES SO WITH A BLEND OF VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL JAZZ TUNES BACKED 
BY A SWING BEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sitting tall behind his drum set, a light tan fedora tilted slightly back, 
David Basse concludes his first set at Lunaria in West Los Angeles by singing 
the rousing Harry (Sweets) Edison-Jon Hendricks blues "Centerpiece." 
</P>
<P>
 As Basse and his colleagues -- veteran pianist Mike Melvoin, ace bassist 
Richard Reid and solid saxman Greg Riley -- deliver the piece, the crowd 
responds with smiles, rhythmic taps of the feet, knowing nods of the head and, 
ultimately, warm applause. 
</P>
<P>
 All performers revere the kind of reception Basse received one recent Saturday 
night, but they don't all seek it as pointedly as he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself an artist, and the picture I paint is a room full of happy 
people," he says. "I want people to be involved. I really strive to have 
everyone in the room included." 
</P>
<P>
 And he does, says Dennis Duke, who has booked Basse into Chadney's in Burbank 
on several occasions. The drummer-singer appears there Saturday (and may also 
be heard Feb. 25 at Monteleone's West in Tarzana). "He plays to the audience, 
gets the crowd going," Duke says. 
</P>
<P>
 Basse, 42, a devoted jazz lover, builds his audience-comes-first presentation 
around an infectious blend of vocal and instrumental jazz tunes buttressed by 
an appealing swing beat. It's the kind of music that drew him when his parents 
played Count Basie records on the living room stereo, when he was growing up in 
Norfolk, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 That music, typified by Basie's exhilarating drive and swing feeling, 
developed to a large degree in Kansas City, Mo., in the '30s and '40s, when 
bandleaders such as Basie, Jay McShann and Harlan Leonard thrived in a town 
that was as wide-open as Las Vegas was in the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 To drink in the atmosphere, Basse moved to Kansas City in 1974. And though the 
town's best musical years were behind it, there was still plenty of activity 
for a young drummer thirsty for a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really dug the sound of the music there, and I wanted to find out about 
it," says Basse, who has been in Southern California for a year, and lives in 
the Hollywood Hills. "I was caught up in it. The music there was jazz that was 
danceable, and I fell head-over-heels in love with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Basse likes to keep that terpsichorean feeling in his renditions. "I like to 
make people dance. It just makes me happy," he says. "I don't really like to 
play music that's so wild that people can't dance to it, even though I love 
jazz, and listen to people like Max Roach, who aren't known as dance drummers. 
But the drummers who really drive me crazy are people like Jake Hanna. I could 
sit and watch him for months. One of the biggest thrills in my life was when 
Jake came in to Chadney's and listened to the band." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a deep blues thrust in Basse's show. At Lunaria he also sang "Parker's 
Mood," the classic blues by alto giant Charlie Parker, himself a Kansas City 
native; and he gave a bluesy twist to Duke Ellington's "I Got It Bad (and That 
Ain't Good)." Basse says his blues-singing influences are two men who gained 
fame in Kansas City -- Joe Turner and Jimmy Rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like them, I like to sing the blues exuberantly," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Basse started playing drums at age 11, after hearing Scottish singer Donovan 
Leitch's 1966 hit, "Mellow Yellow." 
</P>
<P>
 "I took one drum lesson and told my mother, 'This is what I want to for the 
rest of my life,' and I've stuck to it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The musician hopes that his life in Los Angeles will blossom as it did in 
Kansas City. "I'm here to grasp everything," he says. "I'm learning and 
developing new stuff and playing with some of my heroes. And I can go out every 
night and hear people. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it doesn't snow, and that's nice," he says, laughing softly. Where and 
When Who: David Basse, accompanied by Milcho Leviev (piano), Richard Reid 
(bass) and Greg Riley (sax). Location: Chadney's, 3000 W. Olive St., Burbank. 
Hours: 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Saturday. Price: No cover, no minimum. Call: (818) 
843-5333.

ON THE FEMININE SIDE; NANCY MACKO'S MULTIMEDIA SHOW BRINGS TOGETHER IMAGES OF 
GODDESSES AND HONEYBEES. IT BLENDS FEMALE SPIRITUALITY WITH THE POTENCY OF 
NATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Brand Library Art Galleries agreed to give Nancy Macko a solo show 
about three years ago, she decided she would do something different. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than attempt to fill the large main gallery with her two-dimensional 
prints and collages that garnered her a spot on Brand's schedule, the professor 
of art and director of the computer art program at Scripps College "started 
thinking about getting off the wall, of doing an installation. It seemed so 
freeing and involving," she said. Macko asked herself, "If I could do what I 
really wanted to do, what would it be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her answer was to create an ancient matriarchal temple within a modern 
context. Integrating her artistic skills with some research on women of the 
Bible, pre-biblical goddesses and honeybee society, she has abundantly 
fulfilled that goal in the "Dance of the Melissae." 
</P>
<P>
 Melissae is the plural of Melissa, the Greek word for bee. In Macko's 
multimedia installation, her handmade and computer-generated artwork brings 
together images of the honeybee society -- including queen bees, bee 
priestesses, the natural hexagonal form of the honeycomb and the molecular 
structure of glucose -- with abstractions of mythological goddesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Macko, the goddess symbolizes a female-centered spirituality and the bee 
society represents the feminine potency of nature," writes Mary Davis 
MacNaughton, director of Scripps College's Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her temple-like space refers to an ancient polytheistic world before male 
gods overthrew female goddesses, when nature and spirituality were joined. Her 
honeycomb is a metaphor of connection; it reminds us that we are part of 
nature, and not its master. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macko's work also suggests that science and art are linked though human 
imagination, for science, like art, not only observes the world but 
re-envisions it." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit consists of eight sections. On one end of the gallery is the 
"Honeycomb Wall" of 100 wood panels containing objects related to honeybees, 
references to the geometry and chemistry of honey as well as printed images 
from linoleum blocks and Cibachrome prints of computer-generated images. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the panels have been treated with beeswax. Among the images are text 
statements such as "Pythagoreans worshiped bees as sacred creatures of 
Aphrodite" and "Honey was a symbol of resurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 At the center, beneath the skylight, is "Aphrodite's Lattice," a 12-by-12-foot 
hexagonal floor piece made of wax and lead. At its center is an elongated vase 
filled with honeycombs and computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the gallery stands the "Stations of the Goddess," 11 
thought-provoking displays made of various objects and perched on pedestals. 
Although they make reference to the Stations of the Cross, "they are not about 
guilt and forgiveness," Macko said. "They're about life." 
</P>
<P>
 Sly humor beams from such stations as "Fertility/Fecundity," in which round 
plastic-like beads mingle with similarly shaped contraceptive devices. In 
"Nurturance," plastic baby bottles are filled with honey, but sport well known 
soda pop names. "daughters" contains Macko's first pair of dress shoes and a 
photograph of her at age 3 wearing them. They rest on a mirror that reveals, in 
words, her own sexual awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the stations is the "Vestments of a Bee Priestess," including a coral 
silk cocktail dress that belonged to her grandmother and a traditional 
beekeeper's helmet. One can see pictures of Macko in the outfit on the 
"Honeycomb Wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Macko has also adapted to the gallery walls ancient cave drawings that recall 
early honey hunters and gatherers. Her fascination with honey comes from, among 
other things, the fact that it "has been around since the beginning of time, 
that it was the only sweetener and that the first alcohol came from honey. It 
was integrated with sexuality and sensuousness," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Enhancing her sensuous visual environment are the sounds of a cappella tap 
dancing, the humming of bees, chants of Tibetan nuns and other rhythmic sounds, 
which emanate from a continuous audio track. The smells of beeswax, coriander 
and lavender also permeate the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Macko said she is "offering an alternative vision" to the societal structure 
that has governed our lives since at least biblical times, but "it doesn't have 
to be set in stone." Her creation is just that: a personal rather than 
doctrinaire view of anything past or present. Also in the gallery are pastels 
by Nancy Popenoe. Among them are several evocative, almost surrealistic night 
scenes of Los Angeles area bungalows, corner cafes, liquor stores and familiar 
dives. The hot light within these energetic scenes draws one into the pictures, 
making one wonder what is going on inside. Where and When What: "Nancy Macko: 
Dance of the Melissae" and "Nancy Popenoe: Pastels." Location: Brand Library 
Art Galleries, 1601 W. Mountain St., Glendale. Hours: 1 to 9 p.m. Tuesdays and 
Thursdays, 1 to 6 p.m. Wednesdays, and 1 to 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Ends 
Feb. 22. Call: (818) 548-2050. Also: Lecture by Nancy Macko at 2 p.m. Saturday 
in the gallery.

FILLING THE VOID; WHILE THE QUAKE CLOSED MANY LIBRARIES, PAGES BOOKSTORE IN

 Bookstore owner Darlene Daniel has witnessed firsthand the growing interest in 
African American history and culture. When she opened her Tarzana children's 
bookstore a decade ago, the black history books she carried were almost 
considered a novelty by patrons. Today, they are essential for a complete 
bookstore, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a perception that still lingers that the Valley is anti-African 
American, but it's just not true," says Daniel, owner of Pages Bookstore. "I 
have to tell you that people from all cultures were interested in these books 
from the very beginning, and now that more books are available, the interest is 
growing quite a bit. I've seen interest from all parts of the Valley and from 
many different backgrounds."

 Though the Northridge earthquake eliminated many of the school and library 
programs planned this month in the San Fernando Valley in honor of Black 
History Month, such places as Pages and the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum 
are filling the void. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of local schoolchildren are scheduled to attend events during class 
time at both locations. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about Black History Month programs in the local libraries, 
Michaella Johnson, who is coordinating the Valley Bookmobile, said: "All the 
libraries have been shut down in order that books can be put back on the 
shelves, and certainly not all of the libraries will even be open. . . . 
Virtually all of the scheduled events for February have been canceled." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the city's mobile library is Valley residents' only access to books, 
Johnson says she is certain it will offer displays and story readings this 
month specifically geared to black history. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the lack of library programs, Daniel has felt the burden shifting to 
her bookstore. Despite damage there, Daniel says her customers are clamoring to 
have regularly scheduled storytelling sessions again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are calling and saying they want things to return to normal, and 
especially, the children miss the story times," she says. "It's a good time to 
introduce different cultures and new ideas that will pique their imaginations 
through stories." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel has invited New York author and illustrator Brian Pinkney, who will 
read and draw during an energetic discussion about his most recent book, "Max 
Found Two Sticks," (Simon and Schuster, 1994.) The talk will be geared to 
children 5 to 8. Pinkney has illustrated other African American historical 
books, such as a biography of Alvin Ailey and "Seven Candles for Kwanzaa," a 
book about the Christmastime celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Max Found Two Sticks" is a lyrical story involving a boy who taps out sounds 
with two tree twigs. Pinkney draws in a unique scratchboard style, and Daniel 
says his books are popular because he portrays truthful, not stereotypical, 
images of black life. 
</P>
<P>
 For the entire month, the Autry museum is displaying four bronze sculptures by 
an African American former astronaut, Ed Dwight, whose work interprets ethnic 
soldiers, cowboys and settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the museum promises the most extensive lecture series about 
minority settlement in the West ever presented locally, says Mary Ann Ruelas, 
assistant director of programs for the museum. "All of our lecturers for 
February are widely sought after," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "African American history is part of the West, so it is part of our mission 
and goal to get that information out to the public," Ruelas says. "And 
personally, I see a greater awareness of personal heritage and a need to 
explore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Children will be able to meet rodeo cowboy Wayne Orme and practice roping a 
simulated bull at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Autry museum will also present Mike Mann from BEAT radio and his cowboy 
soul band, "Mike Mann and the Nightriders," in a program with artist Clyde 
Williams and actor Kane Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary "Buffalo Soldiers," about all-black infantry and cavalry in 
the early 1870s, will be screened five times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. soldiers could escape everyday prejudice and get a good-paying job in the 
Army. "Ironically," Ruelas says, "despite worse conditions than the general 
Army, their desertion rate was less than anywhere else in the military." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Jones, 77, who was a member of the 10th Cavalry in the 1940s, plans to 
re-create an actual camp setting. Youths will be able to wear cavalry uniforms 
and make shoulder ribbons for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects will range from banging conga drums and bongos to making 
bandannas. The Month's Highlights

IT'S CURTAINS FOR GANGSTERS; TWO PLAYS OPEN, ONE A MUSICAL VERSION OF CAPONE'S 
LIFE, THE OTHER AN EX-CONVICT'S TALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't intentional, but a couple of gangsters are holding a summit in the 
Valley this weekend. One of them is pretty big, a kingpin; the other is sort of 
a small- timer, just sprung from the joint. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Farmer, dramaturge for the American Renegade Theatre, says it's pure 
coincidence that Paul T. Murray's post-prison drama "The Pen" is opening in the 
theater's Stage Two just one day after tonight's opening at West End Playhouse 
in Van Nuys of Mike Reynolds' musical version of the life of Al Capone, 
"Knockin' 'Em Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the earthquake and damage at the Renegade's main stage, the Capone 
production has been transferred to the new venue. The show must go on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capone caper has been in the works at Renegade for more than a year, but 
the decision to stage Murray's play came independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer says he has a "great part" in "The Pen," that of a man released after 
10 years in prison. He has become a new man and winds up in his old 
neighborhood bar to confuse and chagrin his old buddies. The character is based 
on the playwright's real-life uncle, a career criminal with what is sometimes 
called the Irish Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray says his uncle did his first robbery when he was 7 or 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lived a fast life," Murray recalls. "He always had a huge wallet full of 
money, and he was very flashy. But in the end he lost everything -- his wife, 
the family and everything. My father was the hard-working guy who did 
everything legit. In the end my father had what really matters, which was love 
and a family." 
</P>
<P>
 The kingpin, Capone, in Reynolds' musical started his life of crime when he 
left the sixth grade with a B-minus average. His story is history today, but 
Reynolds felt that it would lend itself to the musical form, and to Reynolds' 
desire to write a show that showcased popular music of the period from the 
start of Prohibition to the end of what he calls the classical modern period, 
around 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Murray, the idea was born in a family memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' mother was working at the time at a tobacco stand in a Palm Beach 
hotel where Capone stayed. Capone stopped by the stand every day to play the 
punchboard, a popular pastime years ago. But he never won until one day he 
unrolled the slip of paper he had punched out, and found that his prize was a 
$5 gold piece. He was so happy and proud he handed it to Reynolds' mother and 
said, "Here, kid, keep this for luck." She did, until the country went off the 
gold standard and she redeemed it, much to Reynolds' dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tale stuck with him, and has become the focus of the musical's final 
scene, a Capone memory that leaves him wondering about the luck of life's 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very ambivalent about Capone," Reynolds says, "There are a lot of people 
who thought he was wonderful. He did indeed set up soup kitchens all over 
Chicago for the poor during the Depression, and people who worked in his 
buildings thought very highly of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Cruze, familiar in many TV and film roles and in the New York, London and 
Los Angeles productions of "Tracers," is playing Capone, supported by a cast of 
more than 30. He has his own reference points for the role. While researching 
it, he saw a photo of a house where Capone had lived in Brooklyn. It was a 
house he had passed frequently when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grow up in an area like that," Cruze says, "there are certain things 
that you innately know. I got a feel for what it was like to be involved with 
that kind of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go out, they treat you to dinner, they do wonderful things. They have 
families, they want the best for their kids and a good education. It's just 
that they're in a business that requires muscle. And they were good at it. The 
power that they get drives them into that lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Both playwrights know that, whatever your business, whatever your lifestyle, 
there's always humor to release tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing I remember about my uncle," Murray says. "He was the 
funniest guy in the world. He'd keep you up five, six hours, order Chinese food 
for everybody and tell his stories. An extremely funny man. Yeah, there's humor 
in the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds had to find humor for his musical portrait of Capone, but he says it 
wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of Capone," he said, "there was very little to write about his 
life that could be construed as funny." Where and When What: "Knockin' 'Em 
Dead" at the West End Playhouse, 7446 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys; and "The Pen," 
American Renegade Theatre, 11305 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood. Hours: Both 
productions 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 7 p.m. Sundays. Indefinitely. Price: 
"Knockin' 'Em Dead" $12-$15. "The Pen" $10-$12. Call: (818) 763-4430 for both

THE WRITE STUFF; THE GUYS BEHIND 'WHICH END'S UP?' ARE A FOUNT OF GOOD IDEAS, 
BUT THEIR PERFORMANCE FEELS LIKE A ROUGH DRAFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes regularly about

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Moody and Doug Cox call their evening of comedy skits and improv at the 
Lionstar Theatre "Which End's Up?" -- a good question, they point out, after 
the big quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, as far their act is concerned, is the writing end. With most 
comedy sketch acts, including their alma mater, the Groundlings, it's the 
reverse, with performing far ahead of the writing. In this respect, "Which 
End's Up?" turns things around. 
</P>
<P>
 When it works, comedy theater balances writing and acting in a way no other 
form does. As a comic told me, the delivery needs the line, and the line needs 
the delivery. Which is largely the reason good comedy theater is so rare. 
</P>
<P>
 That Moody and Cox, under Glen Chin's direction, tilt the balance to the other 
side doesn't make their work better than the competition. It just makes us note 
how their lines need the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 We like, for instance, their setup with Moody's lonely telecommuter who 
badgers Cox's door-to-door Jehovah's Witness proselytizer, but we don't believe 
the actors for a moment. Another sketch, with Cox as the jilted sensitive vegan 
boyfriend moving out and running into Moody as the new, gun-toting boyfriend, 
is less sharply scripted, but it could have been pumped up in the playing. 
Here, it looks and sounds tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these guys are really short-order players -- the quicker the serving, 
the hotter. "Big Top Burger Drive-In," which plays on fast-food clerks' 
irritating habit of suggesting dishes you don't want, is one skit that's over 
before you realize it. Another nearly works as silent-film comedy, in which 
Moody's angry acupuncturist tortures patient Cox, who's having an affair with 
Moody's wife. It's cruel but compact, and it knows when to end. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of scenes don't, alas, which is another problem with most sketch comedy. 
The worst sinner is unfortunately the closer, a belabored set of improv scenes 
about an air-conditioning shop owner with a spastic son. Granted, Cox and Moody 
must play with audience suggestions in this situation -- thus robbing 
themselves of their writing strength -- but when the suggestions are this bad, 
the duo is visibly stuck in place. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a good way to end a show, and on Saturday, Cox and Moody appeared to 
be glad to get out alive. For the next show, they might look to that TV monitor 
hovering above their heads on the Lionstar stage. Their TV-related bits, such 
as a running stream of political campaign ad spoofs, contain enough visual and 
topical spice to suggest that this is a user-friendly medium for this comic 
pair. Just as long, that is, as the tube doesn't consume them wholesale. Where 
and When What: "Which End's Up?" Location: Lionstar Theatre, 12655 Ventura 
Blvd., Studio City. Hours: 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Ends March 5. Price: 
$12.50. Call: (818) 955-8647.

1 WOMAN, MANY VOICES; SHANNON BRADLEY'S 'BUT THAT WASN'T SEX,' CONCEIVED AS A 
MONOLOGUE, EVOLVED FROM EXPLORATIONS OF ROMANCE AND RELATIONSHIPS IN HER 
JOURNALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is Peter Fox directing a play that focuses on women's thoughts about sex? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I like women -- in fact, I've loved some," says the Alliance 
Repertory Company's new artistic director, whose staging of Shannon Bradley's 
one-act "But That Wasn't Sex" kicks off the theater's 1994 Bagel Brunch Series 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What appealed to me was Shannon's writing. It could've been about men, women, 
sea otters." But first, Fox thought, it needed editing: In one sitting, he 
whittled the two-hour play down to 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I gave it to Shannon to OK," adds the writer-actor, who was born in New 
Jersey but grew up in Chicago. "And she added a monologue, probably the nicest 
one in the play. I've since asked her to write a different ending, and she's 
done that as well. She's a very thoughtful writer; she has a sense of women's 
feelings -- and men's too. I hope the audience comes away thinking about the 
nature of men and women, and they get a few laughs in between." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not all they'll get. Fox -- who began acting and modeling as a child, 
got an anthropology degree from Harvard and made his film debut in "Fraternity 
Row" -- boasts of "the best deal in town": For a $10 admission, patrons will be 
treated to a pre-show brunch of a bagel sandwich (choice of roast beef, turkey 
or vegetable), fruit salad, pasta salad, coffee and what Fox calls a "desserty 
thing -- maybe a brownie or something like that. And you get a play." 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Bradley began working on her script almost three years ago -- as a 
monologue. "I always wrote journals about growing up, being a human being in 
this world," says the actress-writer. "In my early 20s, I was milling about 
love and romance, mixed messages about sex and marriage. To deal with my 
confusion, I'd write about it. Originally it was going to be one-woman, then 
there were different voices emerging." 
</P>
<P>
 The plot finds the three characters trapped in a women's restroom (inspired by 
a real-life incident in which Bradley observed a hysterical women being coaxed 
out of a public stall). "One of the women is divorced with kids," she explains. 
"The other two are extremes. One is educated, world-weary; the other is from a 
blue-collar family. They're dealing with being alone in their 30s, wondering if 
that's OK. Maybe men are the remedy; maybe they're not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Upland, Bradley graduated in 1987 with a degree in broadcast 
journalism from USC (where she was also entertainment editor of the Daily 
Trojan), and worked as a TV reporter in Palm Desert for six months before 
making the commitment to pursue acting. She's currently appearing onstage as 
Abigail Williams in "The Crucible" at Company of Angels in Silver Lake. "Some 
people have revelations that hit them like an anvil," she says of the choice to 
act. "My feelings sort of seeped in." Where and When What: "But That Wasn't 
Sex." Location: Alliance Repertory Company, 3204 W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank. 
(Enter through the alley.) Hours: 11:30 a.m. brunch, noon show, Saturdays and 
Sundays. Closes Feb. 27. Price: $10. Call: (818) 566-7935.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: FINDING THE RIGHT WORKER; THE END RESULT CAN FILL YOUR 
ORDER FOR ALMOST ANY HOUSEHOLD JOB -- AND THERE'S NO CHARGE FOR THE SERVICE. 
</P>

 The phones have been ringing off the hook at The End Result, which isn't 
surprising, since this is a referral service for all kinds of work around the 
house. Teddie and Karen Kessie, a mother-and-daughter team, work from dawn to 
dark at their home, helping people find people when they need help. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you need, from a chimney expert to a tile worker to beginning or 
master carpenters, the referral charge to the consumer is zip. The tradespeople 
pay The End Result a small fee: 10% or less of the profit they realize from a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work out a fair arrangement with the workers and are careful that the 
consumer doesn't get a bigger bill because of it," Teddie Kessie said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her daughter make it up in volume. "When you have several jobs out 
there a day, it adds up fast," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, it's enough to allow a staff of three assistants and a living for 
the Kessies. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 10 years, I have used The End Result on about 15 occasions. Only 
once did I get a job done that was less than terrific, and that was by a 
painter who was very reasonable and very speedy, but also very myopic. When I 
pointed out where he had missed a few spots, he didn't object, but just 
repainted them. Fourteen out of 15 isn't bad. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first few days after the 6.6 quake, the majority of calls to The 
End Result were for experts who specialize in chimney repair, block-wall 
repair, glaziers, plumbers and inspectors of all kinds. The End Result was able 
to fill the orders. 
</P>
<P>
 On file at The End Result's office is information and references on all its 
400 listings, 100 of which are on the active list. When a call comes in, it's 
simply a matter of matching the worker to the job. The consumer then places the 
call and sets up an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The screening process begins with an informal interview, allowing Kessie to 
get a view of the worker's overall personality. Three current references are 
required, and both Karen and Teddie Kessie believe that they have a handle on 
what questions reveal someone's true character. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are clues," Kessie said. "One expert closet organizer told me his wife 
thinks he's a schnook because he leans over backward to give his clients 
whatever they need. She shouldn't pick on him; he's a wonderful worker, and his 
business will thrive." 
</P>
<P>
 The End Result staffers work closely with contractors and try to fit the type 
of contractor to the client's needs. If the first referral doesn't work out, 
they'll be happy to suggest another. Most of their referrals are licensed and 
bonded, but should there be a problem, The End Result will act as mediator. Its 
tradespeople cover the San Fernando Valley west to Thousand Oaks, the San 
Gabriel Valley, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, there is no referral charge to the consumer. It's like having a 
friend with a finger on the pulse of the workplace. Where and When What: The 
End Result. Location: 13061 Hartsook St., Sherman Oaks. Hours: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
every day. Call: (818) 784-1572.

A STITCH OF COMFORT; AN ENCINO GROUP HAS BEEN CREATING QUILTS FOR OTHERS SINCE 
1987. MEMBERS ARE STEPPING UP EFFORTS AFTER THE QUAKE.

 Soon after the Northridge earthquake, some of the families left homeless 
received a colorful handcrafted quilt. "It may not be much, but a quilt has a 
lot of meaning behind it," said Hannah Meottel of Encino, one of the founders 
of Quilters for Others. "People can recognize the work and effort it takes to 
make a good quilt. They see the love that goes into it." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's 25 to 30 regular members meet monthly to assemble the colorful 
designs of the quilt tops, fill them with batting and put them together, using 
sewing machines. They began their work in 1987, when a few San Fernando Valley 
women met monthly to sew quilts together. 
</P>
<P>
 In the planning stage of a quilt, a "block," or a sample of the pattern, is 
sewn together to see how the quilt will look when complete. If the quilter 
decides against the pattern or color, a new block is started. Shortly after the 
group began, members used some leftover blocks to make nine quilts and gave 
them to Haven Hills, a Valley shelter for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, more women began showing up for the meetings and more charities began 
asking for quilts. Last year, more than 400 quilts of various sizes and designs 
were sewn and given away. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups that have received quilts range from the Mary Magdalene Project, 
which assists former prostitutes, to the Sherman Oaks Burn Center, which gives 
the quilts to its patients.  
</P>
<P>
 "The apartment complex where our crisis shelter is located is very Spartan," 
said Betty Fisher, director of Haven Hills. "The quilts we receive really 
brighten up the place. The women who get them are amazed that a stranger would 
go through all that work to make a quilt just for them. It makes a difference." 
 
</P>
<P>
 A Quilters for Others meeting resembles an assembly line. At various tables, 
some cut fabric while others plan where the multicolored swatches will go. The 
rest of the members attach the batting and sew the quilts together. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the demand, kits have been put together with the needed 
materials for those who want to work on quilts at home. "We've had several 
invalids contact us who have wanted to help out, so we've given them the kits 
and they've been able to pitch in," said Meottel, who has been making quilts 
for 40 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the group hasn't had any male members and most of the women are 
retired, anyone is welcome, even those without quilting experience. "All they 
have to do is show up with two hands," Meottel said. "We'll put them to work."  
</P>
<P>
 The group's fabrics and sewing machines are mostly donated or bought with 
money earned from the raffling off of some quilts. Many of the members also 
kick in some fabrics and thread from their own quilting projects.  
</P>
<P>
 Before it's given away, each quilt must meet the group's high standards. 
Stitches are checked to make sure they don't show, and corners and patterns are 
examined for consistency. After the quilt is approved, the Quilters for Others 
label is sewn on and it's ready to be given away.  
</P>
<P>
 Some members in the North Valley who wanted to stay close to home began 
meeting at Joelle Colville's Granada Hills house to work on quilts, and that 
splinter branch has evolved into what Colville calls "the soup group."  
</P>
<P>
 "I make a couple of pots of soup for everyone, and we have a good time."  
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake has put a crimp in the quilters' efforts. Just when the group 
was working feverishly to supply quilts to victims of the Malibu fires, it had 
to shut down. Its meeting place in the community room at Fallbrook Mall in West 
Hills was closed, and Colville's home where the soup group met suffered some 
damage.  
</P>
<P>
 "My sewing room was a disaster area," said Colville. "The people who meet at 
my house all live where the earthquake hit the hardest." 
</P>
<P>
 But a few days after the quake, some volunteers picked up 11 finished quilts 
at Colville's house and distributed them. "There's always a need, and now that 
we'll be making them for neighbors, the need is even greater," Meottel said. 
Where and When What: Quilters for Others. Hours: 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., the last 
Wednesday of every month. Call: Hannah Meottel, (818) 784-4612, for location.

A LOT ON THEIR PLATE; QUAKE-DAMAGED EATERIES ARE MAKING REPAIRS AS FAST AS 
POSSIBLE. SOME THAT REMAINED OPEN OFFERED A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO GO IN THE 
AFTERMATH.

 "We are crushed," said a banner stretched over the ruins of Johnny Rockets in 
Sherman Oaks. "Shocking!" said a sign on the crumpled Hamburger Hamlet on 
nearby Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reseda Kentucky Fried Chicken flew its KFC flag at half-mast. Around the 
corner from the devastated Northridge Meadows apartment complex, a small, 
rather plaintive hand-lettered sign tacked over the rubble-strewn entrance of a 
strip mall promised "BBQ Open." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in tears when I saw it," Tom McFall, president of Hamburger Hamlet 
Restaurants Inc., said of the Sherman Oaks location. But a deeper inspection of 
the building in which it is a tenant revealed no structural damage. The 
restaurant could be open again by mid-March. "Isn't that amazing?" McFall 
marveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronn Teitelbaum, chairman of the board of Johnny Rockets, said he doesn't know 
the fate of the Sherman Oaks location, a neon landmark across the street from 
Tower Records on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the fourth or fifth restaurant in the chain that we opened about 
seven years ago, so we have a sentimental reason we'd like to keep that one 
open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Northridge Market Place, on Nordhoff Street between Corbin and Tampa 
avenues, both Cafe Como and California Cucina are closed temporarily but hope 
to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9080 Tampa in Northridge, Chi Chi's was severely damaged and probably won't 
open for as long as three months, said Joan Rusen, whose family owns six Chi 
Chi's restaurants in the quake zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wall along Tampa moved down eight inches, and the Nordhoff wall bowed 
out," she said. "Everything inside twisted and turned, and 1,000 pounds of 
pizza ovens just tumbled over. We hope they work. We haven't had a chance to 
check them. Chandeliers fell. You couldn't walk through the place. It was just 
a catastrophe, terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Healy, public relations manager for El Torito, said the chain's Northridge 
location at 8855 Tampa Ave. appeared to be seriously damaged but is expected to 
open by Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fared worse than most of the other restaurants (in the area), who were up 
and running within a couple of days," said Healy. "But luckily it was mostly 
cosmetic damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Teitelbaum, like many others, was thankful the 6.6 temblor struck in the wee 
hours of the morning when the busy, counter-service burger shop was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we would have had any deaths, but there definitely would have 
been some serious injuries," Teitelbaum said. "The hood fell in on the grill, 
the ceiling fell in, glass broke and the building is probably going to be 
condemned. People are looking at it right now to see if we can rebuild. So I 
guess we've suffered like everybody, but not as bad as a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other restaurants were closed for briefer periods of time while 
repairs were made, including Alexi's Greek restaurant and its Japanese-cuisine 
neighbor, Musashi, both housed in a shopping mall in the 9000 block of Tampa 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents of the Valley checked immediately to see how favorite haunts 
had fared in the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people miss us, and we miss them," said John Beauchamp, manager of 
Truly Yours, a small cafe at 9725 Reseda Blvd. in Northridge, which was closed 
for repairs and repainting. He planned to reopen as soon as he could get a city 
inspector out to give him the OK. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliano's Delicatessen, which shares a parking lot with Truly Yours, has a 
"limited entry" tag on the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Rusen said the five other Chi Chi's restaurants in the San Fernando Valley and 
Santa Clarita managed to reopen within two days of the quake. "Our customers 
were just so glad to have a familiar place to go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teitelbaum said two of the restaurant's other Valley locations reopened 
immediately after the quake, though they ran out of supplies. "We were able to 
at least get some people some food who said, 'Thank God you're open because 
you're the only ones and we have nowhere to go.' We weren't even charging at 
the end, because we couldn't put the proper sandwiches together. So we just 
said, 'Here, take it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Studio City, Art Ginsburg said he hopes to reopen his neighborhood treasure 
Art's Delicatessen in about three months. The Bistro Garden suffered 
considerable cosmetic damage but hopes to be up and running in about a month. 
The Daily Grill in the new mall at Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards had 
extensive water damage and will be closed six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cafe Cordiale, at 14015 Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks, and Maria's Italian 
Kitchen, 23000 Ventura Blvd. in Woodland Hills, lost their buildings to fires. 
Both hope to relocate in the same neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere along restaurant-thick Ventura Boulevard, the effects of the quake 
could still be seen two weeks after the fact. In Studio City, the Gaucho Grill 
sign was half gone. Down the street, scaffolding obscured part of Il Mito, 
although valet parkers were on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wine Bistro's awning was tattered. Siam was open behind boarded-up 
windows. The second-floor California Pizza Kitchen had a huge, hand-lettered 
"Open!" sign that directed patrons around the damaged escalator to the stairs 
or elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, a healthy contingent of java hounds sat beneath boarded-up 
windows at Starbuck's coffee shop to watch the post-quake bustle along the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel's Drive-In was open again after repairing broken windows. The Orion Cafe 
in the Radisson Valley Center Hotel posted a sign promising, "We will reopen 
for business soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Like neighbor meeting previously unknown neighbor in the wake of the quake, 
customers realized the bond they share with proprietors of their favorite 
eateries, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign on the Hamburger Hamlet in Sherman Oaks, forlorn behind yellow 
"Caution" tape, said: "Although we regret our loss, we are sincerely concerned 
about yours. We at Hamburger Hamlet wish you a speedy recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Rusen said that only days after the quake, the Chi Chi's restaurant chain 
receive a thank you letter from a grateful customer in Santa Clarita whose home 
was severely damaged. "She said she was saying to her daughter just a few 
minutes after the quake, 'I wonder when Chi Chi's will be open?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's been calling. It's nice," said Beauchamp at Truly Yours. "You 
look around and things are a mess, but everybody wished you well and wants to 
know how you are. It actually makes you feel pretty good."

AIMING TO PLEASE; REGULARS GET THE ROYAL TREATMENT AT EDO SUSHI NAGAO. BUT THE 
DELICACIES THERE WILL DELIGHT NOVICES AS WELL. 
</P>

 Who has the best sushi in town? Could it be Ginza Sushi-Ko, where the tab 
often exceeds $150 per person? Or Matsuhisa, an eccentric La Cienega celebrity 
hangout where half the dishes look as if they were pulled out of a spaceship's 
galley? 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I'm not inclined to speculate. Sushi is the essence of simplicity, 
and at its best, fresh and competently crafted, it's one of those foods that 
doesn't need analysis. But when one local critic solemnly proclaimed that the 
best sushi in Los Angeles might be found in a narrow Tarzana haunt called Edo 
Sushi Nagao, I had to see for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I wouldn't go so far as to compare it with Tokyo's legendary Tsukiji 
fish market (as the critic did), but I'm already planning my next trip. 
</P>
<P>
 On my first visit, at 9:30 on a Saturday evening, the place was packed (two 
chairs shortly opened up at the 16-seat counter). It was fairly obvious 
Nagao-san has a regular clientele -- at least half a dozen people leaned over 
the bar on leaving to ask him whether his house had sustained any earthquake 
damage. For the record, he gave a resigned shrug. Nagao's way of getting 
personal is to serve up a beautiful piece of mackerel or striped bass without 
being asked. He knows what his regulars like, and he likes to please them. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-time customer would be well-advised to order with confidence. Call it 
Japanese modesty, but until a sushi master knows you, he's not going to feel 
all that comfortable feeding you. I had to ask more than once for certain 
dishes, until the chef was sure that was exactly what I wanted. Once he was 
sure, the dishes arrived at something just short of light speed. 
</P>
<P>
 This is actually a modest place on many levels. It's not long on atmosphere, 
apart from a plastic replica of Godzilla with an "I Love Edo," button pinned to 
the monster's lapel (Edo is the old Japanese name for Tokyo) and a colorful 
samurai painted on the front window, which obscures any outside view and makes 
the place seem even more intimate than it already is. It's a smoke-free 
restaurant, by the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The waitress who takes your drink order will ply you with a simple, satisfying 
bowl of o-mi-o-tsuke , Japanese slang for miso soup. I'd advise trying 
something simple like aji (jack mackerel) or toro (fatty tuna belly) before 
plunging into one of Nagao-san's ornate salads or imaginative hand rolls, which 
are all clearly favorites with his regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagao-san prepares a moist, almost wet style of sushi, lacquering the top of 
the fish with various sauces and occasionally sprinkling white sesame seeds 
over the individual pieces. This means it is served essentially ready to eat, 
and that further embellishment with wasabi, soy or ginger is often unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The mackerel is superb, but Nagao-san's rice sort of crumbles as you pick it 
up, so watch it, unless you want a front full of sauce. Uni , or sea urchin, is 
another great favorite here. Nagao-san's version has the salty, almost 
bleach-like tang you expect from good sea urchin, not to mention that famous 
custardy texture. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is dominated by hand rolls -- partly cooked, partly raw creations 
that people would find downright curious in Japan. We tried the sunshine roll 
and the midnight roll, both large concoctions with rice on the outside and the 
filling left to the chef's imagination. If I recall correctly, the sunshine 
roll is stuffed with fried calamari, a mayo-rich crab paste, cooked asparagus, 
gobo (the crunchy root of the burdock plant) and a handful of daikon sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The midnight roll substitutes crab and avocado for the calamari, and it's 
painted with a dark soy paste. Lots of other delicacies are listed on the 
English-only blackboard menu behind the counter, anything from baked yellowtail 
cheeks to raw cockles to chawan mushi -- a delicate custard filled with 
chicken, enoki mushrooms and a very un-Japanese clump of broccoli. ("We don't 
get many Japanese customers," Nagao-san admitted.) 
</P>
<P>
 I've had a delicious salmon skin salad here, made with more salmon than 
vegetables. I've also sampled nuta , an oddball seafood salad where octopus, 
jumbo clam and mackerel sit astride radishes, cucumbers, daikon sprouts and a 
penetrating yellow soybean paste. Grab the broiled butterfish if the chef 
hasn't run out. It's amazing the way it melts like butter in your mouth. For 
those made squeamish by raw sea creatures, you can order solidly 
Japanese-American fare such as chicken teriyaki.  
</P>
<P>
 As for me, next time I come, I'm planning to order as simply as I can. But 
maybe Nagao-san will recognize me, and then he'll probably just know what I 
want. Where and When Location: Edo Sushi Nagao, 18760 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. 
Suggested Dishes: Aji , $3.25; salmon skin salad, $4.50; chawan mushi , $3.50; 
broiled butterfish, $4; nuta , $5.95. Hours: Lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday 
through Friday; dinner 5 to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 5 to 10:30 p.m. 
Friday and Saturday. Price: Dinner for two, $20 to $45. Beer and wine only. 
Parking lot. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Call: (818) 344-9689.

CALIFORNIA DATELINE / PATT MORRISON: SNAPSHOTS OF LIFE IN THE GOLDEN STATE.; 
OTTER CRIME WAVE SURFACES: SEX, VIOLENCE, HOSTAGES

 In the first long-range study of those adorable sea otters, a research team at 
the Monterey Bay Aquarium has found that cute is only skin-deep. The 10,000 
hours of work -- the first long-range study of sea otter behavior, says the 
Contra Costa Times -- found, among other things, a domestic crime wave atop the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Females are sometimes killed when males bite them on the nose during mating to 
keep from slip-sliding away; one male drowned a female by holding her under 
water for about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 And, says researcher Marianne Riedman, males sometimes take otter pups hostage 
rather than do an honest day's fishing. After a mother otter dives for food, a 
male grabs a pup. When the mother resurfaces with the groceries, she sees the 
hostage crisis, drops the food and heads for the pup. The male otter frees his 
hostage, and swipes the morsel the mother had dropped.

 Something must be done: Three strikes, and you're off the threatened-species 
list.

 Bon voyage: Just in time to help you get your mind off the slew of natural 
disasters. . . . Gov. Pete Wilson has declared February "Cruise Vacation 
Month." He would like to promote coastal tourism, but right now a slow boat to 
China sounds more restful than California's ports of call. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's own travels have taken him to Minneapolis, Chicago, Dallas and New 
York of late -- not to mention those reconnaissance rides over Epicenter South 
-- and to the National Governors' Assn. meeting in Washington, where his old 
Senate colleague, Arkansas Democrat Dale Bumpers, twitted Wilson that the way 
things are going in California, Bumpers would bet Wilson wishes he were back in 
the Senate. California's Highs and Lows 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of its active seismic history, California is home to both the 
highest and the lowest elevations in the contiguous 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highest: Mt. Whitney, with a summit of 14,495 feet, is the highest point in 
California and the continental United States. Alaska's Mt. McKinley, at 20,320 
feet, is the highest in North America. Mt. Whitney is in Sequoia National Park, 
on the border of Inyo and Tulare counties. The first recorded ascent of its 
summit was by local fishermen in August, 1873. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lowest: A long and irregularly shaped shallow pond of brackish water in 
Death Valley, named Badwater, is North America's lowest spot, at 282 feet below 
sea level. Badwater is in Inyo County, less than 80 miles from Mt. Whitney. 
Known to the Panamint Indians, it was named by prospectors who entered it as a 
shortcut to the gold mines in December, 1849.

 It's not easy being Brown: As his sister's political trajectory rises, former 
Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. has gone into a different orbit altogether. 
Brown's two-hour show on the Talk America radio network began this week. But 
the two-time presidential candidate, the son of Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. 
and brother of gubernatorial hopeful Kathleen Brown, may already have found 
that life on the other side of the microphone isn't all it's cracked up to be: 
The former governor (whose second term was marred by a fracas over aerial 
Medfly spraying) got modest second billing for Saturday's Farm Conference in 
Ventura -- after a deputy agriculture secretary.

 Rush cuts: In Santa Cruz, home of the fighting banana slugs, Bookshop Santa 
Cruz sold Rush Limbaugh's latest tome for $8.40 -- the identical per-pound 
price as the equivalent amount of baloney, which shop owner Neal Coonerty 
judged it to be. The beauty part for Coonerty was tacking on $7.30 for the 
local AIDS fund and another $7.30 for the town's National Organization for 
Women chapter -- neither of them a Limbaugh cause -- to bring each book up to 
the cover price of $23. Limbaugh ridiculed them on the air, a few fans stomped 
in to complain, and the sales mounted. Donation checks, for $978.15 each, are 
in the mail, and Coonerty was satisfied: "They're going to get more out of the 
sales of his book than he will."

 Hoof and mouth: We told you some months ago that underwater explorer Jacques 
Cousteau was not amused at a Sonoma County billboard showing a local dairy's 
mascot, Clo the Cow, decked out as "Jacques Cowsteau" in diving togs, pointing 
the way to Marine World. The Gallic Neptune of the Seven Seas sued the milk 
company in federal court, and Cousteau and Clover-Stornetta Farms settled this 
week. The dairy donated money to the Cousteau Society and apologized for "any 
embarrassment, misunderstanding or public confusion" it may have caused. 
Remember, France is a country that considers Jerry Lewis movies the pinnacle of 
American wit.

 "You folks have a hell of a deal out there for 50 bucks. And then you complain 
about the soap?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Imperial County Supervisor Dean Shores, about complaints by some Canadian 
visitors who park their RVs during the winter at Hot Springs Long Term Visitors 
Area for $50. The group was upset when the Bureau of Land Management began 
enforcing its no soap rule in a shower next to the geothermal springs; soap can 
clog a nearby pond and contaminate the wildlife habitat.

DAVID I. SOFRO; CO-FOUNDER OF HOUSE OF FABRICS RETAIL CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David I. Sofro, co-founder and longtime chairman of House of Fabrics Inc., 
which with 750 outlets in 43 states is the nation's largest chain of retail 
fabric stores, has died. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Sofro died Jan. 17 at his Glendale home of congestive heart failure, the 
company announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a junk dealer who liked to refer to himself as "just a ragman," 
Sofro was born in North Adams, Mass. He started his first fabric store in New 
England, struggling through the Depression and fabric shortages during World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain that California offered more opportunities for growth, Sofro sold the 
original Eastern store and moved to Los Angeles in 1946. He and his brother and 
co-founder, Charles, opened their first store on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop enjoyed modest success, but Sofro really began his retail magic in 
1965 when he took the company public. 
</P>
<P>
 A former carnival barker and pitchman, Sofro rapidly increased the number of 
stores, which became known for constant sales promotions and markdowns. He 
labeled his stores east of the Rocky Mountains "So-Fro" for his surname. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Sofro began buying out competitors -- the Massachusetts-based 
24-store Beaconway Corp. chain in 1983, the Cleveland-based 35-store Craft 
Showcase chain in 1984, and in 1985 the popular 23-store Southern California 
competitor Home Silk Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We react to the fashion industry; they don't react to us," Sofro said of his 
successful marketing techniques in a 1977 interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 When designers said consumers were tired of synthetics and ready for cotton 
and wool again, Sofro said, his stores stocked cotton and wool even though 
prices were higher. 
</P>
<P>
 When women left the home for the office in the 1970s, naysayers predicted home 
sewing would decline, but Sofro was unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The true story is this," he told The Times. "When women go to work, they need 
a much larger wardrobe. The larger the wardrobe, the more they're going to 
sew." 
</P>
<P>
 Sofro retired as chairman and chief executive officer of the Sherman 
Oaks-based chain in 1986, but remained a director and consultant. His son, 
Barney Sofro, succeeded him as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 As his business acumen made him wealthy, Sofro began to indulge in an 
expensive hobby -- horse racing -- and proved highly successful at that too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in western Massachusetts, 40 miles from Saratoga (racetrack)," he 
told The Times at Santa Anita in 1984. "I used to go to the races, look at the 
Vanderbilts, the Whitneys, all those beautiful horses, and dream. The only 
horse we had in my family then was Jim, who hauled my father's junk wagon 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Sofro was at Santa Anita to watch his horse, Interco, which won nine 
consecutive stakes races, including the 1984 Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to son, Sofro is survived by two brothers, Stanley of Northridge 
and Louis of Florida, and three grandchildren.

NORTH CAROLINA PUSHES AND NO. 1 DUKE SLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the sixth consecutive week, college basketball will have a new No. 
1-ranked team. The Duke Blue Devils got their shot at the top spot, and No. 2 
North Carolina knocked them off Thursday night, 89-78, in front of 21,572 at 
Dean E. Smith Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time these rivals have met as the nation's No. 1- and No. 
2-ranked teams, and for a little more than a half, it was a magnificent game. 
But with Duke leading, 43-38, early in the second half, the Tar Heels outscored 
the Blue Devils, 30-10, during the next 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke made a late run that reduced a 68-53 deficit to 75-69 with a little more 
than two minutes to play, but the Tar Heels, 18-3 overall and 6-2 in the 
Atlantic Coast Conference, held off the Blue Devils. North Carolina's victory 
created a three-way tie for first place in the ACC between it, Duke (15-2, 6-2) 
and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina can regain the No. 1 ranking with a victory Saturday against 
North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure anybody wants to be No. 1 right now," North Carolina center Eric 
Montross said. "It's kind of a curse." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for a scintillating first half that ended with Duke 
leading, 40-38, on the strength of an 8-3 run in the final minutes, during 
which guard Chris Collins made two three-pointers. The Blue Devils shot 64% -- 
the best half of shooting against North Carolina this season. The Tar Heels 
countered with 54%. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't miss a few easy shots in the opening minutes, both teams would 
have shot 60%," said Dean Smith, North Carolina coach. "I'm so engrossed in 
what my team is doing, I don't know if it's a well-played game from the fans' 
point of view, but it sounds like it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins extended Duke's lead to 43-38 at the start of the second half with 
another three-pointer, but the Tar Heels responded with a 12-2 rally that put 
them ahead, 50-45, with 16 minutes to play. Seven-foot forward Kevin Salvadori, 
who was scoreless at halftime, scored six of the points during the rally. Two 
of his baskets came on medium-range jump shots, countering Duke's defensive 
strategy of sloughing off him and Montross, who scored 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Devil forward Grant Hill, who scored 20, momentarily quelled the Tar 
Heels by making a jumper right before a television timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the ballgame when most teams would have folded," Hill said. "It 
seemed like they had about 20 guys out there. They just kept coming in. I 
wanted to come out and rest, but I couldn't."

UCLA SHOWS USC JUST HOW BIG GAP IS; BASKETBALL: BRUINS RUN AWAY QUICKLY, 
101-72, IN MOST LOPSIDED RESULT OF SERIES SINCE 1974. ED O'BANNON HAS 24 
POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Little League baseball has a 10-run rule, in golf you can concede a putt, 
politics has concession speeches, but there is nothing in college basketball 
that could have helped USC escape from Pauley Pavilion a little earlier 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 For UCLA, there was nothing like pinning a little 101-72 defeat on USC to take 
the sting out of losing at California last weekend. Afterward, once it had 
stopped raining points through the hoop, Jim Harrick once again proved himself 
to be a master of understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we played a fine ballgame," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 And overall, a basketball is pretty round. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a sellout crowd of 12,623, Ed O'Bannon led a sextet of Bruins scoring 
in double figures with 24 points as UCLA made it 15-1 on the season and 8-1 in 
the Pacific 10 Conference. It was the most lopsided game in the series in 20 
years. The Bruins won, 82-52, in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 If things go right, UCLA can be a lot better, O'Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think so," he said. "We have a lot of phases for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Trojans, the phase they're going through is sort of a painful 
thing. It was the sixth consecutive defeat for USC (10-8, 3-6), and it wasn't 
very pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 George Raveling was asked when he felt the game slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the tip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but it got even worse in the second half. UCLA's 19-point halftime 
lead grew to 25, then 31 right after the Trojans made a classic blunder, which 
probably answered once and for all what their problem is. 
</P>
<P>
 They can't count. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans got caught with six players on the floor when Lorenzo Orr was 
supposed to come out, but mistakenly stayed in. It turned out to be a 
four-point play. Tyus Edney made two free throws on the technical and Shon 
Tarver drove the lane for a hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tarver left an over-the-shoulder pass for Ed O'Bannon, which wound up as 
a breakaway dunk, the Bruins were out of sight, 76-45, with 11:07 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr blamed the mixup on "miscommunication." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Orr: "Raveling drew up a play and I thought I saw an O for Orr to be in 
the game, but it was something else." 
</P>
<P>
 What it was, no one knew for sure. The only thing certain was that UCLA was 
ringing up points, and quickly. Tarver and Charles O'Bannon had 17 points, 
Edney had 13 points and seven assists, Kevin Dempsey sank four three-pointers 
for 12 points and George Zidek contributed 10 points in 19 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add nine steals, eight blocked shots, and UCLA's trip to play Notre Dame on 
Saturday probably seems a lot smoother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to keep our heads on," Ed O'Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Boyd led USC with 17 points and Orr had 14, but guards Burt Harris and 
Brandon Martin were a combined one for 11 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The 196th meeting between the two schools actually began about a half an hour 
before tip-off when the USC players walked on the court to warm up. While the 
USC band played the fight song, Orr playfully conducted the band and was 
accompanied by a resounding chorus of boos from the UCLA student section. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could blame Bruin followers for being angry, or at least a little bit 
antsy? After all, the last time UCLA beat USC at Pauley Pavilion was three 
years ago when Charles O'Bannon was a sophomore in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, UCLA seemed on its way to a graduate degree in scoring. Ed 
O'Bannon had 17 points in 17 minutes and the Bruins walked to the locker room 
with a 53-34 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, they made it look easy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 18:22, the Bruins led, 8-2, on an authoritative dunk by Ed O'Bannon. At 
13:32, the Bruins led, 19-8, on two free throws by O'Bannon. At 10:01, the 
Bruins led, 30-14, on a resounding dunk off an offensive rebound by O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went for the Bruins. USC challenged just once in the first half when 
back-to-back dunks by Avondre Jones and Orr's short jumpers brought the Trojans 
to within 36-26. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as quickly as UCLA's inside defense wilted, it perked up again. Edney 
stole the ball twice, drained a three-pointer from the top of the circle and 
UCLA knocked down 12 points during the last three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney had six assists and three steals in the half, which he really didn't 
need to do to impress Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Raveling, Edney and Damon Stoudamire could be, well, a lot bigger 
than they are if it weren't for the fact that Jason Kidd of California happens 
to be playing in the same conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure Tyus is praying every night Kidd goes hardship," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hardship evident Thursday night was the fact that USC had to play at 
Pauley Pavilion.

ERRATIC CAMPBELL UP, BUT LAKERS DOWN; PRO BASKETBALL: FORWARD SCORES 
CAREER-HIGH 29 POINTS AND GRABS 13 REBOUNDS IN 99-88 LOSS AT HOUSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think Thursday was a strange night for the Lakers, and it was in a 
99-88 loss to the Houston Rockets, try living Elden Campbell's last couple of 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's playing time had been cut to the mid-20-minute range starting about 
mid-January. On Jan. 21, when the injury-riddled Lakers were down to eight 
players at Portland, he played 40 minutes and finished with a career-high 27 
points. The next two games, he didn't get off the bench in the fourth quarter 
while going 18 and 10 minutes. Two games after that, before 12,092 at the 
Summit and while often matching up against Hakeem Olajuwon, he hit the Rockets 
for 29 points to set a personal best, along with 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers' next game is tonight at Dallas. Campbell? Wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a professional and I've got to do the best I can when I get the minutes," 
he said. "And still try my best when I don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minutes have been there lately. He (Coach Randy Pfund) has given back a 
little more. It's not like it was before, when I was getting 34. But 30 is 
better than 18." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing 31 the night before at San Antonio before being ejected with 
2:23 remaining for a minor scuffle, Campbell went 32 against the Rockets. He 
probably would have played more were it not for two fouls in the first quarter, 
but that was still long enough to lead Vlade Divac (16 points and 15 rebounds) 
and George Lynch (14 points, 12 rebounds and five steals) in a strong showing 
by the Laker front line. 
</P>
<P>
 The backcourt was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the backcourt was in another world. Nick Van Exel made three of 18 
shots. Sedale Threatt was three of 15. Tony Smith went four of 11. At one time, 
Van Exel and Threatt were each one of 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a night when we get 25 offensive rebounds, outrebound our opponent by 
three, Elden gets 29 points and our frontline gets 13, 12 and 15 rebounds, you 
would think we'd be in the game right down to the wire," Pfund said. "But the 
thing we forgot to do was shoot the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that and a 17-point deficit with 7 1/2 minutes left, the Lakers turned 
what could have been an ugly night into a game. They got within seven points, 
the first time at 89-82 with 3:22 remaining and were poised to get closer as 
the Rockets went scoreless for 5:36, but Tony Smith and Lynch both missed 
inside shots. 
</P>
<P>
 That turned out to be the last gasp. Houston, led by Olajuwon's 28 points and 
15 rebounds got the lead back to nine with 31 seconds remaining en route to 
their fifth consecutive victory in the series.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE ADDS SOME SPICE TO THEIR MARRIED LIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When she can lasso her husband long enough, Jo Lasorda takes the Dodgers' 
manager with her to supermarkets and department stores to promote the couple's 
pasta sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talks to people and signs autographs, but I have to be there to keep 
things moving," Jo says. "Tommy talks to everybody like they are old friends. 
Everybody knows so and so or has a nephew in Australia who played for a friend 
of Tommy's in Little League in Japan. He'll talk all day. I have to tell him, 
'Dad, this is not a reunion, this is a sauce demonstration.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Add Lasorda: "Some people come up and taste the sauce and then say, and I love 
this part, 'Well, I'm Italian, I'm from the Old Country, and this is how I make 
sauce.' And I tell them, 'Well, I'm not Italian, I just married an Italian. I'm 
from South Carolina, and this is how I make mine.' They look at me like, 'How 
can you make sauce if you are from the South?' Like all I should be making is 
gravy."

 Trivia time: Name the two Olympic athletes who starred in "Tarzan's Revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Different tune: The musical, "Damn Yankees," is scheduled to open March 3 on 
Broadway. But not long before the show first appeared, in May of 1955, the New 
York Yankees had won five consecutive World Series and would follow with a 
string of four consecutive American League pennants. This led Murray Chass of 
the New York Times to ask: "What is there now to motivate Shoeless Joe from 
Hannibal, Mo., to sell his soul to the devil so he can help beat the Yankees? 
Maybe he should sell his soul to George Steinbrenner and help the Yankees win." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Chass: "In case Shoeless Joe has been napping since the show's first 
Broadway tour ended, someone should tell him the Yankees haven't won a pennant 
since 1981. The 12-year drought is the franchise's longest since the first two 
decades of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 For the fan: Baseball Weekly recently listed 61 Don't Miss Places in Baseball. 
Among them was No. 56 -- Lefty O'Doul's bar in San Francisco, named after the 
former two-time batting champion and popular manager of the old San Francisco 
Seals in the Pacific Coast League. The publication noted that O'Doul is the 
same guy who once told young Ted Williams, "Kid, don't let anybody ever try to 
change the way you hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Add list: No. 50 was the unique seating offered at Sky Sox Stadium, home of 
the minor league Colorado Springs Sky Sox. For $80, a party of 10 can watch the 
game from the privacy of a hot tub. Concessionaires cater tubside. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoops: When free agent Otis Nixon signed with Boston, the Red Sox were so 
happy to have the speedy outfielder they told him he could wear No. 1 as he did 
with the Atlanta Braves. The only problem was the Red Sox had retired that 
number in honor of Hall of Fame member Bobby Doerr. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon will wear No. 2.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: A TOUCH OF JOY AMID THE PAIN OF DEALING WITH DEATH OF 
A SON; LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the tragedies of life is losing a son or daughter, and one of the joys 
of life is the arrival of a grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully experienced both within a two-day span. 
</P>
<P>
 The call came on Jan. 20. Michael Scully, 33, a supervising engineer with a 
subsidiary of Arco, had been involved in a helicopter crash that morning. He 
was inspecting a crude-oil pipeline that runs from the San Joaquin Valley to 
Southern California, looking for earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was the worst possible. The helicopter had exploded upon impact with 
the ground. Michael Scully and the pilot were killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Loll, a spokesman for Arco, said the helicopter had somehow become 
entangled in power lines, but the cause of the crash is still being 
investigated. The crash occurred close to a landing area near Ft. Tejon on the 
northwest side of the Interstate 5 Ridge Route. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Scully, who had an MBA from Pepperdine, had worked as a civil engineer 
for ARCO since 1986 and had lived with his wife, Kathy, in Bakersfield since 
September 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, as he was known, was often described as a "great kid," and Loll said he 
was very popular among co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The description you heard a lot was, 'If you didn't know he was Vin Scully's 
son, you'd never guess he was the son of a celebrity,' " Loll said. "Those who 
were close to him say he was proud of his father but he never talked about who 
he was. He was just a regular guy who was very comfortable with himself." 
</P>
<P>
 That Thursday afternoon, Arco sent a jet to pick up Vin and his wife, Sandy, 
at Burbank Airport and take them to Bakersfield to be with Kathy and her son, 
Matthew Vincent Scully, 3. The jet brought them all back to Southern California 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 While in the air, Kathy, who was pregnant, went into labor. After the plane 
arrived in Burbank, she was taken to St. Vincent Hospital, with Vin and Sandy 
Scully accompanying her. A little later, Chad Michael Scully was born. Although 
premature, he is doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the birth, Kathy Scully attended her husband's funeral 
services in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 For Vin Scully, it was the second tragedy in less than a year. He lost his 
friend and colleague, Don Drysdale, July 3. 
</P>

<P>
 Kerrigan on ice: Two days after being declared fit to skate, Nancy Kerrigan 
will perform in an exhibition at Northeastern University in Boston tonight, and 
CBS will show it at 9 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS commentator Scott Hamilton will be among those taking part. 
</P>
<P>
 Included will be an interview Greg Gumbel taped with Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan tells Gumbel she is fine but has some scar tissue and a lump on her 
knee. She says she is "pretty close" to being back to where she was before the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked her reaction to the unfolding story from Portland about Tonya Harding 
and associates, she says: "I always like mysteries, so it's kind of like 
reading a book -- you can't wait to get to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big-time sport: Suddenly, figure skating is hot. With the Kerrigan exhibition 
being added to the CBS schedule, all three major networks will be featuring the 
sport Saturday, with ABC offering two programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 p.m., ABC will show "IBM Skates of Gold," an event taped last October at 
Boston Garden. It stars past Olympic gold medalists, and even Peggy Fleming 
takes to the ice for this one. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "Wide World of Sports" at 4:30 p.m. will include special performances by 
the winners of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit, including 
Harding. The exhibitions were taped on Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1 p.m., NBC will show highlights of the European Championships held Jan. 
18-23 at Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coming back: Attention, Keith Olbermann fans. After a stint at ESPN2, he is 
returning to ESPN on April 3 and will be reunited with Dan Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
 An ESPN spokesman said the Olbermann move was mutually agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Also starting on April 3, most of ESPN's "SportsCenter" shows will be expanded 
from a half-hour to one hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Stuart will replace Olbermann on ESPN2's "SportsNight." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Different perspective: Britain's Oxford Television produced a six-hour look at 
American sports for airing in Britain last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The series, titled "Power Plays," will be shown on KCET, Channel 28, Monday 
through Wednesday, 9 to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although somewhat outdated, the six one-hour segments are well done. They are 
more in-depth than most such programs on American television, but the down side 
is they may be too drawn out. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan is featured in the first segment Monday night, and Wayne 
Gretzky and Bruce McNall in the final one Wednesday night. But maybe the best 
two segments are on Tuesday night -- a piece on the sports-agent business and 
the Norby Walters case, followed by a look at Marge Schott. 
</P>
<P>
 TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 If Tonya Harding ends up not competing at Lillehammer, would CBS consider 
using her as a commentator? "No," CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius said. "Our 
announcing team is set." . . . TNT spokesman Greg Hughes said his network also 
had no plans to use Harding on its Winter Olympic announcing team. . . . Latest 
rumor on Howie Long is that he will join TNT on its NFL stadium show, taking a 
spot formerly held by another former Raider, Ken Stabler. TNT used various 
guest analysts last season after Stabler decided to devote full time to his 
restaurant business in Alabama. TNT had no comment on the Long rumor. . . . 
Long has been a regular on HBO's "Inside the NFL," doing a diary segment for 
the seventh time this season on Thursday's show. 
</P>
<P>
 If you still can't believe Julio Cesar Chavez lost to Frankie Randall, 
Showtime will televise last Saturday's MGM Grand Hotel card tonight at 9:50 and 
again Saturday at 2:20 p.m. The original five-hour telecast has been edited 
into 2 1/2 hours. The Razor Ruddock-Anthony Brown undercard 10-rounder gets 
only 15 seconds. "And that's 15 seconds too many," said Jay Larkin, Showtime's 
executive producer of sports. . . . USA boxing next Tuesday, delayed at 9 p.m., 
features Lionel Butler against Jerry Jones from the Country Club in Reseda. 
Gabriel Ruelas will fight Raul Hernandez in the co-main event. 
</P>
<P>
 If anybody cares, ESPN will televise the Pro Bowl from Honolulu Sunday at 5 
p.m., with Chris Berman joining Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann in the booth. . 
. . Maybe more exciting than the game will be the taped coverage of some of the 
players competing in the Miller Lite Pro Bowl Beach Challenge on ESPN at 2 p.m. 
Saturday. Events include an obstacle course, a canoe race, volleyball, a relay 
and a tug-of-war. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has Pebble Beach golf this weekend, but NBC will televise the Nissan L.A. 
Open from Riviera the following weekend. . . . Last weekend's Redondo Beach 
Super Bowl Sunday 10K, taped by Marty Liquori's production company, will be 
televised on ESPN Sunday at 9:30 a.m. . . . The Nashville Network will cover 
the finals of the Chief Auto Parts Winternational drag races at Pomona Sunday 
at 5 p.m. Joe Benson will file reports for KLOS-FM Saturday. . . . How the 
mighty have fallen: Joe Garagiola will be host of the USA network's Westminster 
Kennel Dog Show coverage Feb. 14-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Up-and-comers nominated for Southern California Sports Broadcasters Assn. 
awards include: football play-by-play -- Chris Roberts; radio analyst -- Bob 
Chandler and David Norrie; television analyst -- Paul Sunderland, and radio 
talk show host -- Brian Golden. Lee Hamilton and Ross Porter are the other 
radio talk-show host nominees. Two-time winners Vin Scully and Chick Hearn are 
among the veterans nominated in nine categories. Winners will be announced at a 
luncheon Wednesday at Lakeside Golf Club in Toluca Lake.

 Saying talk of the Rams' possible move from Anaheim affected his decision, 
Ernie Zampese became offensive coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Zampese, 57, the Rams' offensive coordinator for seven years, agreed to a 
three-year contract to replace Norv Turner, who was named coach of the 
Washington Redskins this week. Turner was an assistant under Zampese with the 
Rams before leaving for Dallas in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think first of all, it's the possibility of going to a Super Bowl," Zampese 
said of his reason for leaving the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy owner Jerry Jones said Zampese was the coach he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a natural," Jones said. "We think he'll fit right in; he obviously knows 
the offense well." Baseball

 Infielder Jody Reed agreed to a minor league contract with the Milwaukee 
Brewers and will go to spring training as a nonroster player. Reed, 31, hit 
.276 last season with the Dodgers and led the National League in second-base 
fielding. He became a free agent after reportedly turning down an $8-million, 
three-year contract offer from the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 John Olerud, who led the American League in hitting last year, jumped into the 
top 15 in salary, and Norm Charlton, and Henry Cotto joined new teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Olerud agreed to a $17 million, three-year contract with the Toronto Blue 
Jays. The deal has an option for 1997 that, if exercised, would give the first 
baseman $22.5 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton signed with the Philadelphia Phillies and Cotto with the Baltimore 
Orioles, who also signed Rene Gonzales and Mark Williamson. The San Francisco 
Giants and pitcher John Burkett agreed to a one-year contract. Winter Sports

when a roof collapsed under the weight of snow at the hotel where members of 
the International Olympic Committee will stay during the Games.

DRAG RACING / WINTERNATIONALS AT POMONA; TRACK, EVENT RECORDS FALL DURING 
PRELIMINARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a cool and cloudy day made for speed, National Hot Rod Assn. drivers 
responded with track or event records in all professional classes during 
first-round qualifying of the 34th annual Chief Winternationals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz Pedregon, 1992 funny-car champion dethroned last year by John Force, 
blistered the Pomona Raceway strip with a run of 5.010 seconds elapsed time -- 
third fastest in drag racing history. Pedregon's speed in his Larry Minor-owned 
Olds Cutlass was 296.73 m.p.h., a career best. 
</P>
<P>
 After Force lost the championship to Pedregon in '92, he embarked on what he 
called his "comeback tour," winning a record 11 national events to reclaim the 
title he won in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any special name for wanting to get the championship back, like 
John did, but I think we're just as dedicated as he was," Pedregon said. "We 
did a lot of testing at Firebird (near Phoenix) and Bakersfield, and it paid 
off today. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got the car, it had a mind of its own, but we wanted a car that we 
could control so we could adapt it to changing track conditions," the Moorpark 
driver said. "In testing, we sort of took a bad animal and tamed it. I think 
we're ready for the season now." 
</P>
<P>
 The only faster funny-car clockings were 4.987 by Chuck Etchells last Oct. 1 
at Topeka, Kan., and 4.996 by Force two weeks later at Ennis, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedregon bettered the track-record 5.072 run made by Etchells during the 
Winston Finals last Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Force, who won the Winternationals last year, shut off early in his run and 
rolled through the finish line in 12.246 seconds at 70.46 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 35 funny cars are entered, only 18 attempted to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Nix, a 56-year-old veteran from Oklahoma City, led top-fuel qualifying 
with a Winternationals-record run of 4.781 seconds. It bettered the 4.784 by 
Cory McClenathan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 When 13 top-fuel drivers bettered five seconds, sponsoring Chief Auto Parts 
and the NHRA contributed $5,300 to the American Red Cross relief fund for 
earthquake victims. Chief donated $4,000, and the NHRA announced it would 
donate $100 for every run of 4.99 seconds or quicker and $300 for every run of 
300 m.p.h. There were no 300 runs Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending pro-stock champion Warren Johnson ran a track-record 7.060 seconds 
in his 1994 Cutlass, and former two-time champion Darrell Alderman celebrated 
his return to racing after a two-year absence with a track-record 195.77-m.p.h. 
run in his '91 Dodge Daytona. His time of 7.069 was second to Johnson's.

JODY REED AGREES TO JOIN BREWERS IN SPRING AS NONROSTER PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Infielder Jody Reed agreed Thursday to a minor league contract with the 
Milwaukee Brewers and will go to spring training as a nonroster player. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, 31, hit .276 last season with the Dodgers and led the National League in 
second-base fielding, committing five errors in 698 chances. He became a free 
agent after it was said he turned down an $8-million, three-year contract offer 
from the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was drafted by Boston in 1984, hitting .260 in 715 games with the Red Sox 
over six years. The Colorado Rockies picked him in the 1992 expansion draft, 
then traded him to the Dodgers.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE ROUNDUP; KIDD TAKES OVER IN ANOTHER 
CAL VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Kidd scored 27 points, including 10 of his team's last 13, to lead No. 
19 California to a 67-61 victory over Oregon State Thursday night at Corvallis, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 California, 13-4 overall and 6-2 in the Pacific 10, also got 15 points and 11 
rebounds from Lamond Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Anderson scored 20 points for Oregon State (5-12, 1-7), and Jerohn 
Brown had a career-high 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 California shot only 32% in the first half, but still led 28-26 at the break. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the Pac-10's leading scorer, made only three of 15 shots in the first 
half and finished seven for 26 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State took several one-point leads in the second half, the last coming 
at 42-41 with 11:58 remaining after Brent Barry's three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
 But California went on an 8-0 run and Oregon State didn't get any closer than 
three points afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd finished 11 of 15 from the field, with seven assists and two steals, 
which made him California's career steal leader with 167, passing Butch Hays' 
record set in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford 69, Oregon 67 -- Freshman point guard Brevin Knight hit a driving 
layup with one second remaining as Stanford (12-5, 5-3) survived a late rally 
for a victory over Oregon (6-11, 2-6) in Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon tied the score with 22 seconds left when Orlando Williams hit a 
three-point shot, but Knight brought the ball back up the court and, with only 
five seconds left, drove the left baseline and put up the shot between three 
Oregon centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Johnson's half-court shot at the buzzer fell short, allowing the 
Cardinal to escape with the win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal led by at least 10 points for most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State 59, Washington 53 -- Stevin Smith scored the game's final five 
points to give Arizona State (11-6, 6-2) a victory over Washington (2-15, 0-8) 
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State has won six of its last seven games, and 10 in a row over 
Washington. Washington tied a school record by losing its ninth consecutive 
game and fell to 2-15, 0-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who scored 16 points, became the fifth-leading scorer in Arizona State 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Sun Devils leading by one point and 17 seconds remaining, Smith hit a 
12-foot pull-up jumper and then stole a pass at the other end of the court as 
Washington tried to set up a three-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith turned the steal into a three-point play after he was fouled taking the 
ball in for a layin.

THE NBA; IT'S HARD TIMES IN LOS ANGELES AS AS LAKERS, CLIPPERS STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUN POWELL, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like most Hollywood marriages, it may not last, but it does look rock solid at 
the moment. The Lakers and Clippers are a couple. Not for better, but for 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 They share misery and they share the bottom of the Pacific Division. They play 
in places where there is no playoff race. This is new for the Lakers, winners 
of five championships in the 1980s. This is same old same old for the Clippers, 
winners of four playoff games since the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 This is life for professional basketball in L.A., where you can't tell or pry 
these two apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the earthquake tried. It couldn't. A natural disaster that separated 
neighborhoods and freeways only brought the Lakers and Clippers together under 
one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 When it caused minor structural damage to the Sports Arena, the Clippers were 
forced to flee and find temporary shelter. They relocated one game, their Jan. 
21 meeting with the Cavaliers, to the Forum. There, the Clippers dressed in the 
visitor's locker room, weren't allowed to display their logo and drew only 
9,298 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Lakers are doing boffo box office themselves. They're averaging 
13,092, fifth-lowest in the league and a 2,000-a-game drop from last season. 
And the celebrity count -- always a meaningful statistic in the Showtime years 
-- has been reduced to a faithful Jack Nicholson. The Forum gets fewer stars in 
a month than Planet Hollywood sees on a good night. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of the Lakers, inevitable as it was, has been hard. They played the 
Bulls for the championship in 1991. Three seasons and a deadly virus later, 
they jostle for lottery position. They played to make history then, as they do 
now, except for completely different reasons. These Lakers are on track to 
become the worst team since the franchise moved to Los Angeles in 1960. They've 
never been this bad after 41 games, as they took a 14-27 mark into Houston 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Lakers' strongest backers doesn't understand. He realizes that the 
team is giving youth a chance, that while Nick Van Exel, Anthony Peeler and 
Doug Christie may pay off in the future, they're paying dues at the moment. And 
he knows the rest of the squad has nothing else except diminishing talent 
(James Worthy, Sedale Threatt) or diminishing potential (Vlade Divac, Elden 
Campbell). 
</P>
<P>
 "But I still think it shouldn't be like this," said Magic Johnson, who cringed 
his way through a conversation about his former team earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat courtside at the Inglewood YMCA, just blocks away from the Forum, 
before his practice with the Magic All-Stars, the troupe of ex-basketball 
players fresh off a world tour and weeks away from exhibitions against 
Continental Basketball Association teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we were going to lose," Johnson said, his "we" still meaning the 
Lakers, "but with all that youth, it should be entertaining, at least. We don't 
entertain anyone. There's no spirit, no pride. It's bad, man. It's tough to 
watch. I can't stand to go to practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson firmly believes the Jerrys, West the GM and Buss the owner, will keep 
their summer vacations short. West already is anxious to deal. The Lakers 
virtually are assured of a high draft choice, and Purdue's Glenn Robinson sure 
would look dapper in purple and gold. This summer also promises to be a boon 
for signing free agents, like Horace Grant and Danny Manning. And the trade 
route is always a possibility, although West doesn't have much to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Lakers might need a coach, too. Randy Pfund's grip on the job 
appears to be loosening. He doesn't have security past this season and hasn't 
been guaranteed it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 When the obvious question is posed to Johnson, he gives a hearty laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Dr. Buss wanted me to coach the Lakers, I would do it because he's done so 
much for me," he said, "but I'm not saying I want to coach the Lakers. You 
know, I could've been coach if I wanted to, because I had the chance. Other 
things have to be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Something like part-ownership, a requisite for any job Johnson takes in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Clippers, who are a lowly 15-27, changes are bound to happen, too. 
The Manning situation may be, should be, be resolved by the Feb. 24 trade 
deadline. Strong interest continues from Orlando, where the Magic is willing to 
swap Dennis Scott and Todd Lichti to make the salaries work under the cap and a 
few first-rounders to sweeten the pot. It isn't value-for-value, but it doesn't 
appear the Clippers will get that now for Manning, an unrestricted free agent 
July 1. Since Owner Donald Sterling is capable of anything, don't be surprised 
if he keeps Manning a Clipper until the end. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Manning finally leaves, the Clippers will have blown a chance to own 
pro basketball in this town, which now intends to satisfy its basketball jones 
on the UCLA campus, where the nationally ranked Bruins play. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got two teams in L.A. that are bad," Johnson said. "This place isn't 
crazy about that. They were able to take one. Not two." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers will welcome the return of John Williams this week. He spent 
three months at a weight-reduction clinic at Duke University and looks 
noticeably slimmer. "I had to come to grips about the fact I had a problem," 
Williams said. Williams wouldn't disclose his present weight, but the guess is 
that he's less than 300 pounds. He'll be activated from the suspended list for 
Saturday's game against the Kings. Mark Aguirre was waived to make room. ... 
Buck Williams, an unrestricted free-agent-to-be, has just about given up hope 
the Portland Trail Blazers will re-sign him. So the 12-year veteran is 
auditioning for 26 other teams. He snatched 19 rebounds against the New York 
Knicks Sunday, a performance reminiscent of his days in the Meadowlands, and 
two days earlier celebrated his 1,000th game. The Denver Nuggets, looking for a 
veteran to help school their youth, have tried to get Williams in the past; 
they'll probably try again. Who knows, maybe even the New Jersey Nets. ... 
Following their loss to the Clippers last week, the Timberwolves actually 
volunteered the excuse that they were indeed tired after being awakened by 
earthquake aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the Warriors' Latrell Sprewell torched the Clippers for 20 
first-quarter points and finished with 32 in a 110-96 loss. Golden State Coach 
Don Nelson said it would be "an injustice" if Sprewell was left off the 
All-Star team by coaches. "I've never had a player who deserved to be an 
All-Star more than he has," Nelson said. Nelson did some last-minute lobbying 
for Sprewell, but it wasn't needed. Sprewell made the cut anyway. ... In that 
game, Chris Webber had four assists, his average for the year. At this rate, 
he'll average more assists in the last six years than any center since Brad 
Daugherty. "Think of what you'll have with this team someday," Nelson said. 
"His first priority is to pass, and how many great passing centers also have 
the ability to score? When you start with a big man who can pass, there are a 
lot of good things in store for your ballclub. We're going to have a lot of fun 
for years."

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL; WALDNER SETS RECORD IN SAN CLEMENTE 
VICTORY OVER CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a battle between San Clemente's shooting and Capistrano Valley's 
rebounding, Alicia Waldner stepped to the forefront and led the Tritons to a 
48-44 victory Thursday at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldner set a school record, making five three-pointers, as San Clemente 
(16-5, 6-2) clinched a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her shots had been looking great in practice," Coach Mary Mulligan said. "But 
she's been short in the games. Tonight, she just got some open shots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (12-10, 4-4) dominated San Clemente in the paint, scoring most of 
their points there, and outrebounded the Tritons, 43-33. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Lowe had 14 rebounds, Jennifer Garrett had nine and Katie Scott finished 
with eight. Susan Scott had 18 points and seven rebounds for Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to dominate the boards," Mulligan said. "We assume that coming 
into the game. So without the three-pointers, we lose the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldner finished with 15 points, and Michelle Macintyre led San Clemente 
(16-5, 6-2) with 22 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Capistrano Valley was able to limit Macintyre's scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took Michelle out of the game at times," Mulligan said. "But, Alicia 
(Waldner), Heather (Hollis) and Kate (Turnbull) picked up some of the slack." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 46-44, with 42 seconds remaining, Capistrano Valley had a chance to 
tie the score, but Cara Heymon stepped out of bounds after she caught an 
in-bounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Hollis followed for San Clemente with a baseline jumpshot, with eight 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons took a 25-18 lead at halftime, after three-pointers by Waldner and 
Macintyre. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 85, El Toro 33 -- Melody Peterson had 20 points and nine assists and 
Adrienne Botana added 19 for No. 4 Mater Dei (18-3, 8-0), which remained alone 
in first place. El Toro is 4-15, 0-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills 50, Mission Viejo 48 -- Karun Grossman scored 27 points for Dana 
Hills (16-6, 5-3), which moved into sole possession of third place. Treva 
Whitaker and Kortney Okura each scored 12 points for Mission Viejo (7-12, 1-7).

CENTURY LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL; SCORELESS QUARTER LETS CANYON BEAT EL MODENA 
</P>

 Thirty-four. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how many points El Modena had when it entered the fourth quarter with a 
four-point lead over Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how many points the Vanguards had when the game ended. It was no way to 
watch your title hopes go down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just shocked," said Jamie Shine, who watched from the floor as one 
mistake snowballed into another and Canyon took advantage of nearly every 
second-half opportunity to score a 50-34 victory over El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon's victory set the stage for a Century League showdown next Thursday 
against first-place Villa Park in the last game of the season. Provided neither 
team is upset, Canyon (13-8, 6-2) can get a share of the title with a victory 
over the Spartans after finishing second the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the biggest win of the year for us," first-year Canyon Coach Nelson 
Herrera said. "I can't think of any game with this much significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't worried about what El Modena was doing. I just wanted us to keep our 
composure." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. El Modena didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon got 19 points apiece from Robynn Kuhlmann and Dawn Brown. The Comanches 
trailed by six with 3 minutes 26 seconds left in the third quarter, then went 
for broke. In a game that had been dominated by inside play, Canyon found its 
shooting touch from the outside. Kuhlmann's 19-footer at the buzzer made it 
34-30 entering the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches finished with a 23-0 run, making nine of their final 17 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena, which shot 55% through three quarters (16 of 29), went 0 for 7 in 
the fourth. They went 0 for 5 from the free-throw line (two for 13 overall). 
They committed nine turnovers; Canyon committed only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon's defense was too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown scored eight of 12 points as Canyon stretched its lead from 36-34 to 
48-34. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a spell there," Herrera said, "everything was going right for us. But we 
won on defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Shine and Jamie Meadows each had 11 points for third-place El Modena (9-10, 
5-3), which beat Villa Park last week and has little chance of winning the 
league title. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Century League game: 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 78, Orange 18 -- Senior Maureen Skehan recorded her second 
quadruple double of the year with 33 points, 16 rebounds, 10 assists and 12 
steals for Villa Park (19-3, 7-1), which remains in sole possession of first 
place in league.

SAN JOSE STATE HANDLES IRVINE, 72-67

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a pregame shoving match at center court, UC Irvine didn't put up enough 
of a fight Thursday night, and lost its fifth Big West game in a row, 72-67, 
before a crowd of 2,491 at the Event Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Cannon, who scored 26 points in the Spartans' victory Jan. 12 at Irvine, 
led San Jose (10-8, 5-4) again.Cannon scored 21 points, driving to the basket 
almost at will and getting five big rebounds, three that he turned into 
baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (5-12, 2-7) had 12 first-half turnovers and shot 37% from the field. 
San Jose shot 42%. Irvine closed to within three points twice in the final 
minute, but Cannon and guard Les Shepherd combined to make seven of eight free 
throws in the last 34 seconds to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not be mistaken about it, we were outplayed by this team, again," 
Irvine Coach Rod Baker said. JOHN WEYLER

FULLERTON REACHES NEW DEPTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton center Winston Peterson got the ball near the top of the 
key . . . and lobbed the ball inside to nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan forward David Frigout drove baseline . . . and right off his foot and 
out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting to get the picture? 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of game for the Titans Thursday night in a 97-66 loss to 
Pacific in a Big West Conference game at the Spanos Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (4-14, 2-8) suffered their worst loss of the season, surpassing 
last Saturday's 91-69 defeat at Long Beach State. The 97 points by Pacific 
(13-8, 7-3) was the most scored against the Titans this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is that we not carry this on into our next game 
(Saturday at San Jose State)," Fullerton Coach Brad Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only bright spot for the Titans was forward Darren Little, who began on 
the bench because he missed two practices this week. Little responded with a 
season-high 23 points and didn't challenge Holland's decision. MIKE REILLEY

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MASSACHUSETTS CATCHES UP TO FLORIDA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Massachusetts Minutemen lived up to their nickname again. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing catch-up with Florida State for most of the game, No. 11 
Massachusetts erased a 10-point deficit in the closing minutes to defeat the 
Seminoles, 62-58, Thursday night at Amherst, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great win. I still don't know how we won it, but I'm pleased," 
Massachusetts Coach John Calipari said. "If we want to continue to win, we've 
got to come out of the gate better. We can't be a top team by coming from 
behind in the second half all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts (17-3) did it by limiting Florida State (9-8) to one basket and 
only three points in the last nine minutes, erasing a 55-47 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 A key for the Minutemen was a disqualifying fifth foul against Florida State 
center Andre Reid with eight minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Roe's jumper with 4:53 left gave Massachusetts its first lead of the 
second half at 57-56. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Sura, who had 18 points for Florida State (9-8), responded with a layup 
and Marcus Camby hit a free throw to tie the score, 58-58, with three minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Roe blocked Sura's shot, Camby grabbed the deflection and Dana Dingle made a 
layup with 2:07 left to put Massachusetts ahead to stay at 60-58. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Louisville 76, North Carolina Charlotte 55 -- Tick Rogers ignited a 13-4 
spurt at the close of the first half with two baskets off steals as the 
Cardinals won their seventh consecutive game at Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte, 9-6 overall and 2-3 in the Metro Conference, played its fourth 
consecutive road game and seventh in its last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville (17-2, 7-1) was led by Clifford Rozier's 23 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Temple 65, Rhode Island 51 -- Eddie Jones scored 23 points and had six 
steals as Temple used a full-court press to break open a tight Atlantic 10 game 
at Philadelphia for its ninth victory in a row. Rhode Island (7-10, 3-6) led, 
33-31, with 13:28 to play before Temple (15-2, 8-1) went on a 16-3 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada 77, No. 23 New Mexico State 68 -- Jimmy Moore scored 25 points, 
including 19 in the second half, as Nevada pulled away in a Big West game at 
Reno. The win was Nevada's first over a ranked team since it opened the 1984 
regular season with a victory over 11th-ranked Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Hogan made six of his nine attempts from three-point distance for the 
Wolf Pack (8-10, 4-5). 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State (16-2, 8-1) had the longest winning streak in the nation 
ended at 13, and was led by Paul Jarrett's 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 Cincinnati 69, Memphis State 64 -- Cincinnati failed to get the blowout 
it predicted but managed to save face as Dontonio Wingfield rallied the 
Bearcats in a Great Midwest game at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 LaZelle Durden scored 15 points and made three free throws in the final 40 
seconds to save himself and Cincinnati (15-5, 3-2) from embarrassment at the 
hands of Memphis State (6-11, 1-6). Durden told reporters he was "kind of 
expecting a blowout" to make up for Cincinnati's loss at Memphis State on Jan. 
23.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC, UNBEATEN IN PACIFIC 10, PLAYS HOST TO UCLA TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ranked fifth in the nation and unbeaten in Pacific 10 play, USC's women's 
basketball team will try to put more space between itself and the rest of the 
conference when it plays host to UCLA tonight at 7:30 at Lyon Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Trojans, 15-1 overall and 8-0 in the Pac-10, and Bruins (10-7, 5-3) 
beat defending champion Stanford last weekend.UCLA is in third place, trailing 
Washington and Oregon, both 5-2 in the conference.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are improving rapidly. Coach Kathy Olivier's team ended a 10-game 
losing streak to Stanford with its 80-73 upset of the Cardinal last Friday at 
Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA senior Natalie Williams is averaging 25.2 points and 12.9 rebounds in her 
last nine games and is shooting 58% from the floor. Williams, 6 feet 1, has 
scored at least 24 points in six of those nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, she will be matched against 6-5 senior Lisa Leslie. Last Sunday, on 
her way to setting a Pac-10 career scoring record of 2,104 points in the 
Trojans' 81-73 victory over Stanford, Leslie scored 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie has blocked 52 shots in 16 games, largely explaining why the Trojans 
are ranked fifth in field-goal defense at 35.4%.

CENTURY LEAGUE GIRLS' SOCCER; NO. 5 EL MODENA STILL ON TRACK TO WIN ITS FIRST 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked El Modena inched closer to its first Century League girls' soccer 
title by defeating Canyon, 2-1, on a last-minute goal Thursday at El Modena 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 One victory or two ties in the two remaining league games will clinch the 
league championship outright for the Vanguards (16-5, 7-1). 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared El Modena would have to settle for its first tie of the season, 
but Kaylee Whitfield split two defenders and scored her team-high 14th goal 
with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in three weeks that Canyon (12-5-2, 5-2-1) has been 
victimized by a late Vanguard goal. On Jan. 13, Aja Cordova broke a 1-1 tie 
with a goal with less than 10 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have to get out of here with a win today to stay in first place," 
El Modena Coach Tino Ray Younger said. "We were going to sit and play for the 
tie." 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 1-0 lead on Kristi Hales' goal two minutes into the game, El 
Modena's defense dominated the remainder of the half behind the strong play of 
Erin Warren and Jennifer Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Comanches got even 15 minutes into the second half when El Modena 
defender Jill Templin collided with goalkeeper Amy Moreno in front of the net. 
Canyon freshman Kerry Anderson was there to control the loose ball and kick it 
into the empty net. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon, which has won the last two league titles, pressured several more times 
in the closing minutes before Whitfield got loose for the winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be in control of our own destiny for once," Younger said. 
"Usually about this time of year we are sitting around trying to figure out 
ways we can get into first place." DAN ARRITT

TITAN WOES CONTINUE IN BIG LOSS TO PACIFIC; BASKETBALL: FULLERTON FALLS, 97-66, 
ITS WORST LOSS IN THREE YEARS. DARREN LITTLE IS THE ONLY BRIGHT SPOT. 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton center Winston Peterson got the ball near the top of the 
key . . . and lobbed the ball inside to nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan forward David Frigout drove baseline . . . and right off his foot and 
out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting to get the picture? 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of game for the Titans Thursday night. They were outshot, 
outrebounded and flat out outplayed in a 97-66 loss to Pacific in a Big West 
Conference game at the Spanos Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (4-14, 2-8) suffered their worst loss since Jan. 1991, a 98-67 
defeat at Nevada Las Vegas. The 97 points by Pacific (13-8, 7-3) was the most 
scored against the Titans this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night's loss follows the Titans' second-worst performance of the 
season, a 91-69 defeat at Long Beach State Saturday. And Titan Coach Brad 
Holland hopes his team isn't making a habit of getting blown out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is that we not carry this on into our next game 
(Saturday at San Jose State)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only bright spot for the Titans was forward Darren Little, whom Holland 
benched for missing practices this week. Little responded with a season-high 23 
points and didn't challenge Holland's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a paper to write for a class and I missed (practice)," Little said. 
"Coach made the right choice. He sat me down." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Titan starters might as well have joined Little on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton committed three turnovers and missed three of their first four shots 
while falling behind, 12-2, in the first 5 minutes 13 seconds. The Titans 
trailed by 27 at halftime and as many as 38 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific, which shot only 16% in the first half of a 76-69 overtime victory 
over Fullerton two weeks ago, hit 21 of 31 shots (66.7%) in the first half 
Thursday, including four of six three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pacific proved that it can shoot the ball well at home," Holland said. "Our 
defense wasn't bad at times, but Pacific shot extraordinarily well." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger forward Charles Jones did most of the damage from the outside, hitting 
three three-pointers in the first half and finishing with 15 points, nine more 
than his season average. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Jones wasn't blistering the Titans from the outside, Tiger center 
Glenn Griffin was pounding them inside. Fullerton's Little couldn't cover 
Griffin, nor could Frigout, nor could Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin hit five of his first six shots and scored 10 of his 14 points in the 
first half. The Tigers cruised to a 49-22 advantage, their largest halftime 
lead of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin pulled down seven rebounds, as did Tiger forward Michael Jackson, who 
led them with 17 points. The Tigers outrebounded the Titans, 51-31, and outshot 
them, 53.3% to 42.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the players (afterward) that we have to let a game like this go," 
Holland said. "We have to put it behind us. We have to regroup and get back to 
the basics." 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, they need to do a better job of getting the ball to Peterson. The 
Tigers held Peterson, Fullerton's leading scorer with a 15.8 average, to one 
point in the first half.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: SCC RESUSCITATES SEASON WITH 
CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to happen to a Southern California College men's basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 In 12 previous seasons under Coach Bill Reynolds, SCC had won an average of 22 
games and lost nine. Since the inception of the Golden State Athletic 
Conference in 1986, the Vanguards have never finished worse than second. 
</P>
<P>
 But by last week, they were 0-4 in the conference and not showing many signs 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't thinking of second place; we were thinking about a league 
victory," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 That victory came in a fairly unexpected place. SCC beat Concordia, 81-70, in 
front of a Concordia homecoming crowd of 1,100. It's true that entering the 
game, SCC had a 13-1 advantage in the series between the teams, but Concordia 
has its strongest team and was picked to finish second in the conference in the 
preseason coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say we were struggling is the understatement of the year," Reynolds said. 
"But I was extremely proud of the way we played Saturday night. We were 
surprised that we were able to hold Concordia at Concordia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great, great win. I guess our seniors are getting tired of being 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior point guard Danin Bryant led the way with 32 points -- "Which is 
amazing for a non-shooting point guard," Reynolds said. Senior wing Eric 
Carmichael, who is hobbled by an ankle injury he sustained in December, had 11 
points and five assists. The Vanguards' third senior, Court Bickmore, scored 
eight but helped the team with his aggressive, hustling play. Todd Anderson, a 
6-6 junior transfer from Cerritos College, had 20 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC has been hurt by a rash of injuries and medical problems. Eric Price, a 
6-5 senior community college transfer, injured his knee and is out for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Campbell and John Naro, expected to be the team's main outside shooting 
threats, have been told by doctors that they can't play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who averaged 15.3 points last season, has a history of heart 
problems and although he initially received clearance to play, doctors revoked 
clearance in late November. A few days later, Naro, who averaged 10.9 points 
last season, complained of lightheadedness and feeling his heart skip before a 
game in St. Louis. Doctors still haven't determined the nature of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rotation reduced to seven players, SCC was worn out after the first 
15 minutes of most games, but Reynolds said they seem to have found the energy 
to pick up the pace on defense and that has led to more transition baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, SCC won its second consecutive conference game, beating Point Loma 
Nazarene, 80-74, to improve to 11-11, 2-4. Freshman forward Dan Hyde scored 17 
points, making all four of his three-point shots. Hyde, from Redondo Union 
High, had made 11 of 19 three-pointers in conference play, encouraging news for 
Reynolds because the Vanguards need an outside threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "But just as I say how encouraged we are," Reynolds said, "we get to go to 
Azusa Friday, and they will probably bring us back to reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific (20-3, 5-1) is ranked 10th in the NAIA national poll and has won 
24 consecutive home games, including victories over NCAA Division II powers UC 
Riverside, Cal State Bakersfield and San Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars' last home loss? March 3, 1992, when SCC beat them in a NAIA 
District 3 playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday in Santa Barbara, Concordia discovered a soothing remedy for the 
frustration of Saturday's loss to SCC when the Eagles beat Westmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday, the Eagles had never beaten Westmont -- they were 0-13 -- but 
Tim Morris, a 6-9 sophomore from Troy High, made a six-footer at the buzzer to 
give them an 82-81 victory. "It was good from a historical standpoint," said 
Concordia Coach Greg Marshall, who played and coached at Westmont. "But more 
importantly this year puts us back into playoff contention. Well, everybody 
makes the playoffs, but it allows us to compete for a home game." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said senior point guard Darren Lax, who scored only two points before 
fouling out against SCC, "was just possessed out there" Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lax had 13 points, seven rebounds, six assists and 10 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GSAC update: With the victory, Concordia (14-8, 3-3) moved into a three-way 
tie for third with Westmont (12-8, 3-3) and Point Loma Nazarene (11-12, 3-3), 
one game behind Fresno Pacific (14-7, 4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia plays host to Patten in a nonconference game today and to Fresno 
Pacific Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's race, Fresno Pacific (15-5, 5-0) remains in first place. SCC 
(17-5, 3-2) and Concordia (12-8, 3-2) are tied for second with Azusa Pacific 
(15-7, 3-2). SCC travels to Azusa today and Concordia plays host to Fresno 
Saturday.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; CHAPMAN DEFEATS PATTEN, CLINCHES WINNING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman was guaranteed its first winning season in six years by beating Patten 
College, 106-101, in a nonconference men's basketball game Thursday at the 
Hutton Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, who improved to 13-6 with six games left in the season, led by 
as many as 24 points in the second half before Patten closed the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Chapman team with a winning season was the 1988-89 team that went 
17-12 and advanced to the title game of the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. tournament. Since then, Chapman has dropped out of the CCAA, stopped 
offering athletic scholarships and will become an NCAA Division III independent 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Patten (5-18), an NAIA school in Oakland playing its first year of 
intercollegiate basketball, hung close early and led, 21-19, with 12 minutes 
left in the first half. Chapman's Anthony Gonzales then made a three-pointer to 
start a 17-2 run that seemed to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patten, which has played 19 games on the road and plays at Concordia 
tonight, fought back with three of its players scoring at least 26 points: 
Richard Thorpe (35), Karras Moore (28) and Eric Mendoza-Govan(26). Patten 
outscored Chapman, 23-10, in the last five minutes of the game and 8-0 in the 
final minute, but the Lions had too far to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Mumaw had 23 points and 14 rebounds for the Panthers, who play at UC 
San Diego tonight. Seldom-used reserve forward Jason Roczey scored a 
career-high 13 points, including three three-pointers -- all in the first half 
-- and Umahl Anderson and Edgar Diaz each added 11. MARTIN BECK

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Healy recorded the seventh shutout of his career and Mark Messier scored 
a pair of goals Thursday night at Boston, leading the New York Rangers to a 3-0 
victory over the Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Larmer also scored a goal and added two assists for the Rangers, who 
lead the NHL with 70 points.New York has won seven of its last nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended a five-game Boston winning streak; the Bruins were unbeaten in 
their last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Larmer gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead at 17:38 of the first period when he jammed 
Sergei Nemchinov's rebound under goaltender Vincent Riendeau's pads for his 
12th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Sergei Makarov scored with 1:47 to play in 
overtime to lift the Sharks at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>

the right boards and spotted Makarov streaking down the left side. He sent the 
puck across the slot and Makarov scored his 14th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia is winless in its last five (0-4-1) and dropped below .500 for 
the first time this season (24-25-3). The slumping Flyers' last victory came on 
Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 4, St. Louis 3 -- Iain Fraser's breakaway goal broke a third-period tie 
at St. Louis, leading the Nordiques. The Blues lost for the first time since 
acquiring Steve Duchesne Jan. 23.

since joining St. Louis after a season-long contract holdout in Quebec.

ST. JOHN BOSCO THROWS WEIGHT AROUND, 32-22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alemany High Coach Dennis Henderson knew if his wrestling team could get a 
jump on St. John Bosco in the lower weight divisions Thursday night, the 
Indians would be able to stay with the Mission League leaders until the 
heavyweight match. 
</P>
<P>
 Damien Loftus (112 pounds) and James Casteneda (119 pounds) came through with 
early pins and Henderson almost got his wish. It wasn't until Frank Velasco 
outpointed Eddie Moran at 189 pounds, that the Braves, No. 2 in Southern 
Section Division IV, clinched a 32-22 victory at Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a home match for the Indians but was played at Harvard-Westlake because 
of damage from the earthquake at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 Loftus (21-2) and Casteneda (25-0), Alemany's strongest wrestlers, staked the 
Indians (9-5, 2-2 in league matches) to a 12-3 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Loftus was trailing, 7-2, in the third period, but rallied to pin Pedro 
Sanchez (33-7) with 22 seconds left in the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't focused when I started," Loftus said. "My head wasn't in it and I 
fell behind but I was glad I was able to get the pin and six points." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians kept the lead until St. John Bosco's Gil Sanchez (16-8) pinned Sal 
Cisneros at 140 pounds, giving the Braves a 17-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead changed hands until the 160-pound match, when St. John Bosco's Jared 
Boyarski (35-4) needed only 30 seconds to pin Nick DePasquale. Boyarski's 
victory ignited his team and gave the Braves (26-3, 6-0) a 23-22 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew coming in they were stronger at the lower weights," Boyarski said. "I 
just wanted to come in and get a pin. I was confident in our guys they would 
come through." 
</P>
<P>
 Brave Coach Mike DeJesus was ejected during the 171-pound match and was 
penalized two team points, giving Alemany a 22-21 lead. Earlier, the Braves 
were penalized a team point for unsportsmanlike conduct.  
</P>
<P>
 But St. John Bosco rallied after the ejection to win in the last three weight 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know our seniors would be disappointed," Henderson said. "If we had gotten 
a few points in close matches, it might have made a difference."

 Heavyweight Alex Garcia handed Alemany's Ron Vitale only his fourth loss of

 "I think if we were still in contention Ron would have done better," Henderson 
said. "I'm really surprised he didn't beat Garcia."

DIGEST: CLU'S SMITH GETS CLEARANCE TO PLAY AGAINST OCCIDENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Smith of Cal Lutheran has been cleared to play in Saturday's Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference men's basketball game at 
Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 6-foot-5 freshman swingman from Melbourne, Australia, was averaging 
11.1 points and 5.4 rebounds a game before a bone chip on his right knee forced 
him to sit out seven games, all of them SCIAC contests. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, Cal Lutheran reserve Kenny Caesar will be back in uniform 
Saturday after being held out of Wednesday's 87-73 victory over La Verne for 
disciplinary reasons. Caesar is averaging 3.5 points and 1.9 rebounds.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: CHAMINADE'S GYM EARNS A BIG ASSIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chaminade High's basketball team hasn't had many breaks this season, but the 
Eagles got a huge one Monday against visiting Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights had the ball with the score tied and eight seconds remaining when 
Rich Igou spotted Tommy Zapata at the other end of the court, open for an easy 
layup.  
</P>
<P>
 But Igou's baseball pass was high and hit a speaker hanging from the ceiling 
at mid-court, turning the ball over to Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw the ball the only way he could," Notre Dame Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
"He was being triple-teamed. I thought it was a great play. But to Chaminade's 
credit, they still had to score." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles set up a play at mid-court and Mike Yang made a three-foot shot 
with three seconds left, giving Chaminade a 68-66 victory. FOOTHILL LEAGUE

 Overlooked 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus running back Chris Johnson has received no scholarship offers and Coach 
Jack Bowman is mystified. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson rushed for more than 3,000 yards in three seasons, which Bowman 
thought was enough to cash in for a scholarship.  
</P>
<P>
 When classes resumed at Saugus last week, Bowman spent many hours on the phone 
with college coaches, trying to persuade them to take second looks at Johnson 
and All-Valley lineman Matt Speranza. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really mystifies me," said Bowman. "I'm real stunned about both of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson rushed for 1,398 yards and 19 touchdowns last fall. NORTHWEST VALLEY

 Finally, it's a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando quarterback Leon Blunt signed a letter of intent with Notre Dame 
on Wednesday, the first day of the NCAA's winter signing period, and ended 
weeks of speculation in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no easy decision, Blunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt said that on Wednesday morning, he was still reconsidering his oral 
commitment to Notre Dame. USC also was heavily courting the option quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Wednesday, while Blunt was getting ready for school and still trying to 
make up his mind about college, Notre Dame called. The caller was informed that 
Blunt was in the shower.  
</P>
<P>
 "They said they'd hang on until I was done," Blunt said, laughing. "They 
wanted to make sure I was gonna sign that thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He did. Along with several other Southland standouts, Blunt finally signed his 
letter of intent during a ceremony at Bluechip Illustrated magazine 
headquarters in Woodland Hills. Hart defensive back John McLaughlin also signed 
with Notre Dame and attended the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt may have had trouble selecting a school, but he remembers how to talk 
the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and McLaughlin were the only ones in Notre Dame hats," Blunt said. "So 
everybody knew who the best guys were."

 Javy Ramos, an All-City Section basketball guard from San Fernando, missed all 
the hubbub. He didn't miss any games, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a family medical emergency, Ramos was forced to leave for Mexico on 
Jan. 15, two days before the earthquake leveled parts of the San Fernando 
Valley. High school basketball games were canceled for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos returned Monday night, in no apparent hurry to get back to school. Coach 
Dick Crowell called him at home Tuesday morning to see if he could make 
practice later that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos said he couldn't leave the house because the earthquake had damaged the 
door to his family home. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Crowell: "Javy, you were gone for seven or eight days and nobody messed 
with your house." 
</P>
<P>
 The result? 
</P>
<P>
 "He hemmed and hawed, but he finally agreed (to come to practice)," Crowell 
said. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Bob Francola is a little worried about his team. That is, he's wondering if he 
still has one. 
</P>
<P>
 Francola, the football coach at Kennedy, said the widespread earthquake damage 
at the Granada Hills campus has his players talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I see something (on television) about the schools, they show 
Kennedy," Francola said. "That's where the most visible damage is." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Francola had to do some damage control of his own. Some returning 
Kennedy players already have assumed that the school will be bulldozed and that 
they will be attending another school next fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francola has started calling players to assure them that Kennedy, despite the 
structural damage, will field a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, the newest of the 49 high schools in the L.A. Unified School 
District, suffered so much damage that administrators adopted a year-round 
academic calendar. The school is not expected to reopen until March. MID-VALLEY

 Got a Charge Out of It 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham's Tony Silberfeld doesn't mind being a pushover on the court -- 
just as long as he gets the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Silberfeld -- all 6-feet and 128 pounds of him -- has taken 28 charges in 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offensive charges not only turn games around, they can nullify baskets and 
change momentum," Braves' Coach Al Bennett said. "It is a really big play." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said Silberfeld has an eye for spotting opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks for that kind of thing," Bennett said. "His back is all bruised up, 
but it has really kept us in games." PACIFIC LEAGUE

 An 'A' for Honesty 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to respect a coach who comes right out and admits when he's made a 
mistake. So, applaud John Goffredo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crescenta Valley coach has watched Hoover upset his team twice this 
season, both on last-second shots. The second time was last week, and Goffredo 
admitted it was the Tornadoes' delay offense that caused his team problems. The 
Falcons weren't prepared for it, Goffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoover's delay was no secret. The Tornadoes had been running it for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think they'd do it against us, though," Goffredo said. "I wasn't 
prepared." MARMONTE LEAGUE

 Royal Resurgence 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal girls' basketball program, which did not have a winning record in 
any of Coach Paula Getty-Shear's first five seasons, is riding high. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Royal was 5-17. "And that was with two forfeits," Getty-Shear 
said, laughing. "We were really 3-19." 
</P>
<P>
 But the resurgent Highlanders won 12 of their first 15 games this season, 
including a 54-42 victory over Thousand Oaks on Jan. 25. It was the first time 
a Getty-Shear team defeated the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the sudden improvement? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some (good) players finally," Getty-Shear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Tawnee Cooper has been a revelation, averaging 19.6 points, 9.7 
rebounds and four steals a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other sophomore newcomers, Jenny Broadhurst and Merilee Lewis, start for 
the Highlanders, as does Croatian foreign-exchange student Bruna Grubisic.

 The Channel Islands girls' basketball team recently lost a starter for the 
rest of the season. But she isn't injured, nor did she flunk all her classes or 
move out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 She graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider forward Alison Jones finished her required classwork as of the 
just-completed first semester and opted to graduate, ending her high school 
career early. "We're going to miss her, but we'll be all right," Coach Don 
Salado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones may try to play for Oxnard College. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 One of the hottest squads in the state, the Raiders (18-2) have won 17 
consecutive games, including all 10 of their league contests, entering Thursday 
night's game against Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Shawanda Hotchkiss has been their key player, averaging 17 
points, 5.5 rebounds and three steals. "It's been a great season for us," Coach 
Don Salado said. "We've been playing real steady basketball." CHANNEL LEAGUE

 Muscling In 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has virtually locked up the league wrestling championship after 
beating Rio Mesa, 46-13, last week, but Coach Paul Clementi is looking for 
more.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars are ranked No. 2 in the Southern Section Division I coaches' poll 
behind El Modena. If Ventura can finish in the top two, it will earn a home 
match in the preliminary round of the dual meet championships, an event it has 
hosted only once before, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what we're shooting for now," Clementi said. "This has been a basketball 
town but we're helping to turn it on to other sports. It would be a great way 
for our seniors to start their playoffs." Around the Leagues . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * St. Genevieve Coach Dan Donovan missed his team's game last week because he 
was trying to move out of his earthquake-damaged home in Valencia. Problem was, 
Donovan couldn't find any vacant storage space for his belongings while his 
home was being repaired. Building inspectors gave Donovan's house a yellow tag, 
meaning limited access is permitted. He will stay there until he is able to 
store his belongings and move in temporarily with his in-laws in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * St. Francis (17-5, 8-1 in Del Rey League play) has allowed 60 points or more 
only twice this season, and the Golden Knights won both of those games. The 
team is allowing 48.5 points per game, but averaging only 52.6 offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crescenta Valley junior Brock Jacobsen finally has started to meet the 
scoring potential Coach John Goffredo had predicted. Jacobsen, who was injured 
early in the season, scored 53 points in two games last week. Jacobsen is the 
younger brother of Adam Jacobsen, who graduated from Crescenta Valley in 1993 
and holds the Southern Section record for most three-point baskets with 387. 
</P>
<P>
 * Verdugo Hills' Chan Cornish is averaging 17.8 points and 14.2 rebounds a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Because of a scheduling quirk, the Crescenta Valley girls' basketball team 
has played 11 of its last 12 games on the road. And its final four games, 
scheduled to be at home, will be played at Glendale College because the Falcon 
gym was damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Saugus forward Lisa Nielsen is the leading girls' scorer in the Foothill 
League with an average of 13.9 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chaminade sophomore Tami Pivnick is leading the girls' soccer team in 
scoring for the second consecutive season. The midfielder has 20 goals and 
eight assists in 20 matches. The Eagles are battling Mission League opponents 
Alemany, Harvard-Westlake and Louisville for the league's final two playoff 
spots. Bishop Montgomery has clinched the title. 
</P>
<P>
 * Four Harvard-Westlake wrestlers were winners in their own tournament last 
weekend. Paul Michaels (103 pounds), Brandon Roth (112), Josh Eisenberg (171) 
and Germain de Martinis (189) each won their weight divisions, leading the 
Wolverines to the team championship.

 Japanese Leaders Meeting on Economic Package: Leaders of Japan's ruling 
coalition parties were due to meet again today to try to hammer out an 
agreement on how to finance a proposed $49-billion income tax cut. The fragile 
seven-party coalition government headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had 
intended to announce Thursday an economic stimulus package incorporating the 
tax cut. But it was unable to do so because of fierce opposition from the 
Socialist Party to a Hosokawa plan to balance the cuts with a sales tax 
increase three years from now.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Long- and short-term interest rates surged Thursday amid speculation that 
the Federal Reserve Board will nudge short-term interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market backed away from highs as uneasiness about interest rates 
gave investors an excuse to sell and collect profits. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's 30-year bond yield rose to 6.31% from 6.28%, pushing prices, 
which move in the opposite direction, down 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, interest rates on short-term Treasury bills -- which would be most 
directly affected by any change in short-term interest rates -- soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Stirring speculation among bond traders was the Fed's failure to add reserves 
to the banking system as expected, shortly before noon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank routinely adds reserves to help set the federal funds rate, 
the interest charged on overnight loans between banks. The perceived target for 
the rate has been 3% since September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the federal funds rate rose as high as 3.5% on Thursday morning, the 
Fed's failure to intervene was seen by the market as a sign it wants to push 
the rate a quarter of a percentage point above the current target, to 3.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate closed at 3.063% on Thursday, down from 3.25% on Wednesday. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got off to a weak start and remained depressed all morning and into the 
early afternoon. But the profit taking subsided later and the Dow Jones 
industrial average, as well as broader market indicators, finished well above 
their worst levels of the session. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials closed off 7.88 at 3,967.66 on Big Board volume of 318.35 
million shares. It had been down more than 20 points during the day. In the 
broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of solid sales during January by the auto industry helped steer the 
market out of its selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Harrington, senior vice president and technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane, linked the market's afternoon improvement to the car 
makers' reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the news came out on the autos, this was a normal day of profit taking 
amid some uneasiness about interest rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's pullback was not surprising given its prolonged advance. Market 
analysts said investors decided to take profits when interest rates bobbed up 
in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 Weakness in stocks overseas set a negative tone for Wall Street. In Frankfurt, 
a wave of selling triggered by the Bundesbank's decision to leave interest 
rates unchanged pushed the DAX-30 average down 32.29 points to close at 
2,151.72. London's Financial Times 100-share average finished 28.8 points lower 
at 3,491.5. Stocks also closed lower in Paris and Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed at 20,174.82, down 75.21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Woolworth fell 1 1/4 to 24 5/8 after reporting that its January same-store 
sales rose 2.2%. But it said its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings will be well 
below those of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wal-Mart rose 3/8 to 28 1/8 on heavy volume. The stock's investment rating 
was raised to "strong buy" by Kidder Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other retailers were active after posting their January sales reports. Best 
Buy rose 1 5/8 to 50, Gymboree gained 1 1/4 to 39 1/2 and U.S. Shoe fell 1/4 to 
12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among cyclical stocks, Alcoa dropped 1 to 78 1/4 and Deere shed 1 1/8 to 80 
1/2.  
</P>
<P>
 * Weak financial shares included J.P. Morgan, off 1 to 70 7/8, and Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp., down 1 3/8 to 57 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer chip makers were also weak. Cowen & Co. downgraded Intel to "buy" 
from "strong buy," citing uncertainties stemming from recent legal setbacks. 
Intel fell 2 to 63 1/4 and Motorola dropped 1 7/8 to 99 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Big Three posted gains on the strength of the January sales report. 
General Motors climbed 1 1/2 to 63, Ford was up 1 5/8 to 69 3/8, and Chrysler 
rose 1 1/4 to 62 1/2. In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar rose against most major currencies as traders speculated that the 
Fed may boost short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold closed on the New York Merc at $387.30 an ounce, up $2.60. Silver 
continued to rise, gaining 13 cents to $5.465 an ounce.

 MACHINE EXODUS: The recent Southern California earthquake convinced computer 
distributor Ingram Micro Inc. of Santa Ana to move its supercomputer that 
controls its far-flung empire to quieter ground -- like Nashville, Tenn. . . . 
The move will cost $20 million to complete, but Ingram Chief Executive Chip 
Lacy says the "mission-critical" computer system will be safer there and 
cheaper to maintain. . . . Fortunately for the local economy, the people who

Councilman Ralph Bauer: "We know this isn't much, but this is a symbolic thing.

MOSCOW TRIAL HALTED OVER CALM REPORTERS' 'CIRCUS-LIKE' BEHAVIOR

<P>
 The trial of chemist Vil S. Mirzayanov for revealing secrets about Russia's 
chemical weapons program took a turn for the absurd Thursday when the 
prosecutor blamed a group of human rights activists and journalists for 
allegedly obstructing the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was postponed until today, when it will presumably resume under even 
heavier security to prevent the whistle-blower from speaking to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Leonid S. Pankratov charged Thursday that observers and journalists 
waiting quietly behind a line of armed Interior Ministry troops to glimpse the 
jailed chemist were a mob that prevented Mirzayanov from being brought into the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "First learn some manners! Then ask questions!" Pankratov shouted at the 
group, adding that the trial had been postponed "because of your circus-like 
behavior."

 Mirzayanov was charged in 1992 after he co-authored a newspaper article

UKRAINE LAWMAKERS OK INITIAL DISMANTLING OF NUCLEAR ARSENAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parliament gave tacit approval Thursday for this country to begin scrapping 
200 of its more than 1,500 nuclear warheads as part of a deal struck last month 
in Moscow. But lawmakers refused to declare Ukraine a non-nuclear state, as the 
United States, Russia and their own president have demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the resolution on nuclear arms, passed by 260 of the 296 Ukrainian 
lawmakers Thursday, was so vaguely crafted and hinged on such legal 
technicalities that many deputies could not say what its effect will be. "I 
have no idea what we voted for," complained legislator Ihor Dercacz. 
</P>
<P>
 A top government official said President Leonid Kravchuk will interpret the 
measure as a green light to begin transferring the first 200 weapons to Russia 
in return for fuel for Ukrainian nuclear power plants. "We are going ahead" 
with disarmament, the official said. "I can't see anything that can get in the 
way now." 
</P>
<P>
 During President Clinton's visit to Moscow in January, Clinton, Kravchuk and 
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin signed an agreement committing Ukraine to 
giving up its nuclear weapons in seven years in exchange for American economic 
aid, security guarantees and nuclear fuel. But the conservative Parliament has, 
so far, proven ambivalent about whether giving up the world's third-largest 
nuclear arsenal will leave Ukraine defenseless against possible Russian 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, Parliament approved the START I disarmament treaty in principle 
but said it applied to fewer than half of the 176 nuclear-tipped strategic 
missiles on Ukrainian soil. Lawmakers then added tough conditions that made 
their approval meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk and his government told Parliament on Thursday that the deal struck 
in Moscow satisfies most of those conditions -- and that Ukraine will become a 
pariah nation if it refuses to sign. "To be left by oneself in the 
international community, even if you think you are right, is a losing game," 
Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first sign that Parliament agrees, the preamble of the measure passed 
Thursday says the three nations "will adhere" to the deal, which "makes it 
possible to satisfy the conditions" that Parliament set when it ratified START 
I. The preamble, however, is not legally binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament also refused to approve the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
a move that could irritate the West. Lawmakers fear that if they renounce all 
nuclear weapons, they will then forfeit the right to demand compensation for 
warheads they hand over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine should approve the non-proliferation treaty only if the United States 
and Russia explicitly recognize its rights," said Yuri I. Kostenko, a key 
lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk hopes to get a less ambiguous mandate to disarm from the new 
Parliament to be elected in March. Meanwhile, he wants to keep the volatile 
nuclear issue from dominating the spring election campaign. Already, Communists 
accuse him of selling out to the United States, while nationalists charge him 
with appeasing Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament may be coming around, but Kravchuk's allies say he will still have 
to "run between the raindrops" to make the disarmament deal stick.

HARASSMENT OF WOMEN FOUND RAMPANT AT MILITARY ACADEMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sexual harassment of women is rampant at the nation's military academies and 
up to 97% of female students felt some harassment in 1991, congressional 
investigators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread harassment of women and a prevailing attitude among male recruits 
that women do not belong were detailed in a General Accounting Office report 
presented to the Senate Armed Services personnel subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although relatively few cases of sexual harassment were formally reported, 
responses to our survey indicated that nearly all academy women reported 
experiencing at least one form of sexual harassment during the academic year 
1991," GAO military analyst Mark Gebicke told the panel. The GAO is the 
investigating arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) criticized the GAO for drawing so inclusive a 
definition of harassment that the statistics were skewed and that a manageable 
problem appeared to be out of control. Coats said that under the GAO 
definition, a cadet saying, "You'd better shape up," during exercises could be 
accused of harassment by a cadet of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The study covered the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., the 
Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., and the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of the class of 1993 at all three academies found that 80% of the 
female cadets either observed or experienced sexist comments in the past year. 
A 1992 Air Force Academy survey found that 78% of all female students and 52% 
of the men said they daily heard sexist or demeaning remarks about women. Women 
make up between 11% and 14% of the student body at the academies. 
</P>
<P>
 Female cadets wrote of being ostracized for reporting blatant incidents of 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of harassment uncovered by the GAO included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prank phone calls, offhand comments and derogatory name-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 * An upperclassman entering a female student's room and fondling her. 
</P>
<P>
 * A male student videotaping a female student taking a shower. 
</P>
<P>
 * A senior man ordering a woman in a group of underclass trainees to stay 
behind after dismissing others and then attempting to kiss her.

DEFENSE RESTS AFTER BECKWITH DOESN'T TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Byron De La Beckwith, the segregationist who spoke in his own defense during 
two 1964 trials on charges that he killed Medgar Evers, declined to testify 
Thursday at his third trial. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the defense rested, its hopes for acquittal resting largely on the 
testimony of the one live witness, a former police officer who was able to 
place Beckwith 90 miles from the scene where the civil rights leader was 
assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of maneuvering by defense lawyers, the 73-year-old suspect stood 
before Judge L. Breland Hilburn and said he would not take the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 After one final prosecution witness testified, Hilburn sent jurors back to 
their hotel and said they would begin deliberations today. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith's first two trials ended in hung juries. The case was reopened when 
prosecutors found new witnesses who said they heard Beckwith admit to killing 
Evers in the years after his first trials.

MASS. MAYOR VETOES HATE-CRIME LAW THAT WOULD CUT SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor J. Michael McGorty has vetoed a hate-crime ordinance that would have 
denied garbage pickup and other city services to violators. 
</P>
<P>
 McGorty called the ordinance, which had been unanimously approved by the City 
Council last week, constitutionally vague and predicted legal challenges if the 
city tried to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators also could have been denied library cards and fishing licenses and 
fined $300. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was prompted by swastikas and racist graffiti recently 
spray-painted on a hardware store in the city, about 25 miles west of Boston.

COMMUNITY HELP SOUGHT FOR LIBRARIES; FINANCES: COUNTY OFFICIALS URGE RESIDENTS 
TO FIND WAYS FOR THE SYSTEM TO SURVIVE ANTICIPATED ROUND OF STATE BUDGET CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to tap the community spirit that has emerged after last month's 
earthquake, Ventura County leaders Thursday called on residents to help their 
local libraries survive this year's anticipated wave of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors told library officials and library boosters that they would 
not be able to bail out the county's libraries again this year if the 15-branch 
system is shortchanged by the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Two county branches, in Simi Valley and Fillmore, suffered about $500,000 in 
damage from the Northridge quake. Library officials hope that the needed 
repairs will be covered by insurance and federal disaster relief funds so the 
branches can reopen soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, the city-owned library was also devastated by the Jan. 17 
quake, and city officials there believe that insurance and federal funds will 
pay for most of the needed $2 million in repairs. But they anticipate a 
shortfall of as much as $250,000 and have formed the Library Restoration 
Committee that will meet Wednesday to consider funding options. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting in the Camarillo Library on Thursday, county officials said they 
hope that the volunteerism sparked by the earthquake will encourage more county 
residents to support their libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that because of the earthquake . . . it will even more sharply focus 
the need for the public to rally in support," County Supervisor Maggie Kildee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of library staff and boosters agreed to form a countywide steering 
committee that would organize innovative ways to inspire more community 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the suggestions raised at Thursday's meeting included creating an 
adopt-a-library program for businesses and individuals to sponsor libraries, 
advertising the benefits of libraries to encourage more contributions, 
combining school and public libraries when necessary, and rewarding children 
who introduce adults to libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest challenge we have is turning what we said here into 
action," Kildee told the 40-member audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the meeting were passionate about getting control or 
"ownership" of their libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been taking the libraries for granted and now that the funding 
base has eroded, they panic," said Ross Hildebrandt, member of the San 
Buenaventura Friends of the Library. "The way to solve that is to take it over 
ourselves. Public libraries have to be owned by the public." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who face another tough round of budget-cutting, welcomed the 
idea of greater community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 They presented a pessimistic forecast of the share of state dollars that the 
Legislature will direct to libraries. Last year, the Legislature cut $3.3 
million from the county library budget, forcing a dramatic reduction in hours 
of service at most branches. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented action, the Board of Supervisors helped the library system 
by diverting $1.6 million from the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I suggest to you is solving of libraries' problems cannot be through the 
county," said Richard Wittenberg, county chief administrative officer. 
"Frankly, I think it has to be done locally. We can't wait for the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicki Howard said the goal should be to focus on "do-able ideas" to 
help supplement library budgets. "I'm looking at what's happened to us this 
year -- we're not out of the hole financially," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Penprase, a member of the California Library Assn.'s legislative 
committee, said county residents have to realize the importance of public 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are an essential service in a democracy, and they should be required, 
like public education," she said. "It's extremely important we give people of 
all ages a chance at self-education. I just don't see that you can drop that. 
There has to be a way to keep this going."

2 YOUTHS WOUNDED IN CONFRONTATION; THOUSAND OAKS: WESTLAKE HIGH ATHLETES ARE 
CAUGHT IN GUNFIRE STEMMING FROM STUDENT RIVALRY. IT FOLLOWS AFTER-SCHOOL 
VIOLENCE IN SIMI VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Westlake High football players were wounded Thursday during a shooting on 
a Thousand Oaks street corner, as animosity between teen-age rivals led to 
after-school bloodshed for the second time this week in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors David Behling and Scott Smith were shot at noon just outside North 
Ranch Park, where they and a dozen friends had converged to watch a scheduled 
fistfight between two other Westlake High students, police said. A third 
student, 16-year-old Jarad Kline, was grazed by a bullet but not seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had made no arrests by late Thursday, though they were interviewing 
dozens of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began after at least 30 students gathered in the park after 
completing final exams Thursday morning. Witnesses said they had expected to 
watch a one-on-one punching match between a junior football player and a 
sophomore student at the park, which is about 2 1/2 miles north of the school 
in a neighborhood of expensive homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore arrived at the park with several carloads of older friends, 
witnesses said. They began whacking on the football player, identified as 
Curtis Simmons, with a 2-by-4 and a baseball bat, witnesses said. When Curtis 
fled, witnesses said, one of his adversaries opened fire with a small handgun, 
spraying up to eight bullets into a knot of frightened, furious onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shocking. It was stunning. I can't believe it," said football player 
Mike Priebe, who witnessed the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 David Behling, a 6-foot-1 defensive end shot in the base of the skull, was 
being held overnight at Westlake Medical Center for observation. The emergency 
room physician who treated him said the bullet smashed into his neck behind his 
left ear, fracturing his skull. Although the bullet has been removed, the 
physician was watching for possible infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Smith -- who took a bullet in the right shoulder and then crouched, 
bleeding, on the pavement to comfort his more seriously wounded teammate -- was 
treated in the hospital's emergency room and released Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys should be able to play football again next season, physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming just two days after the fatal stabbing of a ninth-grader outside Simi 
Valley's Valley View Junior High, the gunfire rattled students, school 
administrators and city officials in Thousand Oaks. And the incident reminded 
many that even campuses in the nation's safest cities can foster bloody 
rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Westlake's a little paradise here, but you're not immune anywhere," said Dr. 
Frank Gillingham, director of the Westlake emergency room. "We know it's 
coming. We don't have our heads stuck in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp said detectives had not determined 
whether the incident was gang-related. But friends of the victims and school 
administrators suspect that the fight stemmed from a long-running feud between 
Curtis Simmons and his sophomore rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis declined to comment, and the sophomore could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 A beefy, 220-pound defensive end on the Westlake High School football team, 
Curtis had faced the same rival in a fistfight last year, witnesses and school 
officials said. Both participants were suspended for five days. When they 
returned to school, they immediately renewed their mutual hatred, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid didn't like the results of the last fight, and he's been egging on my 
son all year," said Dani Simmons, Curtis' father. "It finally came to a head." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing persistent reports that the two were spoiling for another 
high-profile fight, Westlake High Assistant Principal Jim Martin said he called 
both students into his office last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He warned them not to resort to violence. If either boy suggested a showdown, 
he said, the other should immediately tell administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "But neither was interested in listening to reason," Martin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of campus scuttlebutt that one of the rivals had obtained a gun, Martin 
searched both boys' lockers -- but turned up no weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything else we could have done," Martin said. "We investigated 
the rumor and we talked with the boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the locker search, Curtis' parents remained anxious -- especially in 
the wake of Tuesday's fatal stabbing of the 14-year-old student in Simi Valley. 
Cindy Simmons said she called Westlake High School on Thursday morning to voice 
her fears. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as his worried mother was on the phone, Curtis -- described by 
friends as stubborn and macho -- was heading to North Ranch Park for the 
showdown, which had been widely publicized among his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 His unnamed rival, reportedly a much smaller youth, had challenged Curtis to a 
fight in the school parking lot last Friday but failed to appear, several 
football players said. The antagonists rescheduled the showdown for Thursday, 
after final exams ended and school let out at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 While Curtis' friends said they came to the park unarmed, they were prepared 
to back their buddy up if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 David Behling's 16-year-old girlfriend said the shooting victim "was ready to 
fight if he had to. He won't start a fight but he will stand up for his 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they were ready for a brawl, several students at the park said 
they were astounded that taunts, threats and fistfights could escalate into 
gunshots so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some praised Westlake High administrators for stopping previous campus 
scuffles and working to head off conflicts like the simmering rivalry that 
erupted in violence Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around here, the administration really jumps on fights," student Bob Adair 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few weeks, school board members have talked about developing a 
policy for expelling gang members solely because of their gang ties. And hours 
after the shooting, school officials said they would consider other measures as 
well to safeguard their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got metal detectors, and this may prompt us to use them," said Jerry 
Gross, superintendent of the Conejo Valley Unified School District. "We're in 
extreme times now. Maybe extreme measures are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Other civic leaders, however, emphasized that school policies alone cannot 
eliminate teen-age violence. Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah has been planning 
a citywide forum on crime prevention for next month, and school board President 
Dolores Didio on Thursday called for renewed cooperation between teachers, 
administrators and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said the stabbing in Simi Valley was an isolated incident, but that 
clearly is not true," Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo said. "We cannot 
live next to the highest crime area in the country -- that being Los Angeles -- 
without it affecting us. We've got to protect ourselves."

PLANNERS OK BAILARD LANDFILL OPERATION FOR 3 MORE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County planners decided Thursday to keep the Bailard Landfill near Oxnard open 
for three more years -- but only after assuring a group of neighboring Catholic 
nuns that operators will do a better job of reducing dust, noise and odor 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Six nuns from the Sisters, Servants of Mary convent -- four dressed in 
head-to-toe black habits and two novices in white -- appeared at the Ventura 
County Planning Commission hearing to politely ask for assurances that promises 
to alleviate some of the problems would be kept. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the sisters, who range in age from 19 to 94, are suffering health 
problems they attribute to landfill dust, but have not been vocal about the 
landfill in the past, said Jodi Rupp, a Catholic hospital administrator who 
spoke on the nuns' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "By their nature and their chosen station in life, the sisters are not 
complainers," Rupp said. "But if aggressive mitigation measures are undertaken 
and completed on time, the sisters will not oppose the extension." 
</P>
<P>
 The current permit to operate the landfill south of Gonzales Road and east of 
Victoria Avenue expired in December. But with the defeat last June of a 
proposal to open a new landfill at Weldon Canyon, the western end of the county 
has few other options for dumping the 1,000 tons of trash it produces each day, 
planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission approved a proposal by the Ventura Regional Sanitation 
District to continue operating the Bailard Landfill until either May 30, 1997, 
the point when the landfill accumulates 3.15 billion tons of trash, or when the 
wall of refuse reaches 119 feet high, whichever comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was automatically appealed to the Board of Supervisors, which 
will hear the issue on March 1. If approved, the extension would next be 
considered by the Local Enforcement Agency, which makes recommendations to the 
California Integrated Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the commissioners voted to extend the landfill with a list of 102 
strict measures to reduce impacts on the convent and neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Commissioners Laura Bartels and Sue Boecker dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see extending the life of a landfill that . . . really should never 
have been there in the first place," said Boecker, referring to the site near 
the Santa Clara River and atop a very shallow ground water basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have concerns about ground water, noise, dust and health issues," Bartels 
said in her objection to the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Craven, a member of the Regional Sanitation District board, said the 
nuns will profit from the extension. As part of the conditions of approval, 
they could receive an extensive filtration system for their home at district 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
 That would not only filter out dust from the landfill, but would reduce the 
dust and pollution levels from surrounding farms and traffic on nearby Victoria 
Avenue, which would exist regardless of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, the good of the general public has to be looked at and the 
needs of the sisters made secondary, although they are certainly going to be 
taken care of," Craven said. "But everybody in the county produces trash and it 
has to go someplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The 22 nuns who live at the convent are negotiating with an attorney for the 
district to decide how best to reduce noise, dust and smell on their property, 
which is about 500 feet from the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Planning Commission's conditions attached to the approval, 
the district has several options: install a filtration system in the convent 
and adjacent home, compensate the sisters for their inconvenience and health 
effects, buy their property and move the sisters, or temporarily relocate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupp said she did not believe the sisters would leave their property. And, she 
said, the district had not offered any cash compensation. Focusing on the 
proposal to install a filtration system, Rupp said the sisters would also like 
sound attenuating windows and insulation for the walls to reduce noise. Those 
things are up to the sisters to negotiate with the district, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sisters are naive in business ways," Rupp told the commissioners. "Their 
focus in life is to love and care for the sick and elderly. But we believe in 
integrity and they promised" to be fair, she said of the district's 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Other conditions imposed by the Planning Commission include a requirement for 
landfill operators to use chemical dust suppressants on all unpaved areas to 
reduce dust at the convent, as well as nearby River Ridge and Cypress Point 
housing developments and the planned high school nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 A sound wall has already been promised by Ventura County along Victoria Avenue 
to reduce noise caused by the street's expansion. The regional district will 
pay for half of that project, the district's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district must also begin a new extensive public education program to 
reduce the estimated five tons of household hazardous waste that go into the 
landfill each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has agreed to aggressively implement the conditions, lawyer Mark 
Zirbel said.

DEMOLITION OF OLD MASONIC BUILDING OKD; FILLMORE: A JUDGE'S RULING FRUSTRATES 
LOCAL PRESERVATIONISTS FIGHTING TO SAVE THE QUAKE-DAMAGED STRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court judge on Thursday cleared the way for the 
demolition of the historic Masonic Building in Fillmore over the objections of 
a local preservationist group. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which calls itself the Friends of Fillmore, had won a temporary 
restraining order Wednesday blocking the demolition of the building until 
Thursday's hearing. The group argued that the building could not be demolished 
until city officials drafted a report detailing the historical significance of 
the structure to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge Richard Aldrich said the exception to that law was 
when a building posed a threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law does not cover this because the building is in danger of collapsing 
and may be demolished even though it's of historical importance," Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing reports by two of Fillmore's building inspectors warning that the 
building could fall at any time, Aldrich allowed the city to go forward with 
the demolition, which is now scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A hearing like this shows the true extent of this disaster," Aldrich said 
before issuing his ruling. "The scale of the suffering is brought home by both 
the people whose life savings could be lost and those who want to preserve this 
historic landmark." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hicks, an attorney representing the Friends of Fillmore, said the decision 
was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building has stood for 75 years and could stand for another 75 if the 
city took the initiative to look at their options," Hicks said after the 
decision. "It's a shame. Fillmore is the last frontier town of Southern 
California left and that character should be protected." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Swift, a Fillmore resident who helped organize the Friends of Fillmore, 
was equally dismayed. She felt that the threat was being exaggerated, noting 
that the city recently reopened an intersection in the shadow of the listing 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really this isn't about what state law says, but about the people of 
Fillmore," Swift said. "This is the keystone of the community, and there's 
nothing to replace it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the city and owners of the building had been frustrated by delays in the 
building's demolition. Since it was included on a list of 14 other buildings 
scheduled for demolition 10 days ago, the building has been reviewed by state 
and federal inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 While inspectors said the building was repairable, they also said it probably 
would be more costly to repair than to tear down. The owners and city officials 
say they don't have the money to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we've gone through all the hoops," said City Manager Roy Payne 
before the hearing. "And still we're being told that we should go through more, 
while no one has offered the money that is needed to make these repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks and Swift said Thursday they were not sure whether they would appeal 
Aldrich's decision. The city has already signed the demolition order and 
selected a contractor to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks and Swift worried that the city and owners of the building would try to 
demolish the structure before an appeal could be lodged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore Masonic Assn., which owns the building, said it was satisfied 
with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something we want to do, it's something we have to do," said Louis 
Gabrielsen, a representative for the association. "We're talking $2.5 million 
that we don't have to restore that building. If they want to save it they 
should pay for it."

CSUN BRANCH IN VENTURA IS BRACING FOR INFLUX; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS EXPECT 
RECORD HIGH SPRING ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF STUDENTS DISPLACED BY NORTHRIDGE 
EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring enrollment at the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge is expected to 
reach a record high as students displaced from earthquake-damaged classrooms at 
the college's main campus drive north for instruction, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 1,500 people have inquired about courses in Ventura following 
the 6.6-magnitude Northridge earthquake that heavily damaged portions of Cal 
State Northridge. That is nearly three times the number of students who 
normally enroll at the tiny Ventura satellite campus for spring classes, said 
Joyce Kennedy, director of the Ventura site. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes begin Feb. 14, but students can register for Ventura courses until 
March 4. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the callers said they are students who live in the San Fernando 
Valley who are considering commuting to Ventura to take classes that are 
temporarily unavailable in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But most are Ventura County residents who normally commute to Northridge for 
classes. They said they may opt instead to receive instruction in Ventura, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge's computerized registration system is still down, and 
college administrators do not know precisely how many will end up driving to 
Ventura. But administrators are planning for an influx of at least 200 new 
students, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring enrollment at the Ventura campus usually hovers at about 530, Kennedy 
said. "If what we predict comes true, our spring enrollment will the highest 
ever," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have already added two courses and reassigned faculty members 
to the Ventura campus' spring schedule in preparation for the reverse flow of 
students, Kennedy said. More courses may be added as the spring semester start 
date approaches, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A seven-story complex of faculty offices and classrooms at Cal State 
Northridge sustained heavy damage during the Jan. 17 earthquake, disrupting 
plans for spring classes scheduled to take place there. A newly built parking 
structure was destroyed and other buildings on campus have also suffered severe 
damage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake has also taken a psychological toll of some students and their 
families, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had parents call and say they are concerned about another earthquake," 
she said. "Or their daughter is very nervous about staying on the Northridge 
campus. And they want to know what we have available." 
</P>
<P>
 Students have called from as far away as Santa Clarita and Palmdale to find 
out if the Ventura satellite will enroll them, Kennedy said. Some are desperate 
to get a class, especially if they are nearing graduation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say, 'You're welcome to come. But let me tell you where we are. We are out 
by the ocean, near the Oxnard Plain,' " Kennedy said. "And they say 'We don't 
care. We'll take the back roads.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two business courses have been added to the Ventura site's spring schedule to 
handle the overflow, Kennedy said. Although classroom space and parking at the 
building on Allesandro Drive have always been tight, the campus will be able to 
handle more students because the added classes will be taught during the day.  
</P>
<P>
 Most Ventura campus classes are given at night, geared toward working adults 
pursuing upper-level classes to complete a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the situation is expected to last only one semester, and that the 
Ventura campus won't see any budget windfall as a result of the higher 
enrollment. The students will continue to be registered at the main campus, 
with their fees going to the Northridge site, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like taking in relatives who are down on their luck," Kennedy said. 
"They won't be here forever, but we will do all we can to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quake damage to Cal State Northridge is not expected to delay plans for 
construction of a permanent Ventura County campus, said Colleen Bentley-Adler, 
a spokeswoman for the California State University system. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations to buy a 230-acre tract of land west of Camarillo are proceeding, 
and there is no indication that any money set aside for that purchase will be 
diverted to fix quake-ravaged buildings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't have any impact, because the majority of funds to repair the 
buildings in Northridge will come from the federal government," Bentley-Adler 
said. "And the rest will be paid from the state's Office of Emergency 
Services." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura campus, which suffered no damage from the earthquake, the 
biggest headache from the relocation of classes will be dealing with logistics, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial aid has been delayed and academic record-keeping has been hampered 
by the loss of Cal State Northridge's computers, she said. Even figuring out 
how to get textbooks from Northridge to Ventura for the new classes poses a 
challenge, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Launie, a professor in the business department at Cal State Northridge, 
said the change of class sites will make him a "gypsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new schedule, he will continue to teach one class at Cal State 
Northridge, but is assigned to instruct another at the Ventura campus. Building 
inspectors have told him he may not be able to enter his office in Northridge, 
so he must carry his lesson plans, records and books in his car while shuttling 
from one campus to the other, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will have to carry my office in my car, essentially," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one bonus: Launie lives in Camarillo, so his commute to the Ventura 
campus will be shorter. And after 28 years of teaching, Launie has a broader 
view of the process of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "A university isn't a physical plant or buildings or computers," Launie said. 
"Those things just aid us. I could sit out on the end of a log and have the 
students sit on the lawn and we could still function."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CAREGIVERS TO HONOR 2 COUNTY SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ventura County senior citizens who have dedicated much of their lives to 
serving others will be honored by a senior care group at a special dinner next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Myra Harrison, president of Harrison Industries, and Lloyd Fellows, an 
ordained minister and clinical psychologist, will be presented with 
Distinguished Senior awards from Caregivers Inc., a Ventura-based nonprofit 
organization that provides help to needy seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Myra Harrison, who lives in Ventura, is the widow of E. J. Harrison, who 
founded the local trash collection firm that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been very much involved in the community, and done a lot of volunteer 
service," said Pat Meredith, a spokeswoman for Caregivers. "Then, when (the 
Harrisons) became successful, they began to give back in gratitude to Ventura 
County for being good to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows, an Ojai resident, is now serving as foreman of the Ventura County 
Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is a qualified mental health worker who has served on the Caregivers 
advisory board and has worked extensively with the American Red Cross and its 
National Disaster Team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 13 dinner also will honor actor Macdonald Carey, who is best known 
for his 25-year role on "Days of Our Lives." Carey will receive a special 
tribute for his work in the mental health community. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the dinner, which will be held at the Mandalay Beach Resort in 
Oxnard, cost $100. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HIGH SCHOOL REPLACES OUSTED SWIM COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura High School has appointed two new swim coaches to replace Dale Hahn, 
the teacher who was suspended last month after allegations that he had sex with 
two students and had made sexually suggestive comments to others. 
</P>
<P>
 John Silver has been promoted from assistant swim coach to head coach for the 
boys, and teacher Rita Darling has been named head swim coach for the girls, 
Ventura High Principal Jerry Barshay said.Darling teaches English and physical 
education at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Silver and Darling had both been acting as the swim team's head 
coaches since at least January, they officially took over their new duties this 
week, Barshay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former swim coach Hahn has not returned to the school since before 
Thanksgiving. In January, the school district suspended him without pay and 
took steps to fire him, filing a list of 90 separate allegations against the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 An administrative hearing on the charges is expected to be held in June in 
Ventura, school officials said. Hahn is also under investigation by Ventura 
police.  
</P>
<P>
 Silver and Darling will work together to coach the swim team during the daily 
sixth-period practice session at the school and during competitions, Barshay 
said. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SIGN PROMOTING CIVIC ARTS PLAZA 
APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way Helene Ross figures it, $275 can buy an awful lot of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairwoman of a committee in charge of drumming up support for Thousand 
Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza, Ross has drafted a long and ambitious publicity 
program, from radio spots to a cable broadcast to a slick brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 But her most visible effort may be the most low-tech -- and the least 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week approved Ross' request to install a 23-square-foot 
purple and teal sign on Thousand Oaks Boulevard counting down the months until 
the performing arts center opens this fall. The publicity committee will foot 
the bill of $275. 
</P>
<P>
 With its logo of a leaping dancer and its slogan "The Countdown Begins," the 
sign will "stimulate interest in our wonderful plaza," Ross said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the sign meets the city's size guidelines, it will violate a rule 
limiting developers to one sign per construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza site already has one sign, a billboard identifying it as 
a redevelopment project and listing all five council members. In addition, a 
trailer bearing the construction management firm's name, Lehrer McGovern Bovis, 
is visible from Thousand Oaks Boulevard. And a 60-foot-long banner identifying 
the building hangs on the tower facing the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, City Council members agreed that the Civic Arts Plaza presented a 
special case and agreed to allow the countdown sign. Mayor Elois Zeanah cast 
the only no vote, arguing that the countdown placard should replace, rather 
than stand next to, the redevelopment agency billboard. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Someone fired two shots at the front of the Santa Paula Police Station early 
Thursday, shattering a window pane and startling a dispatcher, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatcher Carla Samples was working near the front of the station when she 
heard two gunshots followed by the sound of glass breaking, Cmdr. Mark Hanson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol cars summoned by Samples stopped one car leaving the area, but the 
occupants were not involved, Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects, but Hanson said that "drive-by shootings are, 
generally speaking, gang-related. We've been leaning on a lot of people lately

<P>
 Oxnard police have arrested two men on suspicion of stealing a 14-year-old 
boy's bike after forcing him to abandon it as he rode down the street, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Homero Barajas and Gilbert Amar, both 19, were taken into custody on suspicion 
of strong-arm robbery a short time after the incident when patrol officers 
recognized their car from a description broadcast by police dispatchers.The 
bike was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were booked into County Jail and were being held Thursday in lieu of 
$20,000 bail. They are scheduled to appear in Ventura County Municipal Court 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 5:50 p.m. Wednesday as the boy was riding in the 
area of Wooley and Ventura roads, police said. The boy told police a car pulled 
up beside him and the passenger got out and tried to hit him. When the boy 
abandoned his bike, the passenger threw it in the back of the car and the 
driver drove away. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WITNESS SAYS MURDER VICTIM WAS KIDNAPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness in a Ventura County death-penalty case testified 
on Thursday that the murder defendant -- his former roommate and close friend 
-- kidnaped a 30-year-old Oxnard woman before killing her. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for defendant Christopher James Sattiewhite have already admitted 
that their client put a gun to the head of Genoveva Gonzales on Jan. 26, 1992, 
and fired three times, killing her instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the testimony of Bobby Rollins, the 22-year-old witness, is significant 
because Sattiewhite would be eligible for the gas chamber if prosecutors could 
prove Gonzales was killed while being raped or kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite is charged with murder, kidnaping and rape. Defense attorneys deny 
that Sattiewhite raped or kidnaped the victim. They say Gonzales accepted a 
ride with Sattiewhite and another man, Frederick Jackson, in hopes of trading 
sex for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rollins, who said he saw Sattiewhite shoot Gonzales in a drainage ditch 
near Arnold Road, testified that she struggled with Jackson in the back seat of 
the car Sattiewhite drove that day. Before Gonzales was shot, Sattiewhite said 
that he and Jackson had kidnaped her from near 5th Street in Oxnard, Rollins 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, the first death-penalty case to be tried in the county in more than 
two years, is in recess until Monday. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; STREET PARKING NEAR METROLINK RESTRICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council has decided to limit all-day parking on portions of 
High and Magnolia streets at the request of downtown merchants who say 
Metrolink commuters parking near their shops are cutting off customer access. 
</P>
<P>
 The new restrictions, slated to go into effect next week, will establish a 
two-hour limit for on-street parking in the immediate vicinity of the Metrolink 
lot between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "This primarily comes at the urging of the merchants on the street (who say) 
that their customers are unable to park during the day anywhere near their 
establishments because of the parking we believe is associated with Metrolink," 
said Mayor Paul Lawrason."In order to give them a little breather and a little 
elbow room, we've decided to take this course." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason, who commutes to the San Fernando Valley on Metrolink daily, said 
many riders park on High Street to avoid the main Metrolink parking lot south 
of the railroad tracks, because it can take up to 15 minutes to leave the lot 
each evening. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new parking restrictions, the council voted 4 to 0 this 
week to instruct city staff members to investigate ways to expand access to the 
lot in an attempt to improve circulation and prompt more riders to use the 
south parking lot. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HYDROGRAPHER RETIRES AFTER 30-YEAR CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Minger, who has provided Ventura County planners and residents with 
accurate rainfall measurements and recordings for decades, has retired after 
more than 30 years with the county's Flood Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Minger, 74, a county hydrographer, has been responsible for monitoring the 
county's 90 rainfall gauges and compiling data used to design storm drains and 
runoff channels for new developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was Mr. Rainfall," said Dolores Taylor, his supervisor from 1978 to 1992. 
"He always had all the stats." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most exciting moments of his career came in 1969 when he was part 
of a two-man crew sent out during one of the worst storms in Ventura County 
history to see how high the water had risen under the bridges on the Santa 
Clara River and its tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the black night and driving rain that reduced visibility to almost zero, 
with water and rocks across the highway, Minger and co-worker Jim Capito set 
out. They arrived at the south end of the Saticoy bridge on their way up the 
Santa Clara Valley. They started to cross, but decided at the last minute to 
check the bridge first. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we got out, we heard this tremendous roaring sound," Minger 
recalled. "Jim said that could be the high-pressure gas line across the river 
and that could mean the bridge is out." 
</P>
<P>
 A huge section of the bridge had in fact been swept away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have driven right off the end of it," Minger said. "Chills still run 
up and down my back when I think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Minger attended both elementary and high school in the Ojai Valley before 
enrolling for three years of college at what was then Santa Barbara State 
College. After a stint in the Army, during which he married his wife of 48 
years, Mary Ann, he returned to complete his college education at UC Berkeley.  
</P>
<P>
 With a degree in zoology and a minor in physical sciences, Minger spent six 
years as a high school math and science teacher before deciding on a career 
change. He began work with the county in 1961, but took time off in the early 
1960s to take a shot at "making big money as a salesman for a roofing company." 
He returned to the county by the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out to be very interesting work," he said. "I enjoyed it, but 
especially the people I worked with. They are really a top-flight bunch of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Minger said he retired because he wanted to relax a little, spend some time 
building model railroads and travel with his wife to visit their daughters and 
grandchildren in Washington and San Diego. They have two sons as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was the section head . . . he could do anything I gave him," Taylor 
said. "I'll miss him." JOANNA M. MILLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGE OFFICIALS SEEK DISASTER PLAN

<P>
 Alarmed by the communications blackout after last month's 6.6 earthquake, 
officials with the Ventura County Community College District are discussing how 
to be better prepared when the next major temblor hits Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quake has become a very pointed learning experience," district Chancellor 
Thomas Lakin said at Tuesday night's meeting of the board of trustees."We've 
learned we cannot rely on telephones when the quake occurs, because the 
telephones weren't working." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin, who said he had trouble reaching some trustees and key college 
administrators until late in the afternoon on the day of the quake, suggested 
that the district invest in short-wave radios that will operate when phone 
lines shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Pete Tafoya added that the district should devise a formal earthquake 
plan so that each trustee, administrator and staff member will know what to do 
in the hours after a natural disaster. "We need to make sure there is a 
formalized process of self-help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin and some trustees noted that if the earthquake had occurred while 
classes were in session, many students and faculty might have suffered severe 
injuries from falling fixtures and plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no plan in place to deal with such a situation, panic might 
have intensified the troubles at hard-hit Moorpark College, where the library 
and gym sustained extensive damage, they said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

PLANNERS TO CONSIDER OUTLET MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission today will consider approving a 22-acre 
factory outlet mall west of the Ventura Freeway, between Las Posas Road and 
Carmen Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners will consider the controversial Koll Leonard factory outlet 
mall for the second time after a Ventura Superior Court judge decided that a 
previous development deal amounted to a gift of public funds by the city.The 
decision was sparked by a lawsuit brought by an Oxnard developer and a retired 
Camarillo businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Before approving the 250,000-square-foot mall, the commissioners must first 
certify the project's new environmental impact report, as required by the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the mall will be the second in Ventura County. A similar-sized 
facility recently broke ground in Oxnard about five miles north of the proposed 
Camarillo mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission meeting will start at 4 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

13-YEAR-OLD BOY CHARGED WITH MURDER IN CLASSMATE'S DEATH; SIMI VALLEY: SUSPECT 
IS TO BE ARRAIGNED TODAY IN STABBING. ANGRY PARENTS ADDRESS EDUCATORS AT 
MEETING. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors charged a 13-year-old Simi Valley schoolboy with 
murder Thursday in the fatal stabbing of a classmate at Valley View Junior 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Hernandez is scheduled to be arraigned this morning before Superior 
Court Judge Steven Z. Perren. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, described by witnesses as a "tagger" who emulated gang members, 
is accused of killing Chad Patrick Hubbard, a popular 14-year-old boy and 
member of the school baseball team. The two boys had a long-running feud that 
escalated last week when Hernandez took Chad's baseball cap, witnesses and 
students said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad was stabbed in the chest in an open-air hallway of the school about 3:30 
p.m. Tuesday, just after classes let out. He was pronounced dead a short while 
later at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over the stabbing drew an overflow crowd of 350 people to Sinaloa 
Junior High on Thursday night, where school officials tried to reassure hostile 
and wary parents that Simi Valley schools are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Don Gaudioso told the crowd that contrary to public perception the 
two boys did not have a long history of conflict. He said school officials had 
learned about a brewing disagreement between them only about 1 1/2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller stressed that the stabbing 
was an isolated incident and not gang related. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chad's aunt, Chris Miller, shouted from the back of the room, "Our kids 
are not safe in your school system. What are you going to do to protect our 
children?" 
</P>
<P>
 And Bruce Levine, Chad's uncle, interrupted, yelling, "Chad gave his life and 
it (should) not all be for not. It's got to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The outburst brought applause and prompted another parent to stand up and 
confront city and school leaders. "The school system hasn't been safe for 
years," shouted Gertry Comden. "I reported it to them years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley schools Assistant Supt. Susan Parks took the microphone and 
encouraged parents to channel their anger into helping officials combat 
teen-age violence. "I am personally glad you are all here today, to see that it 
doesn't happen again. We all feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shouting ended, other parents wanted to know more about the suspect 
and specifically what school authorities are doing to control problem students. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said students caught with weapons are immediately expelled. 
But that answer did not satisfy the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to stop showing concern for your job and start showing concern for 
our students," said William Reed, who said his daughter witnessed the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Another parent shouted, "Nothing is going to get better if the parents act 
irrationally. Let's just cool it." The man's comment also brought applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Hernandez, who was arrested about 10 minutes after the stabbing, has 
been held at Juvenile Hall since then. Under California law, juveniles are not 
entitled to bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the arraignment will be a Juvenile Court proceeding, it will be open 
to the public because of the seriousness of the charge, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the suspect is under 16, he cannot be tried as an adult. If found 
guilty of murder, he could be sent to the California Youth Authority until 
2001, when he turns 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who is under the age of 16 has to be tried in Juvenile Court under 
California law," said Frank C. Woodson, director of the county's Corrections 
Services Agency, which operates Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors refused to discuss the evidence that led them to file the murder 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to charge or release the suspect within 48 hours of his arrest. The 
murder charge was filed midafternoon Thursday, a short time before the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison said the evidence supports the murder 
charge, though he would not discuss any evidence or the motive for the 
stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point in time we filed what we thought was appropriate," he said. "In 
any case where there is an ongoing investigation -- and right now there is an 
ongoing investigation -- there is always a possibility of things changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez family members could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 All juvenile defendants are eligible for the services of the Ventura County 
public defender's office, regardless of economic need. 
</P>
<P>
 But Duane A. Dammeyer, assistant public defender, said his office had not been 
asked to represent Hernandez by Thursday.

SIMI VALLEY CRIME RATE DROPS 10% IN 1 YEAR; STATISTICS: CITY REPORTS 83% JUMP 
IN GRAFFITI, BUT NOTES THAT INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS ARE NOW RECORDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Serious crime fell by more than 10% in Simi Valley in 1993, a decline that 
city officials hope will reinforce the city's image as a safe place to live 
despite the fatal stabbing of a 14-year-old boy earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A report released by the Simi Valley Police Department on Thursday showed that 
there were no reported homicides in 1993, down from two in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of robberies and felony assaults also declined, although the number 
of reported rapes increased from 11 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant increase came in graffiti reports, which surged 83.9% 
from 2,196 in 1992 to 4,038 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Police Chief Lindsey P. Miller said the increase was a direct result of 
the department's decision in mid-1992 to start filing individual crime reports 
for graffiti incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been keeping a much more accurate record of the amount of graffiti 
since we went to the new method," Miller said. "There could have been just as 
much graffiti before, but we did not track it as closely." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the City Council toughened its 4-year-old anti-graffiti laws, 
banning the sale of spray paint, etching tools and wide-tip markers to minors 
and making parents liable for up to $10,000 in damages and fines from their 
children's vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is also offering a $1,000 reward to people who offer information 
that helps arrest and convict vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 To further combat graffiti and improve relations between police and residents, 
the council also agreed to launch a five-officer bike patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, scheduled to begin later this month, will focus on residential 
areas and shopping centers, the Arroyo Simi flood control channel, and on 
existing bicycle and equestrian paths, targeting tough-to-reach crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 crime rate was 30.2 incidents per 1,000 residents, down from a rate 
of 36.9 in 1992 and 36.3 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley has consistently ranked in annual FBI crime statistics as one of 
the safest cities in the nation with 100,000 or more residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton attributed the low crime rate to an aggressive Police 
Department and cooperative citizenry, and stressed that the fatal stabbing 
Tuesday at Valley View Junior High School of ninth-grader Chad Patrick Hubbard 
was an isolated act. 
</P>
<P>
 "An incident like this is always unfortunate," Stratton said. "But you have to 
look at the whole system over time, and we are still one of the safest places 
to live, although unfortunately it doesn't mean that there's no crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said the drop in auto theft, from 439 in 1992 to 369 in 1993, was the 
result of a concerted effort by the Police Department to discourage thieves 
from the San Fernando Valley from heading into Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had criminals creeping over the hill," Stratton said. "But 1993 shows 
that our tough stand has managed to convince people that this is not the right 
place to go foraging for crime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Gordon, founder of Citizens for a Safe and Scenic Simi Valley, said she 
hoped that the city would focus on getting knives out of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that overall this is a very safe community," Gordon said. "We need to 
work harder to make sure children do not have weapons at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, who moved from Chatsworth seven years ago, said she feels comfortable 
walking after dark in her Indian Hills neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of community here," she said. "That's why we're such a safe 
city, because people look after each other." Simi Valley Crime Statistics

PRIEST TESTIFIES HE KEPT LOOSE FINANCIAL RECORDS FOR SIMI PARISH; COURT: FATHER 
JAMES MCKEON ADMITS AT PIROLI EMBEZZLEMENT TRIAL THAT HE COULD NOT TELL 
RECEIPTS FROM THE PAYMENTS IN HIS OWN WORN LEDGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Father James McKeon kept financial records for his Simi Valley parish in a 
"little black book" full of question marks, scribbles, Latin notations and some 
numbers that even he could not explain while testifying Thursday in the 
embezzlement trial of his former assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Under intense cross-examination by the defense attorney for Father David Dean 
Piroli, McKeon admitted he could not tell receipts apart from payments in the 
worn, red-trimmed Leatherette ledger he kept at St. Peter Claver Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace asked, "Do you feel sometimes you didn't 
do such a good job handling money for the parish?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot tell a lie, we're under oath, right?" McKeon said, grinning and 
hanging his head. "Yes," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli is on trial for two counts of grand theft, accused of stealing $60,000 
from St. Peter Claver and his previous posting, Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Richard Beada focused for nearly five hours Thursday on 
McKeon's sketchy financial records. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissection of the ledger was meant to bolster Beada's contention that 
McKeon was actually the one skimming money and that he planted cash in Piroli's 
rooms and car to frame the younger priest, whom he feared would expose him. 
</P>
<P>
 When Beada asked McKeon to name the year in which he wrote a certain page of 
the ledger, McKeon pored over the book, flipping pages and muttering to himself 
before exclaiming, "Ah, here it is. Yes, 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 Beada asked about numbers that McKeon had written in the narrow columns of the 
ledger's lined pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "These would not necessarily be money coming in, they could be going out," 
McKeon testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he could tell the difference by looking at his entries, McKeon 
admitted, "No, I could not." 
</P>
<P>
 Beada pointed to a $10 entry labeled "dinner -- ego." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just myself, ' ego ,' " McKeon explained. "It's a little Latin note -- 
that is, 'myself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, McKeon told jurors he often took cash out of the collection 
money, sometimes logging it in his ledger, sometimes not. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon also testified that the church's volunteer money counters would 
separate donations for the building fund and the poor and give them to McKeon 
after depositing all other donations in the church's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, McKeon testified he sometimes asked counters to swap him cash for 
checks earmarked for the poor so that he could keep a ready supply of cash in 
his office to give to needy people. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, it took Beada five minutes of questioning to get a clear 
explanation about a single ledger entry that McKeon had made on one of the 
checks he had cashed for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever gone through the book and reconciled how much you took in with 
how much you paid out?" Beada asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why I'd need to do that," McKeon answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners and non-parishioners listening to McKeon's testimony in Ventura 
County Superior Court whispered to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be behind bars if I handled money the way that pastor did," one court 
spectator said during a break, referring to McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectator, a woman who identified herself only as a Catholic from 
Camarillo, said she believes the Piroli case is scandalous and should have been 
handled internally by the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "I think this is terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in McKeon's testimony, Bishop G. Patrick Ziemann briefly took 
the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziemann, who oversaw St. Peter Claver Church, Sacred Heart Church and other 
parishes in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties during Piroli's tenure, 
testified that he told parishioners to wait for orders from the Archdiocese 
after they found bundles of cash in Piroli's bedroom and office on June 2 and 
3, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine days later, Ziemann said, he ordered the cash locked in the trunk of a 
parish car for safekeeping until the police could pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on June 29, he cleaned out Piroli's rooms and put the priest's belongings 
into a Simi Valley storage locker to make way for a new priest after the 
associate pastor disappeared, Ziemann testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony is to continue Monday at 9:30 a.m.

MUSIC REVIEWS; ORPHEUS ORCHESTRA BROADENS BOUNDARIES; IN ITS CERRITOS PROGRAM, 
THE CONDUCTORLESS CHAMBER GROUP DID ITS MOST POWERFUL WORK WITH THE MODERN BERG 
COMPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra has been widening the boundaries of repertory a 
conductorless ensemble can handle ever since its founding in 1972. The least 
likely music to succeed with such an approach -- a work by Alban Berg -- may 
have been the most powerful and successful in a concert Wednesday at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the musicians announced their ease and mastery of ensemble with 
virtuosic flair in Boccherini's Symphony in D minor, Opus 12, No. 4 ("La Casa 
del Diavolo"), which opened the program. The crisp, clean, urgent bowings, the 
precision of the starts and stops and the variety and control of dynamics 
vanquished any doubts about the approach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart's Piano Concerto in B-flat, K. 456, and Dvorak's Serenade in D minor 
for Winds, also on the program, should be prime candidates for this kind of 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, soloist Radu Lupu proved a cerebral Mozart interpreter, 
emphasizing dexterity and speed over song and character, although he 
occasionally allowed himself the option of applying pedal to create coloristic 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupu was playing on a modern Steinway grand, and the volume of the sound he 
produced, even through light, pointillistic attack and fingering, sounded 
large, out of proportion to the accompaniment provided by the 23 or so 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians seemed to have little choice other than to respond with short, 
dry, characterless phrasings. The whiplash bowing that had served Boccherini so 
effectively earlier began to sound manneristic and oppressive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in short, a tough, tense, driven, bright, alert and cold performance 
of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, the chamber orchestra split into strings and winds to 
play, respectively, Three Pieces from Berg's "Lyric Suite" and Dvorak's 
Serenade. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berg's complex music, the musicians showed the same technical 
accomplishment heard before, but added to it a degree of personal intensity. 
The visceral surge of emotion that began in the cellos in the Adagio -- to 
single out only the most dramatic sequence -- led to relentless waves of 
passion, a heartbreaking dissolution, a recall to life and a final suspension 
of breath. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance of the Dvorak, which followed, ventured earnestness, bucolic 
charm and folk dance vigor, but could not entirely vanquish Berg's last 
question mark.

MUSIC REVIEWS; BIG AMBITION, LITTLE DEPTH; THE PACIFIC SYMPHONY MAKES A NOBLE 
EFFORT WITH AN ENTICING AND CHALLENGING PROGRAM BUT MANAGES ONLY TO SCRATCH THE 
SURFACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although the Pacific Symphony's concert Wednesday night at Orange County 
Performing Arts Center was a noble and ambitious effort, the results ran only 
surface deep. 
</P>
<P>
 This was partially the fault of the music at hand. John Corigliano's 1968 
Piano Concerto, which formed the main part of the first half, is a big, 
hyper-athletic, theatrical work, a young man's composition (the composer was 30 
at the time of its premiere) that tries hard to dazzle, and succeeds, but does 
little else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most satisfying way to listen to the work, written in this 
composer's trademark eclectic style, is to spot the quotes -- from Bartok, from 
Stravinsky, from Copland, from the Dies Irae, and on and on. Corigliano slants 
this mix very much toward the muscular, driving, brutal end of the spectrum -- 
with heavy doses of aggressive brass and percussion and pounding piano -- but 
occasionally breaks things up with an all-too-sweet, Americana-type lyricism. 
The combination is accessible and exciting and about as subtle and nourishing 
as a Stallone movie. 
</P>
<P>
 It does supply, however, four movements (and 35 minutes) of very high octane 
fuel for pianist and orchestra, and it served well to display the virtuoso 
talents of French Canadian soloist Alain Lefevre, conductor Carl St.Clair and 
the Pacific Symphony -- all of whom will record the work this week. They are 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the concert (and also slated for recording) was the first orchestral 
performance of the five-minute "Postcard" by Pacific Symphony's 
composer-in-residence, Frank Ticheli. It's a splashy and metrically romping 
piece, quirky and pleasing, crescendoing off the page. St.Clair et al. played 
it with polish and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor led a solid but all-too-routine performance of Beethoven's Fifth 
to conclude. Proper instrumental balances proved a major oversight here, 
robbing the music of detail and depth as well as of the exuberance the composer 
achieved by tossing his ideas throughout the orchestra.

THEATER / T.H. MCCULLOH; GETTING TO THE GORE OF THE MATTER; 'COMING 
ATTRACTIONS,' AN '80S SPOOF OF TABLOID TV, GETS AN EXUBERANT STAGING AT ORANGE 
COAST COLLEGE 
</P>

 The "Coming Attractions" in Ted Tally's black comedy noticed a trend that was 
just beginning when the play was written in the early '80s, when the media 
began to drool over real-life gore and to pay premium prices for story rights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a one-joke play, even in this energetic Orange Coast College production, 
about a young hood named Lonnie Wayne Burke, who is holding four hostages in a 
coin-operated laundry. Tobarter with Lonnie, the police send in Manny, a 
low-life agent whose other clients literally are dog acts. Manny engineers 
Lonnie's acquittal on grounds of insanity and grooms him for the big time -- 
books, movies of the week, the whole nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Today that trend is in full flower. Two television movies about the Menendez 
brothers loom, and surely the Bobbitt saga is already in the cutting room. 
Tally hit the nail on the head; indeed, stretching his one joke into a 
full-length play seems no more excessive than the news itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Todd Kulczyk's sense of humor jibes with Tally's, and his brashly 
exuberant pacing fits the writer's cartoon style. What his staging lacks is 
production values, which this play really needs to fill in gaps in the action. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kulczyk has a perfect Burke in actor Jeff Kriese, who has an 
innocent-baby-faced killer look and enough depth to express the character's 
pain when the notoriety fades and the day-to-day world has him back in its 
clutches. (At the performance reviewed, Kulczykproduction values, which this 
play really needs to fill in gaps in the action.

playing Manny with script in hand. It didn't harm the show at all.) 
</P>
<P>
 Kristina Leach is funny as the bimbotic Miss America for whom Lonnie falls. 
Pat Bruno gets laughs as Sammy Dazzle, small-screen emcee supreme, a role that 
allows an actor to go way overboard without throwing the play off course. D.P. 
Vining also has a winning moment as an Arab comic whose humor doesn't translate 
from the Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors double and quadruple as all the characters except Manny and Lonnie, 
and they race through the action with panache. If only those elusive production 
values were there, to give the show a look to match its tempo.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FEMA STOPS DELIVERIES OF CHECKS FOR HOUSING; 
EMERGENCY: AN EFFORT TO HELP QUAKE VICTIMS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE RESULTS IN 
SOME RESIDENTS RECEIVING FUNDS THEY DID NOT REQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said Thursday that they are 
discontinuing the expedited delivery of disaster assistance that resulted in 
the mailing of hundreds of checks to people who did not ask for emergency 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster housing checks for up to $3,450 each were issued to residents based 
on ZIP codes in areas hit hard by the Northridge earthquake, even though some 
of the check recipients were still living in their homes and did not need 
emergency housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem stemmed from an effort to get aid to victims as quickly as 
possible and from the tremendous backlog of applications, which hampered normal 
verification procedures, said Morrie Goodman, FEMA's director of public 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA usually requires inspection of applicants' homes to determine the extent 
of damage and eligibility for aid programs. But in this case there were not 
enough inspectors to go around and checks for needy victims could have been 
delayed for weeks, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, as an agency, it was better to send the checks than to wait until we 
had inspectors out there," he said. The agency has increased its ranks of 
inspectors to about 800 and hopes to have 1,500 in the field by next week, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope shortly that we will be able to match demand with the numbers of 
inspectors," Goodman said. "We will be concentrating more on specific needs as 
inspectors go out to homes and will be downplaying the use of ZIP codes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, FEMA invited those who received disaster housing checks in error to 
return them. Officials also emphasized that everyone who received a check will 
be asked to account for the money and can expect a visit from a government 
inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman said confusion among some quake victims who received unanticipated 
checks may stem from the registration process. When victims call FEMA's 
registration hot line, he said, they automatically apply for the entire range 
of FEMA assistance programs, regardless of whether they request a specific form 
of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goodman also encouraged quake victims to use the money for any 
FEMA-administered program, including home repairs, motel or hotel rooms, if 
victims have been displaced; longer-term relocation; replacement of damaged 
items and crisis counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims who received emergency housing checks and think they are not 
entitled to them may return them to: FEMA, Disaster Temporary Housing Branch, 
P.O. Box 8020, Redwood City, Calif. 94063.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THOUSANDS REMAIN HOMELESS; HOUSING: LAST OF THE 
GIANT TENT CITIES IS DISMANTLED. MANY QUAKE VICTIMS IN INDOOR SHELTERS ARE 
URGED TO SEARCH FOR PERMANENT HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Workers finished dismantling the last of the giant tent cities erected after 
the earthquake on Thursday, yet thousands of quake victims remained homeless at 
dozens of indoor shelters where relief agencies gave a last push to find 
permanent homes for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to bring the population down to zero," said Ella Nevarez, a 
Salvation Army caseworker called in from Orange County to speed the process at 
a Canoga Park shelter. "We're letting them know they need to make a decision . 
. . that this is not a healthy situation. Everyone needs to move beyond the 
earthquake now." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many in the shelters who had been bused over from several of the 
National Guard-run tent cities -- the last of which was closed Wednesday, its 
residents transferred to indoor shelters -- still did not have homes to return 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem in a hurry to kick people out," said one woman, as she cuddled her 
two young children at a Salvation Army shelter set up in the Canoga Park High 
School gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like the several thousand other quake victims spread out across the San 
Fernando Valley, the woman, who declined to give her name, has nowhere else to 
go. "My apartment is condemned. I hope they don't try to make me leave because 
we have nowhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
 From a post-quake high of nearly 20,000 people sleeping in parks and on cots 
and hard floors at recreation centers, churches, senior centers, Boys & Girls 
Clubs and other buildings that doubled as shelters, the number of earthquake 
refugees has dwindled to about 4,000, relief agencies officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to get people out of the shelters as quickly as possible by 
nudging them into service centers where we can give them rental vouchers, 
counseling and whatever else they need," said Felix Perez, a spokesman for the 
Red Cross. "It's important that we get people out of the tent cities and 
shelters quickly so people don't get used to living that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy appears to be working: while a high of 10,726 people slept at 35 
Red Cross shelters around the city on Jan. 24, just 3,724 people stayed at 29 
similar shelters Wednesday night. Hundreds more were still staying at private 
shelters run by the Salvation Army and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 255,728 people have registered for disaster relief -- ranging 
from rent vouchers to home-repair loans -- handed out by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency since the quake. Despite aid however, many left homeless by 
the quake continue to face problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Vineetha de Silva, 43, for example, and her husband, Anslem, and 19-year-old 
son, Asitha Niroshar, have qualified for a HUD housing voucher, but continue to 
live in a circus tent set up by Church on the Way on a field near its Van Nuys 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to an apartment yesterday and the manager said 'Sorry we are not 
accepting FEMA vouchers,' " de Silva said. "The main thing is that we have to 
find a home. We are not rich people." 
</P>
<P>
 And time is running out for the family. Phil Pump, director of volunteer 
ministries, said the church will close its tent city next week. Only 50 of the 
70 people living there will be guaranteed places at a Red Cross shelter at Van 
Nuys High School, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them don't want to look (for another place to live) just yet," Pump 
said. "They are getting comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the shelter at Canoga Park High School, officials also are gearing up to 
close down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our third set of people," said Lt. Mary Doss at the Salvation Army's 
shelter in the Canoga Park High School gym. "Most of the people who had been 
here earlier have found places. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people here now are waiting for a house to be painted or repaired or came 
from the parks. This is sort of the last phase." 
</P>
<P>
 That Salvation Army shelter is currently providing lodging to 500 people in 
the gym, down from 1,600 at the peak. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional problem faced by the shelters is determining which people were 
homeless even before the quake, and deciding what to do about them. Those 
previously homeless do not qualify for federal and other disaster assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a crew of red-jacketed Salvation Army volunteers moved inside the 
Canoga Park High gym, trying to separate earthquake victims from other homeless 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are definitely trying to take advantage of the situation, but 
we'll root them out," a volunteer said. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Winnetka Recreation Center's gigantic tent city that once was home 
to more than a thousand people, all that was left Thursday were a few workers 
loading cots onto trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the people that had been staying there "had homes they could go back 
to but were too afraid to," said Lt. Col. Pat Antosh, a National Guard 
spokeswoman. "But when it got rainy and cold, the number of people (at tent 
cities) went down dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ron Bott was giving the newly exposed ground the once-over with a 
metal detector. When asked what treasures he had found, he said, "Nickels, 
dimes, but mostly pennies. . . . I've only gotten about $1," which he said is 
less than the $3 or $4 he usually collects while sweeping area parks with his 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come to this park pretty often, mostly (people) drop jewelry and things 
like that. But there's nothing like that today . . . just some United Way 
pins."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: HIDDEN HILLS; DAMAGE FROM QUAKE SET AT $1.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake caused $1.5 million in damage to more than 100 homes in 
the tiny gated city of Hidden Hills, prompting some in the upscale community to 
apply for the same federal aid sought by residents of less affluent parts of 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've sent a lot of people to the (Federal Emergency Management Agency) 
centers," said Greg Robinson, Hidden Hills building official. "Just because the 
homes are expensive doesn't mean the people who live them don't need 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 The only home deemed uninhabitable had $500,000 in damage, and one declared 
partly unsafe had an estimated $400,000 in damage. Another 48 were deemed 
partly uninhabitable, mostly near cracked chimneys, with damage ranging from 
$500 to $50,000. All told, Robinson and other inspectors found damage at 119 
homes in Hidden Hills, where most residences cost between $500,000 and $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no significant damage to public property in the mostly residential 
enclave. But the planned start-up of an emergency response team in January was, 
ironically, postponed due to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very bad timing, I know," said James Doran, director of emergency services. 
"But maybe the earthquake will encourage more people to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 Doran said he had planned to recruit and train at least 15 residents of the 
city of about 2,000 in first aid and search-and-rescue techniques in late 
January, modeling the program after the Disaster Response Team in Agoura Hills. 
The program may begin this month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, extra volunteers were not needed Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 15 minutes of the magnitude 6.6 quake, Doran and three other volunteers 
began checking each of about 550 homes in Hidden Hills for injured residents, 
fires or other emergencies, but found none. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly, it was just a case of reassuring people who had come out of their 
homes and were sitting in their cars or standing around," Doran said. "There 
was some nervousness, but everyone was pretty much OK." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; HILLSIDE HOMES BEAR BRUNT OF QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like its neighbor, Encino, Tarzana was a pocket of relatively light damage 
resulting from the Jan. 17 temblor. But that doesn't mean it escaped the quake 
unscathed. Particularly hard hit were some of Tarzana's posh neighborhoods 
nestled up against slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the ground pushed upward and water mains broke, sending rivulets 
pouring down the steep hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Water caused severe damage along three steep blocks of Ellenita Avenue, where 
it undermined the pavement and created sink holes five to six feet deep, said 
Neil Spiva, Los Angeles street maintenance superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Conchita Way nearby was also damaged when the earth beneath it pushed upward, 
cracking the pavement, he said. Both streets are still in use, although 
Ellenita is only partially usable. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews have already begun filling in the sink holes. Repairs on Ellenita could 
take a month or more, Spiva said. Conchita should be fixed within the next 10 
days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most homes in Tarzana came through the quake all right, five houses 
in the 18800 block of Eldeen Drive were rendered uninhabitable when the slope 
beneath them appeared to have slipped during the quake, said Glenn Barr, deputy 
for City Councilman Marvin Braude. City building inspectors estimate the damage 
to these homes totals about $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Ventura Boulevard, several business in the 18800 and 18900 blocks were 
hard hit, according to Barr. Yellow limited-entry tags are posted on many of 
the shops in those areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest of Ventura Boulevard businesses were up and running shortly 
after the quake, according to Sandy Miller, president of the Tarzana Chamber of 
Commerce. But even their future may be grim: Many of Tarzana's boulevard shops 
were already suffering due to competition from Encino and Sherman Oaks shopping 
districts further east, Miller said. Loss of inventory and cost of structural 
repairs may leave many reeling for months to come, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tarzana campus of the Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center suffered only 
cosmetic damage and has remained fully operational, said hospital spokeswoman 
Janice Deutschman. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubhouse of the Braemar Country Club was closed for four days following 
the quake, but one golf course remained open in the quake's aftermath for those 
who simply had to putt their way through the crisis. JILL LEOVY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; RESIDENTS FEEL 'LUCKY' IN WAKE OF EARTHQUAKE 
</P>

 Northridge is famous for lending its name to the Jan. 17 earthquake, and 
Reseda for trying to take it away.  
</P>
<P>
 Arleta, on the other hand, is famous for managing to stay out of the 
post-temblor limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say there was no damage in this tiny community tucked between 
Mission Hills, Pacoima, Sun Valley and Panorama City. Arleta had its share of 
toppled walls and chimneys, shattered glass and cracked masonry. But damage 
wasn't spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came through pretty good," said John Maxon, a neighborhood activist who 
lost a 50-foot wall beside his home. "We're just lucky is all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arleta Chamber of Commerce estimates that businesses suffered about $1.5 
million in damage, said Hawley Smith, first vice president of the chamber, 
which conducted a door-to-door poll of more than 260 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses got hit harder in inventory than in structures," said Smith. 
Liquor stores fared the worst, he said, averaging losses of $10,000 to $20,000 
each. Most enterprises managed to recover well enough to open up within five 
days after the quake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residences experienced similar damage, according to chamber members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people we've talked to since, most of them had the same experience I 
had," said Smith. "A few things got tossed to the floor and broke." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxon theorized that the humble wood-frame construction of homes, many of 
which date to the 1950s, saved Arleta from more widespread destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the quake might have shaken Arleta out of its normal obscurity. 
Drivers who sped along the Simi Valley Freeway, north of Arleta, now find 
themselves traversing it on Osborne Street and Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith suspects Arleta won't be able to cash in on its position. "It could, 
if the people stop," he said. "But my guess is most people just go through."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; JUST ANOTHER SHAKE FOR HOME BUILT IN '98 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ray Shelly's house did just fine in the Northridge earthquake. But that comes 
as no surprise to him. After all, it weathered the 1992 Landers-Big Bear quakes 
pretty well. In fact, the clapboard farmhouse has held its own through 11 major 
temblors and thousands of aftershocks since it was built in 1898. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost two glass bulbs off the kitchen lights and I got a couple of small 
cracks, that's about it," said Shelly, 57, a member of the third Shelly 
generation to live in the Lake View Terrace home on Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandfather Michael Shelly built the first few rooms of the house in 1898, a 
year after moving down from Stockton. Over the years, the family kept adding 
rooms, settling on a seven-room house in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wood frame -- there's no stucco in it," Shelley said. "I imagine it 
flexed quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Several miles east of the quake's epicenter, Lake View Terrace flexed and 
shook but escaped the worst of the temblor's wrath, according to residents. 
Several houses were deemed unsafe, according to Phillis Hines, a longtime 
resident and member of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage isn't too obvious," Hines said. For example, the public address 
system in the community's recreation center will have to be repaired. And the 
interiors of homes look like most others in the Valley -- a tossed salad of 
furniture and housewares. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most disasters, the quake dwarfed other troubles. Before the temblor, 
residents complained about damage from the vibration of traffic on the Foothill 
Freeway and Foothill Boulevard. William Gohl, who was ready to battle Caltrans 
over cracks in his walls that he said were the result of those vibrations, now 
has too many fissures to count. He'll get a disaster loan and repair them all, 
he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I fight Caltrans, it's just going to be a whole tedious thing," Gohl said.

MOTHER PLEADS NO CONTEST TO LEAVING CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Reseda woman pleaded no contest Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of child 
abandonment for leaving her 18-month-old daughter in a shopping cart in a West 
Hills discount store. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of a plea bargain negotiated in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Hang 
Tran, 35, is not expected to serve any time in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement between Deputy Dist. Atty. Leonard J. Shaffer and Deputy 
Public Defender Elie Miller, Tran will be placed on probation for three years 
and will be ordered to seek psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want her to get well and to protect her children," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers will formally sentence Tran on March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, who has been beset with emotional problems since fleeing Vietnam nearly 
two decades ago, was arrested after shoppers found her daughter, Trinh, in the 
hardware section of the Target store in the Fallbrook Mall on Sept. 3, the day 
the toddler turned 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 A second daughter, now 9 months old, was not left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, wearing pants and a white sweat shirt with her hair pulled into a 
ponytail, appeared nervous and confused as she clutched a tissue. When Silvers 
asked Tran how she would plead, the defendant said "not guilty," words 
immediately echoed by her mother, Huong Nguyen, who was sitting in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller then consulted with Tran and her sister, Ha Tran, explaining that the 
no contest plea -- the equivalent of a guilty plea in criminal matters -- would 
be "in her best interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office originally charged Tran with two felony counts 
of child abandonment -- one charge for leaving the child alone, the second for 
having the intent to abandon the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Ha Tran said her sister is being treated at Metropolitan 
State Hospital in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The two children are currently being cared for by the parents of Tran's 
estranged husband in El Toro because the Tran residence was severely damaged in 
the Northridge earthquake. However, Ha Tran said the children would be 
returning to Reseda next week.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: FOR ROBERTI AND WELL-HEELED RIVAL, THE BUCKS DON'T STOP

 If money is the mother's milk of politics, as the late Jesse Unruh observed, 
then some San Fernando Valley-area politicians are doing very nicely, thank 
you, judging by recent campaign contribution reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandatory filings are flooding the countertops of the secretary of state's 
office this week in Sacramento, offering a glimpse into the campaign bank 
accounts of lawmakers as they enter the 1994 political year: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 OF ITALY, VOTES AND MONEY: One high-profile legislator with a long track 
record for successful fund raising is Democrat David A. Roberti, who is an 
unofficial candidate for state treasurer while he battles a movement to recall 
him from his Van Nuys Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti had $246,341 on hand as of Dec. 31, though campaign treasurer Shirley 
Wechsler of Studio City notes, of course, that "monies have come in since 
then." The figure also doesn't include the hefty sums Roberti will have to 
raise for his Beat the Recall campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, however, it would appear that Roberti's main Democratic 
challenger, Sacramento developer Phil Angelides, is sitting even prettier. 
Angelides, the former head of the California Democratic Party, started the year 
with $1.1 million on hand -- and promises to give Roberti a run for his money. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Angelides may not have the same expenses as Roberti. The filings 
reveal that, last August, Roberti put his money where his mouth is by loaning 
$5,000 to the L.A. School Breakup Committee, a local group formed to get the 
issue on the ballot. Sensing the Valley's fervor for breaking off from the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, the state senator has carried the flag in 
Sacramento and vows to continue doing so this year. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last six months of 1993, Roberti's campaign committee also paid 
more than $9,000 for a weeks-long visit to Italy for what went on the books as 
an "official Senate trip." Accompanied by an entourage of three other senators 
and a Senate staff member, Roberti and his wife, June, flew to Rome to 
encourage foreign investment in California, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator also shelled out $16,000 to Calabasas political pollster Arnold 
Steinberg, who helped Roberti study whether to enter the race for a Los Angeles 
County supervisor's seat. The upshot? It would be too costly and bruising. 
</P>

 HE JUST KEEPS GOING, AND GOING . . .: In the Assembly, one of the big 
fund-raisers of the area's delegation was Glendale Republican Pat Nolan, who 
attracted $203,236 in campaign contributions during the second half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of Nolan's war chest these days is being diverted to San Francisco 
attorney Ephraim Margolin, who is defending the 15-year assemblyman against 
federal charges stemming from the FBI's long-running Capitol corruption probe. 
From July to December, 1993, Nolan ran up about $200,000 in legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan was indicted last April on six counts of racketeering, extortion, 
conspiracy and money laundering for allegedly using his office to glean 
campaign contributions from special interests. He is scheduled to go on trial 
with state Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial or no trial, Nolan's campaign filings show that the assemblyman enjoys 
some heavy-duty support that doesn't seem to fade when the going gets tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed among his contributors are a number of fellow GOP officeholders -- Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich included. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributor Joseph Jacobs, the president of Jacobs Engineering in Pasadena, 
says there's no reason for supporters to be squeamish about donating money to 
Nolan. "I find Pat to be a very compassionate man and a man of great integrity. 
I've gotten his side of the story and it all hangs together as far as I'm 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs himself contributed $36,500 to Nolan's campaign committee in 1993. 
Today, Nolan is expected to announce he'll seek re-election. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HE DID IT HIS WAY: One of the thinnest campaign-disclosure files plopped down 
this week at the secretary of state's office was that of state Sen. Tom Hayden, 
whose district spills over the Santa Monica Mountains into the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in his second year of a four-year term, Hayden is not exactly flush with 
cash. In fact, as of the first of the year, Hayden's campaign committee had 
just $843 on hand and the only contribution it received in the last half of 
1993 was a $5,000 loan from the politician himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Outstanding debts were tallied at $637,142 -- again, money that Hayden 
personally loaned his campaign committee. Some Capitol observers wryly note 
that Hayden can well afford it, thanks to a divorce settlement from actress 
Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 While the liberal Democrat would like to be reimbursed someday, said Hayden 
spokesman Duane Peterson, he takes a certain measure of comfort in the fact 
that "he is beholden only to himself." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to distance himself from special interests, Hayden -- along with 
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) -- has signed Common Cause's 
pledge to refrain from asking lobbyists for money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CATCHING UP: Two other area lawmakers are expected to formally declare their 
candidacies for statewide office later this month. State Sen. Cathie Wright, 
the Simi Valley Republican whose district includes portions of Canoga Park, 
Chatsworth and Northridge, started the year with about $7,000 on hand for her 
race for lieutenant governor, according to campaign statements. Wright 
collected $71,000 in contributions in the filing period ending Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But the campaign documents tell only part of the story, said John Theiss, 
Wright's campaign spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Christmas week, when Wright announced her candidacy, "money has been 
coming in from throughout the state of California and she's well on her way to 
some exciting numbers," Theiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, he said, Wright has about $160,000 on hand for the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 She has a long road ahead of her, however. The Democratic contender in the 
lieutenant governor's race is state Controller Gray Davis, who started the year 
with $1.9 million on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A FRIEND IN NEED: Assemblyman Burt Margolin, who has set his sights on the 
California insurance commissioner's office, is the other Valley-area politician 
who expects to announce his candidacy for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, a member of the Democratic inner circle led by U.S. Reps. Howard 
Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), had $324,323 on hand 
as of Dec. 31, having collected $365,021 during the last six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrating the loyalty of the Berman-Waxman clan, Margolin's campaign 
treasury got a boost from fellow Democrat Barbara Friedman of Van Nuys, who -- 
having decided to sit tight and forgo a run for the Senate -- dedicated $20,000 
to her pal.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; UNITED WAY ISSUES RELIEF GRANTS TO AGENCIES; 
EMERGENCY: GREATER L.A. CHAPTER GIVES $424,000 TO 44 GROUPS HELPING QUAKE 
VICTIMS. IT WILL ALSO GIVE $200,000 TO AMERICAN RED CROSS.

<P>
 The United Way of Greater Los Angeles has distributed $424,000 in relief 
grants to 44 area nonprofit agencies that are providing emergency services to 
victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer organization also will provide $200,000 in new funding to the 
American Red Cross, raising the total amount the United Way has donated to the 
agency since the Jan. 17 earthquake to $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 44 nonprofit agencies, the largest amount was a $31,720 grant given to 
the Santa Clarita Child and Family Development Center, which plans to expand 
its counseling and outreach services for earthquake victims by working with the 
Red Cross, state Department of Mental Health and several Santa Clarita Valley 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money came in at the right time," said Carol Gelsinger, the center's 
director of administration. "One therapist said she has seen 41 families in 
three days." 
</P>
<P>
 The other recipients Wednesday included the San Fernando Valley Interfaith 
Council, which will expand its services for elderly quake victims with its 
$19,600 grant; the Samuel Dixon Family Health Care Center in Val Verde, which 
saw its client load triple after the earthquake and which received $17,640 to 
hire additional counselors, and the Home Visitation Center in Pacoima, which 
received $7,900. The visitation center, which provides food and housing, and 
employment referrals to poor Latinos, has seen its caseload increase 100% in 
the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United Way grants will enable us to buy more food for people who have 
lost their jobs and their homes, and to hire an assistant to help us reach the 
elderly who are afraid to leave their homes and who have no transportation to 
come to the center for help," said Carol Reyes, the Home Visitation Center's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 An ad hoc committee made up of community volunteers and United Way staff 
members evaluated grant requests submitted by 88 agencies and approved half. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the agencies said they needed the grants to keep up with a drastic 
increase in caseloads since the earthquake, and to repair the damage to their 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for the grants came from the United Way's Earthquake Relief Fund, 
which has received about $928,000 in donations from companies such as Arco and 
IBM, and from private donors. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way of Greater Los Angeles, itself a nonprofit organization, helps 
support more than 300 health and human service agencies in the area, including 
nine chapters of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit card contributions to the United Way Earthquake Relief Fund can be made 
by calling (800) 600-1830. Checks can be mailed to the agency's office at 621 
S. Virgil Ave., Los Angeles, CA, 90005-4046.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DISTRICT HOPES TO REOPEN HIGH SCHOOLS BY FEB. 
15; EDUCATION: STATE SPEEDS UP TIMETABLE TO DELIVER PORTABLE CLASSROOMS TO EL 
CAMINO REAL AND KENNEDY CAMPUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles school district officials said Thursday that they have been 
assured by the state that portable classrooms will be installed at El Camino 
Real and John F. Kennedy high schools in time to open both campuses Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials had predicted that both schools would not reopen until 
March, but the state -- which is providing the portable classrooms to the 
district -- has speeded up its timetable for delivering the bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
 And although school district officials have liberalized transfer rules for the 
5,000 students at Kennedy and El Camino, they said Thursday that they expect 
95% of the students will wait for their regular school to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a temporary situation to provide flexibility to reduce the anxiety 
and tension on the students and their families," Associate Supt. Dan Isaacs 
said. "I would say that at least 95% of the students . . . will remain 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Area schools reported dozens of inquiries from parents who said they would not 
wait to send their children to school, although only a handful have so far made 
a switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flood gates have been opened but the water is not coming through," said 
Ronald Berz, principal at Taft High School in Woodland Hills. "We have had a 
lot of inquiries and right now we were able to accommodate and program those 
students that came in today. The parents seem very happy that they're getting 
their kids in a school setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve students from El Camino have so far enrolled at Taft, Berz said. 
Because phone lines are still down at El Camino, his office has fielded more 
than 60 calls from parents inquiring about transfer procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills High School enrolled five Kennedy students Thursday and 
registered three the day before, Granada Hills Principal Kathleen Rattay said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Wednesday that students displaced by the quake may 
transfer to any Los Angeles Unified school that has room for them, although the 
district will not add bus routes to displaced students. Students who switch are 
expected to finish the semester at the new school, then return to their regular 
school in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that quite a few are considering it," said Dick Browning, 
director of the district's senior high school division. "We're not promoting 
this as a primary solution to the problem, we're offering it as a possible 
solution for some individual situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Las Virgenes Unified and other surrounding districts said their 
classrooms are already full, so they are unable to accept students even if Los 
Angeles officials were willing to allow their students to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows students to transfer to another district only with the 
permission of their home district and only if the district they choose has room 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the quake struck Jan. 17, several nearby districts called and 
offered to help Los Angeles find room for its displaced students. However, the 
offers were for classroom space for the big district to use, not for students 
to transfer into. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, many private schools in the San Fernando Valley area said they 
already are full. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacs also announced that Van Gogh Street School students will be relocated 
to Frost Middle School and that classes will start there Feb. 15. An 
orientation meeting for parents will be held at Frost on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is conducting a geological study of the soil under Van Gogh 
because the earthquake left cracks and fissures throughout the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is also busing about 160 children from Red Cross shelters to 
their local schools, Isaacs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own feeling is that we want to do the best we can to accommodate students 
who have been traumatized or who need this kind of support system," said 
Rattay, at Granada Hills High. "On the other hand, for most students, it would 
probably be best to be patient, wait until Kennedy opens, be with their friends 
and the teachers they know."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CHILDREN'S SLEEP STILL DISTURBED BY QUAKE; 
STRESS: PANEL OF PEDIATRICIANS SAY THEY ARE TREATING A LARGE NUMBER OF 
YOUNGSTERS WHO REMAIN TOO FRIGHTENED TO GO TO BED ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Earthquake aftershocks may be tapering off, but area pediatricians say they 
are still treating an unusually large number of young children too frightened 
to sleep normally. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to resuming normal sleep patterns and easing children's post-quake stress 
is quickly settling back into normal routines, according to several doctors who 
attended a panel discussion for physicians in Encino on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen pediatricians took part in the support panel, which was 
sponsored by the University Children's Medical Group. Many of them said they've 
been getting frequent calls from parents concerned that, more than two weeks 
after the fact, their children still seem reluctant to sleep alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ask, 'Are they going to be in my bed forever? How do I get them out?' " 
said Susan Brauner-Tatum, a licensed clinical social worker at Childrens 
Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brauner-Tatum was one of a panel of mental-health professionals who advised 
the pediatricians on ways to handle a deluge of new earthquake-related problems 
in children, including stomachaches, nightmares, increased insecurity and fears 
of returning indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Young children are particularly likely to suffer emotional problems weeks 
after the quake because they are less capable of understanding and articulating 
their fears, the panelists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the advice they gave was grounded in common sense: Return as quickly 
as possible to normal patterns of life; listen patiently to children's fears, 
and remember that children's behavior will often reflect the emotional strain 
they detect in their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the doctors said the quake has prompted them to alter time-honored 
parenting advice. Toddlers too scared to sleep alone shouldn't be made to tough 
it out, they said. "This situation calls for a little more sympathy," said 
Tarzana pediatrician Howard Mendelson. "The fears these kids have are not 
unrealistic. They're real." 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists told the doctors to tell parents to gently ease their children back 
into pre-quake sleeping habits -- waiting by their bedsides until they go to 
sleep, for example, or actually sleeping with them in their own rooms until the 
child is comfortable enough to be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should still try to exert pressure to get them back to their own beds. 
There's a delicate balance between sympathy and indulgence," said Mendelson, 
adding that he has been getting about four calls a day from parents concerned 
about children's sleeping habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists stressed that parents should not be too quick to assume their 
child's problems following the quake will persist. 
</P>
<P>
 Nightmares, clinginess and earthquake games are all normal reactions, and 
don't necessarily mean that a child is showing signs of post-traumatic stress 
and in need of treatment, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only if the symptoms seem to preempt normal functioning and persist for months 
should parents assume their child needs psychiatric help, they said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE SCHOOLS EXPANSION DELAYED; EDUCATION: 
DISTRICT'S K-12 PLAN MAY BE POST- PONED UNTIL 1997 BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH 
SIGNATURES WERE COLLECTED TO GET PROPOSAL ON BALLOT.

<P>
 Palmdale School District's plan to expand into a K-12 district may take a year 
or two longer than projected. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Thursday that less than one-third of the required 
6,000-plus signatures needed to get the expansion proposal on the ballot have 
been collected. 
</P>
<P>
 The K-8 district's original plan was to have collected enough signatures by 
the end of the year so the formal approval process could have begun last month. 
If that had occurred, voters could have decided the issue in November with the 
expansion beginning July 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 A best-case scenario now has the district realizing its K-12 expansion no 
sooner than July 1, 1996, and possibly even in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they want to expand their education responsibilities 
to include high school to better meet the needs of students. They want high 
schools with lower enrollments and classes with fewer students than those now 
offered by the Antelope Valley Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers gathered fewer than 2,000 signatures since the petition drive was 
kicked off in mid-November, according to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district needs signatures of 25% of the registered voters in its borders. 
Once the signatures are verified, the proposal goes before the County Committee 
on School District Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county approves, the proposal will be forwarded to the state Department 
of Education, which evaluates the proposal based on a series of factors, 
including racial impact and increased state costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will have the ultimate say on the expansion of the Palmdale School 
District from K-8 to K-12 education.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; INMATES HURT RESISTING CELL, BODY SEARCHES; 
CORRECTIONS: FOUR WERE HOSPITALIZED FOR INJURIES IN THE PROCESS, WHICH YIELDED 
A CARVED PLASTIC KNIFE, OFFICIALS SAY.

 Four inmates serving time at the state prison here were hospitalized with 
injuries they suffered after resisting body and cell searches, prison officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 So far only one of the four inmates who were hospitalized Wednesday has been 
discharged and returned to the California State Prison Los Angeles County. 
Prison officials identified the prisoners as Alvin Dennis, Paul Portillo, 
Nicolas Romero and Jimmy McKinney. McKinney was released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison spokesman Kenn I. Hicks said the inmates were injured during 
Wednesday's search of the prison's administrative segregation unit, where 
inmates facing an administrative action are held in one- and two-person cells. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-hour search was conducted after officials received information that 
"there was a manufactured weapon in one of the cells," Hicks said. The weapon 
turned out to be "some type of plastic sharpened into a point to be used as a 
stabbing weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 "Inmates make manufactured weapons out of just about everything they can 
find," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 159 inmates held in the 100-cell unit Wednesday, 49 resisted the search 
of their cells and bodies, Hicks said. A team of corrections officers had to 
physically remove the inmates from their cells in what the prison describes as 
"extractions." 
</P>
<P>
 The four inmates suffered minor to moderate injuries when they resisted the 
extraction, Hicks said, added that it is believed that the officers acted 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time we don't have any indication there was excessive force," he 
said. "Any time we have a cell extraction, an incident report is written up and 
reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
 A weapons-possession charge will be filed against the inmate who had the 
plastic weapon, Hicks said. The 49 inmates who resisted the search will face 
disciplinary action for not complying with instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said he is not aware that any other weapons were found during the 
search.

 Jurisprudence  
</P>
<P>
 Closing arguments in Jim Huffman's wrongful termination trial will be heard 
Monday morning in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, after which the 
jury will begin deliberating. 
</P>

 Huffman, the former Cal State Fullerton volleyball coach who is seeking $1.2 
million in damages against the school, was the final witness to testify in the 
two-week-old trial Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He claims he was fired on March 23, 1992, in retaliation for speaking out 
against the school's poor gender equity record and initiating successful legal 
proceedings, which resulted in negative publicity to administrators and the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 University administrators, who deny retaliation was a motive in Huffman's 
termination, claim Huffman was fired because of substandard performance, and 
that the decision was made in the fall of 1991. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

HOWARD ROSENBERG: A CHIP OFF THE SAME OLD BLOCK; TELEVISION: WILL ELECTRONIC 
TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BLACK OUT VIOLENT PROGRAMS REALLY HAVE ANY IMPACT ON 
REAL-LIFE VIOLENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be nice if television sets were equipped with electronic chips that 
automatically rejected everything and everyone found to be annoying: most 
infomercials, certain newscasts, Dick Vitale, Rush Limbaugh, Richard Simmons, 
Mr. Blackwell, Tom and Roseanne getting high on themselves. Pick your peeve. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the public appears interested only in vetoing violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it's the "V" chip that's on the slab here for dissection -- proposed 
technology that would repel entertainment programs labeled violent. 
</P>
<P>
 In a feeble move to buy time and placate critics, broadcast and cable-TV 
companies this week said they would form an independent monitoring board to 
measure and periodically report on violence in entertainment programming.  
</P>
<P>
 Even with "independent" observers in the mix, these annual state of the 
industry messages would have a serious credibility problem. "Trust us to do the 
right thing," the TV people seem to be saying. That would be naive, to say the 
least. The trustworthiness of an industry in which two networks (CBS and Fox) 
are greedily rushing projects onto the air to capitalize on the unresolved 
Menendez case speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, however, the cable industry also agreed to begin rating 
its programs and to support proposed legislation that would require new 
television sets to have an electronic chip that, if the owner wanted, would 
block out programs that had been encoded with a "V" (for violence) rating. (Of 
course, the "V" chip essentially would be worthless if the rest of the industry 
did not join the cable companies in rating programs, and the networks are on 
record as opposing the idea, fearing the ratings would scare off some 
advertisers.) 
</P>
<P>
 A prediction: Even if the "V" chip were enacted with the cooperation of the 
entire TV industry, resulting in a dramatic decline in violent programming, it 
would have virtually no impact on the level of real-life violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Capitol Hill's anti-crime bandwagon is practically collapsing under 
the weight of politicians seeking to blame television for some of the nation's 
problems, this is a cynical, quick-fix strategy that will yield few actual 
benefits. If they were really serious about protecting the health of Americans 
through legislation, these Big Brothers could do a lot more good by banning 
cigarette smoking. (Yes, yes, to say nothing about cracking down further on 
guns.) 
</P>
<P>
 But what the heck. If this is what the public wants instead of merely being 
able to switch channels -- if this will be the defining test of whether TV 
violence causes or contributes to real-life violence -- why not give it a try? 
Why not a law, for example, that not only covers the "V" chip but also combines 
it with mandatory violence ratings? What would be the harm? At the very least 
it would temporarily shut up some of TV's more self-serving critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks and cable companies would do their own rating, and of course 
there would be inevitable disputes about the accuracy of their labels. What 
rating would be applied to shows, for example, that aren't explicitly violent 
but create an atmosphere of terror? And what about "The Simpsons," within which 
there is frequently a satirical cartoon segment, titled "The Itchy and Scratchy 
Show," that's as violent as anything on television? Would "The Simpsons" be 
stamped "V" and get swept away in the wash of live-action violence rejected by 
the electronic chip? 
</P>
<P>
 One possible remedy to that dilemma would be a rating system with several 
levels of "V" to accommodate these shades of difference, which is 
technologically possible, according to the office of Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), 
the House telecommunications subcommittee chairman who has initiated one of the 
"V" chip bills being pressed on Capitol Hill. In any case, having the industry 
wield its own "V" would keep the federal government out of program content. 
Thus, no censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the argument that a "V" chip would conflict with the First Amendment, 
it's hard to see how. No one's freedom of expression would be violated any more 
than the Playboy Channel's rights are diminished by those cable viewers who 
choose not to subscribe to it. Instead, parents and other viewers merely would 
be exercising their own rights to shield their homes from that expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Another criticism: Cross one line and it's an even shorter step to the next 
one. With a "V" in place, how many chips off the old block? How long before the 
emergence of mandatory chips in conjunction with such other ratings as "S" for 
sex, "N" for nudity and "L" for language? Perhaps not very long. But again, 
what would be the harm? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this is all futuristic. If "V" chip legislation were enacted today, 
it would take at least a decade, probably two, to sell enough of the newly 
equipped sets and allow the system to operate long enough to draw even some 
preliminary conclusions about the technology's impact. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if nothing was proved, it wouldn't matter. By then, there will be new 
bandwagons.

Q&A WITH PATRICK DUFFY; 'IT'S A JOB . . . LIKE GOLDEN HANDCUFFS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Duffy is quite literally a "working actor." He's toiled consistently 
on television since making a splash as the web-footed super-hero Mark Harris on 
the 1977-78 NBC series "The Man From Atlantis."  
</P>
<P>
 After that show folded, he moved to "Dallas" and spent 13 years -- minus a 
hiatus he took during the 1985-86 season -- playing J.R.'s good brother, Bobby 
Ewing, on the phenomenally popular CBS series. For the past three seasons, 
Duffy has starred with Suzanne Somers in ABC's family sitcom "Step by Step," 
which is part of the network's popular Friday night comedy lineup.  
</P>
<P>
 In this '90s version of "The Brady Bunch," Duffy, 44, plays Frank Lambert, a 
freewheeling contractor with three kids, who is married to a widowed beautician 
(Somers), who also has three offspring. Married in real life to Carlyn Duffy, a 
former ballerina with the First Chamber Dance Company of New York, the 
Montana-born actor is the father of two sons, Padraic, an 18-year-old sophomore 
at Princeton, and 13-year-old Connor.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Are you amazed at your longevity on television? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I've worked consistently for 18 years. Every day, I just consider 
myself extremely fortunate. First of all, part of my daily routine as a 
Buddhist is that I chant for an hour and a half in the morning, from 4:30 until 
6 o'clock. What's going through my mind is how lucky I am. I truly appreciate 
my family and the consistency of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You are the only regular from "Dallas" who went right into another series. 
Did you think of taking any time off between "Dallas" and "Step by Step"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I never wanted to take time off. I guess if I have any theory about 
working, it's just to keep working. I don't consider myself an "artist." I 
approach work as a labor -- a really joyful labor. I was off seven days from 
"Man From Atlantis" when I got "Dallas," and I was off 14 days between "Dallas" 
and the time I signed for "Step by Step." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think this show will become a cult sensation like the '70s 
blended-family series "The Brady Bunch"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, for the reason that "The Brady Bunch" was a different kind of show. It 
was, in essence, the trendsetter. We have our following, but it's not addictive 
to people who watch it. They watch us because we are part of a lineup that's 
good family viewing. They feel comfortable watching us. Q: "Step by Step's" 
young fans probably never saw "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
 A: My wife always jokes that all my fans now are under 3 feet tall. Young 
people come up to me, I mean really young, and say, "Are you Frank Lambert?" I 
realize they have no idea I was Bobby Ewing. I can literally, as people 
approach me, tell what generation of viewers they have come from. I don't feel 
that old, but I realize I cover three generations of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Step by Step" is in its third season and performs well in the ratings. But 
it's sort of a hidden hit. It doesn't get the attention of "Dallas" and never 
receives Emmys. Has the lack of recognition been difficult for you after being 
on such a high-profile show as "Dallas"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Even "Dallas" was a hidden hit. "Dallas" won two Emmys. One was for film 
editing; there's a biggie. Barbara Bel Geddes won, I think the second year of 
the show, and that was because she was a great film star doing a TV show. We 
were the No. 1 show, God knows, for how many years in a row, but you couldn't 
win an award. So I learned long ago that that kind of recognition, as good as 
it is, is not why I go to work. I go to work because somebody asked me to work. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were to have left "Dallas" and said the next thing I want to do is 
something that gets that degree of recognition, then you take a whole different 
approach to what you pick as work. To be quite honest, with rare exceptions, 
those shows don't stay on the air. My raison d'etre is to work. That's why I 
looked at everything that was offered me the minute "Dallas" was off the air 
and I took something. I go to work with the best of what's available and then I 
will make that my job. This is the best job I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I get to work with Suzanne. This year, I get to direct 10 episodes. (He 
also directed 30 "Dallas" episodes.) It's a huge cast show. I think if I had to 
be really honest with myself, the stars of the show, in terms of the viewing 
audience, are the young kids. Suzanne and I are like old, well-known warhorses. 
I think we served a purpose when the show started. When you say Suzanne Somers 
and Patrick Duffy, then it added credence to the show. But I don't think they 
consider it to be "The Suzanne Somers-Patrick Duffy Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And that's OK with you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure. It's a job. It's like golden handcuffs -- golden, mink-lined 
handcuffs. It's like the most regular, wonderful job. I get to be a regular 
dad. I live in the (San Fernando) Valley. I drive my son to school every 
morning and the school is five minutes from the studio. I'm home for dinner 
every single night. I told Suzanne at the first table reading for the pilot, 
"I'm ordering eight years for this show. At the end of eight years, I'll be 50 
years old and I'll be ready to retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You want to retire at that young an age? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Basically. This is something our family has talked about. I'll retire if 
there is no work. I don't want to become one of those people who hangs around 
the industry trying to get something going to match their past successes. We 
have our place in Oregon and as soon as this show is over, if I have to wait 
more than 14 days for my next series, I might as well just go to Oregon.

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS ONE RATES TOP BILLING

 Duke schmuke. Go on, make UCLA No. 1 again. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no idea how good North Carolina looked Thursday night against top-dog 
Duke, but it couldn't have looked any better than UCLA did against USC. 
Whatever bad things the Tar Heels went and done to their Blue Devil basketball 
rivals from just down the tarry two-lane blacktop, I don't much care. Because 
the Bruins went out and did even worse things to their Trojan rivals from just 
down the quakey-shaky freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 They made it look easy, 101-72, in this latest episode of Late Night at Pauley 
Pavilion. Shon Tarver and the Flying O'Bannon Brothers swooped to the hoop, 
Tyus Edney stole everything but the Trojans' ugly socks, the ZZ-Top tandem of 
centers George Zidek and Rodney Zimmerman dominated the paint and another 
generous donation was made by UCLA's freshly minted freshman, Cameron $. 
</P>
<P>
 Number 2 in the country? Number 4? 
</P>
<P>
 Looked like a No. 1 team to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a cold day at Cal, this was one of the really impressive efforts of 
the season by the Bruins, as well as a timely one, in case anybody east of 
Westwood was curious whether Jim Harrick's title contenders would fall apart 
after their first defeat. Trust me, they did not. They were so far ahead so 
fast, USC Coach George Raveling called time 2:13 into the contest. No wonder 
George continued to vote UCLA first in the polls, even after last week's dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, being beaten by Cal is something that happens even to the best of 
teams. Ask Arizona's players. Ask the 1993 Duke squad. Tearful Todd Bozeman has 
such a fine squad up there, he might not need a handkerchief during this year's 
NCAA tournament. Coach Bozeman got so weepy last March after a question about 
his predecessor, Lou Campanelli, you would have thought somebody had just 
stolen Jason Kidd's puppy. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an up year for the Pac-10, so winning the conference title will not be 
any more of a snap than winning the NCAA championship will be. Even so, if the 
Bruins can keep their game at a fever pitch, the way they played Thursday, they 
don't have to be afraid of any of those clubs 3,000 miles away in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 They trailed USC for, oh, a few seconds. Mark Boyd rebounded and scored in 
midair, all in one motion, and the Trojans on the bench beside Raveling all 
stood and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, they mostly sat. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek dunked. Ed O'Bannon pumped. Charles O'Bannon stole the ball and found 
Tarver downcourt, open like Jerry Rice. An in-bounds pass was pilfered by 
Edney, who forwarded it to Ed O'Bannon, who jammed. Scarcely more than two 
minutes were gone, but Raveling, standing with his hands folded into a T, 
already could see the writing on the Pauley wall. This game was over . 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't tell his players that, of course. Burt Harris, a broad-beamed 
sophomore guard who is built like a garment bag, scored from the lane. And then 
Boyd got a layup off an in-bounds play, and the Trojans quickly made the score 
8-6. But a minute or two later, it was 17-6 and the most interesting thing 
thereafter was watching John Wooden in the bleachers, chatting with Sidney 
Wicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all for the Bruins, they didn't coast through the second half. Last 
time I saw them in person, they had looked just as good for a half against 
North Carolina State, only to act a little lazy after halftime and let the game 
get tight. Harrick wasn't too happy with that one. That night in Greensboro, 
N.C., he must have had a moment or two wondering if his players would have 
difficulty keeping their focus. 
</P>
<P>
 But all had gone well, at least until the Cal game. Not too many teams could 
have handled Kidd that day, and nobody expected UCLA to go undefeated anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 No coach, though, can be sure how a team will react to its first defeat. 
Harrick said before Thursday's game, "Now we'll find out what we're made of." 
</P>
<P>
 No, USC found out what UCLA's made of. 
</P>
<P>
 This game was a laugher, even to the point of Ed O'Bannon literally laughing 
aloud after a shot from a crazy angle somehow found its way into the basket, 
making the score 32-16. Nothing could wipe the smiles off the Bruins' faces 
after that, not even Zidek's awkward left-handed imitation of Lew Alcindor -- 
the season's first air hook -- or a flurry before the halftime buzzer in which 
UCLA players misfired from every possible angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't much matter what they tried tonight," Raveling said later. "Pretty 
much whatever they did worked." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA played like a team that ranks above anybody's anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Or should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Or will be.

PHOENIX HIRES RYAN; PRO FOOTBALL: COMBATIVE FORMER OILER ASSISTANT GETS 
FOUR-YEAR CONTRACT TO TAKE CARDINALS TO 'NEXT LEVEL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Desperate to end a tradition of dull futility, the Phoenix Cardinals Thursday 
ignored conventional wisdom and turned the franchise over to Buddy Ryan, one of 
the most combustible and charismatic coaches the NFL has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who has punched a fellow assistant coach and presided over some of the 
angriest defenses of recent times, became the team's coach and general manager 
after two days of interviews with owner Bill Bidwill. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, 59, leaves the Houston Oilers after a tumultuous one-year term as 
defensive coordinator that produced a feud with offensive coordinator Kevin 
Gilbride and a defense that helped fashion 11 consecutive victories at the end 
of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Ryan's pressure defense, Houston led the league in interceptions (26) 
and sacks (52), but the Oilers were defeated by Joe Montana and the Kansas City 
Chiefs in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan was given a four-year, multimillion-dollar contract at Phoenix. Ryan 
replaces Joe Bugel, who was fired as coach on Jan. 24 after a 7-9 season in 
which he failed to deliver on an ultimatum by Bidwill to produce a winner, and 
former general manager Larry Wilson, who resigned in December. 
</P>
<P>
 In four years under Bugel, the Cardinals never won more than seven games and 
did not come close to reaching postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a winner in town," Ryan said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bidwill, who has seen attendance at Sun Devil Stadium fall appreciably 
since moving the franchise there from St. Louis in 1988, it was the combination 
of Ryan's trademark, attacking '46' defense, his solid record as a personnel 
man and his ability to stir fan interest that proved decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said we want to reach the next level," Bidwill said. "Buddy Ryan has 
been to the next level. I anticipate he will take us there." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Ryan coached the Philadelphia Eagles from 1986-1991, and the 
Eagles made the playoffs in each of his last three seasons. But his stormy 
relationship with owner Norman Braman and the team's inability to win a playoff 
game led to his firing after the '91 season. 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, Ryan was unable to put together an offense that could be 
successful in the playoffs and never made an attempt to subordinate his ego to 
that of the strong-willed Braman, who considered Ryan's outspokenness a form of 
mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were 43-35-1 under Ryan, whose draft selections included Pro 
Bowlers Seth Joyner, Clyde Simmons, Fred Barnett and Eric Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are any real good football players here, they're going to want to 
play for Buddy Ryan," Ryan said in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 In Houston, Ryan won raves for his sack-producing defense, but ignited 
controversy when his disgust at Gilbride's run-and-shoot offense boiled over to 
a nationally televised Jan. 2 sideline incident in which Ryan threw a punch at 
Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals made their move after the Washington Redskins hired Dallas 
Cowboy offensive coordinator Norv Turner, who reportedly was offered the same 
Phoenix job of coach and general manager for $700,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't know that they didn't get him, and I don't really care," said 
Ryan, whose salary was not disclosed. "I mean, I knew Norv when he was a 
receivers coach with the Rams. I think I've got a better job than he's got." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan first won fame -- and made headlines for battling his fellow coaches and 
superiors -- when he was defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears under Mike 
Ditka.

COMMENTARY; STORY IS SO BIG IT'S RIGHT OUT OF DUMPSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 What don't we have on Tonya Harding? 
</P>
<P>
 How about perspective, for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in this city of satellite dishes, roving mobs of cameras, press stakeouts 
in a dozen places; here, where lawyers now have PR flacks and where improbable 
small-town characters are wondering who will play their part in the movies; 
here, where tabloid gossip is hardly distinguishable from what appears in the 
columns of America's so-called serious newspapers; here, where the contents of 
a garbage dumpster are transformed straight-faced into news . . . well, here, 
no optics yet fashioned by humans could possibly bend the blinding light of the 
Tonya Harding caper into anything resembling perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 So I took a breather from the story and called to chat with a far-off friend, 
an Alaska wilderness guide and dog musher, a man with a steel grip on the 
basics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me," he said, instantly. "How is this story really going down?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then I spoke to a sober-sided author I admire in New England. He came to the 
phone puffing from shoving snow off his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want everything! I've been out of it too long. I need a fix," he began. 
</P>
<P>
 You are kidding me. You want more ? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the mythology of journalism holds that by getting into the locker 
room, reporters see things that other people do not. My place is not to spoil 
it for everyone and say this is seldom the case. 
</P>
<P>
 So then, what do the notebooks reveal? 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers, don't let your children grow up to be newsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that age-old fear of modern American life: Snagged out of the blue by 
the lawyers -- sued by a neighbor, charged with a petty crime, somehow hauled 
off to court, bludgeoned with writs and depositions, and made to endure months 
or years of slow-moving judicial anguish? Forget it. The courtroom here is the 
only island of reason and calm in very stormy, polluted waters. And God help 
you when you step outside room 208 of the Multnomah County Courthouse and end 
up facing the 18-inch guns of the live-at-five crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack! Oh, Excuse me. Whack! No excuse me. Uumph. Ow. Damn! Look out. Excuse 
me. Here he comes! Wham! Oops. Golly. Amateur athletics. The Olympics. American 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 This conversation I can vouch for: 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter No. 1: "It's everything that's wrong with America, greed, paranoia, 
violence, lust for gossip, egomania." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter No. 2: "I know. That's why I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the myths of journalism is that it's supposed to make sense of 
things. Will I be spoiling it for anyone to suggest that so far we're perhaps a 
little weak in this regard? 
</P>
<P>
 Or am I dense? Is there real significance to the report that a TV station 
learned from anonymous sources that investigators were checking a call made on 
Tonya Harding's telephone credit card from Detroit to the Oregon residence of 
her not-for-real bodyguard Shawn Eckardt sometime during the U.S. National 
Figure Skating Championships? In case you missed it, that was big news for a 
few hours earlier in the week. I guess it was supposed to implicate Harding in 
something nefarious -- most everything seems to lean that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Or how about this from the FBI files of the interrogation of Tonya Harding: 
</P>
<P>
 "At 3:03 p.m., it was suggested that a break be taken, and HARDING stated she 
was hungry. Agent Russell asked HARDING what she would like to eat, and she 
stated she wanted a turkey sandwich on sourdough with tomatoes, onions, cheddar 
or American cheese, and extra mayonnaise, and a cup of coffee with extra 
cream." 
</P>
<P>
 Nutritional secrets of champions. 
</P>
<P>
 What diabolical impulses could such a diet trigger? 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, have you ever actually read an FBI report? 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder this investigation is taking so long. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is verbatim from Page 37 of the interrogation, punctuated just 
the way the FBI does it: 
</P>
<P>
 "HARDING said at the time that she did recall stopping at the Minit Mart, 
where GILLOOLY bought cigarettes. She said that after buying the cigarettes, 
GILLOOLY drove his pickup, with HARDING in it, south on Southeast 112th past 
ECKARDT's house. HARDING stated that she did not know why GILLOOLY drove past 
ECKARDT's house and said she did not remember GILLOOLY pulling over and 
stopping after driving south of ECKARDT's house. HARDING stated they turned 
around, but she stated she does not recall where they went then." 
</P>
<P>
 Clues, clues. So many clues. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't you admire George Steinbrenner, that old fox? Such a huge athletic 
controversy simply had to have his shadow cross the action at some point, now 
didn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 He's guilty of nothing, of course. But he's there, sure enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding told investigators that she received two $10,000 supporting grants 
from Steinbrenner, one in mid-December and another on Jan. 3. She used $3,100, 
possibly more for skates and costumes. ( That costume?) Ex-husband, manager, 
boyfriend, accuser Jeff Gillooly said he made one request to Steinbrenner for 
financial help. Gillooly asked, as he recalled, for $14,968. Steinbrenner 
rounded it down. 
</P>
<P>
 That money apparently financed all or part of the scatter-brained plot to 
disable Kerrigan. Gillooly's attorney says the whole caper came down to about 
$5,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls have already been placed, of that I am sure. Please put us through 
so we can ask Mr. Steinbrenner: Did you, sir, have the least hint that your 
generous support of this otherwise flat-broke young, troubled and promising 
figure skater would finance an attempt to change the outcome of Olympics and 
thereby poison amateur sports for years to come? 
</P>
<P>
 Click. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in Portland has a favorite among the misbegotten supporting cast of 
characters here. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, it's Shawn Eckardt. In the breathless opening of the drama, he was 
described as Harding's "350-pound" bodyguard. Then reporters got a grip. 
Eckardt suddenly shrunk to a 300-pound bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt is important for several reasons. Foremost, he's the goofiest and the 
least photogenic of anyone involved -- with sleepy eyes, a blank face and a 
neck like an oil drum. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt, you may recall, is thought to be the middleman in the hi-jinks. He 
was the link between Gillooly and the accused thugs-for-hire Shane Stant and 
Derrick Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 Seems that Eckardt's daydreams were more than a match for his tonnage. He had 
passed himself off among acquaintances as some sort of a young James Bond who 
had tangled with the terrorists of the world. But, OK, he would make time for 
his old pal Gillooly and help "take down a skater." 
</P>
<P>
 According to attorney Hoevet, Eckardt more or less discounted any James 
Bond-style fee and "bet on the come" by taking on the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wreak a little violence into the world of figure skating, and guess what? 
Skaters everywhere will be in a desperate search for bodyguards. Enter Shawn 
Eckardt, 26-year-old entrepreneur and proprietor World Bodyguard Services Inc. 
He would protect figure skating from himself. Economists call this creating a 
market for your services. 
</P>
<P>
 Who besides his lawyer calls Eckardt stupid? 
</P>
<P>
 Another favorite character is Norman Frink. He is the glowering prosecutor 
with the razor-cut hair and the limited vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times a day he parades in front of the cameras -- and in fairness, he 
could hardly avoid the cameras because they are stationed at every door of the 
courthouse. He is the man that knows it all and tells nothing, unless of course 
he is clandestinely behind the leaks that have left Portland knee-deep in the 
sour broth of rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 But who is to say? Not Norman. He is tormentor: He has all the turkey 
sandwiches but won't feed the hungry mob scratching at this door. 
</P>
<P>
 At one court appearance, a crass wag bellowed out a question to Frink. "So who 
do you pick to play you?" As in, Skating on Thin Ice, The Movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Frink: Thin smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But sorry. Everybody in Hollywood prefers a speaking part these days, don't 
they. Could even Clint Eastwood pull off a role as a man in a dark suit who 
says 250 times: "The investigation is continuing. . . . The investigation is 
continuing. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Are we making light of events? Yes, and about time, don't you agree? 
</P>
<P>
 But not for long. As Frink explains: "The investigation is continuing." The 
satellite dishes stay aimed at the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 One more thing. Did I mention that garbage was in the news this week? 
</P>
<P>
 No, not that kind of garbage, but the real stuff as comes out of the dumpster. 
It seems the owners of the Dockside Saloon and Restaurant in North Portland 
have reported to the FBI that Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly's household trash 
ended up in the restaurant's dumpster. Among the reported contents: The stub of 
a check for $10,000 from the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., an envelope addressed 
to Gillooly from the Associated Press, a Detroit taxi receipt and handwritten 
notes "related to" the Nancy Kerrigan's practice rink in South Dennis, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a significant development? Does herein lie evidence? How did trash 
from the Gillooly-Harding residence in suburban Beavercreek end up behind a 
North Portland saloon? Just who picked through the restaurant dumpster to find 
this garbage? Why were they looking? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know. But everyone is after the story. Gotta go.

ATLANTA OUTFIELDER GANT BREAKS RIGHT LEG IN MOTORBIKE ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Gant, left fielder of the Atlanta Braves, suffered a broken right leg in a 
motorbike accident Thursday and will be sidelined at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent 2 1/2 hours of surgery at Piedmont Hospital for a compound 
fracture Thursday night.The club said the operation on the lower leg was 
performed by team physicians Joe Chandler and Carl Fackler. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said Gant will be out at least three months but he predicted a full 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is highly unlikely he'll miss the entire season," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials did not know details of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves open spring training in less than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant, who last season hit .274 with 36 home runs, 117 runs batted in and 26 
stolen bases, recently signed a $5.5-million contract for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old outfielder and a friend were named last Saturday in a lawsuit 
accusing them of conspiring to have sex with two teen-age girls on Christmas 
Eve in Victoria, Tex., Gant's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant and Stephen Gaskin, 27, are also under criminal investigation in 
connection with the alleged incident with the girls, aged 15 and 16, said 
George Finley III, the Victoria County district attorney.

EX-COACH PELL TRIES SUICIDE; FOOTBALL: HIS CONDITION IS NOT IMMEDIATELY 
AVAILABLE AFTER LEAVING NOTE AND BEING FOUND IN CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charley Pell, former University of Florida football coach, attempted suicide 
after leaving a note saying he had lost his desire to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said he was found Wednesday night in his car in a wooded area.The 
engine was running with a hose connected from the exhaust pipe into the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Pell, 52, was taken to Baptist Medical Center and admitted for his own safety, 
the police report said. Hospital spokeswoman Cindy Hamilton would not say if 
Pell was still hospitalized. His condition was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 Pell coached Florida from 1979-84, compiling a 33-26-3 record. He was fired 
Sept. 16, 1984, three games into the season, after an NCAA investigation into 
widespread recruiting violations. The Gators ultimately were put on three 
years' probation that later was reduced to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pell, who headed a Jacksonville insurance firm, had left a box at a local golf 
club and asked that it be given to Malcolm Jowers, head of team security for 
the Florida football team, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the box, Jowers, who was also in charge of security when Pell was the 
Gators' coach, found a note from Pell, according to the police. The note talked 
about how he was not motivated for the future and included a map of where his 
body could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to the Jowers' residence went unanswered.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; HORSE DANGERS LURK AROUND TRAINING AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The serious injuries suffered by assistant trainer Jeff Lukas when Tabasco Cat 
knocked him to the ground in the Santa Anita barn area six weeks ago are a 
reminder to backstretch employees that while most horses aren't vicious, they 
can still be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Whittingham, who has trained the animals for 60 years, thought about 
this for a few moments this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell," the 80-year-old Whittingham said, "you get hurt in football games. You 
can get hurt just walking down the street these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but then this reporter reminded Whittingham of Perrault. In 1982, the 
English-bred horse gave Whittingham his first of three victories in the 
Arlington Million. 
</P>
<P>
 Perrault was a rogue, and I was aware of his reputation as I stood at the barn 
one morning a few days before the Million. I was closer to the adjoining stall 
of Erins Isle, talking to his owner, Brian Sweeney, but still not far enough 
away from Perrault. After a while, he lunged in our direction, biting me with 
full force on the right forearm. The arm was still sore the day Perrault won 
the race, and if I hadn't been wearing a jacket, his nip probably would have 
broken the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham smiled. "Yeah, he was that way," the trainer said. "He probably 
slipped off your coat, or it could have been worse." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marine, Whittingham is incredibly fit and still carries around the 
grit acquired in the Corps. Over the years, his luck around horses has been as 
bad as anybody's. His half-brother, Eddie, was killed after being kicked in the 
chest by a horse at San Luis Rey Downs, the training center in Bonsall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie was icing the horse's legs," Whittingham said. "He said he was all 
right when they took him to the hospital. But two hours later, he was dead. He 
bled to death." 
</P>
<P>
 When Charlie was a young man, a horse fell on him at Agua Caliente, breaking 
his left arm. And in 1989, the best horse Whittingham ever trained, Sunday 
Silence, almost landed a serious blow at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Sunday Silence had already won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, 
and the day before he would unsuccessfully try to sweep the Triple Crown in the 
Belmont Stakes, Whittingham was leading the colt to the track. In a tunnel that 
connected the paddock to the racing strip, Sunday Silence was spooked by a 
photographer. The horse reared in the air, clipping Whittingham near his right 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had got me coming down instead of going up, it might have been a lot 
worse," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been horsemen who haven't been as fortunate. An assistant to 
trainer Thad Ackel was killed at Del Mar after being kicked in a barn accident 
a few years ago. Joe Hernandez, the Santa Anita announcer who called 15,586 
consecutive races, was kicked in the stomach by a horse in January 1972 and 
collapsed in his booth a couple of hours later. He never recovered from the 
injuries and died of complications a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have had close calls: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Preakness horse bit off the finger of his groom several years ago, and 
trainer David Cross had the tips of his fingers trimmed by one of his horses at 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loading a horse for a trip to Del Mar, trainer Doug Peterson was kicked in 
the chest. "The doctor told me that a few inches either way and I could have 
been dead," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On horseback, trainers Wayne Lukas and Johnny Nerud had scares, and Del 
Carroll was killed in 1982 when his horse threw him and ran off at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas, Jeff's father, cracked three ribs at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 After his spill at Belmont Park, Nerud was rushed to the Boston hospital of a 
famous neurosurgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to name a horse after you some day, Doc," Nerud said later. "And it 
just won't be any horse; it'll be a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Fager, who won 18 of his 22 races, was elected to racing's Hall of Fame in 
1971, the year before Nerud was so honored. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Hialeah several years ago, another Hall of Fame trainer, Harry Trotsek, 
was doing what Jeff Lukas tried to do. Trotsek, who was in his 70s, put up his 
hands, but the runaway horse ran right through him. 
</P>
<P>
 After several weeks in the hospital, Trotsek was back working at Hialeah. 
Driving out the stable gate late one morning, he was broadsided by another car 
and hospitalized again. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just like Charlie Whittingham says: You can get hurt anywhere.

CANYONS' HERRICK DENIES HE MADE RACIAL SLUR; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: VALLEY 
OFFICIALS CLAIM COACH DELIVERED DEROGATORY COMMENTS AFTER GAME SATURDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Valley College administrators have filed a protest with their counterparts at 
College of the Canyons over a racial slur women's basketball Coach Greg Herrick 
allegedly made against Valley players after a game between the teams Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick adamantly denied the charges, saying they are prompted by bad feelings 
between the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to make it look like I'm a racist," he said Thursday. "I'm 
disgusted with it. Everyone who knows me knows it's ridiculous. . . . I kind of 
like their players, as a matter of fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Ferrero, Valley athletic director, said Thursday that school 
administrators faxed to Canyons statements from two coaches and four players on 
Valley's women's team accusing Herrick of making derogatory remarks about black 
Valley players after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is in their court," Ferrero said. "We've asked for their response 
when they take action." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrero sent the same information to WSC Commissioner Aviva Kamin. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons President Dianne Van Hook was unavailable for comment Thursday, but 
Glenn Hisayasu, dean of student services, said the school is looking into the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incident itself has just come to our attention," Hisayasu said. "We are 
going to fully investigate it. . . . College of the Canyons does not condone in 
any shape or form any racist behavior and will take proper action if 
warranted." 
</P>
<P>
 Hisayasu said it is too soon to discuss what action the college would take if 
the allegations are true. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to hear from them," said Mary Ann Breckell, vice president of 
administration at Valley. "Our perspective as a college is we don't tolerate 
this kind of thing. It has no place in our society today." 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged incident occurred moments after Canyons defeated Valley, 88-60, in 
a Western State Conference game at Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 John Taylor, first-year Valley coach, said he walked to the Canyons bench to 
congratulate Herrick after the game but was greeted rudely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to shake (Herrick's) hand but he turned away, so I said, 'You don't 
shake hands?' He said, 'No. Not with (expletive),' " Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Taylor, Herrick then walked to the Valley bench and made the 
comments that prompted the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Herrick followed me to my bench and started cursing me out," Taylor said. "As 
he was walking away, he said to me, 'You can take your (racial slur) home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said he charged at Herrick, asking him to repeat the remarks, but was 
restrained by other Monarch coaches as Herrick walked away without replying. 
Taylor, assistant Sandrine Rocher and four players wrote some of the incident 
reports that were faxed to Canyons and Kamin. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five black players on Valley's team and one at Canyons. Herrick is 
white and Taylor is part Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick, in his second season with the Cougars after coaching the boys' teams 
at Cleveland and Hart highs, denied making racial remarks about players or 
responding with an expletive when Taylor attempted to congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm insulted that anyone would say I used a racial slur," he said. "That word 
that I allegedly used has not crossed my mouth. I didn't say that word. . . . 
That kind of accusation is below any kind of comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick said he refused to shake Taylor's hand because he believes Valley 
coaches and Ferrero have been spreading malicious information about his 
program. He said that was the essence of his response to Taylor when he walked 
past the Valley bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'I'm not shaking the hand of someone who cheats and files 
fraudulent documents,' " Herrick said. "Valley has discredited not only me but 
my program, and because of that I don't respect them personally or 
professionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have pointed fingers at each other the past two years over alleged 
recruiting infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick, who resigned at Hart after a stormy five-year relationship with 
administrators at the school, took over at Canyons for the 1992-93 season and 
immediately came under fire from Ferrero, who notified the WSC that Herrick had 
contacted a high school player in Valley's recruiting area. Initial contact by 
a coach with a player outside a college's recruiting area is against state 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrero said the information came from the player, who related it to 
then-Coach Doug Michelson and Taylor, then the team's assistant. Michelson, who 
was the boys' coach at Hart before Herrick, is now the men's coach at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We caught (Herrick) recruiting illegally and turned him in," Ferrero said. 
"He was cheating, plain and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 The WSC did not penalize Canyons on that occasion. Kamin said Thursday that 
she will review the Canyons decision on the current issue before approving it 
or recommending different action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll sort of try to stay out of it at this moment," Kamin said. "I'll let the 
schools take their shot at it. If I don't agree with their decision, then I'll 
get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick said those salvos fired by Valley have soured him about the Monarch 
coaches and athletic administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Taylor and others have told players I've recruited not to go to COC 
because I'm a bad guy," Herrick said. "Now they've chosen to fabricate another 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor denied making such references to Herrick and called Saturday's incident 
"unfortunate."

ALABAMA BIRMINGHAM WILL PAY TO PLAY CSUN; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NO. 17 BLAZERS, 
NOT WANTING TO LOSE GAME TO QUAKE, PERSUADE MATADORS TO COME TO THEIR GYM.

 At what cost victory? For the Alabama Birmingham basketball team, the answer 
is $15,000, plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than risk losing a game -- and, most likely, a victory -- at a juncture 
in the season when potential playoff teams are under increased scrutiny, 
Alabama Birmingham made Cal State Northridge an offer Thursday it could not 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the Matadors moving their Feb. 26 men's basketball home game 
against the Blazers to Feb. 27 in Birmingham, the school said it would cover 
the cost of Northridge's trip, plus pay a $10,000 guarantee and $5,000 more to 
a special student earthquake-relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't afford to lose a win, or a game, because of their postseason 
situation," said Bob Hiegert, Northridge athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Bartow, Alabama Birmingham's basketball coach and athletic director, did 
not want to risk canceling the game if another major aftershock were to strike, 
Hiegert said. Bartow could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham, 16-3 and ranked 17th in the nation, was the most prominent 
team on Northridge's home schedule. Bartow has agreed to play at Northridge 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's nice," Hiegert said, "because it probably won't be easy for us to 
schedule home games next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors are down to eight home games in a 26-game schedule this season, 
but Hiegert said he could not guarantee that the school could handle the large 
crowd expected to attend the Alabama Birmingham game were it not moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan unveiled by university officials this week, the parking lots 
closest to the gym are sites for portable classrooms. The next closest parking 
areas are approximately a half-mile north, at Sierra Hall, or even farther 
north, adjacent to North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting spectators to contests is not as big of a priority as getting 
students to classrooms," Hiegert said.

THOUSAND OAKS HIT WITH TAMPERING CHARGE BY MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High is conducting an investigation into charges that assistant 
football coach Bob Shoup, who coached at Cal Lutheran for 28 years, made 
improper contact with a member of the Moorpark High team. 
</P>
<P>
 George Paul, whose son Bryan was a backup quarterback last fall at Moorpark, 
said he contacted Shoup and had lunch with the coach last week. Bryan also 
attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoup, 61, was a first-year walk-on coach at Thousand Oaks last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact between a coach and a player or parent from another school is 
considered undue influence and is forbidden under state rules.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Athletic Director Anna Merriman said she hoped to complete the 
investigation within a week and would forward the results to the Southern 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, a sophomore, played last fall behind Tyler Dritz, a junior who 
transferred from Westlake. George Paul said he was unaware of the rules 
governing undue influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ignorance on my part," the elder Paul said. "I was investigating how 
to go about (transferring). I hope I haven't jeopardized Bob or my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section administrator Bill Clark, who supervises football, would not 
speculate on possible sanctions against the program or Paul if the charges 
prove true. Merriman said she is awaiting a written response from the Paul 
family before forwarding her findings to Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 In his tenure at Cal Lutheran, which ended after the 1989 season, Shoup led 
the Kingsmen to national prominence. Cal Lutheran won the NAIA national 
championship in 1971 and made the final in 1975 and 1977. He compiled a record 
of 185-87-6 and had 21 winning seasons in his 28 years at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoup said he was asked by Thousand Oaks administrators not to comment on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Coach Rob Dearborn, president of the Ventura County Coaches Assn., 
was incensed when he learned of the apparent violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us a long time to get where we are," Dearborn said Wednesday night. 
"I'll be damned if I'm going to sit by while someone takes our players." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Athletic Director Rich Uphoff and Dearborn said they will evaluate 
the corrective action taken by Thousand Oaks before deciding if they will 
pursue the matter further with section officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark finished 9-2-1 last fall and won a playoff game for the first time in 
school history. Thousand Oaks was 2-7-1 and failed to qualify for postseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Uphoff said that Paul talked openly of his desire to play elsewhere and made 
no secret of the fact that he was seeking to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boy told us all along what was going on," Uphoff said. "The paper trail 
is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks might not be the only school targeted by the Pauls. A Marmonte 
League football coach who asked not to be identified said he was approached at 
a basketball game last month by an adult who asked if the coach was interested 
in picking up a transfer quarterback from Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the coach, the adult did not identify himself, but said the 
quarterback's name was Bryan Paul.

BRADSHAW TO LEARN BOARD RULING TODAY; BOYS' BASKETBALL: EMBATTLED SIMI VALLEY 
COACH, SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINE, LEAVES BEFORE END OF MEETING. 
</P>

 Members of the Simi Valley Unified School District reached a decision Thursday 
regarding Simi Valley High Coach Dean Bradshaw's possible punishment for 
pushing one of his players to the floor during a Jan. 14 basketball game. But 
they said they would not comment on it even after informing Bradshaw today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is appropriate for the coach to know (the decision) before you know," 
board member Doug Crosse said to reporters after the meeting adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow member Judy Barry confirmed that a decision was reached, "but we can't 
talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The special, closed-door board meeting at the district offices began at 6 p.m. 
and lasted an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw, with attorney Randy Sundeen in attendance, presented his side of the 
incident, then left 20 minutes before the meeting ended. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Sundeen said that no decision had been reached and that they would have 
no further comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw could not be reached later Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundeen said as he left the district offices that a written statement would be 
released after a decision was made. The statement is expected to come from 
Bradshaw or Simi Valley High officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any comments will have to come from Coach Bradshaw or (Simi Valley principal 
Kathryn Scroggin)," Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw, in his sixth season at Simi Valley, has been suspended from games 
and practices since the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been accused of grabbing and subsequently throwing reserve guard Sam 
Rodriguez to the floor after Rodriguez was assessed a technical foul during a 
51-44 victory over visiting Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Saunders, a Simi Valley lawyer who coached many of the Pioneers' current 
players in youth leagues, and Dave Detmer, a shop teacher at Simi Valley and 
the freshman girls' basketball coach at Thousand Oaks High, have acted as 
co-coaches during Bradshaw's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coaches Steve Johnson and Christian Aurand have refused to coach the 
Pioneers in a show of support for Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (15-5, 6-2 in Marmonte League play) is 3-0 during Bradshaw's 
suspension and will play Agoura as the home team at Thousand Oaks High at 7:30 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's gym was severely damaged during the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers compiled a 90-48 record during Bradshaw's first five seasons. 
They advanced to last year's Southern Section Division I-AA championship game 
before losing to Long Beach Jordan, 61-59, in double overtime.

FOR GILLESPIE, IT'S CATCH AS CATCH CAN; OFTEN-RELUCTANT RECEIVER TO START AS 
FRESHMAN AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Eric Gillespie was playing Little League baseball as a 10-year-old, a 
relative somehow caught him on film wearing full catcher's gear. Tools of the 
trade? A trade of the tools for his infielder's glove quickly was made. 
</P>
<P>
 A few horrific, fleeting moments behind the plate were enough. Not so 
remarkably, Gillespie pulled up lame after his first inning at catcher. Rather, 
he pulled up with a lame excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Find another volunteer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated it," Gillespie said. "I faked an injury to get out of there. I said 
the ball hit my finger or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, the fickle finger of fate has again singled out Gillespie. 
He is back behind the plate, and in an NCAA Division I program. In addition, he 
will start as a freshman as Cal State Northridge opens the 1994 baseball season 
today at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 When the photograph was taken, the gear looked as if it was manufactured for a 
much larger player. Somewhere, wrapped in all that armor, was Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks very serious," his father Richard said, describing the photo. "All 
the equipment looks too big. Even the glove looks too big." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie was practically bribed to get back in catcher's gear. As a sophomore 
third baseman at Millikan High in Long Beach, he was asked by his coach to 
consider trying out behind the plate. Might get some at-bats that way, the 
coach said. Otherwise, no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gillespie: "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Gillespie hardly played. The following year, the coach repeated 
the question and Gillespie made the transition. Despite Gillespie's 
unfamiliarity at the position, Millikan won a Southern Section 5-A Division 
title during his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 That Gillespie proved to be a quick study should surprise nobody. Gillespie 
(5-foot-10, 190 pounds) stands apart from most of his teammates in several 
respects.  
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie, whose high school grade-point average was 3.8, was offered an 
academic scholarship to Washington State. He is taking pre-med classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a genius," his father said, "he just works very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie, who as a senior batted .390 and drove in 20 runs, is probably the 
only player at Northridge with Mozart cassettes in his car. His mother forced 
him to begin taking piano lessons at age 6. Now, he can't get enough of it. On 
a given day, Gillespie can be found banging out tunes on the piano in the 
student union building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get lost in the piano sometimes," he said. "I like performing for people. I 
wish I had more time for it." 
</P>
<P>
 When Gillespie was in high school, he played in the Millikan jazz ensemble and 
had a couple of paying gigs with a band he helped throw together. Nothing 
glamorous, really. The band played at a local rib joint and for a group of 
senior citizens over Christmas break. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Gillespie, 18, is very much the whippersnapper on the Matador 
roster. In fact, he is the team's lone freshman. Since Gillespie had nobody 
with whom to compare notes, Mike Sims volunteered as his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few weeks, Gillespie has been the apprentice, Sims the 
taskmaster. Sims, an Alemany High graduate who started 227 of 232 Matador games 
at catcher over the past four seasons before he was drafted by the Florida 
Marlins in June, has been spending hours each day with the freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in his head, he wants to put in mine," Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims means everything. Four years back, Sims recalls waking up in the middle 
of the night in a fit of panic, a cold sweat. He had just experienced his first 
baseball-related nightmare, which centered on a particularly hellish blocking 
drill to which Gillespie also has been subjected. In the dream, baseballs are 
rocketed by a pitching machine into the dirt at home, beating the catcher into 
a purple pulp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever have that dream?" Sims asked recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, no," Gillespie said, a strange look crossing his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will," Sims countered. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Gillespie did. 
</P>
<P>
 Their situation is comparable, but not identical. In some respects, Sims says 
he had it made. When Sims was a freshman, the NCAA allowed considerably more 
practice time -- the hours have since been reduced. Sims said the off-season 
schedule gave him a year's worth of experience in a few short weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Northridge was playing at the Division II level at the time, and 
as Gillespie soon will learn, there's a world of difference between Cal State 
Stanislaus and Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had it easy," Sims said. "Compared to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisons? Sims said Gillespie stands head and shoulders above most players 
his age. That is, his smarts and arm should make the challenge easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a better arm than I do," Sims said. "I know he takes a better hack 
than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie, in fact, will be given a chance to hack and chop with the team's 
best. In a pair of scrimmages the past two weekends, Gillespie, who bats 
left-handed, has been inserted in the sixth and fifth slots in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gonna have to grow up pretty fast," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. 
"It's on-the-job training." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many Division I coaches, Kernen lets his catchers call their own game. 
Throw in the fact that pitching is expected to be the strength of the team and 
Gillespie becomes a focal point. 
</P>
<P>
 How the Matador pitchers react to a catcher with peach-fuzz on his face 
remains a question mark. When Sims was a freshman, pitcher Val Lopez used to 
shake off his signs routinely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, he'd shake me off, shake me off, shake me off, then we'd go all 
the way back around to what I first called," Sims said. "He wanted to show me 
he was in charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie isn't sure how the staff will react if there is a difference of 
opinion on pitch selection. He will be expected to learn each pitcher's 
strengths and weaknesses as well as their personalities. Preferably, by 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I'll call what he wants to throw and he'll throw what I want to 
call," Gillespie said. "I've been thinking a lot about that. It's not my job 
for them to like me, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the immersion process. Sink or swim. Sims said his head was 
spinning so much as a freshman that he used to tape notes on opposing batters 
to his left wrist.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect (Gillespie) to be perfect," Kernen said. "There's going to 
have to be some patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the thing I learned (from Sims) is that it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie was discovered by accident. Last spring, Northridge assistant P.C. 
Shaw drove to El Segundo to watch Millikan face Simi Valley in a tournament 
game. Shaw was scouting another player when Gillespie caught his eye, 
</P>
<P>
 The only other school to pursue Gillespie athletically was Chapman, which is 
moving to Division III. The decision on which school to attend wasn't 
difficult. Ever since, Gillespie has been caught up in a cyclone of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think that two years ago he wouldn't have been, well, caught dead 
behind the plate. Now he's starting as a freshman for a team ranked 27th in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough to make Gillespie dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I started thinking about all this," Gillespie said with a smile, "it might 
start bothering me."

BURBANK CLOSES IN ON FOOTBALL COACH

<TEXT>
<P>
 An athletic department official said Thursday that Burbank High has selected a 
new varsity football coach, but an announcement is pending an approval of 
teaching arrangements and other details. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Athletic Director Frank Kallem would not confirm that Burbank's choice 
is Montclair Prep assistant John Hazelton.A Burbank district official said 
earlier in the week that Hazelton was the overwhelming choice of a 13-member 
selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee did not interview Hazelton or the two other finalists -- St. 
Genevieve Coach Richard Fong and Glendale College assistant Robert Dos Remedios 
-- until Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one person in mind, but we're still checking out that person," Kallem 
said. "The interview process is complete, but the decision is not finalized. 
We're not quite ready to release the name yet." DANA HADDAD

NEWS ANALYSIS; CHAMPING AT THE BIT; U.S. FIRMS ARE EAGER TO GET INTO VIETNAM 
WITH LIFTING OF TRADE EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When President Clinton announced the lifting of the Vietnam trade embargo 
Thursday, the U.S. business community applauded -- ecstatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-four American companies, large and small, have already obtained 
licenses from the Hanoi government to set up offices in Vietnam. And countless 
others -- including many in Southern California -- have been waiting anxiously 
on the sidelines, revving their engines for the day when they would be able to 
start making deals and catching up with their Taiwanese, French and Japanese 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's striking about all this excitement is that as recently as 10 or 15 
years ago, it would have been unthinkable. Not because of animosities left over 
from the Vietnam War, but because American business was much more insular than 
it is today, exploiting easy opportunities in its huge domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe 10 years ago, there was more of a complacent attitude than 
there is today," said Frank Brown, chief executive of Connel Bros. Co., a San 
Francisco trading firm with about $265 million in annual sales, which opened an 
office in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "But today, most U.S. manufacturers are well aware of the opportunities in 
Asia with the phenomenal growth going on there," Brown said. "And they're very 
interested in Vietnam, which is really ready to take off." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Connel's first venture in Vietnam. The company had a "sizable" 
business during the war. "It was easy then," Brown said. "We dealt through the 
U.S. AID program, and we didn't have to compete with the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown still has high hopes of exploiting a niche market in specialty 
industrial chemicals, one of his company's mainstays, as well as selling a 
range of other U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We predict that in three years we'll have a major profit center there. It 
usually takes us that long just to break even in a new market," he said. "I 
haven't been this optimistic about a new branch office in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Allergan Inc. in Irvine, the world's biggest manufacturer of eye care 
products, has already registered some of its products with the Vietnamese 
Ministry of Health. "We are in the process of making a regional push into the 
Pacific Rim, so Vietnam fits into our marketing strategy," spokesman Jeff 
D'Eliscu said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of Clinton's announcement, Otis Elevator Co. said it would 
resume business in Vietnam after a two-decade hiatus. The company's statement 
was followed by similar announcements by Coca-Cola Co. and United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the presidential decree lifting the ban on trade with Hanoi, a number 
of barriers to normal economic relations remain, said Irwin Jay Robinson, 
president of the Vietnam-American Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese manufacturers won't have meaningful access to the U.S. market, for 
example, until Congress grants the Hanoi government most-favored-nation status, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks that will happen eventually, but in the meantime the situation is a 
"one-way street." The major significance of Thursday's move is that American 
contractors can now compete for a share in major development projects in 
Vietnam, soon to be put to bid by the World Bank and other international 
lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Corp., the giant engineering and construction company, is "in the 
process of evaluating business opportunities" in Vietnam, spokeswoman Deborah 
Land said. "Southeast Asia is one of our most active areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Fluor is building two power plants in the Philippines, an oil 
refinery in Thailand and a chemical facility in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's much more than the profit motive involved, Robinson added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam is a very special case," he said. "When I traveled around the country 
in the process of forming this chamber in 1992, I found a tremendous desire to 
do something to help Vietnam, to compensate for the guilt that many American 
businessmen feel for what we did to and in that country." 
</P>
<P>
 John Bushby, a businessman and Vietnam veteran who last spring returned to the 
Southeast Asian nation for the first time in 20 years, said he also senses a 
mood of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know more veterans who want to go over there and do something positive, 
because basically that's the only way to heal," said Bushby, president of a 
financial services software company in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you go over there now, you see our global competitors taking away 
our business," he said. "Why is Evergreen (a Taiwanese shipping company) 
setting up the big container facility in Saigon and not an American company?" 
</P>
<P>
 But change is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland-based American President Lines recently received a license to open an 
office in Vietnam. Branch licenses have also been granted to other major 
American companies such as Eastman Kodak, Motorola, Caterpillar and DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they'll be able to sign contracts and start battling the regulatory 
process to get a piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 BankAmerica is ahead of the field of U.S. financial institutions. It has been 
operating a liaison office in Hanoi since 1992, taking advantage of a special 
waiver in the embargo that allowed it to handle family remittances for the 
Vietnamese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the embargo has been lifted, spokesman Jim Mitchell said, the bank is 
planning to upgrade its operation in Vietnam to a full-service branch offering 
financial advisory and capital market services, short-term trade financing, 
foreign exchange trading and correspondent banking. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines announced Thursday that it will begin scheduled service to Ho 
Chi Minh City "as soon as practicable."  
</P>
<P>
 While half a dozen foreign air carriers serve Vietnam through Los Angeles 
International Airport, the end of trade barriers allows not only United but 
also competitors Northwest and American to fly there, said Kim Pham, owner of 
Kim's Travel in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Pham's business to Vietnam involves Vietnamese Americans, but she has 
also booked passage for former U.S. miliary veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel World in Garden Grove, which last year arranged trips to Vietnam for 
about 15,000 customers, has secured licensing from the Vietnamese government. 
"We hope to be the first travel agency to bring Vietnamese visitors to 
America," manager Michael Tran said. "We can set up an office there next week." 
</P>
<P>
 But the eagerness to jump into the competitive fray in Vietnam is perhaps most 
notable among smaller U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Odetics Inc., a high-tech manufacturer in Anaheim, hopes to sell its 
broadcasting products in Vietnam. The company makes an automated tape library 
used to store and air commercials and news spots for television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam is an area of the world we've been waiting to open up," spokeswoman 
Holly Barnett said. "We do well in emerging countries that are in the process 
of establishing communications paths and need the hardware to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Son H. (Sonny) Luu has been offering discount long-distance telephone services 
to Vietnam since May, 1992, when the Bush Administration relaxed the embargo to 
allow direct phone links. 
</P>
<P>
 But Luu's Costa Mesa-based Pan Pacific Telecommunications Management has much 
more in the hopper. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of projects we've been nourishing and are waiting to do," 
said Luu, a native of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to trade in telecommunications equipment, and we can offer our 
consulting services in negotiating offshore energy concessions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The market also presents an opportunity for the computer industry. Ho Thanh 
Viet, whose company has developed a Vietnamese-language computer program, said 
he will definitely look into sales possibilities in Vietnam. "We have to weigh 
everything," he said.

 MAIN STORY: A1 Competition in Vietnam 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. companies have been forced to sit on the sidelines because of the 
trade embargo, their global competitors have been making deals in one of the 
world's fastest-growing economies. Foreign concerns have received government 
approval to invest nearly $5 billion, on paper at least. Actual inbound 
investment is believed to be much lower. Value of investment commitments as of 
June 30, in millions of dollars: Taiwan: $1,441 Hong Kong: 843 South Korea: 441 
Australia: 426 Japan: 335 France: 325 Britain: 291 Ireland: 236 Singapore: 201 
Holland: 196

NISSAN TO BUY BACK 33,000 DEFECTIVE MINIVANS; AUTOS: ALL OWNERS WILL RECEIVE UP 
TO $7,000. THE ACTION ON THE FIRE-PRONE VEHICLE COULD COST MORE THAN $200 
MILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 After four recalls of its 1987-90 minivans failed to fix defects that could 
cause engine fires, Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. threw in the towel Thursday by 
announcing it will buy back and destroy all 33,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyback is highly unusual and by far the largest ever in the United 
States. Fiat's repurchase of 4,000 1972-74 sedans with rust-prone suspensions 
was the only other major buyback for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The action could cost Nissan more than $200 million. Nissan said it expects to 
pay $5,000 to $7,000, depending on age and mileage of the vehicle. The move 
underscores the ever-greater lengths that auto makers must go to to maintain 
their image with increasingly demanding customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're paying higher than you'll ever get as a used car or a trade-in," a 
Nissan spokesman said. The company's vice president and general manager, Earl 
Hesterberg, said, "This program is designed to satisfy our customers." 
</P>
<P>
 That is particularly important these days to Nissan, whose Japan-based parent 
company is losing money while the U.S. arm has been making a comeback from 
years of weak sales blamed on poor products. Nissan was the only Japanese auto 
maker to pick up U.S. market share last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan, based in Torrance, took the voluntary action as the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration was auditing the results of the latest recall, 
which began in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said five or six engine fires have been confirmed in vehicles 
repaired last fall by Nissan dealers. In all, there have been 153 fires 
reported in the Nissan vans since 1987, but there have been no deaths or 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the buyback program, the company is offering to purchase all the 
Passenger Van XEs and GXEs at current retail value. The company will also 
provide all the minivan owners a $500 coupon toward the purchase of any new or 
used Nissan vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHTSA approved the program. "We will continue to monitor the situation," 
said Bill Boehly, assistant administrator of enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency itself has taken heat over its handling of the Nissan minivan 
problems. The case marks the first time one model has been recalled four times 
for related defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is impressed with the Nissan offer. Sean Kane, a senior associate 
for Ralph Hoar & Associates of Arlington, Va., a vehicle safety research firm, 
said it falls far short of satisfying Nissan's legal responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew about the problem for seven years and didn't do anything about it," 
said Kane, who has assisted in lawsuits filed against Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Christian of Moreno Valley agrees. She and her husband bought a 1987 
minivan from Nissan and within a month the vehicle was in the shop because the 
passenger compartment had filled with engine smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The company undertook a repair at no charge. But the problem persisted. "We've 
had continual overheating," she said. "It's been a constant problem and they 
don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 The minivans with the fire problem are a different vehicle than the Nissan 
Quest, a Nissan-designed minivan built at a Ford Motor Co. plant near 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan no longer makes the minivans involved in the buyout. They were imported 
from Japan and sold largely in the 1987 and 1988 model years. California, Texas 
and Florida were the most popular markets for the vans. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had problems with them nearly from the time of their U.S. 
introduction. In July, 1987, Nissan recalled several thousand vans to replace a 
defective valve gasket. A leaky gasket could cause oil to drip onto the 
manifold, igniting a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 There were subsequent recalls in 1990, 1992 and 1993 involving all 33,000 
vehicles. All the repairs were for separate problems that could cause fires in 
the engine compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The last recall began in September. It involved extensive and complex repairs 
to the cooling system to prevent overheating that could result in an engine 
fire. The procedure included installing an improved cooling system, with a new 
radiator, electric fan and warning system in case of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those repairs, the company said it continued to receive reports of 
problems. "There have been a few," Nissan spokesman Mark Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also found that repairs were so extensive on some vehicles that it 
made more sense to buy back the vehicles than to repair them. The company did 
that on a selective basis last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But word of the problems resulted in several class-action lawsuits filed on 
behalf of minivan owners. Nissan said one of those in California was settled as 
a result of its buyback offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan said it is doing what it can to repair relations with the minivan 
owners. Although belatedly, it is following the aggressive strategies pioneered 
by Lexus, Saturn and others in which special care is lavished on owners of 
recalled vehicles to try to turn the experience into a plus.

JUDGE LIMITS GM ON MAKING RETIREES PAY FOR HEALTH CARE; LABOR: EXPERTS SAY A 
'HORNET'S NEST' AWAITS COMPANIES THAT WANT TO RETROACTIVELY CHANGE TERMS. AUTO 
MAKER IS LIKELY TO APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a ruling that raises a warning flag for U.S. companies trying to cut back 
on health care expenses, a federal judge said General Motors Corp. cannot force 
certain of its retirees to help shoulder the costs of their health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 GM is likely to appeal the decision, which could cost the nation's largest 
auto maker scores of millions of dollars. The 119-page ruling, issued late 
Wednesday by U.S. District Judge John Feikens in Detroit, binds GM to promises 
of lifetime free health insurance that, the court ruled, GM made to about 
50,000 employees who took early retirement between 1974 and 1988 -- many of 
them residents of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee benefits experts said that while the ruling applies only to General 
Motors, other companies considering making changes in retiree benefits plans 
should pay close attention. A "hornet's nest" now awaits companies that want to 
retroactively change the terms of retiree health benefits, unless they clearly 
had reserved the option to make changes -- or discontinue -- health care 
benefits, said Raymond C. Fay, the Washington attorney representing the 
retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, Francesca Bruno, a benefits consultant with New York-based A. 
Foster Higgins & Co., said companies need to take a careful look at their 
retiree health care plans and that retirees should examine the terms as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ruling," she said, "just has to flow across everybody's consciousness 
and sink in until they ask themselves" if it can happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling does not put an end to the case, originally filed by a group of 
white-collar retirees in Los Angeles in 1989 and moved to Detroit in 1990. 
Retirees attorney Fay said the next steps are to restore the retirees' 
guarantees to lifetime, no-cost health care and to calculate how much money GM 
owes to the retirees and their families, unless GM gets special permission to 
appeal before the trial is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay said the decision could cost General Motors $25 million to $40 million for 
each year since 1988, when it began requiring employees and retirees to bear 
some of the costs of their health care benefits. General Motors' annual cost of 
health care rose to nearly $3.7 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed with the ruling," Richard F. O'Brien, GM vice president 
of corporate personnel, said in a statement. "The GM benefits package is among 
the best in all of industry, and we intend to maintain a competitive benefits 
package for our employees and our retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 As a basic operating procedure, however, we believe we do have the right to 
amend, modify or change our benefit plan." 
</P>
<P>
 GM stumbled, observers said, over conflicts between what it wrote in some of 
the documentation of the retirement plans and in other communications designed 
to encourage employees to take early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as early-retirement incentive packages have become a crucial tool in 
corporate restructuring and slimming down, the drive to gain control over 
upward spiraling health care costs has led more and more businesses to pass 
along some of those costs to their employees and current and future retirees. 
In previous challenges to changes in retirement health care provisions, courts 
have allowed such changes when the companies clearly proved they had informed 
retirees that modifications were possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the ruling, some companies may just throw up their hands and 
not offer retirees any health care benefits, said Richard A. Kleinert, a 
principal in the Los Angeles office of benefits consultants William M. Mercer 
Inc. He said employers "may think, 'If I don't dot one i or cross one t , I may 
create this irrevocable obligation stretching on into the future.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, GM added a $750 annual deductible to its health care plans for all 
retirees and employees. Last year, it hiked the costs of the most common health 
insurance plan to $3,000 per family, attorney Fay said, and this year began 
requiring monthly contributions to premium costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trial, GM maintained that it had reserved the right to make changes in 
early-retirement plans it offered employees from 1974 to 1988. (The case does 
not involve employees who retired before 1974 or since 1988.) However, Ray 
said, a pivotal issue in the trial was a memo issued in 1980 by GM Vice 
President George Morris to personnel directors dealing with early-retirement 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Feikens wrote: "Morris explicitly advised (them) to stress the 
importance of full health care coverage in retirement without cost to all 
employees considering early retirement. But he failed to mention the 
possibility that health care benefits could be reduced or even eliminated after 
the employee retired." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray said he thinks companies will continue to offer early-retirement 
incentives, but "the rules of the game have changed significantly."

JOBLESS RATE TO BE UNVEILED TODAY WILL REFLECT REVAMPED SYSTEM; STATISTICS: NEW 
FIGURES ARE EXPECTED TO REVEAL A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OUT OF WORK. WOMEN IN 
PARTICULAR WERE BEING UNDERCOUNTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The nation's overhauled system for gauging unemployment -- a method expected 
to boost official jobless rates -- will turn out its first figures today when 
the Labor Department releases employment statistics for January. 
</P>
<P>
 Both government and private economists say the revamped approach will provide 
a more accurate picture of the U.S. job market. Among its drawbacks, the old 
format undercounted the number of women in the labor force and the percentage 
of women unemployed, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new system and other statistical revisions are making their debut amid 
concerns in the Clinton Administration that the statistics will be 
misinterpreted as a reflection of a worsening job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials estimate that monthly jobless rates in 1993 would have 
been, on average, more than half a percentage point higher if the revised 
procedures had already been in effect. For example, the U.S. jobless rate of 
6.4% reported for December probably would have been 6.9% to 7.0% under the new 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts note, however, that the gap between the old and new formats will vary 
from month to month and will not always be half a percentage point. That will 
make accurate comparisons between 1994 and previous years difficult if not 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have made a major effort in recent days to head off 
potentially misleading news reports about the new unemployment numbers. On 
Thursday, that effort kicked into high gear, with senior officials calling 
reporters about the revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all just calling around to everybody to make sure they understand the 
changes," said Laura Andrea Tyson, the head of the President's Council of 
Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new survey will be much more accurate, but obviously those numbers can be 
used in all sorts of ways," she said. "We want people to understand it's an 
improvement, a technical correction." 
</P>
<P>
 The government has long compiled unemployment figures by surveying about 
60,000 households nationally every month, including 4,550 throughout California 
and 1,888 in Los Angeles County. But now government interviewers will ask more 
questions, and officials say the questions raised will be more precise and less 
gender-biased. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, under the old system, men and women were asked different 
questions about what they did the week prior to the survey. Men were asked 
whether they were working or doing something else, while women were asked if 
they were keeping house or doing something else. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach toward women "has a Norman Rockwell ring about it, with Mom 
serving dinner wearing her apron," said labor economist Audrey Freedman, who 
heads a committee of business experts that advised the Labor Department on its 
revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, men and women alike are asked simply, "Last week, did 
you do any work for pay or profit?" 
</P>
<P>
 In another change intended to improve accuracy, government interviewers will 
use computers rather than paper questionnaires. The computers will aid 
interviewers by providing appropriate follow-up questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, the government figures will also reflect revisions that take 
into account population changes identified by the 1990 census. Among other 
things, those revisions are supposed to remedy the previous undercounting of 
Latinos in the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate is, like the national rate, expected to rise 
somewhat more than half a percentage point as a result of the revisions. The 
state rate was reported as 8.7% for December. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to rise are figures for Los Angeles County, which are released 
at the same time as the national and state numbers, and figures for other 
California counties, which come out several weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the changes, private economists say serious weaknesses remain in the 
data. They say the jobless rate will continue to rise in many cases when the 
economy is actually improving. 
</P>
<P>
 That occurs because more people start looking for work when they sense that 
their opportunities are better.

GM SIGNS ON TO ENVIRONMENTAL CODE OF CONDUCT; POLICY: PROPONENTS OF THE CERES 
PRINCIPLES PRAISE THE PACT, BUT OTHERS ARE SUSPICIOUS OF THE AUTO MAKER'S 
MOTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ceres Principles, a business code of conduct long advocated by 
environmentalists, may be revived from obscurity thanks to a surprise agreement 
with General Motors Corp., the world's largest industrial corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the pact announced Thursday, GM pledges to reduce waste, use renewable 
resources wherever possible, publicly divulge its environmental progress and 
even protect company whistle-blowers when these measures fail to adequately 
protect employees and the public from environmental risks. 
</P>
<P>
 While proponents praised the agreement, other environmentalists and consumer 
groups expressed suspicion about GM's motives. One group called the move 
"greenwashing" by an auto company that is vigorously fighting California's 
mandate to cut air pollution through the use of electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ariane van Buren of the New York-based Interfaith Center on Corporate 
Responsibility, a Ceres member, defended the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an agreement to agree on every issue," Van Buren said. "It's 
rather to create a forum for discussion and moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 As to the Ceres Principles, introduced with much fanfare in 1989, they have 
had few takers so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Once known as the Valdez Principles -- after the Exxon Valdez oil spill that 
inspired them -- the guidelines have been the subject of routine but mostly 
unsuccessful shareholder initiatives at U.S. corporate annual meetings in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates, grouped under the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible 
Economies, control about $150 billion worth of corporate stock. Despite this 
clout, only 75 companies have endorsed the principles, the largest being Sun 
Co., a Philadelphia-based oil marketer. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's endorsement will "break the logjam," said Ceres board member Mindy S. 
Lubber, who is president of Green Century Capital Management Inc., a Boston 
mutual fund that considers companies' environmental policies in its 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a coup . . . and I do think you'll see a lot more companies 
signing on," said Carl Frankel, editor of Green Market Alert, a Bethlehem, 
Conn.-based environmental newsletter. "But one reason this is happening is that 
Ceres is being less adamant and finger-wagging with corporations. . . . The 
fact that this exists is a reflection of the willingness of environmental 
interests to sit down and negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 The principles have also been amended from environmentalists' initial demands. 
For instance, the demand for an environmentalist on every board of directors 
has become a demand that companies pledge to "consider demonstrated 
environmental commitment as a factor" in choosing directors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, some environmental advocates praised the principles but 
questioned GM's timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Magavern, director of energy projects for Public Citizen, a national 
consumer organization, contended that GM is "promising to do things like make 
their products more energy-efficient and reduce harmful emissions, while at the 
same time lobbying against higher fuel efficiency standards and zero-emission 
vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Christine Quirk, spokeswoman for the California League of Conservation 
Voters: "It sends signals to my brain that GM is up to no good."

 Toyota Breaks Into Big-Car Market: Toyota Motor Corp., which built its 
reputation with small, fuel-efficient cars, rolled out the biggest Japanese 
sedan ever offered in the U.S. market, complete with an American-style bench 
front seat.The Avalon, which goes on sale later this year, will serve as the 
flagship model for Toyota, filling a void left by the demise of the 
top-of-the-line Cressida in 1992. The Avalon will be built exclusively in 
Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., factory using a stretched version of Toyota's 
mid-sized Camry platform. The vehicle's price was not disclosed.

 30-Year Mortgages Steady at 6.97%: The fixed-rate mortgages were unchanged 
from last week, according to a national survey released by the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp. The rates remained the lowest since Oct. 26, when they 
averaged 6.86%.After dropping to a 25-year low of 6.74% in October, rates rose 
to 7.31% in November, then began drifting lower. On one-year, adjustable rate 
mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 4.12%, down from 
4.16% last week. Fifteen-year mortgages, an increasingly popular option for 
people refinancing mortgages, averaged 6.46% this week, down from 6.47% a week 
earlier. The rates do not include add-on fees that are known as points.

 Clinton Reportedly Drafting Plan for Free-Trade Zone: The Administration is 
drafting a plan that would create a Western Hemisphere free-trade zone in 10 to 
15 years and add Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement by late next 
year, White House officials told the New York Times. While details remain 
unresolved, the plan could dominate the hemisphere's economic and political 
agendas in the next decade, the officials told the newspaper.

 British Court Rules Against Antar: The court ordered the convicted founder of 
the Crazy Eddie electronics chain to turn over $1.2 million in a London bank 
account to U.S. regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. The 
judgment is the first granted to the SEC by a foreign court.In a four-year 
search, the SEC and a court-appointed trustee have identified more than $60 
million that Eddie Antar hid in banks around the world. Of that, only $1.3 
million has been returned to the United States. The $1.2 million in an account 
at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London remains there pending Antar's appeal, 
said Richard Ross, a lawyer at the New Jersey law firm appointed to seek out 
Antar's assets. Most of the money would go to investors in Crazy Eddie Inc., 
which failed in 1989 amid charges of stock manipulation.

 Made-in-Japan Rocket Blasts Off: The first major rocket developed completely 
in Japan roared into space from a launch pad in Tanegashima.The country hopes 
the advanced H-II will lift Japan into the commercial satellite business. 
However, analysts say the cost of the H-II's leading-edge technology -- coupled 
with the strong yen -- will make it too expensive to compete in the tough 
satellite-launching market. The H-II was developed at a cost of $2.4 billion.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Short-term interest rates surged Thursday amid speculation that the Federal 
Reserve Board may already be tightening credit. Long-term rates rose less 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market tumbled in early trading but rallied near the close to 
finish modestly lower, despite the rate jump. 
</P>
<P>
 * Key commodity prices rose strongly. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 With a regular meeting of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee as a 
backdrop, short-term interest rates rocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on three-month Treasury bills soared to 3.22% from 3.13% on 
Wednesday, and six-month T-bill yields rose to 3.36% from 3.30%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's failure to add liquidity to the banking system early Thursday, as 
short-term rates rose, convinced many bond traders that the central bank was 
already in the process of tightening credit for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had warned as recently as Monday that the Fed 
could be forced to boost short-term rates somewhat to keep the fast-growing 
economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 When the key federal funds rate -- the annualized rate banks charge each other 
for overnight loans -- rose as high as 3.5% on Thursday morning, the Fed's 
failure to intervene was seen as a sign it wants to push the rate a 
quarter-point above the current target of 3%. Fed funds closed at 3.13%. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term interest rates, however, didn't rise as much as short rates. The 
30-year T-bond yield finished at 6.31%, up from 6.28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key test for rates will come today, when the government reports on 
January employment. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got off to a weak start and remained depressed all morning and into the 
early afternoon as interest rates rose. 
</P>
<P>
 But the profit taking subsided later, and prices rallied back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials, down 26 points at midday, closed down 7.88 points 
at 3,967.66. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, losers beat winners by about 4 to 3 on the New York 
Stock Exchange and by a thinner margin on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Harrington, analyst at brokerage Interstate/Johnson Lane, linked the 
market's afternoon improvement to reports of strong January car sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if interest rates rise a bit, stock investors are unlikely to lose 
interest in the market as long as the economy stays healthy, many analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks jumped on the January sales news. GM gained 1 1/2 to 63, Ford 
rose 1 5/8 to 69 3/8 and Chrysler added 1 1/4 to 62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many other industrial issues also continued to rally on optimism about the 
economy. Nucor gained 1/2 to 59 5/8, Varity jumped 1 1/8 to 44 3/8, Phelps 
Dodge rose 1/2 to 56 1/2, GE gained 5/8 to 109 3/4 and Caterpillar advanced 3/4 
to 105 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Woolworth fell 1 1/4 to 24 5/8 after reporting that its 
January same-store sales rose just 2.2%. The company also said its fiscal 
fourth-quarter earnings will be well below year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other retailers reporting sales, Wal-Mart inched up 3/8 to 28 1/8, Ann 
Taylor surged 2 to 23 1/2 and Dayton Hudson added 7/8 to 67 3/8. Dillard lost 1 
1/8 to 35 1/4 and Nordstrom eased 1/2 to 34 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks were broadly lower as interest rates rose. J.P. Morgan fell 
1 to 70 7/8, Federal Home Loan Mortgage dropped 1 3/8 to 57 5/8, Citicorp lost 
1 to 42 1/2 and NationsBank slid 5/8 to 49 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But Countrywide Credit gained 1/2 to 27 5/8. The company said it funded 61% 
more in mortgages in January than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer chip giant Intel sank 2 to 63 1/4. Cowen & Co. downgraded Intel to 
"buy" from "strong buy," citing uncertainties stemming from recent legal 
setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt set a negative tone as stocks dove after the Bundesbank 
decided against a new interest rate cut. The DAX index lost 32.29 points to 
2,151.72. London's FTSE-100 fell 28.8 points to 3,491.5. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 
index eased 75.21 points to 20,174.82. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index soared to a record 2,822.51, up 37.61 points, 
awaiting Telmex's earnings report. After the market closed, Telmex said 1993 
operating earnings rose 5.9% on a 10% sales gain. In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold rebounded, rising $2.60 to $387.30 an ounce on the Comex, following a 
steep rally in silver. Silver shot up 13 cents to $5.47. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other commodities, sugar prices hit seven-month highs, while coffee 
prices jumped on export news from Brazil. However, energy prices were broadly 
lower after a three-day rally.

 Goldman Fined in Treasury Bond Scandal: Goldman, Sachs & Co., one of Wall 
Street's most powerful investment banks, agreed to pay $250,000 to settle 
charges it broke federal securities laws in the trading of U.S. government 
bonds. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Goldman settled an 
administrative case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC 
accused Goldman of prearranged purchases and sales of Treasury securities with 
Salomon Inc. and other brokers in 1985 and 1986, mostly as a way of beefing up 
losses for federal income tax purposes.

THE ECONOMY; RETAIL SALES HURT IN JANUARY BY STORMS, CALIFORNIA QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harsh winter weather and the 6.6 magnitude earthquake in Southern California 
kept consumers out of stores last month, but damage to merchant profits was 
limited by the relative insignificance of January results in the retailing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The weak numbers reported Thursday reflect the impact of ice storms and 
snowstorms in the East and Midwest, which deterred almost all shoppers but 
those buying coats, boots and snow shovels. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the quake damaged or destroyed hundreds of stores, including some 
operated by big national retailers. The disruption to the Los Angeles freeway 
system impeded shopper access to unscathed stores, hurting them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The results weren't unexpected. Walter Loeb, a retailing analyst and 
consultant, said he knew how January would turn out just by looking at a map. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of companies inundated by snow, earthquakes or anything else had very 
bad numbers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson Corp., with one-third of its stores in California, said the cost 
of lost business will result in a $25-million pretax charge against 1993 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., which operates the Broadway department stores, 
said January same-store sales -- those at stores open at least a year -- fell 
3.9%, reflecting the impact of the Jan. 17 earthquake. The quake temporarily 
closed 14 of its stores. As of Saturday, four remained closed. For the fiscal 
year ended Saturday, the Los Angeles-based retailer reported that same-store 
sales rose 1.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, January is a relatively unimportant month in the retail year, a fact 
that mitigated some of the bottom-line damage for many retailers. Stores 
generally use the month to clear out winter and Christmas merchandise and 
prepare for spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Salomon Bros. Inc., said that in spite of the 
elements, retailers' results showed "underlying consumer demand is quite 
favorable." 
</P>
<P>
 January's results marked the end of the 1993 fiscal year for most big 
retailers. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, again dominated 
the industry, with total sales soaring to nearly $67.38 billion from $55.48 
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry was sharply fragmented during 1993, reflecting a consumer shift 
toward home-related merchandise. Discount stores generally did well, and sales 
at department stores improved. Apparel retailers tended to founder. 
</P>
<P>
 Same-store sales are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 During January, Wal-Mart's same-store sales rose 5% from January, 1992, while 
total sales were up 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart Corp. said same-store sales rose 2.1%, while overall business was down 
1.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co. fared well in January, although its numbers were down 
slightly from its recent pace. It said same-store sales advanced 7.9% and 
overall sales rose 9.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 J.C. Penney said same-store sales at its flagship stores rose 4.6%, while 
total sales, including its drugstore and catalogue operations, rose 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson said same-store sales rose 2.9%, while overall business rose 
9.3%. The company's stores include department stores, the Target discount chain 
and the Mervyn's clothing chain. 
</P>
<P>
 May Department Stores Co. reported that same-store sales rose 5%, while 
overall sales gained 8.5%. The figures do not reflect the contributions of 
seven California stores temporarily closed by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated Department Stores Inc. said same-store sales fell 4.8%, while 
overall sales slipped 3.2%.

ORDERS TO MANUFACTURING PLANTS HIT 5-YEAR HIGH IN 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orders flowed to the nation's manufacturing plants at the briskest pace in 
five years during 1993, the Commerce Department said Thursday, indicating that 
the economy continued to gain momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 New orders in December grew 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted $266 billion, a 
fifth straight monthly increase. For all of 1993, orders climbed 5.9% to a 
total $3.1 trillion, the strongest rise since 8.4% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist James Padina of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles said a home 
building and sales boom and brisk sales of new cars late last year should keep 
the manufacturing sector growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of output, this momentum should not die down quickly, and employment 
gains should be at least a little better this year than was the case in 1993," 
Padina said. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate report from the Labor Department showed claims for unemployment pay 
leaped by 59,000 in the final week of January to 422,000, the highest level in 
a year and a half. But analysts discounted the significance of the figures 
because severe winter weather and the California earthquake may have distorted 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor's report today on January employment will be watched much more intensely 
for signs that a solid pickup in the manufacturing sector is paying off in 
better job prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-week moving average of claims, which gives a better indication of 
labor market conditions than the more volatile weekly number, rose to 377,250 
last week, up from 361,000 the prior week, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.2% gain in December factory orders followed a revised 1.7% increase in 
November business. The last time orders fell was in July, when they dipped 
1.9%. They have risen every month since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing gains were concentrated among industries that make durable 
goods, especially automobiles. But surging sales of new and used homes, boosted 
by low interest rates, also help companies that make household goods, furniture 
and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing plants report that business continues to grow. The National 
Assn. of Purchasing Management said business picked up for a fifth straight 
month in January, and rising orders lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders for transportation equipment were the strongest individual component in 
December, up 2.9% after increases of 5.1% in November and 5.7% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipments of motor vehicles and parts rose 3.5% after a 4.2% November pickup.

 Times Mirror Co., its newspaper group beginning to recover from the recession, 
Thursday reported a fourth-quarter profit of $161.8 million, contrasted with a 
year-earlier loss of $61.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based publishing and cable television concern said the latest 
earnings, equal to $1.26 a share, were aided by a $131.7-million gain from the 
sale of its broadcast TV stations to Argyle Television Holdings Inc.

 The results also reflect a variety of restructuring charges -- including 
voluntary employee-separation programs -- that totaled $76.4 million in the 
latest quarter and $183.7 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's fourth-quarter revenue climbed 4% to $1.02 billion, from $980.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's overall profit for 1993 totaled $317.2 million, or $2.46 a 
share, contrasted with a $66.6-million loss in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the onetime gains and various restructuring costs, Times Mirror's 
full-year income from continuing operations rose 5% to $161.5 million, from 
$153.5 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's annual revenue edged up 3% to $3.71 billion, from $3.59 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The company owns the Los Angeles Times and several newspapers in the East, 
including Newsday in New York and the Baltimore Sun. It also operates cable TV 
stations and publishes books and educational products. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strong performance by our newspapers in the fourth quarter helped boost 
earnings for the year," Times Mirror Chairman Robert F. Erburu said in a 
statement. "Fourth-quarter advertising revenues rose almost 6%, spurred by a 
10% increase in December." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the latest gains, Erburu said Times Mirror remains cautious about its 
outlook for 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 The company still faces "a weak Los Angeles economy, which lags behind the 
improvement on the East Coast," Erburu said, along with the impact of rate 
re-regulation in the cable industry and an ongoing restructuring of its Matthew 
Bender & Co. legal publishing group. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising revenue at the Los Angeles Times for all of 1993 fell 3.3% from 
the prior year to $775.7 million, but it rose by the same percentage at Times 
Mirror's Eastern newspapers, to $689.4 million.

FCC OKS RULES FOR NEW WAVE OF PERSONAL COMMUNICATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Congress debated how to give Americans access to advanced 
telecommunications, federal regulators Thursday cleared the way for a new 
generation of portable devices that might one day serve as phone, fax and pager 
in one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to finalize its rules 
for deploying so-called narrow-band personal communications services, a 
technology the agency said will "contribute to the development of the national 
information infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC said these services, initially limited to paging and data messaging, 
could be launched as early as September. But experts consider this the most 
primitive of a family of emerging wireless technologies that will eventually 
allow users to send and receive video, voice and computer data from the gadgets 
that are as portable as a wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, narrow band PCS could be a boon for the estimated 14 million people 
who now use pagers or mobile data services, experts say. And it would be an 
important first step toward a system of go-anywhere communications -- available 
as early as next year -- in which users would jettison separate work, cellular 
and home phones in favor of a single device and phone number they could carry 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to launch PCS came as the House telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee heard testimony about ways to ensure universal access to the 
emerging information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers said promoting competition would create more access to 
telecommunications services through lower prices. But Prof. Eli Noam of 
Columbia University urged lawmakers to set up a system of financial credits and 
debits to encourage providers to wire poor and rural areas as rapidly as 
wealthier communities.

THE ECONOMY; JANUARY SALES OF CARS AND TRUCKS TAKE OFF; AUTOS: COLD WEATHER, 
QUAKE FAIL TO DAMPEN MOMENTUM. BIG THREE SALES TOGETHER CLIMB 14.8% FOR THE 
MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Neither the frigid weather in the eastern part of the nation nor the 
California earthquake stalled the auto industry's momentum in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released by the auto makers Thursday show total car and truck sales -- 
including vehicles built in the United States and abroad -- were up 14.3% for 
the month. January's cold typically makes it a slow month for auto sales, and 
analysts were expecting worse results because of record low temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Three vehicle sales combined were up 14.8% for the month, compared to an 
11.4% improvement for Japanese auto makers and a 24.4% improvement for European 
and Korean auto makers, whose volume is much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these are excellent numbers, considering how bad the weather was," 
Salomon Bros. analyst Jack Kirnan said. "We are in the big 'B.' We are in a 
boom period." 
</P>
<P>
 On a seasonally adjusted basis, domestically built cars sold at an annual rate 
of 7.3 million, with imported cars accounting for another 1.8 million. 
Domestically built light trucks, which include minivans, pickups and sport 
utility vehicles, sold at a record annual pace of nearly 5.9 million, about 
600,000 ahead of last January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is coming together," Kirnan said. "Used car prices are staying 
high, interest rates are at record lows, massive replacement pressures for cars 
are continuing and employer and consumer sentiment is strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic auto makers, who lost 71,000 units of car and truck production in 
January due to the record cold, are moving to make up for those losses. They 
have added 111,000 cars and trucks to February and March production plans, 
according to the trade journal Ward's Automotive Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Credit the public acceptance of Chrysler's products and the continued 
strength of the economy for the strong month," said Theodor Cunningham, 
executive vice president of sales and marketing at Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler's 17.9% increase in truck sales led to the No. 3 auto maker's 
strongest January sales in four years. Car sales were up just 1.3% for an 
overall improvement of 10.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. said its truck sales were the best in history. Full-size 
pickups were up 45% from last year, leading to 21.9% higher overall truck 
sales. Five of six car divisions reported higher sales, contributing to a 13.6% 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. had a robust 34% increase in truck sales but a meager 1.2% 
improvement in car sales.

 Dialing I-love-you, let us count the cost: With Valentine's Day approaching, 
we surveyed the cost of sending a dozen long-stemmed roses via several 
toll-free ordering services. None are cheap; only one service, Flowers Direct, 
quoted a price under $50, including tax and delivery. Here's a rundown. 
</P>
<P>
 * (800) FLOWERS said prices ranged from $68.95 for a box to $88.95 if a glass 
vase was included. Prices include $8.95 for tax and delivery. But a customer 
service representative warned that prices will rise by $10 before Valentine's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 * (800) THE ROSE quoted us $83.44 -- $68.95 for the flowers and $14.49 for tax 
and service. Roses are shipped with a vase at no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * (800) SEND FTD quoted us $69.95 for roses and a vase. Boxed roses aren't 
available. We had to call a second number to find out the delivery charge is 
$8.95, bringing the total to $78.90 before tax. A service rep told us we could 
save $20 by sending a belated Valentine, delivered after Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * Calyx & Corolla, a catalogue flower service, said prices range from $68.95 
for a box of roses to $78.95 for a vase of them, including a $3.95 delivery 
charge. Tax is additional. 
</P>
<P>
 * RosExpress said roses shipped via Federal Express to arrive by Feb. 11 cost 
$69.99, while roses shipped via Express Mail to arrive on Valentine's Day cost 
$74.99. Tax adds about $5 to each total, a service rep said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flowers Direct, a toll-free service that connects you to a local florist, 
quoted us $47.63 for boxed flowers and up to $80.10 for flowers with a fancy 
glass vase, delivery and tax included. The florist told us the $4 delivery 
charge varies by florist and destination. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For post-Valentine's Day developments: Following the lead of such 
budget-minded competitors as 99 Cents Only Stores, the Target Stores discount 
chain is opening a bridal registry in its Chicago-area stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples registering at Target, a unit of Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson 
Corp., use scanner guns to "zap" bar codes on the items they want. The 
information is fed into a computer and printed out for gift givers at 
participating stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said Target executives believe that engaged couples "want 
functional gifts like power tools and stainless flatware." She said the company 
expects to expand the program nationwide. During a test run in Minneapolis last 
year, she said, 2,000 couples registered for such gotta-have items as 
toothpaste and soap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking it out: Citibank is mailing its credit card customers $3 checks to 
"endorse and deposit or cash at any bank." In an accompanying letter, Citibank 
says the check is its way of saying "thanks for your business" and introducing 
customers to its new "protection plus service." 
</P>
<P>
 More to the point, the check is Citibank's way of getting its customers to 
sign up for the new service. By cashing the check, the letter notes, customers 
agree to pay $39 for three years of protection plus a benefits package that 
covers losses on stolen credit cards, among other things. Citibank calls the 
deal a "$3 offer." Sounds like a $36 offer to us.

 Throwing away stones: A leading textile manufacturer has come up with a 
specially treated denim that appears to be stone-washed but isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing manufacturers launder jeans with abrasive pumice stones for up to 
four hours to achieve the popular look that accounts for up to 85% of jeans 
sales nationwide. A drawback is that heavy stone-washing can damage jeans, 
forcing manufacturers to repair them or sell them as seconds. Stone-washing is 
hard on washing machines too. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Industries of Greensboro, N.C., said the indigo in its "stone-free" 
denim breaks down quickly in the wash cycle, so in most cases no stones are 
required. (The exception: Burlington says stones are needed for the faded 
"destructed denim look.") 
</P>
<P>
 The stone-free fabric is being tested by Levi Strauss, Guess and Gap. 
Depending on the results of the tests, stone-free jeans, or almost-stone-free 
jeans, could show up in stores a year from now.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: BIG 3 AUTO STOCKS DRIVING INVESTORS INTO A FRENZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street knows the importance of momentum, and that's what it sees in car 
and truck sales this year. Auto-related stocks, therefore, remain a favorite 
way to bet on a stronger than expected economy in '94 -- even though most of 
the stocks have already zoomed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Big Three auto makers provided more inspiration for the 
bulls: Despite relentless cold in the eastern part of the country, and the 
earthquake in the Southland, January car and truck sales by General Motors, 
Ford and Chrysler were up nearly 15% versus a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors, who were stunned by Chrysler's robust fourth-quarter earnings 
report two weeks ago, responded to the latest good news by pushing shares of 
the Big Three up sharply again Thursday. GM rose $1.50 to a record $63, while 
Ford jumped $1.625 to $69.375 and Chrysler added $1.25 to $62.50. Both Ford and 
Chrysler are trading just under their all-time highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters now are stirring the frenzy for the auto shares by touting 
price targets in the $80s or $90s for the stocks a year or so down the road. 
The optimists' scenario: Car and truck sales continue to boom, earnings keep 
topping estimates, and waffling investors finally capitulate and jump in, lured 
in large part by the stocks' comparatively low prices relative to earnings per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A key assumption of the bulls, however, is that investors will believe that 
car and truck sales can continue to rise well into 1995 and 1996, if not 
beyond. In the auto industry and others that ride long cycles of boom and then 
bust, you don't buy the stocks if you can see the bust on the horizon. By that 
point, smart investors are already bailing out, anticipating the next downturn 
in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, almost nobody's talking bust. Among other things, experts point to the 
advanced age of cars and trucks on the road as a sure sign of sales yet to 
come. Ron Glantz, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, says at least one-quarter of 
the U.S. car and truck population is 12 or more years old. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, rising consumer confidence and faster job growth as the 
economy expands should put more Americans in the mental and financial states 
necessary to buy big-ticket items such as cars. "We're now getting employment 
growth, and generally you need a car to get to a job," notes David Hale, 
economist at Kemper Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the once-feared Japanese continue to lose market share to the Big 
Three, and nothing suggests a significant reversal of that trend soon. 
Chrysler's share of the car and truck market rose to 14.8% last year from 13.3% 
in 1992, while Toyota's dropped to 7.4% from 8.0%. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this feeds Wall Street's glowing earnings outlook for the Big Three. 
Ford, for example, is expected to report that it earned $4.12 a share in '93; 
it should double that figure between 1996 and 1998, according to Value Line 
Investment Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody buys the unending-growth story, however. Many money managers 
remain skittish about GM in particular because of its huge pension liabilities, 
which could severely hamper its finances. And some big investors simply worry 
that all the good news is already built into the Big Three stocks, with no room 
for trouble -- such as a rise in interest rates or an international incident 
that causes consumer confidence to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street is "striving to make this a secular (story), but I just can't 
convince myself that these stocks are anything more than the cyclical issues 
they've always been," says John Schaffner, manager of the $450-million 
Nationwide Growth stock mutual fund in Columbus, Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
 The bulls argue that skeptics just need time to catch Big Three fever. And the 
favorite of many analysts remains Chrysler, with its promising new-car lineup 
for '94, starting with the already- launched Neon in the small-car, low-priced 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chrysler has today's cars," gushes New York money manager Seth Glickenhaus, a 
major Chrysler shareholder. "They're on a roll." 
</P>
<P>
 But let's say you don't want to own the Big Three, yet you would like to play 
the auto boom. Is there a better way -- via auto parts suppliers, for example? 
Most analysts say no. Look at the price-to-earnings ratios on the parts 
suppliers' shares versus the Big Three's P-Es. The Big Three are still the 
better value, most auto bulls say. 
</P>
<P>
 A few possible exceptions: Federal-Mogul, a major parts maker and distributor 
seen in strong shape to benefit from future parts demand in the aftermarket 
(i.e., repairs) here and, importantly, abroad; parts retailer Genuine Parts, 
considered overlooked by some despite its powerful franchise in the United 
States, and Reynolds & Reynolds, a developer of data-processing systems for car 
dealers, many of whom need to modernize. Ready for Overdrive? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are analysts' consensus earnings-per-share estimates for major 
auto-related stocks (or actual numbers, if reported) and the stocks' 
price-to-earnings ratios based on 1994 earnings estimates. 05,21,09,11,08,09

U.S. LOWERS VOLUME IN GATT FILM DISPUTE; TRADE: ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT IS 
SEEKING A 'QUIETER DIALOGUE' IN ITS EFFORTS TO ADD HOLLYWOOD TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL ACCORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a significant tactical shift, the Clinton Administration has decided to 
take a lower-key approach to try to resolve a transatlantic dispute that left 
the multibillion-dollar movie industry out of the recent world trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Spero, undersecretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs, 
told reporters that the Administration is searching for what she termed a 
"somewhat quieter dialogue" on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a critical trade issue for us, (but) at the same time, we'd like to 
find a way to have a somewhat quieter dialogue with the Europeans," she said. 
"It doesn't mean the problem has gone away; it doesn't mean that we don't care 
. . . but we'd like to see what we can accomplish in a slightly lower tone of 
voice -- on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Spero's remarks followed meetings with European officials here and in Paris on 
a broad spectrum of trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Strenuous opposition from the 12-nation European Union -- opposition led 
primarily by France -- prevented the entire audiovisual sector from being 
included in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade reached Dec. 15, which 
is expected to remove an array of export barriers when it takes effect in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In her remarks, Spero indicated that European officials have also been 
receptive to the idea of searching for new avenues for talks, including 
industry-to-industry contacts, instead of only government-level discussions. 
She said there has been "some resonance both here and in France" for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. 
of America Inc., said he fully supports the new Administration approach, 
saying, "I am willing to talk to anybody anytime on the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official stressed that no details were discussed in the most 
recent meetings. The official described the contacts as "a first talk" since 
the Dec. 15 accord. "I think there is receptivity to a dialogue, but (there 
were) absolutely no specifics," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful that free trade in films and other media could unleash a tidal wave of 
U.S. imports that would erode its culture and severely weaken its own film 
industry, France has insisted that the EU be allowed to continue its policy, 
which sets a quota of 49% for the maximum amount of non-European productions 
aired on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans also want to retain film subsidies that in 1992 totaled about $700 
million and restrict non-European access to emerging technologies that are 
likely to be areas of major growth in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 To save the entire trade round from collapse in the final hours before the 
deadline to reach an accord, the United States and EU agreed to disagree on the 
issue. But the Administration has continued to pursue some form of agreement to 
allow the audiovisual sector to be included in the final accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is important because the film industry is one of the United States' 
major exporters. According to MPAA figures, films, television series and home 
videos produced in the United States generated $8 billion in revenue from 
international markets in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 While Americans tend to view the European attempts to limit U.S. film imports 
as a form of censorship, the French see Hollywood's motion picture muscle as a 
potential threat to their identity and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Those viewpoints have added a powerful emotional dimension to the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers flared again earlier this week when Valenti, in an open letter, 
criticized French film executive Daniel Toscan du Plantier for stating that the 
Los Angeles earthquake was proof that God was on France's side in the film 
trade dispute. Du Plantier, president of Unifrance Films, later apologized for 
the remark, which he said had been a "bad private joke told among friends."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND CLAUDIA ELLER: CONTRACT DEAL NEAR FOR MCA'S POLLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and CLAUDIA ELLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After protracted negotiations, MCA Motion Picture Group Chairman Tom Pollock 
is expected to sign a three-year contract extension as early as next week, 
though it appears doubtful that he will get the broader management 
responsibilities he has been seeking after eight years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions with MCA/Universal have lurched along for months, with Pollock 
lobbying for more authority and new challenges. One of his main strategic goals 
was to have MCA's home video division added to his domain, but sources say he 
made little headway in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This company has clung to the notion that home video is a bastard of 
ancillary rights and the record business and it's Tom's notion that home video 
is a major component of the motion picture business," one insider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollock's new contract would expire near those of MCA Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg. While all sides declined comment 
-- Sheinberg saying "we don't discuss our colleagues" -- Pollock's package is 
said to be much the same as his old one, which would still return him millions 
of dollars over the term of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 By extending his contract, Pollock also retains the power and prestige that 
come from running a major studio. Friends say that appeals to him more than 
returning to his law practice, or any other options. 
</P>
<P>
 With stability as a primary concern, Wasserman and Sheinberg never seriously 
considered anyone else for the job, sources say. There were also no obvious 
alternatives. "The feeling is 'why rock the boat?' " said one industry 
observer. 
</P>
<P>
 With Pollock, Universal production chief Casey Silver also is expected to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 That should lay to rest concerns on the studio lot, where deal signings have 
recently been hurried as a hedge against a power shift, even as Universal 
projected a confident image as the studio behind the record-setting "Jurassic 
Park" and the award-winning "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 At 50, Pollock is regarded as one of Hollywood's brightest and most 
buttoned-down moguls. Since his tenure began in 1986, Universal films have 
grossed a collective $4 billion. But the former entertainment lawyer has also 
come under criticism for the studio's mediocre performance in recent years. 
"Jurassic" and "Schindler" did little to ease the pressures on Pollock, since 
those successes have been solely credited to Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pollock has gotten high marks over the years for encouraging 
cutting-edge talent such as Spike Lee and, more recently, "Reality Bites" 
director Ben Stiller, he's also well known for frequently buying into expensive 
star- and director-driven packages from talent agencies. Universal is not known 
for developing a large number of its projects in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects often flow into the studio's pipeline through deals Pollock has 
secured with such high-profile filmmakers as Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Sydney 
Pollack, Robert Zemeckis and Ivan Reitman. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Tom is very smart, but my feeling is that he's allowed himself to be driven 
more by deal and marketing considerations than he was at the beginning, when he 
let his gut guide him," said one source who has worked closely with Pollock 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though "Jurassic" has taken in nearly $900 million worldwide so far and 
is the highest-grossing film ever (helping give the studio a 14.2% market share 
last year), the rest of the slate largely tanked. Apart from modest successes 
such as "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story," "Carlito's Way" and "Beethoven's 2nd," 
Universal's slate included "Matinee," "Cop and a Half," "Heart and Souls," "The 
Real McCoy" and "Mad Dog and Glory." 
</P>
<P>
 This year looks more promising. Besides 1993's holdovers -- "In the Name of 
the Father" and "Schindler," which is considered likely to win the Oscar for 
best picture -- there are strong expectations for Ron Howard's "The Paper," 
"The Flintstones," and this Christmas season's "Junior," re-teaming Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito and director Reitman of "Twins" success. Also 
potentially promising could be the remake of "The Getaway" and "Reality Bites," 
starring Winona Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to be Universal's costliest production of the year is "Waterworld," a 
big special effects-laden film starring Kevin Costner and directed by Kevin 
Reynolds, set for summer, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pollock's future seems secure through 1996, outsiders wonder what will 
become of him and the rest of MCA's senior management after that. Wasserman and 
Sheinberg signed five-year extensions when Japan's Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co. bought the company for $6.6 billion in 1991. But sources say 
there's no long-range succession plan in place. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Grandiose plans: With his $10-billion bid for Paramount Communications, QVC 
Network Chairman Barry Diller certainly has grand ambitions. But does he 
qualify as a "grand sponsor?" That's what some supporters of last week's AIDS 
Project Los Angeles' Commitment to Life benefit were loudly pondering after 
Diller was given top billing in the program. APLA could not be reached for 
comment. But sources pointed out one explanation for the 
self-aggrandizing-sounding title: Diller gave "a ton of money" to the benefit.

TV NETWORKS JOIN TO FUND RATINGS RESEARCH; MEDIA: PROJECT'S AIM IS TO IMPROVE 
AUDIENCE MEASUREMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

 In a move that could set the stage for the creation of a rival to the A.C. 
Nielsen TV-ratings service, the three major commercial networks said Thursday 
they have commissioned Statistical Research Inc. (SRI) of New Jersey to develop 
and test methods of improving TV audience measurement. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital Cities/ABC, NBC and CBS each have made what was described as a 
multimillion-dollar, multiyear commitment to the research project through the 
Committee on Nationwide Television Audience Measurement, an industry group to 
which they and the National Assn. of Broadcasters belong. 
</P>
<P>
 SRI, an independent research firm specializing in media, marketing and 
statistical research, has done work for TV and radio networks and advertisers. 
It also produces RADAR, a network radio audience measurement service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to develop better audience measurement," said David Poltrack, 
vice president in charge of audience research at CBS. He and other CONTAM 
members hope the new project will motivate Nielsen to make changes in its 
current ratings technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be less than honest if I didn't say this is also designed to ease the 
eventual entry (into the TV-ratings business) by competitors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Nielsen, a unit of the Dun & Bradstreet Corp., is the only 
national TV-audience measurement service remaining in the United States. The 
networks, which each pay millions of dollars a year to obtain the data, 
previously have supported some failed rival services. 
</P>
<P>
 The three broadcast networks, which have seen their audiences decline steadily 
over the past decade amid the growing number of alternative video outlets, have 
expressed dissatisfaction with the Nielsen ratings service, whose determination 
of how many people are watching a given program helps determine the amount of 
money broadcasters can charge for commercials. They maintain that the Nielsen 
numbers are imprecise and do not reflect the ways people view TV in today's 
multimedia environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Loftus, a vice president at Nielsen, said, "We welcome any research that 
would improve the quality of audience measurement. But we think everyone should 
be included. We don't just measure the three networks -- there's the Fox 
network, 33 cable networks, ad agencies, syndicators and others . . . who bring 
their own agendas to the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Schiavone, vice president for media and marketing research at NBC, 
said the networks hope to persuade other TV companies and ad agencies to join 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Loftus acknowledged that the networks' backing of SRI's effort "is designed to 
prod Nielsen." But he said, "I doubt if the three networks want to get into the 
business of setting up a multimillion-dollar ratings service." 
</P>
<P>
 London-based AGB Research, the originator of the "people-meter" to measure TV 
audience, was said to have lost about $67 million in trying to bring its 
service to the United States in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 SRI executives were vague about what they consider the advantages of their 
system, which is still under development. They said it requires no special 
wiring in the home and is "user-friendly."

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; PARAMOUNT SIGNS '48 HOURS' DIRECTOR HILL TO 
2-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paramount Pictures, which has been suffering from uncertainty caused by the 
tug of war between QVC Network Inc. and Viacom Inc. over parent Paramount 
Communications Inc., scored a coup by signing director Walter Hill and his 
wife, Hildy Gottlieb, to a two-year non-exclusive deal.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill is a prolific director and writer whose most recent film is "Geronimo: An 
American Legend" for Columbia. Hill also wrote, with Amy Jones, the screenplay 
for Universal's upcoming "The Getaway." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's signing comes amid reports that Paramount executives are finding it 
hard to do business because of the uncertainty over who will eventually end up 
with the company. But William Morris executive John Burnham, who brokered the 
deal along with the agency's Leonard Hirshan and Arnold Rifkin, said 
negotiations have taken place since about November and the takeover was not a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walter has faith in himself and what he does," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's "48 Hours" was a big hit for Paramount in the 1980s. Burnham said Hill 
is working for Paramount on "Sudden Country," set in the late 1800s in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb was president of actor Alec Baldwin's Meadowbrook Productions at 
Orion, and before that was an agent at International Creative Management. 
</P>
<P>
 * Atlantic Records confirmed rumors that Grammy-winning producer and composer 
David Foster has been recruited as senior vice president. Foster also entered 
into a long-term agreement with the label to produce Atlantic Group acts. 
</P>

Atlantic's Big Beat Records in the label's new West Coast office. 
</P>

 Television: Home shopping channel ValueVision International launched a hostile 
bid for infomercial giant National Media Corp., offering $61.2 million, or 
$10.50 a share, for enough stock to seize control.The bid values National Media 
at $146 million. ValueVision, which already owns 1.2 million National Media 
shares, promised to offer the equivalent of $10.50 a share for the remaining 
shares if it succeeds in gaining a 50.2% stake. National Media has grown 
through infomercials such as "Juice Tiger," "Amazing Discoveries" and a pain 
relief infomercial staring Frankie Avalon. National Media's directors spurned a 
previous ValueVision offer. ValueVision has retained Salomon Bros. to help with 
financing. National Media declined to comment. JAMES BATES

ALICE'S RESTAURANT ON MALIBU PIER; GETS A LAST CALL FROM ITS LANDLORD; 
LANDMARK: THE STATE SAYS THE FAMED EATERY, NAMED AFTER AN ARLO GUTHRIE SONG, IS 
BEHIND ON ITS RENT. THE BUSINESS'S OPERATOR CHARGES THAT OFFICIALS RENEGED ON A 
PROMISE TO REPAIR THE WHARF.

 Two decades of earthquakes, mudslides and furious winter storms could not 
topple Alice's Restaurant from its landmark perch on the Malibu Pier. But now 
the celebrity hangout faces a more potent threat: eviction by its landlord, the 
state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Department of Parks and Recreation, which owns the pier, hit the 
restaurant owners with a 30-day eviction notice Tuesday, demanding "significant 
amounts of unpaid back rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-owner Bob Yuro, who opened Alice's in 1972, conceded that he has often been 
behind on rent since 1991, but vowed to fight the eviction on the grounds that 
the state had reneged on a promise to apply rents to renovate the decrepit 
pier, badly damaged in a 1983 storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute only compounds the restaurant's financial troubles -- it suffered 
$70,000 damage and slower business as a result of last fall's wildfires -- and 
throws into doubt the future of a Malibu icon favored by surfers and Hollywood 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cher would come in with all her young boyfriends and you'd have Elizabeth 
Taylor sitting next to some Danish tourists -- everyone would just fit in 
together," said Nancie Evoniuk, who worked as a waitress at Alice's for eight 
years. "Arnold Schwarzenegger came in with his cigar once and none of us had 
the guts to tell him to put it out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, where tequila-fortified waiters have been known to toss 
themselves off the pier in full dress, also became a favorite spot for riding 
out large surfs. "You'd always have these crazy people wanting to sit at the 
end of the restaurant with the waves smashing into the windows and watching 
surfers shooting (through the supports of) the pier," Evoniuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage caused by storm-tossed surf is a central part of the current 
dispute. Yuro said the state, which paid $2.5 million to a private owner for 
the pier in 1980, has not honored an agreement to use rents to fix up the 
battered pier. The renovation cost has been estimated at $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 13 years I have paid them nearly $2 million in rent and 
absolutely no repairs to the pier have taken place," Yuro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials who oversee state recreation department concessions declined to 
comment on the eviction action or were unavailable. A department announcement 
did not specify the amount of unpaid rent owed by Alice's. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuro's company, Japademy Inc., had sought a 20-year contract with the state to 
manage any business on the pier but could not land the concession after four 
years of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed plan, the restaurant would have been required to pay for 
the renovation. A sticking point in the talks reportedly had been the state's 
unwillingness to grant sufficient rent abatements to induce the owners to make 
the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Yuro's plans for the pier included an additional restaurant, 
gift shops, a jazz club and an expanded sport-fishing business.  
</P>
<P>
 The recreation department said it plans to find another concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers doubted that the pier business could generate enough money 
to cover the renovation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is unrealistic that someone can take over the huge job of 
renovating the pier by themselves," said Madelyn Glickfeld, a member of the 
state Coastal Commission. "You'd almost need a Century City skyscraper on the 
pier to recoup enough money to restore it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, people have warned that the 88-year-old pier is a disaster waiting 
to happen. Winter storms have snapped pilings and yanked bait platforms away 
from moorings. The pier, built by a prominent Malibu rancher, was nearly wiped 
out by a storm in 1942. Rebuilt in 1944, it served as a wartime station for the 
U.S. Coast Guard. The state bought it in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals are already girding for a fight to save the restaurant, which was named 
after the famed Arlo Guthrie song and is, in some people's minds, a historic 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Rod Steiger, an Alice's regular, said the place is one of the few 
remnants of old Malibu, which has been largely swept away by a tide of strip 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no sense of tradition, we don't honor the past," Steiger said. "In 
Europe, a restaurant like this would have the whole neighborhood out there, 
doing whatever they could to save it."

LAPD CLASHES WITH D.A.'S OFFICE ON SHOOTING; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE REFUSE TO 
TURN OVER DOCUMENTS IN INVESTIGATION OF WOMAN'S SLAYING BY OFFICERS. GRAND JURY 
IS CONVENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office have squared off over a controversial police shooting case, 
with the LAPD refusing a request for documents on the incident and the district 
attorney convening a grand jury in response, sources close to the investigation 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sources, county prosecutors recently requested internal LAPD 
documents concerning the fatal shooting of Sonji Danese Taylor on a hospital 
rooftop Dec. 16. That request was rebuffed by LAPD commanders, who reportedly 
said they wanted to complete their inquiry before turning over their findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated in their efforts to secure that material, prosecutors then sent the 
matter to a grand jury, the sources said. That grand jury took sworn testimony 
last week from five police officers who witnessed the shooting, sources said, 
as well as from at least two civilians who were on the roof of St. Vincent 
Medical Center when Taylor was shot by two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor suffered 10 gunshot wounds. Seven shots struck her in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither prosecutors nor police officials would comment publicly Thursday on 
the standoff between the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not our position to comment in any way relative to the activities or 
investigations of any of the agencies looking into this matter," said Cmdr. 
David J. Gascon, a spokesman for the LAPD. "Our position is that we have a 
responsibility to do a very comprehensive investigation and then present the 
facts uncovered in that investigation through the chain of command. The matter 
will be appropriately reviewed at every level, including the use-of-force 
review board and the chief of police." 
</P>
<P>
 Other police officers said the district attorney's decision to convene a grand 
jury angered the officers who were called before the panel, as well as LAPD 
officials. The officers who were forced to testify had just completed 12-hour 
earthquake duty, which colleagues said deepened the resentment that they and 
some other officers felt toward county prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, however, prosecutors were said to be deeply frustrated by 
the LAPD's unwillingness to supply evidence it has relating to the Taylor 
shooting. The Police Department has refused to turn over such material in the 
past, and prosecutors say it hinders their ability to quickly and completely 
review police shooting cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the district attorney has taken this to a grand jury, we think that's the 
right step," said attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who represents Taylor's 
family. "We need some level of independence by the prosecutorial effort, and 
this may help ensure that." 
</P>
<P>
 An initial LAPD press release on the Taylor shooting said she had a knife in 
her left hand and was holding her 3-year-old son in her right when officers 
found her on the hospital rooftop. Hospital security guards had called police 
after discovering Taylor on the roof, and police say Taylor was yelling "For 
the blood of Jesus!" while cradling her son and the knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers used pepper spray on Taylor and succeeded in forcing her to drop 
the child. At that point, however, they say she continued to threaten them with 
the knife. Two officers, Sgt. Michael Long and Officer Craig Liedahl, fired 
nine shots at Taylor, killing her. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report found that Taylor suffered a total of 10 gunshot wounds; 
one bullet may have struck her more than once. Seven of the bullets hit her in 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD and the district attorney's office opened parallel investigations 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the inquiries said prosecutors briefly questioned four 
of the police officers but spent much longer with the fifth, a young 
probationary officer. The officers and other witnesses were asked about the 
details of the incident and were questioned about how seven of the nine bullets 
hit Taylor in the back, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury has not subpoenaed Long or Liedahl. It is unusual for the grand 
jury to subpoena anyone who may be the target of a criminal prosecution because 
compelled statements by witnesses cannot be introduced as evidence at trial. 
Defendants have the right not to be forced to incriminate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although grand juries have the authority to approve or reject a request to 
indict a criminal suspect, sources familiar with the Taylor case say this grand 
jury so far appears only to be investigating the matter. Neither police 
officers nor other witnesses can refuse to testify before a grand jury, so 
prosecutors can use the panel to secure evidence and testimony that they might 
otherwise be unable to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the district attorney's inquiry and the internal LAPD 
investigation, the Taylor shooting is being reviewed by the FBI's Los Angeles 
field division, which opened a preliminary investigation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision was applauded by several community groups Thursday, some of whom 
had written to the Justice Department to complain about the shooting and to 
call for a federal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to say thank you," said Kahlid Shah, president of Stop the 
Violence/Increase the Peace Foundation. "The shooting of this young lady is 
totally unjustifiable, and it doesn't matter if the police say she was 
disoriented or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Gipson, president of Youth Against Violence, agreed and said the 
community will monitor the progress of the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is to let everyone know that we are prepared to follow this 
whole case all the way to the end," Gipson said. Times staff writer Lisa 
Richardson contributed to this report.

PARENTS' GIFT OF LIFE; MEDICINE: ONE YEAR LATER, FAMILY CELEBRATES SUCCESSFUL 
LUNG TRANSPLANT THAT MADE MEDICAL HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the first weeks of 1993, Stacy Sewell, then 21, was fighting for every 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor warned Jim and Barbara Sewell that their daughter was about to lose 
her lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
 But a year ago last Saturday, all three members of the Sewell family took part 
in a risky medical experiment that snatched Stacy from death's door. At USC 
University Hospital, a team supervised by Dr. Vaughn Starnes removed parts of 
Jim's and Barbara's lungs and sewed them into Stacy's chest. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time two living donors had been used in a lung transplant and 
the first lung transplant performed on a cystic fibrosis patient. The operation 
raised medical ethics questions because it put three lives in jeopardy at one 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet today there are no regrets in the Sewell house, located on a scenic rise 
in Quartz Hill, just west of Lancaster. On the anniversary of the historic 
operation, the family popped open a bottle of champagne they had received a 
year earlier from a member of the transplant team. 
</P>
<P>
 And this afternoon, the family will return to the hospital to join Starnes, 
other staff members and other transplant families in an anniversary 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sewells have good reason to celebrate. Although they are sometimes winded 
by heavy exertion, Jim, 56, and Barbara, 50 -- who each gave up one lobe -- say 
it has not affected their normal routines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most remarkable change is in Stacy. Before the surgery, she was 
tethered to an oxygen machine around the clock, sometimes too weak to wash her 
hair. Today, she plays tennis, works 20 hours a week at a clothing store, 
attends college and stays out till 2 a.m. with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, she was sick and dying," Jim Sewell said. "Today, she is alive 
and healthy and has a life ahead of her. It is a completely different person." 
</P>
<P>
 Cystic fibrosis, an inherited disorder that affects about 30,000 Americans, 
causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs. This leads to chronic lung 
infections and the destruction of critical air sacs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Sewells' operation, Starnes has performed six successful transplants 
involving cystic fibrosis patients and their living relatives. But few doctors 
nationwide have followed suit because the technique is still new and poses some 
risks to the living donors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Washington has taken no position on this 
surgery and refers inquiries to leading physicians in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, lung transplants only involved organs from recently deceased 
donors. But about 1,200 people nationwide are on a waiting list, and a patient 
typically must wait more than a year for a transplant, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Living-donor operations are an option when a patient cannot wait a year. But 
transplant experts say they only work when the recipient is smaller than the 
donors. In these cases, the two small donated lobes provide normal lung 
capacity for the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputed that Stacy Sewell was days away from death just over a year 
ago. Even so, her family says, Stacy possessed a powerful will to live and a 
knack for beating the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 She had confounded her doctors' prediction that she would die before her first 
birthday, her mother says. After a difficult childhood, her health improved as 
a teen-ager. When she graduated from Quartz Hill High in 1990, most of her 
classmates were unaware of her ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late 1992, her health had taken a turn for the worse, forcing her to 
leave her job and college. By then, Stacy was so weak that her father had to 
carry her upstairs to her room, piggyback style. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Stacy, a petite woman with wavy brown hair, says she was most upset 
about the loss of independence. "I did not like the way my life was," she said. 
"I didn't like being dependent on so many people, and I didn't like being 
housebound." 
</P>
<P>
 By January, 1993, Stacy was hospitalized with a dangerously fast heartbeat, 
caused by her failing lungs. Because of her grave condition, Starnes asked 
Stacy's parents to consider a living-donor transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that because Stacy was so weak, she had only a 50-50 chance of 
surviving the surgery. Her mother now says, "At no point during this did we 
really think she wouldn't make it. We never stopped to think that she might 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 After the operation, when Stacy was disconnected from a respirator, "I felt 
like I was breathing with somebody else's body," she said. Although Jim Sewell 
was discharged in 10 days, his wife developed an infection that required 
additional surgery. She remained in the hospital for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel guilty to this day," Stacy told her mother recently. "What you 
went through was awful."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 4 
UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS ARRESTED IN SPOT CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police separately arrested four unlicensed contractors in the San Fernando 
Valley on Thursday in the department's first post-quake crackdown on illegal 
construction activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Daniel Gonzales, 37, of Reseda; Juan Ortiz, 35, of South Gate; 
Agustine Serrano, 33, of Canoga Park, and Jose Flores, 27, of Sylmar were each 
charged with one felony count of contracting without a license in a declared 
disaster area.If convicted, the men face a maximum sentence of up to 16 months 
in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were arrested during a spot check of residential construction activity 
in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. Lt. Ken Welty of the LAPD's fraud unit said 
more random licensing checks are planned.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; OWNER WHO 
BURNED STORE IN RIOTS GETS PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man convicted of torching his Long Beach market during the riots was 
sentenced Thursday to five years probation and 1,000 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Stout, 59, faced up to eight years imprisonment, and prosecutors argued 
that he should spend at least a year in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly could justify putting you in custody," Superior Court Judge 
Michael Tynan told Stout. "I'm not going to do that because I've had an 
opportunity to observe you for a lengthy period of time," he said. "I think 
you're a pretty decent guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The father and son owners of Eddie's Market were originally charged with one 
count of arson during an emergency with additional firearms allegations. During 
the trial, Tynan reduced the charge to the unlawful causing of a fire. Stout, 
who says he is bankrupt, must also pay $10,000 restitution. His 36-year-old 
son, Bryan, was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The store was set afire April 30, 1992, at the height of rioting in Los 
Angeles. Civil unrest swept the area after four police officers were acquitted 
on all but one charge in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he understood prosecution arguments that Stout was 
irresponsible for starting a fire when firefighters were desperately needed 
elsewhere. But he did not think Stout was a danger to the community.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
ADULT MAGAZINES BANNED FROM FIREHOUSE -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge refused Thursday to loosen a ban on adult magazines in county 
fire stations, but he told attorneys to prepare their arguments and come back 
March 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Steven Johnson had sought a preliminary injunction against 
enforcement of the ban on Playboy, Penthouse and Playgirl, pending trial of his 
lawsuit.Johnson claims he has a 1st Amendment right to read the magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 The department, supported by the local chapter of the National Organization 
for Women, says the magazines violate sexual harassment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson said it was an unusual 1st Amendment case 
because Johnson works for the government. To get a preliminary injunction, 
Johnson would have to prove the county's policy was too general, covering any 
magazines that publish nude photos, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson indicated that the case would probably focus on whether Johnson's 
possession of a magazine would interfere with efficient operations, and whether 
the public would encounter the magazines.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
GARCETTI SEEKS WAY TO FORCE JACKSON ACCUSER TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti announced Thursday that he is 
sponsoring a legislative amendment that would allow prosecutors to attempt to 
force a 14-year-old boy to testify against Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti acknowledged at a news conference that a reported multimillion-dollar 
settlement nine days ago of a lawsuit that the teen-ager filed against Jackson 
prompted his effort to overturn a section of the California Code of Civil 
Procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 That section states that "no court may imprison or otherwise confine or place 
in custody the victim of a sexual assault for contempt when the contempt 
consists of refusing to testify concerning the sexual assault." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said his proposal would take away that legal protection, even from 
children, only if they have filed a civil suit in their cases, or if they have 
accepted a monetary settlement. Filing a suit indicates a willingness to get on 
a witness stand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts have noted that the civil code section, as currently written, 
would protect the boy if he balked at testifying against Jackson in a criminal 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, the experts said, made it unlikely the boy would give such 
testimony. And without his testimony, they said, the prosecution's chances of 
success in a criminal case are weakened.

<P>
 School officials said they will reopen El Camino Real and Kennedy high schools 
Feb. 15 -- two weeks earlier than planned -- because the state has assured the 
Los Angeles Unified School District that portable classrooms will be in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Supt.Dan Isaacs said he expects the two campuses to resume classes 
in portable bungalows until earthquake-damaged classroom buildings are 
repaired. Parents who do not wish to wait may enroll their children in other 
high schools within the district for the semester, Isaacs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the district expects about 95% of the students to return to El 
Camino Real and Kennedy when those campuses reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and staff at Van Gogh Street Elementary in Granada Hills, which has 
been closed because of large cracks and fissures throughout the campus, will be 
relocated to Frost Middle School, officials said. Classes also will start Feb. 
15.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICIALS EXPECT GRANT 
FUNDS FOR COLISEUM REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first grants for repair of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum could come 
next week, two state officials said Thursday after a tour of the 
earthquake-damaged facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Word about the possible grants came from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, the officials said.Douglas P. Wheeler, secretary for resources in the 
Wilson Administration, and Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of 
Emergency Services, added that they have an agreement with FEMA to block 
demolition of the Coliseum, a national historical landmark, while they strive 
to assess the damage and create a plan to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Coliseum Commission's project director for the rebuilding, Don 
C. Webb, said he is hopeful that $17 million in federal funds will be granted 
next week to allow at least a start on repair work. Webb has said the work will 
cost at least $33 million and possibly more if hidden damage is discovered by 
structural engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new commission president, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, said FEMA officials have told her that the White House has expressed 
interest in expediting the Coliseum work. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tour for state officials, workers from the Tutor-Saliba Corp. were 
taking tiles off the peristyle section, stripping ivy from the stadium's walls 
and demolishing a small section of the upper concourse level to get behind the 
facades for a direct examination of cracks in the superstructure. Tutor-Saliba 
is doing the work under a continuing contract for Coliseum renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he expects a structural engineering report by the middle of next 
week that will identify the damage with enough precision to begin repair work 
if the federal grant is forthcoming. KENNETH REICH

THE PURPLING OF PERSHING; COLORFUL TOWER, FAUX FAULT LINE ARE HIGHLIGHTS OF 
RENOVATED PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The radically redesigned Pershing Square, its 10-story purple bell tower 
chiming music over Downtown streets, was dedicated Thursday as a symbol that 
Los Angeles can renew itself despite riots and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new Pershing Square," Mayor Richard Riordan said in an emotional speech, 
"is a bold statement of what Los Angeles is -- a city that looks forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and other officials recounted how the five-acre park had decayed 
into a dangerous and dirty turf until the $14.5-million face-lift, more than 
half financed by owners of nearby property. The square now provides, Riordan 
said, "a special place for peopleand nature, a pause in a busy day's work, an 
open space among skyscrapers and hotels, a breath of fresh air, a vision of 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 people, mainly invited guests, attended the dedication Thursday of 
what is the park's fifth remake since it was set aside as public space in 1866. 
They eagerly inspected new features such as the bright yellow cafe, the 
waterfalls and tidal pool, and the bench decorated with Los Angeles postcards 
from the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, there was much nervous humor about one park walkway that was 
whimsically paved and shaded to resemble an earthquake fault -- months before 
the Jan. 17 Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the designers must have had some special knowledge," Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Rita Walters said of the faux fault line. Artist Barbara McCarren, 
who designed it, joked that she expected to be invited soon onto late-night 
cable television talk shows to discuss her psychic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling the block enclosed by 5th, 6th, Hill and Olive streets, Pershing 
Square will open to the public Sunday. A free festival between noon and 5 p.m. 
will include a gospel choir, a mariachi band, Korean folk dancers and a circus 
workshop for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban planners from around the nation will be watching to see if the park 
attracts a lively and well-behaved mix of Downtown shoppers, workers and 
tourists or if it descends again into being a campground for the homeless and 
an open-air bazaar for drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reviews were mixed and included some puzzlement at the work of architect 
Ricardo Legorreta and landscape architect Laurie Olin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the big purple thing is, but it looks cool," said 
9-year-old Morgan Segal, who came with her Carpenter Avenue Elementary School 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Robert Rodriguez, an MTA bus operator who once worked in 
the garage beneath the park, wished for "something better in terms of the 
architecture and design. It just seems to me that a lot of it is just something 
sticking out of nowhere." He also worried that the park's many walls may create 
dangerous hiding spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Rangers have the main responsibility for security but LAPD officers, 
transit police and guards from the nearby Biltmore Hotel and garage will also 
patrol the square. Well-lit, but unfenced, the park is supposed to be 
off-limits from 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. Counselors will offer homeless visitors 
van rides to shelters. To further discourage overnight camping, the park has no 
public bathroom and its grounds are mainly concrete and crushed granite, with 
only a modest lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Legorreta, who flew in from his Mexico City home, said some of his design was 
altered for safety concerns. But the architect contended that real safety will 
come from citizens who "react positively and say 'Let's respect this place.' "

NEIGHBORS MOURN 'GRANDMA'; CRIME: GRIEVING FRIENDS SAY JOAQUINA MARIE LINFOR, 
WHO WAS FOUND SLAIN, WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC FREE SPIRIT.

 The sight of 82-year-old Joaquina Marie Linfor patrolling the sidewalks and 
stooping to tend flower gardens in her South Gate neighborhood was a familiar 
and comforting one to her neighbors. Linfor had keys to the next-door 
elementary school's gates and would check the grounds late at night and visit 
with custodians. A former South Gate Azalea Queen, she was often seen at city 
functions, collecting tickets or baby-sitting children. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday she was gone and the streets seemed empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Linfor was found dead in her apartment in the 2600 block of Poplar Place early 
Wednesday by a neighbor who said he saw her door ajar, then discovered her 
lying face-down with her hands tied behind her back. A sheriff's spokesman said 
Thursday that detectives had no leads. Linfor, known as Marie to her friends, 
was well liked by teachers and children at Liberty Boulevard grammar school, 
where many called her "Grandma," said Jyotsna Patel, co-owner of the Seville 
Motel, Linfor's neighbor.  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Sam McCall, who found Linfor's body, remembered the bilingual 
grandmother's ability to track "all the cars parked along the street, and all 
the people walking up and down it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we'll do without Marie," said McCall's wife, Grace, who 
said Linfor came over every morning to chat with her and to help weed her 
flower garden. "She watched out for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison Griffin, principal of Liberty Boulevard school, called Linfor an 
"enthusiastic free spirit" and said teachers plan to plant a tree in her honor 
or dedicate a plaque on the school's front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "She took care of our school seven days a week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linfor, who leaves three stepsons, 11 grandchildren and 25 
great-grandchildren, was also popular with South Gate city officials, who 
worked closely with her after she was crowned queen of the city's Azalea 
Festival two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told her she couldn't be as old as she was, she had too much energy," South 
Gate Mayor Mary Ann Buckles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very big loss, and that doesn't even sum it up."

BACKERS OF DISMISSED CHINESE TV REPORTER PLAN RALLY 
</P>

 Sparks are flying among members of the Taiwanese community over the 
replacement of a popular Chinese anchorman who aired a controversial broadcast 
last week about the Taiwanese premier's visit to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say Joseph Jinn, a 38-year-old reporter for KSCI Channel 18, a 
cable station based on the Westside, was fired because influential Taiwanese 
officials wanted to censor media reports that reflected unfavorably on Premier 
Chan Lien's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 But detractors, including Jinn's former boss, say the reporter resigned Jan. 
26 rather than be fired for violating professional standards. They say Jinn 
editorialized during a Jan. 25 news broadcast that described the premier's 
visit in disrespectful terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is expected to intensify Saturday, when Jinn's supporters predict 
that up to 300 people will attend a meeting in Monterey Park for the veteran 
journalist, who created the Mandarin-language news program on KSCI and hosted 
it for almost four years. The show reaches an estimated 260,000 viewers in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Jinn expressed bafflement at his termination and 
denied using inappropriate language or editorializing on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fired because my reporting doesn't please the Taiwanese 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy sprang from a news report in which Jinn recounted details of a 
Jan. 24 reception held for Lien at the Universal City Hilton. Although 
translations of the broadcast differ, Jinn said he commented that some tables 
were partly empty and that the premier's speech brought the audience almost to 
the point of boredom. He also said that the $600,000 in emergency aid that the 
premier announced would be donated to victims of the Northridge earthquake was 
small compared to the $13 million that Taiwan has earmarked for Honduras, the 
premier's next stop on his tour of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at KSCI maintain that Jinn called the premier "smug and complacent." 
Additionally, the station says that Jinn described the reception as a "song and 
dance showcase full of undeserved praises and flattery" and used phrasing that 
implied the Honduras money was "political bribery." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Yu Mo-Si, a Taiwanese community leader who supports Jinn, says 35 Chinese 
groups have written letters to KSCI expressing their anger at the firing and 
accusing the Taiwanese government of censoring freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwanese government officials said they do not get involved with local 
politics. KSCI officials termed the allegation of government influence 
ridiculous and denied they had been pressured to fire Jinn.  
</P>
<P>
 "He editorialized on the air, which was totally inappropriate," said Rosemary 
Danon, general manager of KSCI. "We can't tolerate that."

COMPTON SCHOOLS GET NEW ADMINISTRATOR; EDUCATION: STATE APPOINTEE JEROME HARRIS 
PROMISES TO OVERHAUL THE TROUBLED DISTRICT FINANCIALLY AND ACADEMICALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Veteran school district administrator Jerome Harris took control of the 
Compton Unified School District on Thursday, announcing that he would work 
around the clock to rejuvenate the troubled school system financially and 
academically. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, former superintendent of the Atlanta public schools, will serve as the 
district's state-appointed administrator, replacing interim administrator 
Stanley G. Oswalt. Harris will have czar-like powers to run the financially 
strapped school system, which also has some of the lowest student test scores 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a 24-hour person," Harris said of his dedication to education. "This is 
my golf. This is my tennis. This is what I do. This is what I work at. This is 
what I have fun at. This is what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Unified came under state control in July as a condition of an 
emergency state loan. Community critics have called the takeover illegal and 
accused the state administration of mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 63, accepted the Compton job after a nationwide search to find a 
long-term administrator for the school system of 28,600 students.  
</P>
<P>
 "I come here committed to putting students first, putting students second and 
putting students third," said Harris at a Thursday news conference. "After 
that, I'll deal with everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Academically, if all students are not better at this time next year, you 
ought to come after me," said Harris, who arrives with a reputation for plain 
speaking and for improving student achievement in minority, urban school 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris headed the Atlanta public school system from 1988 to 1990. During his 
term, student scores on the Georgia Test of Basic Skills improved significantly 
in reading, writing and mathematics. He also oversaw rising test scores while 
heading an urban school district in Brooklyn, N.Y. From 1960 to 1973, Harris 
was a teacher or administrator at three Los Angeles high schools. Most 
recently, Harris directed a trouble-shooting program aimed at improving public 
school districts, based at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Former board member Kelvin D. Filer said Harris' sincerity and pragmatism 
impressed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Oswalt also praised Harris, and added that the state intervention has already 
ended years of financial mismanagement and taken the first steps toward 
improving academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, however, including school board member Amen Rahh, are already 
angry. Rahh said he was angry that school board members were not invited to 
Harris' introductory news conference. Rahh said that the state administration 
has stripped the district of its financial resources and made administrative 
decisions that have harmed minority students and employees.  
</P>
<P>
 The student population is 59% Latino, 39% African American and 2% other 
ethnicities. A majority of employees are black. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same policies will be here (under Harris)," Rahh said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a reception Thursday, Harris wooed about 100 parents, employees and 
community members, some of whom greeted him with hostility and distrust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an embarrassment to me as a black that students who look like me aren't 
doing well in their academic performance," said Harris, who is African 
American. "I believe that kids who are dark and different, Latino and African 
American kids, can learn." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not the enemy," he told one critic. "I'll need your help to do what I 
need to do."

EXPERTS AT UCI MEETING ASSAIL CONGRESSMAN'S HEALTH PLAN; INSURANCE: THEY 
COMPLAIN THAT ALTERNATIVE TO CLINTON PROPOSAL RELIES ON VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION 
AND IS TOO EXPENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of one of California's largest health maintenance organizations on 
Thursday sternly criticized a Democratic congressman's proposed health plan 
that is being promoted by hundreds of the nation's most powerful business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 A vote Wednesday by the Business Roundtable, composed of 225 heads of the 
largest U.S. corporations, thrust into the limelight a health care reform plan 
offered by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
 While many members of the roundtable praised Cooper's plan, which is less 
ambitious than the Clinton Administration's proposal, it was not received well 
by many attending a health care conference Thursday at UC Irvine -- including 
Dr. Robert Gumbiner, chairman of Fountain Valley-based FHP International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt we need reform," Gumbiner said. "But the Cooper plan just 
won't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The deep divisions that surfaced among business and health executives in 
Orange County over which health plan would best cure the ills of the nation's 
health care system mirrors the debate that continues on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, many health care experts said, the health care reform plan that 
does emerge at the end of the year will be unlike any being proposed in 
Washington today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what the final plan will be?" said David Anast, publisher of the 
Biomedical Market Newsletter in Costa Mesa. "All the plans have some merit. How 
they will be incorporated, no one knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it embraces the Clinton idea of banding consumers together in large 
buying groups called purchasing alliances, the Cooper plan does not require 
employers to pay the majority of their workers' health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also make joining a health alliance voluntary, though it encourages 
universal health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Business Roundtable endorsement of Cooper's proposal has forced other 
executives to scramble to examine the effects of the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Several health experts, who had gathered at UCI's third annual Health Care 
Forecast Conference, decried the Cooper plan, calling it expensive and 
unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumbiner and others said the Cooper plan fails because it is voluntary, and 
therefore unenforceable. It would also increase health premiums because fewer 
people would contribute to insurance funding pools than under the 
Administration's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative reform plan, they said, also would increase so-called cost 
shifting -- a process that results when those who have no insurance use medical 
services at hospital emergency rooms, shifting the cost of their care to higher 
premiums for companies that provide employee insurance benefits and to 
individuals who pay for their own policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "An employer mandate is the only workable method," said Dr. Melvyn Sterling, 
president of the Orange County Medical Assn. "I don't know how you can" enforce 
health care reform "without that component." 
</P>
<P>
 But others saw Cooper's plan as a way to speed up health care reform, because 
the less-restrictive proposal seems to have strong bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach-based Rockwell International Corp. and Irvine engineering firm 
Fluor Corp., both members of the Business Roundtable, called the Cooper plan a 
better alternative because it cuts the bureaucracy inherent in the Clinton 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, we concur that there is no single program available today that 
will adequately address health-care reform," said Debra Land, a spokeswoman for 
Fluor, whose chairman, Les McCraw, sits on the roundtable's policy committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the Cooper plan is a better starting point than the Clinton plan," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell spokeswoman Joy Sabol said the aviation, electronics and 
high-technology company also supports the new reform proposal. "We believe its 
principles are good." 
</P>
<P>
 And Thomas Sutton, chairman of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Newport 
Beach, also thought the Cooper plan was superior to the White House proposal, 
but he criticized it for endorsing purchasing alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small employers will no longer be able to negotiate and purchase coverage for 
their employees from a private insurer," Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana nurse Wendy DeVreugd, who traveled last year to Washington and 
studied various reform plans, said her biggest concern is backing a proposal 
that places additional bureaucracy on an already complicated health system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what happens when government controls take over," said DeVreugd, whose 
duties at a local hospital include juggling cases between doctors, patients, 
hospital administrators and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need flexibility if we are going to get anything done," she said.

BORLA REVS UP PERFORMANCE; TRANSPORTATION: EXHAUST-SYSTEMS COMPANY MAKES A NAME 
FOR ITSELF WITH CAR BUFFS. THEY SPEND BETWEEN $330 AND $3,000 FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

 Sell American high-performance auto mufflers to the Japanese on their home 
turf? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just a pipe dream for Borla Performance Industries. Last month the 
Oxnard company introduced its first product for the Japanese, an exhaust system 
for Corvettes, at a Tokyo auto show. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Borla, president of the 11-year-old company, said marketing his 
exhaust systems in Japan is a sound move. "We're riding the wave of American 
automobiles that are winding up in Japan. Every year I see more and more," as 
jeeps, sports cars and Harley-Davidson motorcycles are getting popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla's company, which he claims did $3 million in sales last year, has made a 
name for itself with a line of stainless-steel exhaust systems. The systems 
extract more power from an auto or truck's engine because they work more 
efficiently at getting the hot gasses out of the engine than conventional 
exhaust pipes, mufflers and catalytic converters. Most of his customers are 
baby boomers who remember the "muscle cars" of the '60s and are willing to 
spend more to squeeze extra power out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ford, General Motors or Chrysler produces a vehicle, the mufflers are 
designed to be as quiet as possible, Borla said. But about 10% of the owners 
are willing to put up with a bit more noise to improve acceleration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of spending $60 at Midas for a new muffler, these car buffs will spend 
from $330 to $3,000 for a Borla exhaust system. About 50 small companies in the 
U. S. make high-performance exhaust systems that they sell through specialty 
auto parts shops and the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla and its competition have thrived, independent experts say, because the 
exhaust system "is the cheapest, most effective way to get a rear-wheel 
horsepower increase in any kind of vehicle," said Dick Gazan, owner of Spectra 
Racing & Engine Development in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sherman, a Huntington Beach racing-engine builder, said he uses less 
expensive exhaust systems that "perform as good or better" than the Borla 
models, but credits Borla with offering a quality product. "He makes everything 
out of stainless steel. Right away the price goes up," Sherman said. "But it 
should last about three times as long. You might say he has the Cadillac line 
of mufflers." 
</P>
<P>
 Borla Industries and its Japanese distributor, Startline Inc., hope to offer 
exhaust systems for the American vehicles most popular in Japan, including 
Camaros, Firebirds, Jeep Cherokees and Chevrolet Astro vans. "The Japanese are 
. . . heavily into the American auto scene so they want American parts on their 
cars and motorcycles," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet Japan's emissions laws and other requirements, Borla recently became 
the first company based outside Japan to join the Japan Automotive Sports 
Muffler Assn. On his trip to Japan last month, Borla said he met with U. S. 
Ambassador Walter F. Mondale, who complimented him on working his way into the 
Japanese market. "He was very interested in how we became successful in Japan 
and interested in using the same formula to help other companies," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla said that, within five years, Europe and Asia, which now account for 10% 
of his company's sales, will increase to 25%. With the expansion into Japan, 
his goal is $600,000 in foreign sales in 1994. The company sells currently in 
Australia, England, Canada, Germany and New Zealand, the Arab Emirates, Brunei, 
Holland and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Borla's mufflers stand out? "You can take any of our mufflers and 
look right through it," he said. "Other mufflers have baffles -- or what I call 
'mazes and rat traps.' The hot exhaust gasses have to go all over the place," 
which diminishes engine power. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla has two patents and a third pending for a combination muffler and 
catalytic converter that enhances performance and reduces emissions. A big auto 
maker, Borla claims, has expressed interest in utilizing the technology under 
license for its exhaust systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a fast, agile set of wheels has always been a priority for Borla, a 
Romanian immigrant who was fascinated with autos as a teen-ager. In 1976 he 
started a New York company that made replacement exhaust systems for 
Rolls-Royces and Bentleys. But his heart remained with sports cars and racing. 
"I got bored with the stodgy, old people who owned Rolls-Royces. I wanted to 
get involved in performance vehicles," Borla said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold the East Coast operation and moved across country, leased space and, 
starting with $7,000 and 10 new employees, opened his company in 1983. Over the 
years he got publicity by developing exhaust systems for the auto makers' 
"concept cars" exhibited at auto shows. He also advertises in about 30 auto 
magazines, including Car and Driver, Road & Track and Motor Trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Borla offers exhaust components for about 200 vehicles, from exotic Ferraris 
and Lamborghinis to more subdued Chevrolet Suburbans. When Borla started, he 
was in the highbrow Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche market. But he saw that the 
money was in volume, so he shifted the product line to the larger American 
market and started making exhaust equipment for Corvettes and full-size pickup 
trucks. Today his list prices range from $332 for a Chrysler Eagle Talon 
exhaust system to $3,048 for a Lamborghini Diablo. 
</P>
<P>
 "European cars have gotten so expensive. You can go out and buy a $20,000 
American car and blow away an $80,000 Mercedes," said Borla, who drives a 1993 
Ford Mustang Cobra equipped, naturally, with Borla mufflers. By the time he's 
through tweaking and adding a supercharger, he figures he'll have about 450 
horsepower under the hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall the company, which now has 50 workers, moved to a five-acre site 
that will include an emissions lab, an eighth--mile drag strip, a slalom course 
and a skid pad to test cars fitted with Borla mufflers  
</P>
<P>
 To diversify, the company plans to eventually sell a turbocharging system for 
Harley Davidsons in Japan. But Borla's growth has been fueled by aggressive 
marketing. Sales of the company's mufflers and exhaust systems, which he said 
are available as dealer-installed options at Ford dealers nationwide this year, 
could produce another $800,000 in sales this year.

FHP INTERNATIONAL'S 2ND-QUARTER EARNINGS RISE TO $10.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 FHP International Corp., holding a line on costs while adding new members to 
its health maintenance organization, said Thursday that its second-quarter 
earnings rose 66% to $10.3 million, or 31 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 This compares to net income of $6.2 million, or 19 cents a share, for the 
previous year's second quarter.Revenue grew 27% for the three-month period 
ended Dec. 31 to $591.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old company attributed its quarterly revenue gain to a 14% 
enrollment growth, particularly in its Southern California, Utah and Nevada 
service areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good improvement. It shows that FHP is continuing to work on its 
cost structure," said Mary O'Connell, an industry analyst at Louis Nicoud 
Associates in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP, one of the state's larger HMOs, posted six-month net income of $21.5 
million, or 64 cents a share, up from a profit of $12.6 million, or 38 cents a 
share, for the first half of its previous fiscal year. Revenue rose 32% to $1.2 
billion, from $908.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, FHP offered to acquire TakeCare Inc. in Concord for $829 million 
in cash and stock, or a value of $62 a share. The bid was lower than a 
stock-swap offer valued at $64.50 a share from United HealthCare Corp. in 
Minnesota, but TakeCare directors accepted FHP's offer. A shareholder lawsuit 
to block the sale to FHP is pending.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: 4 BANKS PROVIDE WYLE LABS A $50-MILLION LINE OF CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wyle Laboratories went shopping for money to support last summer's major 
expansion efforts and walked away Thursday with a $50-million line of credit 
from four banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyle, one of the nation's larger marketers and distributors of high-technology 
electronic products, will use the money for working capital until 10 locations 
it opened last June in the Midwest and the East reach the break-even point, 
said Van Holland, the company's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyle, which in September moved its corporate headquarters to Irvine from El 
Segundo, expects to reach that point this summer, Van Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The line of credit is being provided by Continental Bank in Chicago, Bank of 
New York, NationsBank in New York and NBD Bank in Detroit.

BERGEN BRUNSWIG LOOKS NORTH WITH $1-BILLION SHOPKO DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Bergen Brunswig Corp., expanding its reach across the Northern states, said 
Thursday that it has signed an exclusive contract to supply ShopKo Stores Inc. 
with pharmaceutical products for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal with the Green Bay, Wis., company is expected to eventually generate 
$1 billion in sales for Bergen, with an average of $200 million in annual 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement gives Bergen a major stake along the Northern tier as it 
distributes goods to ShopKo's 118 stores in the upper Midwest, Mountain and 
Pacific Northwest regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contract, ShopKo also will use Bergen's computer-based product and 
information management system, which will expand ShopKo's ability to centralize 
its pharmaceutical purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen's automated distribution system and other assets are "very high 
quality, state of the art," said Kevin E. Silverman, an industry analyst with 
Kemper Securities in Chicago. "The company seems to have a new urgency to do 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen, which has been going through a corporate restructuring, also has been 
working to lower its overhead to compete with other major drug distributors 
such as McKesson Corp. in San Francisco, said William Jelin, an analyst with 
Hamilton Investments in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract with ShopKo isn't a big one considering Bergen's overall sales -- 
$6.8 billion for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30 -- Jelin said. Silverman 
figures the $200 million in annual sales will amount to 2.6% of the company's 
expected revenue this year of $7.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone would love to have this contract," Silverman said. "In terms of 
percent addition to revenue, it may seem small, but that's a reflection of how 
big Bergen is." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the companies could not be reached for comment.

KMART PLANS TO OPEN THREE SUPER STORES IN O.C.; RETAIL: THE SITES, EACH 
FEATURING A PHARMACY, GROCERY AND CAPPUCCINO CAFE, WILL BE IN ANAHEIM HILLS, 
ALISO VIEJO AND LA HABRA, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Super Boxes are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what retail specialists have dubbed a concept that Kmart Corp. is set 
to bring to Orange County: A combination discount department store, 24-hour 
pharmacy, grocery and cappuccino cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three sites are being readied, according to local real estate 
sources. The stores will be in Anaheim Hills at the Riverside Freeway and Weir 
Canyon Road; in Aliso Viejo on Aliso Creek Road in the planned Pacific Park 
Town Center; and in La Habra at Imperial Highway and Idaho Street, on the site 
of the former La Habra Drive-In. A possible fourth store is being considered 
for Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Troy, Mich.-based Kmart, which now operates 14 stores in Orange County, 
declined official comment Thursday on future Orange County locations. One store 
manager, who asked not to be identified, said the first Super Kmart is 
scheduled to open in October in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing coincides with three Wal-Marts that are said to be opening in 
Orange County. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which is based in Bentonville, Ark., has 
so far declined to confirm its expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 One site said to be a future Wal-Mart location in Laguna Hills would be less 
than two miles from the planned Aliso Viejo Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the new Kmart will compete head-on with Wal-Mart and Target," said 
Greg Mickelson, a retail broker in the Newport Beach office of Grubb & Ellis 
Commercial Real Estate. "And part of it will compete with all of the grocery 
chains." 
</P>
<P>
 Retail consultant Linda Crowley, president of Irvine-based Linda Crowley & 
Associates, said the influx of such super stores is going to be too much for 
Orange County to digest. Across the freeway in Anaheim Hills, the Festival 
Marketplace is already struggling, she said. The center contains a Target and a 
3-D Bed and Bath. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to get hit" by the new arrival, Crowley said. "The super boxes 
are getting real aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Price Club, Costco and Sam's Club also compete in this category of large, 
low-price destination retailers, she said. Sam's, a division of Wal-Mart, 
purchased 91 Pace Membership Warehouse locations in November from Kmart. Half a 
dozen are in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It remains to be seen whether the retailers can make any money competing that 
aggressively," Mickelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart operates 19 Super Kmarts across the nation. The first opened in Medina, 
Ohio, in July, 1991. The retailer has announced plans for 50 more during 1994.

 Pacific Scientific Co.: Strong demand for its so-called brushless motors will 
boost 1993 net income more than 48% to $8 million, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which designs, manufactures and markets electrical equipment and 
aircraft safety equipment, said the expected earnings would amount to $1.50 to 
$1.52 per share.Net income for 1992 was $5.4 million, or $1 a share. Annual 
revenue should rise to about $195 million from $172.7 million the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Official results won't be released until early next week, a company 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, the company expects net income to rise more than 25% 
to $2.3 million, or about 40 to 42 cents a share. Net income for 1992's final 
quarter was $1.6 million, or 30 cents a share. Quarterly sales are expected to 
range from $55 million to $57 million, up from $46.2 million in the same 
quarter a year earlier.

 PacifiCare Health Systems: The Cypress-based health maintenance organization 
said Thursday that it has chosen Ketchum Advertising in Los Angeles to handle 
its account, which has an estimated value of $8 million to $10 million."We are 
looking for this agency to solidify our brand and launch it on a national 
scope," said Ellen Santoni, advertising manager for PacifiCare. The HMO 
operates in six states now. Its account had been handled by Santa Ana-based 
Baxter Stone.

THE AGE OF NIP & TUCK; PEOPLE HAVE LONG GONE UNDER THE KNIFE TO TRY TO UNDO THE 
EFFECTS OF TIME AND GRAVITY. TYPICALLY, THEY WERE IN THEIR 50S AND 60S. NOW, 
THIRTYSOMETHINGS--AND YOUNGER--ARE GOING FOR FACE LIFTS, COLLAGEN INJECTIONS 
AND CHEEK IMPLANTS.

 Vanessa was tired of looking old and tired. Staring into the mirror at the 
dark bags under her eyes, she'd place her fingers over the half-moons and 
think, "I'd feel so much better if I didn't have these." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she did something about them. At 34, Vanessa, who requested 
anonymity, had the saggy skin tightened up. 
</P>
<P>
 Having plastic surgery at that age is hardly a shock. But having it at that 
age to look younger is a bit of one. Although surgeons note that 
fortysomethings and under aren't exactly rushing en masse to demand 
appointments, facial rejuvenation surgery, as it's known in the trade, is 
becoming increasingly popular with younger women and men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in practice for 20 years," says Dr. Dennis P. Thompson, president 
of the Los Angeles Society of Plastic Surgeons, "and I'm definitely seeing 
patients coming in at a younger age. The average patient when I started my 
practice 20 years ago was a woman in her late 50s or early 60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, his typical facial rejuvenation candidate is 10 to 15 years younger. 
Still, such patients make up "probably less than 5% of the average plastic 
surgeon's practice," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What do they want? Major and minor procedures, including face lifts, eye 
surgery to lift droopy lids or saggy under-eyes, liposuction to erase double 
chins, removal of fat from chubby cheeks, forehead lifts, collagen injections, 
cheek implants and chemical peels. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as if our fascination with youth culture is growing, so much so that 
men and women still in or barely out of their 30s are looking for ways to put 
off the natural signs of aging. Plastic surgeons, aestheticians, patients and 
psychologists offer a variety of reasons for the downward curve, from cultural 
pressures to the greater acceptance of plastic surgery, to gaining an edge in 
the youth-tilted job market, to being more attractive date bait, to "Roseanne 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to ask the patient why they want to have the surgery," Thompson 
says. "Somebody can have way-out reasons at 55 or 35. I could say, 'I've got an 
operation that I think will improve your appearance, and there's a good 
risk-benefit ratio.' If someone who's 35 comes to me and says, 'Look at these 
heavy jowls,' and I don't see anything, I'll tell them I don't have an 
operation to prevent them." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone who comes through a surgeon's door merits surgery, doctors say, 
but age isn't usually a disqualifying factor. More important is whether the 
surgeon believes he or she can markedly improve a patient's appearance, and 
whether the patient has reasonable expectations about the outcome. One plastic 
surgeon said he had done an eye lift on an 18-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stanley Frileck, a Brentwood-based plastic surgeon, says he sees more 
younger patients these days, including more men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having plastic surgery earlier to forestall the need for (it) later on is 
something that makes sense to people," he says. "The whole idea of rejuvenation 
surgery is to do it (at a time when) you actually need it, and . . . at a time 
(when) you tend to hold your appearance longer, while those around you are 
aging rapidly. So you look like you've made a pact with the devil. The people 
who are coming in have bought that rationale, understand it, agree with it, and 
that's what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But having a face or eye lift at 37 doesn't preclude the need for more nips 
and tucks down the road. The skin's elasticity, as well such factors as sun 
exposure, determine how long a procedure lasts. As one surgeon put it: 
"Gravity's working from the minute we take the last stitch out." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa, who works as an office manager in Los Angeles, went to her surgeon to 
talk about having liposuction on her stomach. When she mentioned how much her 
eyes -- a legacy from her father -- bothered her, the doctor said he could 
excise the saggy skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I had it done (last June), I thought it was great, that I looked much, 
much younger," she says. "For a long time (before the surgery), I'd look in the 
mirror and think, 'I haven't had enough sleep,' and then I realized that after 
two years I still hadn't had enough sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Staring into the mirror and seeing Mom or Dad staring back -- complete with a 
deeply creased forehead or sagging eyelids -- has driven more than a few people 
to the surgeon's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times people will have a family tree that will include a double 
chin," says Dr. Malcolm Lesavoy, professor of plastic surgery at UCLA and chief 
of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. "Now, 
liposuction, in some younger patients who have resilient and elastic skin, can 
help very much by reducing the amount of fat (without) having to have a formal 
face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that people are having more sagging skin at an earlier age," he 
adds, "but more patients at an earlier age are thinking about it. . . . There's 
nothing whatsoever wrong with looking 40. I'm not so sure the bottom line is 
that (people who merit surgery and have it) will actually look younger. It's 
not like they're going to look 18. If they look tired and haggard, they'll 
still look 40 (after surgery), but they'll look better." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the younger rejuvenation patients simply consider age a disease they 
can prevent. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, 40-year-olds were well entrenched in careers and family; today, 
they're changing careers and starting families, says Wanda von Kleist, a Los 
Angeles- and Chicago-based psychologist and lecturer. Armed with copious 
information on the evils of cholesterol, fat, alcohol and tobacco, and the 
benefits of exercise, the baby boomers are light-years ahead of their parents 
in terms of self-improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the psychology of aging, the things that make people feel 
young are excitement for life, flexibility in the body and the mind, muscle 
strength, stamina, and feeling fit physically and mentally," Von Kleist says. 
"But there are people who really buy into the idea that plastic surgery is the 
only way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Images of firm, poreless skin surround us. We spend billions on face creams, 
hair dye, exercise programs and surgery to roll back the clock. We revere 
actresses and models whose beauty is astounding, yet few of us stop to think 
what they may have done to achieve their looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't divorce yourself from the cultural influences," Von Kleist says. 
"We don't have many models of what a healthy, vibrant woman looks like at 30, 
40, 50. We have some -- Hillary Clinton, Jeane Kirkpatrick -- but until you 
have other images of what vitality and beauty look like, it's all in the 
physical realm of a 20-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Von Kleist suggests a way to alter this perception: "We expand our idea of 
what beauty is, to include more dimensions until physical beauty is an aspect 
that has no more weight than any others. We need to develop our fullness as 
human beings, not just physical beings, and to glorify that to the exclusion of 
everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary, 40, is blunt when explaining the reason for his "lower two-thirds face 
lift. The doctor's first question was, 'What brings you here?' and I said, 'In 
a word, vanity.' "  
</P>
<P>
 After losing 45 pounds, the L.A.-based retail manager was unhappy with the 
double chin that stuck around. "I would have had it done five years ago, but I 
didn't have the money then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran into a friend five days after the surgery and he said, 'I can see 
you've got some swelling, but you look so incredible, you look so young!' I did 
look older because of the fat that was hanging. I didn't have wrinkles, but 
that look (of a double chin) does come from age." 
</P>
<P>
 And how does he feel about aging? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that's always bothered me, the thought of getting older. 
There's nothing you can do about it, and who wants the alternative? But if I 
can do something about it, I will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many men and women in the entertainment industry apparently share that view; 
doctors say they account for much of the under-40 facial rejuvenation set. 
After all, this is a business in which aging can mean being relegated to 
unglamorous roles -- or no roles at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Delany knows the pressures well. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in L.A. long enough, you do think about plastic surgery -- it's 
almost impossible not to," says the 36-year-old actress, who has not had her 
visage altered. ("I'm blessed with a young face.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had many discussions with friends about it," she says. "They say, 
'Should I do it?' And I've said, 'Should I do it?' Something inside me always 
says 'no.' . . . The Puritan in me says, 'God gave me this face, it's what 
makes me unique.' If I age, I'll have earned every line." 
</P>
<P>
 Delany says she even looks forward to growing older. "I'm dating a younger man 
right now, and it's the first time in my life I've felt older. I've always been 
the younger one in a relationship. I like it. And I much prefer being in my 30s 
than in my 20s, and I think that my 40s are going to be even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Others refuse to go gently into that good night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Klinger is president of Georgette Klinger, whose plush multipurpose 
beauty salon on Rodeo Drive caters to countless clients who have been lifted, 
tucked, liposucked and reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's not against plastic surgery, Klinger is alarmed by the recent 
trend of younger women going under the knife. "Nobody can look that bad in 
their late 30s or early 40s that they need a lift," she says. "I think it comes 
from insecurity, and putting too much emphasis on wanting to be perfect. Your 
40s should be your best time; we should have confidence in ourselves and enjoy 
life. But it's contagious -- one person in a group does it, it's follow the 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind seeing some fine lines on myself," the 43-year-old Klinger adds. 
"It doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Would she at some point consider plastic surgery? 
</P>
<P>
 "Later, sure. But I don't want to have three face lifts in my lifetime."

FASHION; HI-YO SILVER!; THERE'S A VEIN OF THE SHINY STUFF IN SILVER LAKE

 Deep-six the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass on the brass. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hills of Silver Lake, there's silver to be had: silver sunglasses, 
silver gloves, silver jewelry. And, yes, even silver slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Overlooking a reservoir, Silver Lake is east of Hollywood, surrounded by 
Downtown Los Angeles, Atwater Village and Los Feliz. But the multilingual 
community that gets its moniker from the lake's argentine reflection has 
another kind of reservoir: its collection of funky sidewalk shops offering an 
eclectic, silvern mix of clothing, spiritual artifacts, eye wear, decor and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The hippest areas to shop are along Hyperion Avenue (between Lyric Avenue and 
Griffith Park Boulevard) and Sunset Boulevard (between Golden Gate and 
Hillhurst avenues); Hyperion and Sunset run perpendicular. Metered parking can 
be easily had for 25 cents an hour (a bargain in L.A.!) in safe surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, you'll find a children's bookstore, flower shops, an Army Surplus store, 
a gift shop specializing in Native American items, a Honduran goods boutique 
and thrift stores hawking the latest on the retro fashion front: vinyl car 
coats ($15), sparkling 1930s and '40s evening gowns ($15 and up), well-worn 
flannel shirts ($6) just right for grungy days and nights, and puka-shell 
necklaces ($5 and up). 
</P>
<P>
 Need an easy chair, lava lamp or cafe-inspired divan? Several used- and 
antique-furniture stores boast these offerings from the past for the perfect 
present-day lived-in look. 
</P>
<P>
 And always within walking distance, a cup of creamy cappuccino or chips and 
salsa or pasta primavera can be whipped up at a sidewalk cafe or quaint 
neighborhood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, you might even enjoy Silver Lake landmarks from the early 
history of film. 
</P>
<P>
 Home to the ABC Television Center and KCET, Los Angeles' primary 
public-television station, Silver Lake was familiar ground to the "Keystone 
Kops," Tom Mix, Charlie Chaplin, "Fatty" Arbuckle, Laurel and Hardy, and Gloria 
Swanson, who worked at studios along Glendale Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney's first studio at 2719 Hyperion Ave. was the place where he and 
animator Ub Iwerks crafted the early Mickey Mouse cartoons, as well as Snow 
White and the Seven Dwarfs. A Mayfair Supermarket parking lot now occupies that 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 And 4473 Sunset Drive is the former site of D.W. Griffith's grandiose Babylon 
set for his 1916 film "Intolerance." Today, the site houses the Vista movie 
theater, which, of course, has a silver screen.

 Women aren't the only ones who get makeovers. Cosmetics counters do, too. In 
hopes of wooing women away from such stores as the Broadway and Robinsons-May, 
mass merchandisers known more for their microwaves than their mascara have 
gussied up their cosmetics departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Where only a few hutches of makeup once stood unattended at the Sears in 
Torrance, for example, two huge glass and chrome display islands now house 12 
makeup and skin-care lines: Revlon, L'Oreal, Almay, Flori Roberts, Frances 
Denney Classic, Frances Denney Sensitive, Color Me Beautiful, Cosmyl, 
Eco-Suisse, Dermablend, EB 5 and Exclusives by Georgette Mosbacher. The 
Mosbacher line, a complete makeup system, is sold only via TV and at Sears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't upgraded these cosmetics counters so much as introduced them," 
says Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond. "It's part of our strategy to focus on the 
woman -- the CFO, or chief financial officer, of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Mega-counters (3,000 square feet or more) featuring everything from eye liner 
to eye creams were rolled out late last year in seven Sears stores (Buena Park, 
Cerritos, Costa Mesa, Montclair, Oxnard, Torrance and Westminster), with more 
scheduled over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-time "beauty advisers" staff the departments. They receive training from 
individual suppliers but don't push any one brand. Customers can even serve 
themselves at the Revlon and L'Oreal counters, 12-foot-long display units 
packed vertically with foundation, eye makeup, nail polish and lipstick. (The 
only drawback to self-service: "Some of the customers think the open stock are 
testers," one adviser says.) 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Sunday at the Sears in Torrance's Del Amo mall, a gaggle of 
teen-agers hovered around the Flori Roberts makeup testers. Two of the girls 
worked their magic on a third, who started to look like Elvira, Mistress of the 
Dark.  
</P>
<P>
 They might have consulted Georgette Mosbacher's how-to video playing on the 
adjacent Exclusives counter. The self-contained $89.99 Exclusives line involves 
a step-by-step system based on skin tones (light, medium, tan and dark). It 
contains lip, cheek and eye colors; tinted moisturizer; foundation; mascara; 
concealer; pencils; powder, and makeup tools. The color schemes lean toward the 
traditional, not the trendy. 
</P>
<P>
 But "younger kids are wearing brown or red lipstick -- that's why you'll find 
them over at Revlon or L'Oreal," says beauty adviser Patti Sakimoto. With a 
lipstick in either line costing $6.25, price is also a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitor JCPenney also recently revamped its cosmetics counters in selected 
stores (Glendale, Culver City, Torrance, Northridge). Out went the old standbys 
-- Max Factor, Almay, Coty and Revlon -- and in came the new: Ultima II, 
Charles of the Ritz, New Essentials, Payot, Cosmyl, Flori Roberts, Color Me 
Beautiful, Dermablend, Fernand Aubry, Mavala, and Frances Denney Classic and 
Sensitive, along with dozens of designer perfumes. Other Penney stores carry 
five or six of these lines, except for the cosmetic-less Santa Monica and 
Granada Hills stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've changed our whole image. Because that's where the demand is -- 
customers want better cosmetics and fragrances," says Gloria Smeal, cosmetics 
specialist for the JCPenney in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Is brand-name makeup less costly at Sears or Penneys than in higher-end 
department stores? An informal survey shows prices are comparable. Says Sears' 
Drummond: "The product lines are value-priced, but they're not discounted."

SCREEN STYLE / BETTY GOODWIN: BETTER DRESSED THAN THE COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Series: "Hard Copy"; airs weeknights at 7:30 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: The personal woes of America's favorite tabloid fodder -- Tonya, 
Michael, Burt and Loni -- vie with celebrity romances and movie-of-the-week 
crime news for air time on the magazine-format series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Anchors Barry Nolan and Terry Murphy (both pictured) dress neither 
as corporate as CBS news anchors Dan Rather and Connie Chung nor as 
unrelentingly zippy as news-entertainment hosts John Tesh, Mary Hart and Leeza 
Gibbons of "Entertainment Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan wears dark jackets, white shirts and bold, abstract-print ties. Murphy 
leans toward jackets, open-neck blouses and an occasional turtleneck. 
</P>
<P>
 This duo is far better turned out than their competition on "A Current 
Affair." There, host Maureen O'Boyle inhabits the cocktail-attire zone, while 
field reporters favor jeans and no neckties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palette: Color me loud. Although Murphy certainly has her muted moments 
(lots of olive greens), it's her sizzling orange blazers that reverberate in 
one's brain. 
</P>
<P>
 We Could Live Without: Nolan's and correspondent Doug Bruckner's fancy, puffed 
up, shiny pocket squares. We don't fancy such ornamentation, even when Peter 
Jennings does it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: From the Michael Jackson beat, reporter Diane Dimond dresses completely 
against type. Her sorority-girl image -- butter-yellow crew-neck sweaters, 
pearls and unsprayed hair -- buffers an aggressive delivery style. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad Hair Day: Murphy's top-layered, teased hairdo is surprisingly similar to 
Gibbons', but in a much lighter shade of blond -- quite similar to Loni 
Anderson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: For Murphy, Lillie Rubin (although we hear she may soon be switching 
to another label). For Nolan, Perry Ellis and the Greif Cos.

SOME KIND OF WONDER STUFF; EXISTENTIAL CRISIS PASSED, MILES HUNT AND BAND-MATES 
ARE BACK ON THE ROAD, FOR 'CONSTRUCTION FOR THE MODERN IDIOT.' THEY'LL BE AT 
THE COACH HOUSE SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miles Hunt of the Wonder Stuff concluded a few years ago that being a rock 
star, or at least something approximating one, wasn't so wonderful after all. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear the English band's singer tell it, 1991 was a year of fear and 
loathing on the campaign trail as he and the Wonder Stuff tried to promote 
their then-current album, "Never Loved Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the low points came July 29, on Hunt's 25th birthday, when a friend 
invited him to celebrate by attending a Guns N' Roses concert at the Forum in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt had spent the previous three weeks crisscrossing the United States on a 
publicity tour without the band, chatting up the "Elvis" album in a round of 
interviews and other promotional appearances. As he watched Axl Rose strut, 
Hunt found himself questioning the terms of his own existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guns N' Roses came on in all their stupidity. I was extremely intoxicated, 
and I was looking at them and the audience, and I hated everyone in the room," 
Hunt recalled over the phone last week from Seattle, the first stop on a tour 
that brings the Wonder Stuff to the Coach House on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt remembers wondering exactly what it was he was striving for: "I spent 
three weeks whoring around America to pacify my record company, and this 
(GNR-style arena-rock godhead) is the end result? I got very upset and decided 
I would stop being in the group and get a job. I'm not saying I'm a victim (of 
rock's promotional machinery). I know it's my choice. But it came to a massive 
confusion for me." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Hunt got a song out of his moment of revulsion. On a plane flight the 
next day, the badly hung-over singer began scrawling diary notes that 
subsequently emerged in "Hush," a song from the Wonder Stuff's new release, 
"Construction for the Modern Idiot." 
</P>
<P>
 The song, which begins with the line, "If this is the prize, it feels like a 
threat," expresses Hunt's misgivings about the chase for fame and his 
reluctance to divulge too much of his inner self to the public. The song's last 
line goes, "No, you don't know my relatives, and that's as deep as you get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of getting a job, Hunt soldiered on with the Wonder Stuff, which 
nearly staged its own Waterloo in a Tokyo hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very serious" about quitting, Hunt said. "Things came to a worse head 
by the end of the year, when the whole band came to blows with one another. I 
attacked everybody. The first thing I threw was the lamp," which meant that the 
Wonder Stuff's internecine free-for-all took place in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no light in the room, I was hurling things at everybody," he said. 
"The next few gigs were difficult. We were all on stage wondering who had hit 
who." 
</P>
<P>
 As the long, glorious and occasionally pugilistic careers of the Who and the 
Kinks attest, a bit of brawling among band-mates seems to do British rockers 
some good. The Wonder Stuff got over its blow up, and reconvened determined to 
take the idea of a "fresh start" as literally as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As the band prepared to record again, Hunt said: "We wrote and rehearsed all 
the songs as if we were a brand-new band getting together its first set. The 
old cliche about a band's first album being the easiest and most enjoyable to 
make -- there is a little bit of truth in that." 
</P>
<P>
 The band rehired Paul Collier, the producer who had recorded its first two 
albums, "The Eight Legged Groove Machine" (1988) and "Hup" (1989). Those had 
established the Wonder Stuff as a cheeky but exuberant and catchy band that 
managed to sound bilious and frolicsome at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The folk strains that dominated "Never Loved Elvis," the band's more 
reflective third album, were de-emphasized in favor of a louder guitar-rock 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt reports that this was not a problem for Martin Bell, the 
fiddler/mandolinist/accordionist whose playing was highlighted on "Elvis." 
Looking for a new challenge, the singer says, Bell busied himself arranging the 
rich horn and string orchestrations that crop up on several of the songs on 
"Construction for the Modern Idiot." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt also rearranged some of his personal habits, first giving up marijuana 
and then, about a year ago, booze. Although it is his policy not to write 
confessional songs, the new album alludes several times to his own bouts of 
excess. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when singing the praises of weed has become high fashion in pop, as 
practiced by megaselling rappers (Cypress Hill, Dr. Dre) and rockers (the Black 
Crowes), the Wonder Stuff takes a contrarian stance. One new song, "Storm 
Drain," depicts pot as a sense-dulling, life-stalling escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Going against the flow is no problem for Hunt, a brash fellow who seems to 
relish a good verbal tussle and pulls no punches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dope smokers bore the (expletive) out of me," he said. "I know what a boring 
(expletive, expletive) I was when I used to smoke it. The song is a celebration 
of clearing my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt says he gave up marijuana several years ago at the behest of his wife but 
maintained his liberal intake of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent the majority of the last three or four years" inebriated, he said, 
until "I gave myself a little test" last year and gave up drinking. "Now I get 
up earlier, I do much more, I'm a lot more sociable, and I think things through 
more clearly." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt says that some of his band-mates wondered whether he had thought things 
through clearly enough in his lyrics to "I Wish Them All Dead." The track from 
"Construction" excoriates the Man-Boy Love Association, a fringe San Francisco 
group that cites the ancient Greeks in advocating mentor-lover unions between 
men and boys. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing controversial about condemning child abuse, but Hunt takes 
his condemnation to extremes with lyrics that urge vigilante justice against 
abusers: "It's time to pick up a knife, or any weapon you like, to see an end 
to their lives," he spits. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt, who had just alighted in the United States, was momentarily taken aback 
when told of recent California cases in which his wish came true: the Menendez 
case, in which, if one believes the defense, past sexual abuse justified a 
double parricide, and the Ellie Nesler case, in which a woman stepped up in a 
Sonora courtroom and left her son's alleged molester riddled with bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "She killed him in the courtroom? (Expletive) me!" Hunt said in astonishment. 
</P>
<P>
 His first impulse was to weasel. He began to suggest that "I Wish Them All 
Dead," which was inspired by a Geraldo Rivera expose on the MBLA, didn't 
actually advocate lynching child abusers. Then he caught himself. "It doesn't. 
. . . Well, it does, actually," he admitted with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The song simply captures his "knee-jerk reaction" to its loathsome subject, 
Hunt said. "Certain members of the band were saying, 'It's dodgy territory. Do 
you have to name who you're after?' They wanted to make it more general." 
</P>
<P>
 The song remained quite specific, and Hunt takes no responsibility for any 
listener who might act on its very specific suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do whatever they do," he said. "You're pretty much responsible for 
your own actions." The Menendez and Nesler shootings both predated the 
September release of the "Construction" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Wonder Stuff has yet to move beyond cult status in America, it 
has had a healthy run in its homeland: Hunt said that "Construction for the 
Modern Idiot," the band's fourth album, went Top 5 in England and has produced 
two hit singles, "On the Ropes" and "Full of Life (Happy Now)." 
</P>
<P>
 Touring opportunities abound: After its American tour, the Wonder Stuff will 
stay on the road until June with tours of England, Australia and Japan. "Then 
we might do another tour of North America, if there appears to be a hungry 
audience that wants to see us again." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Hunt said, life these days among the Wonder Stuff is fairly 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 The band that almost self-destructed is still on the road, singing, in "On the 
Ropes," a battle cry for intelligent rock: "Do you want to know what this 
fight's about? / Commerciality over art can't win out." After that 
near-Waterloo in '91, the battle is going well again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a very lucky position, basically," Hunt said. "We're getting away 
with it is the way we look at it." 
</P>

BACK TO THE RICK DERRINGER THAT NEVER WAS; POP MUSIC: GROWN-UP FANS CAN WELCOME 
HIS BLUES ROCKER INCARNATION AT THE COACH HOUSE TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The sight of Rick Derringer flying across a stage like a guitar-wielding 
sprite on amphetamines is one of the indelible images of pre-punk, '70s rock 
'n' roll. In oversized fur boots, garish capes, feathered 'do, Day-Glo rouge 
and other such rock star accouterments, Derringer was either frash-cool or 
vulgar excess personified, depending on one's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he's typecast as a '70s guy isn't lost on Derringer, who plays 
tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. During a recent phone 
interview, the singer/guitarist/songwriter/producer seemed positively obsessed 
with putting the past behind him: Almost any given topic led back to his desire 
to be given a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some venues, they really don't even want to see me around," he said. "They 
think I'm this loud, sweaty, uncouth, distasteful rock 'n' roll guitar player. 
I'm away from that now, and I never really was as much like that as people 
thought. I've grown up a lot since then, but a lot of people who grew up with 
my music and then grew out of it still think of me as that guy, instead of 
taking me along with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like, when I was a kid, I'd be really excited to see -- I'm gonna throw a 
name out here -- Foghat, let's say. Now as an adult, I'm not as excited about 
that idea anymore. But let's say there was a new Foghat album out that 
reflected their age and experience and was more in line with my taste as a 
grown-up, then I'd be excited again. That's what I'm talking about. There's a 
period of time that people remember me for that we've both grown out of. I'd 
just like the people to know that I'm right there with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Derringer has been on the scene since 1965, when he was the 16-year-old front 
man for the McCoys, a group that hit No. 1 with "Hang On Sloopy." Back then, he 
once said, was "like Christmas every day. What teen-ager could ask for more 
than to have the top record in the world, girls screaming and pulling your 
clothes off everywhere you go?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 1969, their hit-making days were behind them, but the McCoys were hired as 
the unbilled backup band for then-arena-packing Johnny Winter. When drug 
problems sidelined Winter the following year, Derringer took up with Johnny's 
brother, Edgar. 
</P>
<P>
 His association with the Winters ran concurrently with a successful career of 
his own that lasted throughout the '70s, until he began to work more behind the 
scenes. In recent years, he has produced, toured with or guested on albums by 
the likes of Cyndi Lauper, Weird Al Yankovich, Barbara Streisand, Steely Dan, 
Alice Cooper, Richie Havens, Kiss and Todd Rundgren, among others. But his work 
on behalf of others grew to obscure his own career, something he regrets and is 
trying to rectify. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It got really easy to stay home and make money instead of traveling out on 
the road. Also, record companies and managers were pushing me in that 
direction. An artist tries to do the best he can, but the whole music industry 
is geared toward telling the artist what they think the best he can do is. 
"Once I decided to pursue my own career again, I took a look and realized I 
didn't need these agents who were still taking advantage of me from the old 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The managers and everyone else were remnants of a time when I was younger and 
less sure of myself. I fired managers; I got rid of agents, I just got rid of 
everybody. My hobby now is taking care of my own business." 
</P>
<P>
 He has recast himself as a macho blues rocker, very much in the vein of his 
old employer Johnny Winter. The cover of his new album, "Back to the Blues," 
shows a tattooed, leather-jacketed Derringer cradling a Stratocaster. Actually, 
at 46, he still looks more like a teen-age girl than a roadhouse tough guy, but 
his stinging, hyperkinetic blues workouts ably showcase his considerable 
skills, and fans of his work with the Winters should welcome him back off the 
strength of this latest effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out real young, and when you're that age, you take it for granted 
that people are going to be watching out for you," he said. "You lose 
perspective of how much control you've lost; you don't know if you're going in 
the right direction. I got to the point, I guess, where I was playing a lot of 
music that I didn't feel comfortable with.  
</P>
<P>
 "But now, having had the opportunity to do a blues album, it's obvious that 
this is the music I should have been doing all along. It's more grown-up music 
than people are used to me doing. I'm striving for some kind of honesty here. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is just like anybody else's job. This is what I do, and I'd like to 
continue doing it." 
</P>
<P>

WEEK'S WORTH OF JAZZ, ON FILM AND LIVE, AT GOLDEN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Golden West College's Jazz Week Feb. 7-11 will include several jazz-oriented 
movies, both documentaries and dramas, in a free series. 
</P>
<P>
 All the films will start at 3 p.m. in the campus' Forum II theater. The 
program begins Monday with "The Gig." The 1985 film, starring Cleavon Little 
and Wayne Rogers, follows a group of middle-aged jazz amateurs who land their 
first professional gig, with surprising results. 
</P>
<P>
 The series shifts to real-life Tuesday with the 1959 release, "Jazz on a 
Summer's Day." The documentary on the 1956 Newport (Rhode Island) Jazz Festival 
features performances by Louis Armstrong, Gerry Mulligan, Mahalia Jackson and 
Chuck Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, "Ladies Sing the Blues" and "A Well Spent Life" will screen. The 
first includes performances by Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee and 
Dinah Washington. The second traces the life of blues musician Mance Lipscomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The program closes Friday with "Round Midnight." The 1986 film, inspired by 
the lives of musicians Bud Powell and Lester Young, traces the boozy, tragic 
and brilliant days of a black American sax man (played by tenor saxophonist 
Dexter Gordon) living in Paris during the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz Week also offers free daily performances in the Student Center by GWC and 
professional musicians. On Monday, Swing Savant plays Dixieland jazz at noon. 
Tuesday brings the GWC student jazz combo at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, musicians Buddy Collette and Luther Hughes will present a 
"history of jazz" lecture at 10 a.m. in Room 108 of the Music Building. Pianist 
Jack Reidling performs at 2 p.m. in Forum II. On Thursday, GWC faculty and 
students team up for a noon jazz session in the Student Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Golden West College's Jazz Week film series begins at 3 p.m. Monday with 
"The Gig" and continues daily (except Wednesday) through Feb. 11 at the 
college's Forum II theater, 15744 Golden West St., Huntington Beach. Free.

'93 LUNG-TRANSPLANT PATIENT HAS PARENTS TO THANK FOR GIFT OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 During the first weeks of 1993, Stacy Sewell, then 21, was fighting for every 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor warned Jim and Barbara Sewell that their daughter was about to lose 
her lifelong battle against cystic fibrosis and the damage it had done to her 
lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 But one year ago last Saturday, all three members of the Sewell family took 
part in a risky medical experiment that snatched Stacy back from death's door. 
At County-USC Medical Center, a team supervised by Dr. Vaughn Starnes removed 
parts of Jim's and Barbara's lungs and sewed them into Stacy's chest. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time two living donors had been used in a lung transplant and 
the first lung transplant on a cystic fibrosis patient. The operation raised 
medical ethics questions because it put three lives in jeopardy at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet today, there are no regrets in the Sewell house, located on a scenic rise 
in Quartz Hill, just west of Lancaster. On the anniversary of the historic 
operation, the family popped open a bottle of champagne they'd received a year 
earlier from a member of the transplant team. 
</P>
<P>
 And this afternoon, the family will return to the hospital to join Starnes, 
other staff members and other transplant families in a first-anniversary 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sewells have good reason to celebrate. Although they are sometimes winded 
by climbing stairs or heavy exertion, Jim, 56, and Barbara, 50 -- who each gave 
up one lobe from one lung -- say it has not affected their normal routines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most remarkable change is in Stacy. Before the surgery, she was 
tethered to oxygen around the clock, sometimes too weak to wash her own hair. 
Today, she plays tennis, works 20 hours a week at a clothing store, attends 
college, drives her own five-speed green Ford Escort and stays out till 2 a.m. 
playing gin rummy and poker with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no comparison, whatsoever," says Barbara Sewell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sewell agrees: "A year ago, she was sick and dying. Today, she is alive 
and healthy and has a life ahead of her. It is a completely different person." 
</P>
<P>
 Cystic fibrosis, an inherited disorder that affects about 30,000 Americans, 
causes thick, sticky mucous to build up in the lungs. This leads to chronic 
lung infections and the destruction of critical air sacs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Sewells' operation, Starnes has performed another six successful 
transplants involving cystic fibrosis patients and their living relatives. But 
few doctors nationwide have followed suit because the technique is still new 
and because it poses some risks to the living donors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Washington has taken no position on this 
surgery and refers inquiries to leading physicians in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, lung transplants only involved organs from recently deceased 
donors. But about 1,200 people nationwide are on the waiting list, and a 
patient typically must wait more than a year before they receive a transplant, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Living-donor operations provide another option when a patient cannot wait a 
year. But transplant experts say they only work when the recipient is smaller 
than the donors. In these cases, the two small donated lobes provide normal 
lung capacity for the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there's such an organ shortage, and because this can be done, I think 
more and more programs will cautiously adopt it, particularly if the size is 
correct," says Dr. Stanley B. Fiel, a cystic fibrosis specialist at Medical 
College of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's something that holds potential for some people," says Dr. Thomas 
Egan, a transplant specialist at the University of North Carolina. But he adds, 
"As much as this is a technical success, it would have been better for the 
patient and her parents if she had been able to get a conventional (non-living) 
donor." 
</P>
<P>
 Elbert P. Trulock, medical director of the lung transplant program at 
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said his staff has 
considered living-donor transplants but has not attempted one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, in order to carry this operation forward, you must have a patient 
whose death is imminent and who is not likely to get a lung from a brain-dead 
donor," Trulock said. "It is new, and it does subject the donors to some risk. 
In order to justify that, there has to be a more urgent need." 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputed that Stacy Sewell was days away from death just over a year 
ago. Even so, her family says, Stacy possessed dogged optimism, a powerful will 
to live and a knack for beating the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 She had confounded her doctors' prediction that she would die before her first 
birthday, her mother says. After a difficult childhood, her health improved as 
a teen-ager. When she graduated from Quartz Hill High in 1990, most of her 
classmates were unaware of her ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late 1992, her health had taken a turn for the worse, forcing her to 
leave her job and college. By then, Stacy was so weak that her father had to 
carry her upstairs to her room, piggyback style. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no life for her," her mother recalls. "She would take a shower, if 
she could, and sleep all day. Then she would cough all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Stacy, a petite woman with wavy brown hair, says she was most upset 
about the loss of independence. "I did not like the way my life was," she 
explains. "I didn't like being dependent on so many people, and I didn't like 
being housebound -- which really drives me nuts!" 
</P>
<P>
 But she adds: "I never lost hope. I just figured that tomorrow is another day. 
Tomorrow, it will be better. It never was, but I kept believing that." 
</P>
<P>
 By January of 1993, Stacy was hospitalized with a dangerously fast heartbeat, 
caused by her failing lungs. Because of her grave condition, Starnes asked her 
parents to consider a living transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the risk to the parents, "He told me I should think about it," 
Barbara Sewell recalls. "I said, 'I don't have to.' " Her husband agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Starnes also warned that because Stacy was so weak, she had only a 50-50 
chance of surviving the surgery. Her mother now says: "At no point during this 
did we really think she wouldn't make it. We never stopped to think that she 
might die -- and we would be too sick to arrange the funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 After the operation, when Stacy was disconnected from a respirator, the 
sensation was surreal. "I felt like I was breathing with somebody else's body," 
she recalls. "My lungs had never inflated like that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jim Sewell was discharged in 10 days, his wife developed an infection 
that required additional surgery. She remained in the hospital for five weeks. 
"I still feel guilty to this day," Stacy told her mother recently. "What you 
went through was awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy herself began building up stamina by walking the hospital halls. After 
five weeks, she too was sent home. The drive along California 14 remains a 
vivid memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the car ride home, I saw things on the freeway I had never seen before," 
she says. "I appreciated every blade of grass. Maybe I thought I was never 
going to see that freeway again." 
</P>
<P>
 For three months after the operation, Stacy had to wear a surgical mask in 
public places to avoid the risk of infection. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, the mask was gone, and her father had reassembled the bicycle he 
feared she might never ride again. After overcoming a few balance problems, 
Stacy was soon pedaling away. 
</P>
<P>
 In August she returned to her job, selling children's clothing at Mervyn's in 
Lancaster. "It is amazing," says Ed Skvarca, store manager. "She always 
mustered as much energy as she could, but I could tell after the operation that 
she was much more vibrant and had more energy." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was hired in 1989, she had sought no special considerations because 
of her cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't want anyone to know," store manager Skvarca says. "She didn't want 
to use anything like that as a crutch. I think she has a lot of character." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her co-workers learned about her condition through news coverage of 
the historic transplant. They sent cards and banners to cheer her on. 
</P>
<P>
 In late summer, Stacy also returned to Antelope Valley College. Her courses 
have included English, psychology -- and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "During my whole life, I never mentioned that I had cystic fibrosis to 
anyone," Stacy explains. "I told them I had asthma. I didn't want any special 
attention. I just wanted to be normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Although her lung problems are gone, Stacy still has the disorder and must 
consume enzymes to help digest her food. She also takes drugs to help prevent 
rejection of her new lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she is a transplant pioneer, medical experts do not know how long her 
donated lungs will continue to perform properly. But she was pronounced in good 
health at a checkup performed earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy is uncertain about her career plans. But she does know they won't 
involve accounting, which gave her trouble in a college class. And she won't 
take any job in the medical field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had enough of that, thank you," she says with a smile.

 President Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam hit

Vietnamese community. The news brought anger, jubilation and hopeful talk of 
future cooperation. On Thursday, several people offered their thoughts on the

 George H. Dang, 39, is president of ALCA International Co., an Irvine 
consulting firm. He has traveled to Vietnam many times to do market research 
for prospective clients who want to extend their operations to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time that America conducts business with Vietnam again. The time is 
right because Vietnam needs the U.S. to better its economy and U.S. companies 
can conduct full-fledged business in what is virtually an uncharted business 
territory. For Vietnam, there will be jobs and contracts. For the U.S. 
manufacturers, there will be a new market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lifting of the embargo is going to be beneficial for both the U.S. and 
Vietnam. I can't honestly say which country I think will gain more from this. 
But I am sure both will gain a lot and lose nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the American business people, they will catch up with their European and 
Asian counterparts who have already been trading regularly with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ending the embargo will also be greatly beneficial for Vietnamese Americans 
who want to do business in Vietnam. We know the language, we know the culture, 
we have friends and relatives in Vietnam; all this will be advantageous and 
will allow us to conduct business smoothly from Vietnam and to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trade will open all sorts of doors to all sorts of businesses. Businesses 
such as import/export, service management, infrastructure, building and 
construction. . . . There's no end to the opportunities that we have here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trade will bring to the people in Vietnam better roads, better bridges, 
better housing, a better way of life. The economy, now poor, will improve and 
the standard of living of our people will improve with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a manufacturing standpoint, Vietnam is the last frontier in Southeast 
Asia and Vietnam, geographically, is strategically located. The neighboring 
countries have a much higher labor cost. Vietnam's low labor costs will be 
inviting to manufacturing companies. All this equals more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "From this point today, the sky is the limit when we're talking about business 
in Vietnam. This is just the first step; it's not going to change everything 
overnight. But ending the embargo allows businesses to prepare and concentrate 
on moving into a new market." LILY DIZON

 Larry Silveira, 40, is a Rancho Santa Margarita resident who served in Vietnam 
from 1973 to 1975. He is president of American Veterans Assistance Corp., a 
Tustin center that gives free shelter to homeless veterans and grants last 
wishes to dying veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just one question I have: There are 2,000 people unaccounted for. 
What about them? Do we just sweep it under the rug and start business like it 
never happened? These people committed more atrocities than Saddam Hussein ever 
thought of doing. I'd rather see us open trade with Saddam Hussein before we 
open trade with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many hurt feelings to say 'Let's forgive all and resume trade.' 
I spent a year and a half in a Southeast Asian theater (of war), and it wasn't 
a good time. It's still too fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like everyone forgot so fast. There are a lot of vets my age dying 
from rare types of cancer. The inhumane treatment that we received at the hands 
of the North Vietnamese people 20 years ago -- it's too soon to expect us to 
try to resume normal trade with these people. The nightmares are too fresh. I 
have only one recurring nightmare; I'm lucky. The nightmare I have is I'm back 
overseas and they've lost my orders to come home. I can't go home. I get that 
dream whenever I am stressed out and I fear things are beyond control. The last 
time I had it was a few months ago when things were out of control work-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not breaking in on the other channels. CNN is the only news channel 
to carry (President Clinton's announcement Thursday afternoon) because it's 
just another normal daily news event, it seems. For President Clinton, it's, 
you know, typical. The next thing we're going to hear is that he's going to 
tear down the Vietnam Memorial and build these Vietnam businessmen offices in 
its place -- not realistically, of course, but . . . it's just going to be 
another news bite in the 5 o'clock news. For those of us who are old enough to 
remember Vietnam, we know it's much more than that." ELAINE TASSY

 "I left Vietnam in 1975, by boat. I came with my mother, father and younger 
brother. We ended up in Guam, then went to Ft. Chaffee, Ark. That was my first 
impression of America, but it was funny -- at that time I was just happy to get 
off the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too young to understand the political impact of what was happening. The 
immediate danger of our lives was the motivating force to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grow up in a culture constantly at war, it's sad to say it becomes 
normal. Saigon slowly was being taken over. Just before we escaped, everything 
came apart. But prior to that, it was a strange concept. Everything around you 
indicates a war is going on, but it never really felt like I was in immediate 
danger.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a mixed group of friends, with some Vietnamese friends, but I never 
really discuss politics with them. I don't believe in it. It frustrates me. I 
abhor politics; everything that has to do with the state of my country is a 
consequence of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish the embargo wasn't there, and the country had a head start 10 years 
ago. Then they wouldn't be so behind. It's going to take a lot of rebuilding, 
and it's been very frustrating to follow. It's the people that always suffer, 
not the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought it was very silly that America was the last one getting in 
there, and over a very dead political issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the people that I know, and I can't speak for everyone, are very aware of 
Vietnam and very concerned. There isn't a day that goes by that we don't hope 
the embargo would be lifted. It's not a panacea, but it's definitely a step. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and dad have been back to Vietnam, but I haven't. I definitely would 
love to go. There's some hesitancy, though. I have this romantic image of what 
my country was before I left it and I know it's not what it is now. I'm not 
ready to see it. Maybe it's silly. There will be a lot of things that don't fit 
my memory of the country.  
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, we have to transcend the political barrier for the country to 
heal. Vietnamese American people here that oppose the embargo on a political 
level, I think maybe they have to re-examine themselves and their feelings 
toward the embargo and ask themselves whether their problems are personal 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "For young Vietnamese Americans here, it's very important to understand their 
roots, their people and what their country has gone through. Without that 
connection, people forget their history. Young Vietnamese Americans will have a 
very difficult time unless personal ego struggles (from the older Vietnamese 
immigrants) are removed. That's what causes a lot of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have seen so much pain, and such a ravaged country, that of course 
their natural reaction is anger. But you have to get past it. It's the past, 
and it has nothing to do with what's going on right here and now. We have to 
think of what we can do to rebuild the country." ALICIA DI RADO

 Errol Bond, 78, and his wife, Madeline, 73, are Fullerton retirees who have 
spent more than two decades trying to find out what happened to their son, Air 
Force Capt. Ronald L. Bond, who disappeared over Laos at age 23 in 1971. On 
their answering machine, the Bonds ask callers to "think about what you've done 
today to help the POWs" before the sound of the beep. 
</P>
<P>
 EB: "It's kind of a shock. This happens to be the 23rd anniversary of my son's 
going to Vietnam. The war isn't over for us, despite the fact that that's what 
they're saying on TV."  
</P>
<P>
 MB: "What promise do we have that they're going to still keep looking for 
him?" 
</P>
<P>
 EB: Clinton "lied to us. He said he wouldn't do it (lift the embargo) until he 
thought he'd done everything possible. He broke that promise. What assurance do 
we have that they're going to keep looking for them?" 
</P>
<P>
 MB: "We fought a hard battle to try to get him home. We have no assurance that 
he's dead, we have no crash site."  
</P>
<P>
 EB: "This isn't over for us." 
</P>
<P>
 MB: "I don't know what we'll do, but we won't close his book. People have told 
us there are still prisoners over there -- how can we close the book on our 
son?" 
</P>
<P>
 EB: "How would you feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 MB: "How would anybody feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 EB: "You know what I put on all my envelopes when they go out of here, whether 
it be bills or anything else? I have a stamp that says, 'You'd damn well care 
if it was someone you loved.' " 
</P>
<P>
 MB: "We just can't close the book. We just can't do it until they give us 
proof that he is dead. Until then, no way, you can't. Not if you have any love 
or feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 EB: "We know our son was alive (immediately after the crash), so as far as 
lifting the embargo is concerned, we're just going to continue fighting as hard 
as ever. We feel it's pathetic, we personally feel it's criminal. I don't care 
what Clinton says, this is being done for money, by American business." 
</P>
<P>
 MB: "I don't know who's pushing this embargo. It must be the businessmen, it 
has to be, because it's not the families, it's not the American Legion, it's 
not the Veterans of Foreign Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 EB: "Everything that Vietnam wants, we have given into. They haven't given 
into anything for us. Even today our people can't go any place (in Vietnam) 
without first telling (the Vietnamese) where they want to go. They have someone 
from the Vietnamese side with them all the time.  
</P>
<P>
 MB: "What can we do? We don't know. We depend upon the government again." 
</P>
<P>
 EB: "They've lied to us. They have sold us down the river, really." 
</P>
<P>
 MB: "We feel we were deserted, and what can we do? What can we do? There's not 
much, but we'll try, we sure as heck will try." 
</P>
<P>
 EB: "We'll keep at it." JODI WILGOREN

 Ngoc Anh, a 44-year-old mother of three, fled Saigon with her family in 1975 
and has lived in Garden Grove since 1988. She works as a beautician in Cerritos 
and also writes about politics and women's issues for Tieng Chuong, a 
conservative newspaper published in Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Clinton is) going a little too far. Not to lift the embargo is 
better because lifting the embargo means that you make the government there 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went back there last year -- my mom is buried in the cemetery (and) they 
wanted the land so they can sell it, so all the country can make money, not for 
the people but so they (the government leaders) can put it in their pocket. 
They told everybody, the relatives that have the graves there, to come and dig 
it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I was there. They're really corrupt. They got money from me. Everything I 
had. I go through (the airport), I had to pay. You don't have money, it means 
that you can't do anything. I'm the one who has experience with it. The 
government is really bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, if Americans come in, it means there (will be) more corruption 
because the money comes in. The people won't receive it; it all will go to the 
government. The government there, the officials there, they try to get money so 
they can save for themselves. They are very rich right now. They are very, very 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lifting embargo, it means that the government will be more corrupt. If a 
company here wants to go back there, if they want to go to a certain deal or 
something, they (will) have to give some money to officials so they can sign 
the paper. Also I think it's (going to bring) more inflation there, and the 
small business there will die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, small business, it means they sell little thing here and little 
thing there. If America and every country comes in, any kind of big business, 
it's not going to (go to) the people, it's going to (go to) the government. It 
means that no money will come to the people, the people will go with very low 
pay, like $200 a year or something.

 "Without lifting the embargo, we (can) still send the money back there, we can 
help them, we can visit them, we can bring money to our relatives. If they lift 
embargo, it means inflation will go up over there and the money (we send) won't 
be enough any more. Inflation means the officials who have the money will be 
better off, but the people with the low pay will be suffering.

 "Clinton doing it right now is like back-stabbing. It's back-stabbing 
Vietnamese Republicans, it's back-stabbing South Vietnam, and it's 
back-stabbing all the American soldiers that fought for the freedom over 
there." JODI WILGOREN

 President Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam hit 
home with Vietnam war veterans, business leaders and members of Orange County's 
Vietnamese community. The news brought anger, jubilation and hopeful talk of 
future cooperation. On Thursday, several people offered their thoughts on the 
decision.

 The Rev. Joseph Son Nguyen, 30, is a priest at St. Boniface Church in Anaheim. 
He often works as a youth counselor in the Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, emotionally, I feel down, so I sympathize with all those who are 
disappointed. The situation in Vietnam is not the best for my people. 
</P>
<P>
 "And emotionally, it will negatively affect those who had hope that the trade 
embargo would not be lifted unless a new government is in place. But this will 
be a uniting factor for our community because now we don't have that point of 
argument anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to argue if the trade embargo should be lifted or not. Now, we 
will have to discuss how we can best work with the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a great opportunity for us to give more thoughts to our 
ultimate goals and not get caught up in the political or economic issue of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who are against it now must accept it and they must accept the reality 
that it is a done deal. What we must discuss is how we must take the best 
advantage of the present situation -- which I'd like to add is not 
irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of us our main concern is not to see Vietnam get rich or American 
businessmen get rich. It's beyond that. We have two concerns, the moral state 
and the state of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only one step in the normalization of relationship with Vietnam. I 
think we can flood Vietnam with new ideas. We can use this freedom of trade and 
through the back door, influence it so that it could become freedom of thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can imprint on every one of the packages that we send there messages of 
freedom. I'm telling everyone: Don't give up hope; have more hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must, given the reality that the trade embargo has been lifted, now use 
trade on the bargaining table for democracy. We must use it to continue to 
work, to fight and to ask that dignity be given back to the people of Vietnam, 
not just money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if complete normalization should happen, we should still continue to 
work toward that goal -- that human rights be restored to the Vietnamese." LILY

 Trang Nguyen, 32, is an Anaheim resident who is a shareholder in Little Saigon 
Television and Little Saigon Radio. She was born in Nha Trang, a beach town in 
Vietnam, and fled to the United States in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for the U.S. government to close the most painful 
chapter in U.S. history. But for many Vietnamese Americans I feel this wound 
will never be healed because Vietnam is still far away from being a democratic 
society, and I'm disappointed the President didn't mention democracy and human 
rights in Vietnam. He lifted the embargo without any conditions and I'm so 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will benefit most of the business people, but pouring money into Vietnam 
without any plans or strategy -- I'm sorry I'm getting so emotional -- but this 
will not help Vietnam to reform. The people won't benefit. Right now the people 
are not allowed to practice their own religion, they're being oppressed in many 
ways. Most businesses in Vietnam are owned by the government so (lifting the 
embargo) will help the government obviously. It's not going to do a whole lot 
of good for the country at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against lifting the embargo; if lifted with conditions I'm all for 
it. But I'm so disappointed. The U.S. has always been for democracy, but why 
are we neglecting this issue in Vietnam? The President just touched on the 
POW/MIA issue. I think he lifted it because he's under a lot of pressure, but 
there are more than 2,000 American soldiers unaccounted for. The Vietnam 
government has cooperated in the past year or so, but I don't think the United 
States really got a straightforward answer. I mean, what happened to them? Did 
the Vietnam government send them to Russia? Did they torture them to death? 
</P>
<P>
 "(I went back to Vietnam) two years ago -- Hanoi, Saigon, Nha Trang -- for 
three weeks. I stayed with relatives and friends. I wanted to find out what 
really happened to my country, what communism was really like. I wanted to find 
out myself, not through books or propaganda, to hear for myself what's going 
on. I was very disappointed because so many people go into Vietnam to do 
business, but they're not concerned about welfare for the people there. 
Businesses just want cheap labor, but what about health care, contracts, 
minimum wage? There aren't any unions to protect the workers. Lifting the 
embargo might torture our country even more than during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "(When visiting Vietnam) I cried a lot. Two days before I left I cried even 
more because I was afraid Vietnam would be another Bangkok, prostitution-wise, 
not economic-wise. I attended different receptions, nightclubs, and I saw 
14-year-old, 15-year-old girls who were prostitutes. I'm sorry I'm crying 
again. These are young beautiful girls, but they needed to make money. I asked 
this one girl, she said her father was in a re-education camp, her mom was 
selling in the market, and she was worried about her two younger brothers 
running around. She said she didn't have any skills to do anything else. I felt 
sorry for them. I just see more of that coming and happening in Vietnam." THUAN

CULTURAL COMMERCE EXPECTED TO BLOSSOM; EXCHANGE: AN UNRESTRICTED FLOW OF MEDIA 
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM COULD STRENGTHEN ETHNIC ROOTS AND MAYBE EVEN 
HASTEN DEMOCRACY, AN OBSERVER SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 In building a community in a new country, Vietnamese Americans also had to 
rebuild a cultural life from scratch, one that evolved and flourished in 
virtual isolation from the land that is its source. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Co Pham, president of the Westminster-based Vietnamese Chamber of 
Commerce and a longtime (and often embattled) proponent of lifting the U.S. 
trade embargo against Vietnam, an action President Clinton took Thursday. 
Reopening cultural channels, Pham believes, will foster understanding between 
the two countries and will help young Vietnamese Americans "know who and where 
we come from." 
</P>
<P>
 An unrestricted flow of Vietnamese films, music, books and other materials 
will increase "understanding about the Vietnamese culture and its history" here 
in the United States, Pham said. And, he believes, an exposure to U.S.-produced 
art and entertainment may even speed the democratization process in Vietnam as 
residents there are exposed to Western ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Such general theories aside, however, the specific ways in which the embargo's 
end will affect cultural exchange remain difficult to predict, although 
numerous local businesses and institutions are examining the question with 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, for instance, is home to a burgeoning number of recording and 
production studios that supply a steady stream of music CDs, videos and laser 
discs featuring local singers of Vietnamese-language pop music. Lifting trade 
barriers expands the potential market from about 1 million (the approximate 
number of Vietnamese Americans) to some 70 million (the population of Vietnam). 
</P>
<P>
 Questions remain, however, about weak Vietnamese copyright laws, about the 
aggressiveness of government censors in Vietnam, and about how new trade 
regulations will be worded, according to Yen Do, editor of Westminster-based 
Nguoi Viet Daily News. Local singers, however, might do quite well with concert 
tours in Vietnam, where interest in U.S.-produced pop music is high, Do said. 
</P>
<P>
 One local singer, Tai Thai, said he is excited about the prospects of playing 
in Vietnam eventually, but added that he still hasn't thought through the 
political ramifications. "I would like to go back there and perform," he said, 
adding, "right now is really a confusing time." 
</P>
<P>
 On the national level, the U.S. film industry could find a potentially large 
new overseas market in Vietnam. The first step, according to a spokesman for 
the Los Angeles-based American Film Export Assn., is assuring adequate 
copyright protection in whatever agreements the United States draws up. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is achieved, Vietnam "will be a potential new market just as Eastern 
Europe has become since the fall of the Soviet Union," William Shields, 
chairman of the trade group, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, local arts organizations expressed interest in bringing Vietnamese 
artworks and performers to the United States. "We're very interested in any 
opportunity that may arise from the lifting of the sanctions," said Brian 
Langston, spokesman for the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 As Do pointed out, exchange of cultural material has already been going on to 
a small but increasing extent, particularly since the lifting of the ban on 
organized U.S. travel to Vietnam in December, 1991, and subsequent decisions to 
ease restrictions on humanitarian aid and educational exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirated copies of popular U.S. music and videos, particularly 
Vietnamese-language product from Orange County, are already sold on the 
underground market in Vietnam. Conversely, Do estimated that about 300 
Vietnamese video film titles are widely available in Little Saigon, reproduced 
from copies brought back by returning tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 On a larger level, a French-Vietnamese co-production, "The Scent of Green 
Papaya," is now playing at art cinemas across the United States (including the 
Port Theatre in Corona del Mar) and is Vietnam's first official entry for a 
best foreign language film Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's pretty well known that the embargo's been coming down 
piecemeal," said Douglas Pike, a Vietnam expert from the Indochinese studies 
program at UC Berkeley. Much of it has been a matter of loose interpretation of 
the ban, he said. When he was recently in Vietnam, he saw many English-language 
novels and nonfiction books shipped there under an agreement designed to allow 
the sale of textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are questions of how easily local Vietnamese Americans will accept 
products from Vietnam. Many of the films produced there under the restrictions 
of an authoritarian regime are "heavy-handed," Pike said. Do said many 
Vietnamese books and magazines have circulated recently in Orange County, but 
have raised little interest because of their "poor quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the political factor. Many local Vietnamese Americans have been 
opposed to the lifting of trade sanctions and remain fervently anti-Communist. 
When a popular Vietnamese singer and actress, Thanh Lan, came to California 
last month to promote a new film, her visit sparked protests and sharply worded 
editorials branding her a Communist tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Pike said if history is a lesson, much of that politically based resistance 
will fade with the lifting of the embargo. That's what happened with China, he 
said. The embargo was hotly debated politically, but "once it takes place, it 
becomes almost instantly depoliticized."

Q & A; ASSESSING IMMEDIATE EFFECTS ON U.S.-VIETNAM RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam will 
affect U.S.-Vietnam relations in a variety of ways. Here are answers to some 
immediate questions raised by the President's action Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Now that the 19-year-old embargo has been lifted, what will happen? 
</P>
<P>
 A. American businesses are free to trade and invest in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How will this affect those of us who live in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 A. In many ways: more international trade for businesses here; more travel, 
communication and financial transactions between the two countries; U.S. 
visitors to Vietnam will have fewer hassles with credit cards and find a bigger 
U.S. presence there; Vietnamese coming to the United States may face fewer 
barriers and complications as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does this mean we are establishing full diplomatic relations and that the 
two countries will exchange ambassadors? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No, there are many steps left toward normalization, both economic and 
diplomatic. The United States is only establishing a "liaison office." This 
office will assist relations between the two countries and assist U.S. firms 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 But there remain many laws and restrictions on trade. For instance, this does 
not give Vietnam any preferential treatment on trade issues such as "most 
favored nation" status. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will the lifting of the trade embargo make it less complicated for people 
to travel to Vietnam? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. Despite President Clinton's action, the United States and Vietnam have 
not resumed diplomatic relations. Consequently, travelers to Vietnam still 
won't be able to get a tourist visa anywhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, an application must be made through a travel agency or the Permanent 
Mission of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to the United Nations. The request 
is then forwarded to the Vietnamese consulate in Canada for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if approved, the visa is mailed back to the applicant in the United 
States. All told, the process takes several weeks. However, officials at the 
Vietnamese Mission hope to begin issuing visas when and if full normalization 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will it now be easier to travel from Vietnam to the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It is still unclear how that will be affected. Since the President's action 
was basically a unilateral move on the part of the United States, it is too 
early to tell whether Vietnam will also eventually ease travel restrictions for 
its nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will it be possible to fly direct from the United States to Vietnam? 
</P>
<P>
 A. United Airlines plans to start offering flights between Los Angeles 
International Airport and Tan) Son Nhut Airport in Ho Chi Minh City as soon as 
it can obtain the necessary government approvals. Due to the great distance, 
the flights will include a stopover. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago-based airline inherited the rights to the route when it bought Pan 
American Airlines in 1986. United officials must now seek the corresponding 
operating authority from the government of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the embargo has been lifted, there are no U.S. regulations 
prohibiting United from starting service to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will Vietnamese Americans be able to arrange for relatives to immigrate? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Until full diplomatic ties are established, strict sponsorship rules still 
apply. Only a U.S. citizen can petition Vietnam for permission to let a 
relative come overseas, and only if it is a member of their immediate family. 
The process is lengthy and can take from 90 days to 10 years, depending on the 
individual case. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How will the lifting of the embargo affect financial transactions? 
</P>
<P>
 A. For one thing, Americans will now be able to use credit cards to purchase 
goods in Vietnam. Under the embargo, such transactions were prohibited. If a 
credit card was issued by a U.S. bank, Vietnamese residents in the United 
States have been able to make direct money transfers to relatives in Vietnam 
since May, 1992. Many establishments already accept Visa cards issued by 
non-American banks. Sometime today, American Express is expected to sign an 
agreement in Hanoi that will permit the use of their charge card in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How will the embargo affect cultural ties between the United States and 
Vietnam? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Many observers believe it is still too early to tell. Cultural exchanges 
between the two countries have already been occurring on a small scale and 
there has been a steady easing of restrictions on educational exchange 
programs. Pirated copies of American-made pop music and videos are already sold 
on the black market in Vietnam. Conversely, videos produced in Vietnam are 
readily available now in Little Saigon. However, the lifting of the embargo 
would allow such companies to export a far greater volume of product. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Which American companies are most likely to benefit? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It truly runs the gamut, but manufacturing, construction and 
telecommunications companies head the list. Several Fortune 500 companies have 
been in Vietnam for months, setting up offices and obtaining the necessary 
business licenses. Now, these companies have a leg up on the competition and 
may begin conducting business freely. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What needs to happen before the two countries normalize relations? 
</P>
<P>
 A. At a White House briefing, officials declined to speculate as to when 
formal diplomatic relations might be established but the President has said it 
would only happen once he is satisfied that the POW/MIA issue is resolved. He 
said the new U.S. liaison office would also continue to monitor human rights 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other negotiations will be ongoing. For example, American and Vietnamese 
representatives are expected to meet Feb. 15-16 in Hanoi in an attempt to 
resolve U.S. claims against Vietnam for American property seized by the 
Vietnamese government. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can citizens now send mail or packages to Vietnam via private postal 
services or must they still depend on the government postal services of the two 
countries? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Now that there will be commercial trade with Vietnam, yes, private postal 
services, such as Federal Express, could be used. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some private companies have long been able to deliver packages from 
the United States by routing them through countries that had trade relations 
with Vietnam, such as Great Britain and Singapore. TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

MCKEON'S AID VOTE CLASHES WITH IDEOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caught between the pleas of earthquake victims for billions of dollars in 
federal aid and the demands of party ideology to pay for it with budget cuts, 
California House Republicans Thursday found themselves in a classic political 
dilemma. How do you remain faithful to the tenets of fiscal conservatism when 
the devastation is in your home state? 
</P>
<P>
 How about in your back yard? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about explaining it," said Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, the 
Santa Clarita Republican, whose hearty conservatism collided head-on with the 
needs of his quake-ravaged district surrounding the temblor's Northridge 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do what is right. I support cutting the deficit and I want relief for 
disaster victims," said McKeon wishfully before the series of votes that led to 
House passage of the aid package. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a lawmaker, he could not have it both ways. Perhaps more than any other 
California Republican, McKeon's predicament pointed up the difficult political 
choices facing conservative House members representing areas near the quake's 
worst destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon wanted to get aid to his shattered district as swiftly as possible. But 
he also had to reconcile his district's needs with the Republican doctrine he 
so deeply embraces. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to build up the deficit," McKeon said, "but some things aren't 
black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'm not strongly in favor of paying for it (through budget cuts 
in other programs). I want to bring some organization to it and set up an 
insurance-type program to deal with future disasters." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, the House Democratic leadership agreed to allow debate on 
three amendments offering varying amounts of spending cuts to pay for the quake 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Deficit hawks pushed for $9.7 billion in cuts. A Democratic maneuver offered a 
relatively mild $2.5 billion. A third proposal called for $7.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 This gave McKeon an unwanted array of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 While perhaps philosophically inclined toward the deeper cuts, McKeon feared 
they would create turmoil in the Senate and conference committee, possibly 
delaying the aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he felt committed to his fiscally conservative principles. 
</P>
<P>
 By early Thursday afternoon, McKeon had decided to vote for all three 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've taken a position that I will vote for the cuts," McKeon said then. "But 
I'm going to watch how the votes go. One will determine the other." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he hoped that he could vote for the two larger spending cuts, 
but that they would lose. What he really wanted to pass was the $2.5-billion 
package that stood the best chance of landing on President Clinton's desk late 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, McKeon wound up voting against the two more ambitious packages of 
spending cuts -- joining only three other California Republicans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I listened to the debate I didn't feel good about them," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) joined McKeon and four other Republicans 
in voting against the largest of the spending cut amendments. The dean of the 
Republican delegation, Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead of Glendale, voted for both the 
larger amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who spent the day lobbying members to 
vote for the $2.5-billion plan, had praise for McKeon. "He was tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Democrat said, "He could have been a jerk about it, but he wasn't."

PHOTOGRAPHER LOSES APPEAL OF BIAS SUIT FILED BY GAY IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an appeal by a commercial 
photographer sued for sex discrimination after he excluded a gay couple's 
picture from a 10-year reunion book produced for the Class of 1977 at 
University High School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while leaving an appellate ruling against the photographer intact, 
the high court withdrew the ruling as a precedent for future cases. The ruling 
contained criticisms by one appellate justice of the high court's narrow 
reading of state civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Stanley Mosk and Joyce L. Kennard cast dissenting votes to leave the 
appellate ruling on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling "still sends a message that discrimination against gay or lesbian 
couples will not be tolerated under the law," said Gloria Allred, lawyer for 
the Orange County man who filed the suit. The man, David Engel, is entitled to 
damages and attorney's fees as a result of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer's lawyer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involed a photo company that agreed to take portrait pictures of 
alumni for a memory book, but refused to include a picture of Engel, a 
theatrical actor, and his partner, Eric Underwood.

 Dan Worthington, owner of the photo company, said he had a policy against 
taking pictures of same-sex couples because it would violate his beliefs and 
cost him advertising revenue. When the reunion committee objected, saying all 
alumni had been promised portrait pictures, Worthington decided not to publish 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Engel's suit was dismissed by Orange County Superior Court Judge David H. 
Brickner, who said Worthington had shown no intent to discriminate and had 
stated valid business justifications for his policy. But the 4th District Court 
of Appeal ruled 2 to 1 last October that Worthington had violated the state's 
civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead opinion by Justice Sheila Prell Sonenshine said the photographer was 
guilty of sex discrimination because his decision was determined by the sex of 
Engel's partner. Although the policy would have applied equally to an 
all-female couple, Sonenshine said, "equal application of a discriminatory 
practice makes it no less violative of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The exclusion was not justified by Worthington's beliefs or financial 
concerns, Sonenshine said.

CLINTON LIFTS VIETNAM EMBARGO TO 'RESOLVE THE FATE' OF MIAS; TRADE: PRESIDENT 
SAYS ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS DID NOT AFFECT DECISION TO END 19-YEAR BAN. HE 
WARNS THAT SANCTIONS MAY BE REIMPOSED IF HANOI DOES NOT CONTINUE COOPERATION.

<P>
 Taking a historic step to close the wounds of a divisive war, President 
Clinton on Thursday ordered an immediate end to the 19-year trade embargo 
against Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting aside any economic rationale, Clinton asserted that he made the move 
entirely as a means of resolving remaining questions about the fate of missing 
U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely convinced it offers us the best way to resolve the fate of 
those who remain and about whom we are not sure," he said at a White House 
ceremony. "I have said that any decisions about our relationship with Vietnam 
should be guided by one factor and one factor alone: gaining the fullest 
possible accounting for our prisoners of war and our missing in action." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's help in answering these questions has recently produced "substantial 
progress" in accounting for missing soldiers, he said, adding that "we would 
lose leverage if there were no forward movement" in relations between the two 
countries. And if the Vietnamese slow their efforts regarding the missing, the 
embargo may be reimposed, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The step, still short of normalizing relations, culminates years of anguished 
public deliberation over a conflict that has continued to sow bitterness and 
division nearly two decades after its conclusion. Although many Vietnam 
veterans had pushed for a lifting of the embargo, major veterans groups were 
quick to condemn the move by a commander in chief who avoided military service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the advice given to the President was wrong, and we told him 
that," said John Sommer, director of the Washington office of the American 
Legion, after meeting with the President and other veterans leaders at the 
White House. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, Vietnam Veterans of America and 
Disabled Veterans of America, also represented at the meeting with Clinton, 
opposed the embargo's end as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the protests of veterans and groups representing families of 
missing soldiers, the broader public mood may have been suggested last week, 
when the Senate voted 62 to 38 to urge the President to lift the ban. Other 
lawmakers, including some Vietnam veterans, signaled their support Thursday for 
Clinton's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the right decision," said Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a highly 
decorated Vietnam veteran who headed a yearlong Senate investigation into the 
POW-MIA issue. "The President can be proud of the fact (that) he took the extra 
year to make sure we got more (information) from Vietnam. And we got more." 
</P>
<P>
 Also hailing the decision were Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who commanded 
U.S. forces in Vietnam, and Gen. John W. Vessey, a former chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and an emissary to Hanoi on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the ban is expected to produce a quick boost for some U.S. 
companies and, by one estimate, may generate an added $9 billion in trade this 
year alone. U.S. officials will open a "liaison office" in Hanoi to oversee 
American interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also creates the possibility that the United States, which has lost 
military bases in the Philippines, may be able to forge an important strategic 
alliance in Southeast Asia to offset the influence of China, one of the world's 
few remaining Communist nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton declared last July that he would maintain the embargo until Vietnam 
proved its willingness to help provide a full accounting of missing servicemen. 
In citing progress on that front, Clinton pointed to four factors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Since last July, the remains of 39 American servicemen have been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of inadequately explained "discrepancy cases" has fallen from 135 
to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vietnam and Laos have stepped up their cooperation in searches for remains 
along their common border. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Vietnamese have released important documents from their archives, 
including from antiaircraft units along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and from a 
"military political unit," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that they have other incentives, short of a resumption of 
the embargo, to ensure continued Vietnamese cooperation. The nation still wants 
full diplomatic relations with the United States, entry into international 
financial institutions in which the United States is especially influential and 
assistance from U.S. programs that promote trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that his Administration has 500 people working on the search for 
Americans missing in Southeast Asia -- "more than any other Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 He denied that his own lack of service in the military played any role in his 
decision. Indeed, although Clinton marched against the war as a student, he 
indicated that he had special feelings for the 58,000 Americans who died in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his own history, he said: "Everyone my age, whether they were in 
Vietnam or not, knew someone who died there. . . . And I think people in our 
generation are more insistent on trying to get a full accounting, more obsessed 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that all his senior military and diplomatic advisers and all his 
Cabinet members involved in the issue had urged that the embargo be lifted. 
Economic motives were so far removed, he said, that the Administration did not 
even conduct a study of the trade consequences of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 It was perhaps a measure of the war's lingering bitterness that a number of 
the President's critics made a point of stressing his avoidance of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Clinton refused to serve in Vietnam, protested the war and has no 
military experience. Yet he thinks he understands Vietnam better than the 
families who have endured years of uncertainty, national veterans organizations 
. . . and the majority of former POWs who sacrificed years of their lives in 
captivity," said Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.), a Vietnam veteran who led the 
unsuccessful opposition to last week's Senate resolution on the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) also denounced the move, calling it 
"the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While representatives from four veterans organizations attended the White 
House meeting with Clinton, the nation's largest POW-MIA family group, the 
National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast 
Asia, was so angry that its representative, Ann Mills Griffiths, boycotted the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has "clearly broken" his promises on the conditions for lifting 
the embargo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Clinton) didn't have the guts to fight in Vietnam, and now he's shown 
that he won't fight to bring our POWs home from Vietnam," said Dolores Alfond, 
the sister of a missing serviceman and president of the Seattle-based National 
Alliance of Families. "President Clinton has sold out the morality of the 
American people for a few pieces of silver." 
</P>
<P>
 "He lied," said J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam Veterans 
Coalition, a federation of 75 veterans and POW-MIA family groups. "All of the 
campaign promises he made to us about not lifting the embargo until there was a 
full accounting were just campaign rhetoric. He has betrayed our country and 
abandoned our men, and Vietnam veterans will do all that we can to assure that 
America elects a different President in 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 The family and veterans groups also took issue with Clinton's contention that 
significant progress already has been made in accounting for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Childress, a former Ronald Reagan Administration official who oversaw 
the POW-MIA issue as director of Asian affairs on the National Security Council 
from 1981 to 1989, said that the Administration "worked very hard to create an 
aura of real cooperation" on the POW issue. But he said most of Hanoi's 
cooperation to date has been cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, they've been turning over documents, but what (the Vietnamese) are 
giving us are summary documents. The originals are still there," Childress 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials will need some weeks to write regulations to govern trade 
relations between the countries. But the business community was quick to 
predict broad and immediate effects from the easing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything you can think of, they need," said Eric Rehmann, managing director 
for the Vietnam America Trade & Investment Consulting Co. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam is hoping to rebuild roads, bridges, telecommunications systems, 
ports, airports and hospitals. Because the George Bush Administration decided 
to permit limited business contacts, such U.S. firms as Bank of America, IBM, 
Caterpillar, DuPont, Motorola and Phillip Morris already are licensed to do 
business there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after Clinton's announcement, American Express and United Airlines 
announced plans to begin operations in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies are worried about whether they will get there ahead of European 
and Asian competitors. But experts said that, even if business prospects are 
not as bright as some would portray them, there should be a substantial boost 
to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEW CHALLENGES: End of embargo opens up more opportunities for U.S. A7 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORIES AND GRAPHICS: A5-7, D1 Beginning a New Era 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton lifted the 19-year-old trade embargo with Vietnam on 
Thursday, formally opening the way for commerce with Hanoi. He cited Vietnam's 
progress in searching for U.S. servicemen missing during the Vietnam War. 
Immediate Impact 
</P>
<P>
 * Unrestricted commercial ties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emergence of American businesses in Vietnam. Commercial sales to Vietnam had 
been permitted since April, 1992, but only for those products that met basic 
human needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Likely resumption of flights by U.S. airlines directly into Vietnam. POWs 
and MIAs 
</P>
<P>
 * Since July, remains of additional 39 Americans have been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 2,238 U.S. servicemen are still unaccounted from the war. 
</P>
<P>
 * Veterans groups feel betrayed and think this will hinder efforts to find 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton says action will result in more information on POWs and MIAs. What's 
Next 
</P>
<P>
 * Opening of U.S. liaison office in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continued monitoring of human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Washington must issue regulations governing trade and investment in Vietnam 
for U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Possible establishment of full diplomatic relations.

JAPAN PREMIER DOES TURNABOUT ON TAX PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE and DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa today abruptly backed down from a 
tax package proposed just one day earlier to jump-start the flagging economy, a 
stunning turnabout meant to quell a political backlash that had threatened to 
destroy his ruling coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's reversal on plans to enact a $49-billion tax cut, and a new welfare 
tax to finance it, came after hours of fruitless negotiations with the 
Socialists, who had threatened to quit the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 It underscored a mounting power struggle within his coalition that seems 
headed toward sweeping political realignments in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 The brouhaha is likely to weaken Hosokawa just days before his Feb. 11 summit 
with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Hosokawa has enjoyed sky-high public approval ratings despite 
taking controversial steps to open Japan's sacrosanct rice market and pass a 
severely watered-down political reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said his growing confidence -- and a tendency toward imperious rule 
stemming from his family's royal history -- led him to commit what could become 
the most serious political miscalculation of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prime minister must have been drunk on his own high public approval 
ratings," said Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, a Socialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's backpedaling is likely to displease Japan's industry and trading 
partners, who have been urging a tax cut to combat the worst recession in two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Although chances remained that an economic stimulus package could still be 
announced later in the day, it will not contain the critical component of the 
tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who had praised Hosokawa's 
tax cut plan when it was released, expressed hope that an economic stimulus 
program will still be forthcoming very soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has urged a tax cut to stimulate consumer spending and 
help shave Japan's $50-billion trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock markets barely responded, however, as traders said that many had not 
heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the short-term effect for the market will be disquiet," said one 
trader at James Capel & Co. "The coalition looks shaky once again." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax package, which would have enacted a 7% tax on goods and services in 
April, 1997, replacing the 3% consumption tax, had drawn fierce opposition from 
a broad array of critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists, the coalition's largest party, had threatened to quit the 
coalition over the new tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hosokawa's own Japan New Party members and those of its ally, Masayoshi 
Takemura's New Party Harbinger, opposition Liberal Democratic Party members, 
many of Japan's major newspapers and many citizens had also voiced protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tabloids presented screaming headlines about the "Hitler-like" tactics 
used to decide on the plan and announce it in the wee hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy illuminated a growing split among the partners in the 
government coalition.

HOUSE OKS $8.6-BILLION EARTHQUAKE RELIEF BILL; POLITICS: LEGISLATORS AGREE TO 
$2.6 BILLION IN OFFSETTING SPENDING REDUCTIONS AFTER REJECTING PLEAS FOR LARGER 
CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The House on Thursday swiftly sent the $8.6-billion California earthquake 
relief bill to the Senate, paving the way for final congressional approval by 
the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a magnificent victory and it will help speed this through the 
Senate," said Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), dean of the California delegation. 
The bill passed on a 337-74 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats, joined by a bloc of 26 Republicans, turned back a determined 
effort by a bipartisan coalition to pay for the new spending with $9.7 billion 
of cuts in defense, transportation, community development, foreign aid and 
other national programs. Following intensive arm-twisting, the vote rejecting 
the amendment was surprisingly decisive, 240-178. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the House leadership had a scare when another proposal to cut 
spending by $7.5 billion was narrowly defeated, 211-207. Instead, with the 
backing of the Democrats, the House voted, 415-2, for a relatively modest $2.6 
billion in cuts in various federal programs that it had already passed last 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 In the process, the bill's leading advocates from Southern California worked 
doggedly to sidetrack proposals that they said could have seriously complicated 
their goal of pushing the measure through the Senate and on to President 
Clinton next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the urgency of the timing, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency said Thursday that it has halted delivery of money for rebuilding roads 
and public structures in 20 states because a string of recent natural disasters 
has seriously depleted emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
 With the federal disaster aid fund down to $200 million, officials said they 
acted to ensure that they would be able to continue providing emergency shelter 
and other immediate care to those stricken by the Northridge quake. FEMA 
officials said they are continuing to provide funds for infrastructure repair 
to the Los Angeles disaster area, but only to meet critical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 During its speedy movement through the House this week, the measure became 
embroiled in two highly charged political issues at the outset of an election 
year: illegal immigration and deficit reduction. The bill emerged with 
compromise amendments that its leading sponsors said would forestall potential 
problems in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no discussion on the House floor about the immigration amendment, 
which prohibits government agencies from giving longer-term benefits to 
earthquake victims who are known to be illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's votes were the culmination of a bid by deficit hawks of both 
parties to attach a pay-as-you-go provision to the disaster relief bill rather 
than add the new outlays to the federal deficit. President Clinton and House 
leaders maintained that the government should not suddenly change its customary 
method of paying for emergency aid in the wake of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cloakroom and on the House floor Thursday, key advocates of the bill 
argued to wavering colleagues that adoption of the amendment to slice spending 
by $9.7 billion over five years would mean trimming programs in their own 
districts to pay for Southern California's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, under the terms of the proposal, the cuts for the first year would 
have had to be implemented in the next six months because the 1994 fiscal year 
is nearly half over. Sponsors of the relief bill said that could have crippled 
programs such as drug enforcement, the FBI and border control that are 
priorities for many fiscal conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the most ardent supporters of the Clinton package agreed that 
Congress should seek other ways to pay for disaster relief in the future. But 
as Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) said, "It should not be done 
on the backs of the people who have suffered the tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the bill's passage, the House leadership named a bipartisan task 
force to examine other funding mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Republicans went all-out to win broad spending cuts under the emergency 
aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have another disaster -- the federal deficit -- and citizens will be 
feeling the aftershocks from that for years to come," said Rep. Gerald B. 
Solomon (R-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
 The more sweeping proposal to trim $9.7 billion was sponsored by Rep. Tim 
Penny (D-Minn.) and Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), a politically potent team who 
have attracted significant support for deficit-cutting plans in recent months. 
Most Republicans joined with them but a crucial group of GOP lawmakers who had 
previously supported their efforts broke ranks on the earthquake relief bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an emergency bill, not a budget-balancing measure," said Rep. Jerry 
Lewis (R-Redlands). "This is the wrong thing at the wrong time in the wrong 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, senior California Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, and 
McKeon, president of the GOP freshman class, teamed up to persuade other 
Republicans to resist spending cuts that might bedevil the relief bill. They 
were among six California Republicans who voted against the Penny-Kasich 
package; 16 supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who represents portions of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys 
devastated by the quake, said he had intended to vote for the Penny-Kasich 
proposal until Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) persuaded him that its 
passage might slow the aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fundamental principle is that you don't build up the deficit," said McKeon 
as he lobbied colleagues. "But I don't want to do anything to slow (the aid) 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 California Democrats, with the lone exception of Rep. Gary A. Condit 
(D-Ceres), voted solidly against both of the larger spending reduction 
proposals. Berman and Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles) took the lead in 
mobilizing opposition to those spending offsets. 
</P>
<P>
 If it wins final approval, the $8.6-billion emergency aid package would be the 
costliest in the nation's history. The bill also contains nearly $1.2 billion 
for military peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Bosnia and elsewhere, as well as 
nearly $750 million for other previous disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the House cast its votes, Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) predicted 
that, as more damage is uncovered from the quake, "We have to be prepared to 
help Los Angeles again. There will certainly be a second (emergency aid) 
request before the end of spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, FEMA Director James Lee Witt told a Senate Appropriations 
subcommittee hearing Thursday that it was critical for Congress to quickly pass 
the earthquake aid package so that the delivery of emergency services in 
Southern California is not interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do not get this supplemental passed, we are all in a position moving 
into the next week or two where we could literally run out of funds," Witt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze order would affect federal emergency funds to Midwestern states hit 
by last summer's floods, Florida communities racked by Hurricane Andrew and 
Southern California areas rebuilding from last year's fires, said Richard W. 
Krimm, FEMA associate director for response and recovery.

GARAGE RUINS EXAMINED FOR QUAKE LESSONS 
</P>

 As they sift for lessons in the rubble of the massive Northridge earthquake, 
experts have been alarmed by the spectacular failures of several large parking 
structures which could have entombed scores of victims had they collapsed 
during business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all modern buildings, parking structures "appear to have suffered the 
largest incidence of partial or total collapse," said a preliminary report by 
UC Berkeley's Earthquake Engineering Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The most troubling aspect of the failures, experts said, is that several new 
parking structures took the heaviest hits, while many older garages -- built at 
a time of weaker building codes and less engineering know-how -- came through 
with less damage. They also noted that structures assembled from precast 
concrete sections seemed most vulnerable, and that the garages may have been 
subjected to more vertical quake movement than they were designed to withstand. 
</P>
<P>
 At least eight public parking structures at heavily used shopping centers, 
colleges and hospitals either partly or completely collapsed. Four were built 
in the last six years, and the others were built between 1965 and 1982. Cracked 
or crumbling columns and beams caused building inspectors to close at least 20 
others in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Glendale. Many of those will take 
months to repair at a cost of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although experts are not unanimous about the causes of the failures, or how to 
prevent future ones, several said they signify a dangerous combination of 
inadequacies in building codes and an increasing drive to cut costs by 
designing for the minimum code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Southern California, the construction market is very cutthroat," said Neil 
Hawkins, chairman of the civil engineering department at the University of 
Illinois, who inspected more than a dozen parking structures damaged by the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 If "you can still satisfy the words of the code and the system is cheaper, 
everybody will buy that one," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is very high to cut the building down to the absolute minimum 
requirements of the code," said structural engineer Bill Holmes, part of a 
quake study team sent by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute in 
Oakland. "Because of the highly competitive nature . . . the costly details of 
tying together precast structures or the extensive engineering that would be 
required is perhaps not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Structural and seismic engineers who came from around the country to study the 
effects of the quake generally agreed that current practices in the design and 
construction of parking structures need to be revised to require more 
resistance to seismic forces -- particularly the unexpectedly large vertical 
thrust of the type produced by the Northridge temblor. Some also suggested that 
more diligent inspections and review of construction plans are needed to 
protect against future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the attention of the engineers focused on today's prevalent building 
method of stitching together large precast concrete slabs and beams rather than 
pouring the concrete into forms to harden as a single unit -- or building with 
steel, which is more expensive but is the most quake-resistant material. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say precast structures -- relatively cheap to build because they can 
be put up quickly -- require special care to strengthen the connections between 
the structural elements. "It's like a card house and if you don't tie your 
cards together carefully, it will all collapse," said Helmut Krawinkler, 
co-director of Stanford University's John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, it is more difficult to make precast structures as sturdy as other 
buildings. The more engineering and materials put into the ties, the more 
costly the building -- defeating the purpose for which precast concrete was 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts said precast structures proved most vulnerable to the intense 
shaking of the 6.6-magnitude Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge Fashion Center, where two large precast parking structures 
built in 1988 partially collapsed, two much older poured-in-place garages built 
in 1971 suffered cracking but did not fall. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, an $11.5-million parking structure, built mainly of 
precast elements just two years ago, also partially collapsed while a 
cast-in-place garage just three blocks north, also completed in 1991, came 
through intact. 
</P>
<P>
 And a portion of the upper deck of the Glendale Civic Center garage, 
constructed in 1988 by pouring a slab over precast beams, caved in, breaking 
through two decks below as it fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Several experts interviewed by The Times said such failures exposed the 
limitations of the building code in ensuring the safety of the bare-bones 
modern parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking structures typically feature long spans and open architecture, both to 
save money and park the largest number of cars. Interior partitions and walls 
-- which would dissipate part of a quake's destructive energy -- are kept to a 
minimum. The exterior walls also have large openings -- saving money and 
helping to light and ventilate the structure, but again providing fewer 
structural elements to absorb the shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the code upgradings after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, advances in 
engineering know-how have allowed designers to widen the spans and reduce other 
internal support and still get their plans approved by building departments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, experts said, engineers were more apt to design buildings well in 
excess of code requirements -- in part because of uncertainty over how much 
structural strength it would take to meet the minimums. Ironically, advancing 
knowledge may be tempting them to refine their seismic calculations to a thin 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The engineer probably has too much confidence in the code being correct," 
said Hawkins, of the University of Illinois. "Unfortunately, he always has to 
work to the minimum of the code -- otherwise, he won't get the job." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the public perception, the code is, " 'God protect us all,' and 
it isn't that way," said Fred Herman, chief building official for the city of 
Palo Alto and a board member of the International Conference of Building 
Officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a minimum standard, and building departments fight all the time to get 
designs to meet the minimum," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Peter Yanev, chairman of EQE International, a leading earthquake 
engineering firm, "If you (just) meet the code, you're barely legal . . . . If 
there's any error, you're definitely underneath -- and people make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Uniform Building Code, which is used by all California cities and 
counties, does not dictate specific methods of construction, but rather sets 
seismic strength guidelines, allowing the designers great leeway in deciding 
how to meet expected stresses. 
</P>
<P>
 In high-risk seismic areas, parking structures, as well as other buildings, 
are supposed to resist the sideways movement generated by a large quake. This 
is done through the use of stiff and strong "shear walls," which resist the 
movement, or with "ductile" building frames designed to bend, but not break, 
under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts cited several possible explanations for garage collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some structures apparently failed because internal columns that should have 
flexed with the rest of the building instead snapped under the sideways force. 
</P>
<P>
 Such internal columns were not designed to help resist the sideways movement, 
but merely to carry the weight of the building. Nonetheless, they were supposed 
to "ride along" with the parts of the building designed to resist the sideways 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way or another, it is absolutely clear that the (internal columns) could 
not follow the movement of the lateral load resisting system," said S.K. Ghosh, 
director of codes, standards and engineering services for the Portland Cement 
Assn., a trade group based in Skokie, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, experts said, it appeared that key connections between 
structural elements pulled apart under the force of the quake, causing the 
buildings to collapse. This may have contributed to the parking structure 
failure at the Glendale Civic Center, said an engineer who visited the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Behrend, architect for the civic center garage addition that collapsed 
in the quake, said he had visited the site and did not yet know why the 
structure failed, but he suspected vertical movement was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, experts said some failures may have resulted from the crushing of 
columns by the strong vertical thrust of this particular earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most quakes generate primarily sideways movement, and the building code sets 
no special requirement for sustaining vertical pressures. However, the 
Northridge quake caused strong vertical as well as horizontal thrust, and some 
experts say that may have been a factor in parking structure failures. 
</P>
<P>
 David Anderson, vice president for operations of A.T. Curd Builders Inc. of 
Glendale, which built the collapsed Cal State Northridge garage, said the 
internal columns were designed only to handle the dead load of the building, 
and "that's all they were required to handle." 
</P>
<P>
 The "earthquake did something that was not anticipated by the code." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Engelkirk, a structural engineer who designed the Northridge Fashion 
Center garages that collapsed in the temblor, also blamed a "failure in the 
vertical load carrying system." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the cause of specific collapses, some critics contend that the 
failures show that more can go wrong with precast buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been telling my wife for years not to park in (precast) garages like 
that," remarked Peter Yanev. "It's almost a joke in the family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanev, who joined a U.S. study team in touring quake-ravaged Armenia in 1988, 
warned of problems with precast concrete in his report on that disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the building systems affected by the earthquake, seismically 
under-designed precast-concrete frames . . . performed most poorly," he wrote 
in a report on the Armenian quake. Similar designs are "also popular in the 
United States," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the system is probably adequate in zones with very low seismicity, the 
earthquake demonstrated that it should be eliminated or radically modified in 
higher-risk zones in both countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the Northridge earthquake, Yanev said, "We can come up with a 
million reasons why the code was inadequate or the engineers made mistakes or 
the earthquake was stronger than anything we've ever seen before. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing new here we are talking about," he said. "Theoretically, 
everything can be made to work. . . . What we need to do is beef up the codes 
and to penalize the poor performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Yanev said he believes the code should be changed to impose a higher standard 
for precast than other types of construction in earthquake zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts, however, said precast construction can do the job if building 
departments are more rigorous in reviewing plans and conducting inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is more a matter of enforcement than a failure of the code," 
Krawinkler said. "From a building department perspective, it's difficult, 
because ensuring compliance with code requires much larger manpower. Yes, it 
can be done, but not the way building departments are staffed today." 
</P>
<P>
 Still others predicted that the building code will be changed to address 
vertical pressures such as those that came with the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will definitely be some harder looks taken at this vertical 
acceleration aspect," said Ray McCann, a member of the Structural Engineers 
Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the experts reach a consensus on the lessons of the Jan. 17 
earthquake, their recommendations cannot be written into the Uniform Building 
Code until 1997 when it will next be revised by the International Conference of 
Building Officials. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the California Building Standards Commission, a state agency, could 
require local governments to upgrade their standards in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, local officials must decide whether older parking structures that 
are repaired must be brought up to current standards, however inadequate some 
critics may think them to be. In Los Angeles, any portions of parking garages 
that suffered structural damage will have to be brought to current code, said 
Nick Delli Quadri, senior structural engineer with the city's Department of 
Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the financial pressures and the short half-life of even pressing issues, 
some experts are concerned that the lessons of the garage failures will go 
unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is always a financial story," Krawinkler said. "Garages have little 
impact compared to freeway overpasses. It may fizzle out. Hopefully it will 
not."

LITTLE SAIGON SUBDUED AFTER EMBARGO ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the news finally came to Little Saigon in Orange County and the end was 
clear, so many people had braced themselves for the lifting of the 19-year U.S. 
trade embargo against Vietnam that, apart from a general sense of sadness, the 
deepest emotions most could muster were regret, resignation and bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is home to the nation's largest Vietnamese community, 70,572 
people according to the latest Census. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, it was just another gray, subdued business day on the Bolsa 
Avenue strip of shops and pho restaurants in Westminster's Little Saigon -- the 
cultural capital of the 300,000 or so Vietnamese immigrants living in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 As President Clinton delivered his announcement live from Washington, rows of 
flickering television sets at the Ultimate Electronics International Appliance 
Store in the Asian Garden Mall were tuned to another program: "Woody 
Woodpecker." Two toddlers watched with keen interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is quiet. The reaction of the community seems fairly low. So I 
think it's a good thing for the President," said Co Pham, head of the 
Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce who just a few months ago donned a bullet-proof 
vest and hired bodyguards because his vociferous support for normalization of 
relations between the two nations aroused such heated reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 For days, news of the President's expected decision had circulated widely in 
the Vietnamese community. When it was finally official, the only surprise was 
that the announcement was not made on Friday, as had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not Friday?" asked Huu Dinh Vo, a Pomona physician who is co-chairman of the 
Vietnamese American Community in the USA. "Guessing when it will happen is one 
thing, but to actually hear about it is something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a bit disappointed," said Vo, a staunch opponent of trade with 
Vietnam. "I think American business will have a chance to make a profit in 
Vietnam. At the same time, the Communists will have the propaganda to say the 
embargo is lifted. They will care less about human rights. The more money they 
have, the more they can cling to power." 
</P>
<P>
 Vo and other allies scrambled to organize a Saturday demonstration on Bolsa 
Avenue to oppose the President's action. Other major community groups -- such 
as the Vietnamese Community of Southern California, which already had big plans 
to inaugurate its president this weekend -- offered moral support for the 
effort, but not much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Diem Do, a member of the National United Front for the Liberation of Vietnam 
and host of a cable television show called "Youth and Tomorrow," said his group 
was preparing to stage a weekend demonstration in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to point out to the Vietnamese community that no matter what happens, 
we're going to struggle for human rights in Vietnam," Do said. "We don't want 
the community to feel down or depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 There was anger and dismay among those who argued the lifting of the trade 
embargo eased the pressure on Vietnam to provide information about American 
service personnel who were prisoners of war or who are missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lowerison, a San Diegan whose brother, Air Force Col. Joseph Scharf, 
was shot down near Hanoi in 1965, said she was infuriated by Clinton's 
decision. "I hope to God I'm wrong, but I think the Vietnamese might just go 
ahead and murder our Americans (POWS) because they've outlived their 
usefulness," Lowerison said. "We've lost our bargaining power with the 
Vietnamese. Vietnam has won the war totally now." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowerison, a longtime activist among POW-MIA families, had asked Clinton about 
her brother in a televised Town Hall meeting in San Diego in May. She believes 
that her brother is still being held prisoner. After the release of American 
POWs in 1973, the Pentagon listed Scharf as dead, but Lowerison maintains that 
the military is withholding vital records that might prove that he and others 
are still captives. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese officials today welcomed the American action, calling it a logical 
development whose time had come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important event for Vietnam," said Do Cong Minh, the director of the 
government's Foreign Press Center. "Certainly it creates more favorable 
conditions for relations between the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we've been waiting for," said Vu Binh, a government 
official. "It comes as the result of a logical development. The Vietnamese 
public has been prepared for this. On the American side, the President has the 
momentum and political support that he lacked before." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, for the Vietnamese who fled their homeland and now live in Orange 
County, Thursday brought no tears, just the chill numbness of depression. 
Missing were the charged arguments against normalization that have erupted into 
fist fights in Little Saigon. Gone was the passion. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Boniface Church in Anaheim, the Rev. Joseph Son Nguyen shook his head 
as he listened to the President's announcement. "He was talking about Vietnam, 
and I felt so left out," Nguyen said. "Vietnamese Americans were not once 
mentioned. A very important constituency of this country was left out. I am an 
American citizen, and, in listening to the President talk about why he's doing 
this, I felt that the government didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Trang Nguyen was on her way back to Orange County from a Burbank meeting when 
she heard the news crackle on her car radio. "He lifted the embargo without any 
conditions, and I'm so disappointed," Nguyen said. "Why did we go to war? For 
democracy, for freedom. Now, none of those goals are achieved, and we're 
trading with our enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, opposition to the end of the trade embargo had been a test for 
every local Vietnamese leader. Supporters were probed for softness on 
communism; some were found lacking. It was difficult to find anyone favoring 
normalization to debate the issue on Little Saigon television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 But the embargo's end opened the way for many younger Vietnamese to speak 
freely about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Nguyen, 31, is an actor who has appeared on television shows such as 
"21 Jump Street" and the movie "Heaven and Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a day that goes by that we don't hope the embargo would be 
lifted," he said. "It's not a panacea, but it's definitely a step. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, we have to transcend the political barrier for the country to 
heal," Nguyen said. "Vietnamese-Americans who oppose (normalization) may have 
to re-examine themselves and their feelings and ask themselves whether their 
problems are personal issues." 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, when the Union of Vietnamese Students Assn. of Southern 
California hosts a two-day Tet festival in Huntington Beach, there will be 
students manning an information booth with petitions calling for free elections 
in Vietnam. They are ready, they say, to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung Nguyen, who has ambitions to one day run for Congress, will be there 
with the younger generation. "Back in the '60s, Americans came to Vietnam for 
freedom and now they have the chance to attain the same goal with a peaceful 
means," he said. "We should not betray the Americans who died for political 
freedom."

PROPOSED QUAKE AID LIMITS SEEN AS MOSTLY SYMBOLIC; IMMIGRANTS: ILLEGAL 
RESIDENTS COULD STILL RECEIVE EMERGENCY BENEFITS. BUT DEBATE MAY HAVE POLITICAL 
IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The proposed congressional amendment barring illegal immigrants from receiving 
non-emergency earthquake aid may have more impact on election-year politics 
than any practical effect on providing assistance to disaster victims, federal 
officials and immigration activists say. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the bulk of President Clinton's $8.6-billion aid package would 
go toward fixing freeways, schools and other public facilities rather than 
assisting individuals. Moreover, much of the aid to individuals is earmarked 
for emergency shelter, food and medical care -- all of which are exempt from 
the proposed regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Emergency Management Agency director James Lee Witt said the amendment 
would have little impact on his agency, which primarily distributes short-term 
emergency aid. "The amendment I have seen wouldn't hinder our efforts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency officials say they have no idea what percentage of aid-seekers are 
undocumented immigrants since they do not inquire, but Witt and others said 
they do not think the numbers are sizable. Studies have shown that most 
undocumented residents do not seek long-term aid from government agencies 
because of fear of being deported. One such study showed that Latinos -- 
including illegal immigrants -- use government health and welfare benefits at 
half the rate of whites and a fifth of the rate of blacks, according to UCLA 
professor David Hayes-Bautista. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that many undocumented will apply for these programs," Hayes-Bautista 
said. "Economically, it is meaningless." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulation, introduced by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) and 
adopted in modified form by the House on Thursday, would be aimed primarily at 
excluding illegal immigrants from longer-term aid programs such as 18-month 
housing subsidy grants provided by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, and low-interest residential and business loans offered by the 
Small Business Administration. The bill, with the amendment, still must be 
acted on by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 While the amendment bars federal agencies from giving long-term federal 
disaster aid to anyone they know to be in the country illegally, it does not 
require them to ask applicants their residency status. "Unless there is a 
mandate to ask, the federal agencies won't ask," said Dan Stein, executive 
director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, adding that the 
amendment is therefore largely symbolic. "We are again seeing political fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 But Packard said that if the amendment is enacted, "agencies will determine 
how to implement the law." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they choose to not find ways to implement that law, we will find ways for 
them to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because extensive paperwork is required for an SBA loan -- applicants must 
also submit federal income tax forms and a Social Security number -- few 
undocumented residents would be likely to apply for disaster assistance loans, 
SBA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, we have never heard of a single case of an illegal 
getting a loan," said Alfred Judd, deputy assistant administrator for disaster 
assistance for the SBA. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD's Section 8 housing subsidy program for quake victims has moved forward so 
quickly that the implementation of a congressional ban might not occur until 
many earthquake victims have already received their vouchers and moved into 
their new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, more than 11,000 people have qualified for 
housing vouchers and 1,426 of them have located new apartments. The only 
remaining steps before they move in are government inspections to make sure the 
units are shipshape and the signing of contracts with landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we could undo what's done," said Joe Shuldiner, assistant 
secretary of HUD. "I don't think contracts would be nullified." 
</P>
<P>
 The detailed application procedure for winning housing subsidies makes it 
unlikely that many undocumented immigrants would be served, Shuldiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a sense the people receiving certificates are undocumented," he 
said. "As a practical matter . . . we're talking about people waiting on line 
for a long time, filling out forms in which they have to give their Social 
Security numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1980, Congress has voted several times to restrict housing assistance 
programs to only legal residents. However, implementation was held up as a 
result of court decisions and public criticism of the enabling regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The push for regulations against aid to illegal immigrants is an issue that 
HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros would prefer to sidestep during the current 
emergency, according to a White House aide involved with immigration policy and 
earthquake issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks the earthquake is not the time to start making policy on this," 
said the aide. "He's reluctant to turn HUD field officers into immigration 
cops." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuldiner concurred that HUD officials are concerned "about this being imposed 
here for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is something Congress wants to do to address problems with 
undocumented aliens, the department would hope they'd take it up as part of an 
immigration issue rather than a supplemental to disaster relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Republican as well as Democratic HUD officials have expressed 
concerns about barring aid to illegal residents, who are eligible to send their 
children to public schools and to receive emergency medical care. In 1990, 
President George Bush's HUD secretary, Jack Kemp, warned Costa Mesa officials 
that they risked losing federal funding if they barred illegal immigrants from 
receiving HUD-related social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Those favoring Packard's restrictions call current government policy 
schizophrenic.  
</P>
<P>
 "They want to enforce immigration law at the border, but once illegals are in 
the U.S., they want to play Santa Claus," said FAIR's Stein.  
</P>
<P>
 But immigrant advocates counter that the limitations are motivated by ugly 
political interests, and fear the amendment may have negative ramifications for 
some undocumented residents, as well as the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking Thursday at the Central American Resource 
Center, blasted the proposal as "immoral and unfair." Joined by Los Angeles 
City Council members Jackie Goldberg and Mark Ridley-Thomas, Jackson denounced 
the "resurrection of anti-immigrant hysteria" nationwide and called for the 
defeat of the provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Lovato, the center's executive director, said, "We have reached a 
moral low as a country when we deny emergency aid to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of the whole anti-immigrant agenda," he said. "This is the first 
salvo in an ongoing battle this election year." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovato said that limitations on housing and other assistance could result in 
more homelessness and crime by some of the county's estimated 700,000 illegal 
residents. "A lot of people presume that if immigrants don't get aid, they will 
go away," said Angelo Ancheta, executive director of the Coalition for Humane 
Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. "People won't go back to Tijuana. They will 
stay in the parks."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON HAD CLEAR VIETNAM STRATEGY -- AND FOLLOWED IT; FOREIGN 
POLICY: POLITICAL SENSITIVITY OF THE MIA ISSUE CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. BUSH HAD 
ALREADY LAID GROUNDWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Bill Clinton became President a year ago, the conventional wisdom among 
foreign policy experts was that improving relations between the United States 
and Vietnam had just moved onto a distant back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had spent much of his campaign answering charges that he had 
maneuvered to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. And only weeks after he 
came to the White House, the new President was embroiled in another emotional 
military issue, his order to allow gays to serve in the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seemed unlikely that Clinton would take bold steps on the touchy 
question of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this issue waits for a Clinton Administration," one Indochina expert said 
before the inauguration, "we might have to wait until (1995) or even longer." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Clinton and his aides quietly began moving on Vietnam almost 
immediately -- denying all the while that they had made any firm decisions. 
They devised what Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord called "an 
incremental strategy," moving one small step at a time through the political 
minefield of the prisoner-of-war issue. They frequently stopped to gauge public 
reactions before moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Clinton finally took a major public step, lifting the U.S. trade 
embargo that has applied to Communist-ruled North Vietnam for 30 years and to 
South Vietnam since it fell to the Communists 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have made the judgment that the best way to ensure cooperation from Vietnam 
(on accounting for troops missing in the war) . . . is to end the trade 
embargo," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move drew criticism from groups representing the families of Vietnam POWs 
and MIAs -- but praise from most of Congress, including some frequent Clinton 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the President has handled this very well, especially given the 
circumstances surrounding his involvement in the issue," said Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), a conservative former POW who has campaigned for more normal 
relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for a President who has come to grief in other forays into foreign 
policy, from Somalia and Bosnia to Haiti, the careful but steady march toward 
lifting the trade embargo stands out as a notable case of sure-footedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials offer several reasons for the Administration's success. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that Clinton decided early in his Administration on a set of clear, 
precise goals, which has not been the case on some issues. A second important 
factor is that Vietnam, anxious for U.S. trade and investment, cooperated 
enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 And a third, ironically, was the political sensitivity of the MIA issue. It 
captured Clinton's attention in a way that only a few other foreign policy 
problems have, focused the policy clearly on winning cooperation from the 
Vietnamese -- and ensured that the problem would get top-level treatment when 
decisions were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one issue where he has clearly delineated his priorities," a senior 
official said of Clinton. "We often have some tension between goals when we're 
pursuing relations with various countries -- security, human rights, economics. 
. . . This is one case where the priorities were firmly established. In this 
case, (it was) the MIA issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was lucky on one other count: He basically agreed with the policy that 
his predecessor, George Bush, was already following. In 1991, Bush had given 
Vietnam what officials called "a road map" for improved relations with the 
United States. At the top of the map was greater cooperation on clearing up the 
cases of more than 2,000 servicemen listed as missing from the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 In his campaign, Clinton never explicitly endorsed Bush's policy, which had 
drawn criticism from POW-MIA family groups. Instead, battling his own Vietnam 
problem, he gave the impression that he would be extra tough on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is personally a very big issue with me," he said. At a "town meeting" in 
Detroit, he told a POW activist that he would "make it clear to Vietnam and to 
the other countries in Southeast Asia that full normalization of relationships 
depends upon an accounting for every single one of those people." 
</P>
<P>
 But two weeks after the election, Clinton offered a softer line -- one that 
turned out to be the policy he followed. Instead of demanding a complete 
accounting, something military experts say is a practical impossibility, 
Clinton called on Vietnam to provide "the most extensive and good faith 
possible effort" to account for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The first steps were halting -- and thrown off course by unexpected events. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department and National Security Council officials began drawing up 
policy papers within weeks of the inauguration. As an initial move, they 
suggested, Clinton could drop the U.S. objection to new loans for Vietnam from 
the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But in February, the Administration found itself embroiled in the controversy 
over gays in the military, prompting caution on other military issues. And in 
April, a Harvard researcher published a document from Soviet archives which 
charged Vietnam with deliberately concealing the survival of hundreds of U.S. 
prisoners in 1972. That touched off an uproar among POW-MIA groups -- and 
forced a three-month postponement of the IMF move. 
</P>
<P>
 By July, Clinton was ready to take his first major step. On the Friday before 
the July 4 weekend -- a time chosen partly because Congress was out of town and 
the public was heading for the holidays -- the White House announced that the 
United States was dropping its opposition to new international loans for 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton laid out four specific areas where he wanted more 
cooperation from Hanoi before the United States would lift the embargo: the 
recovery of remains of servicemen who died in Vietnam; the resolution of cases 
in which MIAs might have survived; faster delivery of Vietnamese documents that 
could contain information about MIAs, and a joint effort with Laos to search 
that country's border with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House held its breath for public reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were worried that the sky would fall," a senior official 
recalled. "They were pleasantly surprised when it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Clinton sent three officials to Hanoi to assess Vietnam's 
performance: Lord, Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Herschel Gober and Lt. 
Gen. Michael E. Ryan, an aide to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials talked with much of Vietnam's Communist hierarchy -- and with 
the U.S. military experts sifting through aircraft crash sites on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 They looked at cardboard boxes with bits of bones and teeth, at battered old 
dog tags, at tattered, faded logs from Vietnamese anti-aircraft units 
recounting the survival or death of U.S. pilots whose planes were shot down. 
And they came away impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were clearly trying to cooperate," one official said of the Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 Gober, an old friend of Clinton's from Arkansas, told the President that the 
Vietnamese performance was real. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Hershel Gober switches, when he's convinced, that makes a big 
difference," a White House official said. "They go back a long time. And not 
only that. Here's a guy who understands deeply the way the families feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the President wanted to move slowly. In September, some officials 
suggested at least a partial lifting of the embargo. But Clinton was heading 
toward a showdown in Congress over the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of nervousness in the Senate about taking on the Vietnam 
problem," recalled Sen. McCain. 
</P>
<P>
 So, instead, Clinton announced another partial measure: allowing U.S. firms to 
bid on projects in Vietnam financed by the IMF and other international 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were projects financed partly by U.S. tax dollars," an official 
explained. "It didn't make sense to prohibit Americans from bidding for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The move also reflected another new factor in the debate: the growing 
insistence of U.S. firms that Vietnam was turning into a major market -- and 
that companies from Japan, France and other countries were moving in fast while 
Americans were standing on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the White House announced its action only quietly -- and on the same 
day that Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat sealed a peace agreement at the White 
House. Again, the timing helped forestall POW-MIA groups from mounting much of 
a protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord even joked about the pattern of "Stealth" announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stay tuned for Christmas," he told a group of State Department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He was almost right. In December, he and other officials made another trip to 
Hanoi and found more evidence of real cooperation from the Vietnamese. 
According to one official, Lord told a Dec. 20 meeting of the National Security 
Council Principals Committee -- Clinton's top advisers, including the 
secretaries of State and Defense -- that the time had come to lift the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House and the State Department assured the POW-MIA groups -- and the 
public -- that no decision at all had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, two senators stepped in. John Kerry, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat 
who had won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam before turning against the war; and 
McCain, a conservative Republican, who had spent seven years as a prisoner of 
war in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Both agreed that it was time to lift the embargo -- and neither feared 
accusations of softness on Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last week, Kerry decided, virtually on the spur of the moment, to offer 
the Senate a resolution asking Clinton to lift the embargo. He told his 
national security adviser, Anthony Lake, of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 To some senators, Clinton seemed -- again -- to be testing the wind without 
committing himself on the issue. And some believed that was not all bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was smart," McCain said. It kept the issue bipartisan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry's resolution passed by a surprising 62-38 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave Clinton essential political cover," McCain said.

CLINTON TELLS YOUTHS SEX IS NOT A 'SPORT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring that sex is not "sport" but a "solemn responsibility," President 
Clinton on Thursday entreated a group of junior high school students in a 
crime-ridden neighborhood to avoid mistakes that could cast a shadow over the 
rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the theme of family values, the President told Kramer Junior High 
School students in southeast Washington to delay child-bearing until after 
marriage and to make a firm commitment to family. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is "the most wonderful institution in society," he told a student 
who asked how to "restore family values." And, he said, "there's no such thing 
as a family where fights never occur, where differences never happen, where 
some days you think it wouldn't be easier to quit than go on." 
</P>
<P>
 As he has during a number of talks to adults, Clinton stressed to the 
teen-agers that they must take responsibility for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't live your life for you," he said. "I'll try to keep up my end of the 
deal, and I want you to keep up yours. . . . You have to say: 'I'm going to 
make the most of my life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been steadily expanding his emphasis on family values and personal 
responsibility -- and winning plaudits from liberal and conservative audiences 
for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's State of the Union Address, Clinton spoke of the need for the 
nation's disadvantaged to help themselves, even as the government takes steps 
on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior high school chosen for Thursday's presidential visit was attended 
by several members of the Secret Service and by a White House photographer. 
Last Christmas, the White House Secret Service detail "adopted" the school as 
part of a national mentoring program. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has some of the city's lowest scores in math and reading, and many 
of its children go home at night to single-parent families. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, Clinton attended the National Prayer Breakfast, where Nobel 
Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa called for an end to government-condoned 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abortion just leads to more abortion. Any country that accepts abortion is 
not teaching its people to love one another," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, an abortion-rights supporter, has said the procedure should be legal 
but rare. 
</P>
<P>
 In his comments to the students, Clinton urged the school's girls to put off 
child-bearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Young women "have to decide: 'I'm not going to have a baby until I'm married, 
I'm not going to bring a baby into the world I can't take care of and I'm not 
going to turn around and walk away when I do it. I'm going to take 
responsibility for what I do,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had a warning for young men who carelessly father children, then 
abandon them: "It's something you pay for for the rest of your life," he said. 
"You carry that in the back of your head: Somewhere out there there's some kid 
you didn't take care of who's in terrible shape because of something you didn't 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a sport, this is a solemn responsibility," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how the federal government is working to end the AIDS epidemic, Clinton 
cited his plan to increase spending to fight the disease, even while some 
government agencies are seeing their budgets slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he again emphasized individual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the only thing we know that works with regards to AIDS is not to 
get it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing his program to impose national standards on schools, Clinton 
stressed that even amid the harsh circumstances of their lives, the students 
need to look beyond gratification of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day you have to decide whether the future is what happens to you 30 
minutes from now or what happens to you 10 or 20 years from now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how to fight gangs, Clinton observed that most people want to belong to 
groups that make them feel good and that even schools are gangs, in a sense. 
Thus, the goal should be to coax young people away from violent gangs into 
"more positive" groups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also fielded questions from the students on anti-crime efforts, 
the information superhighway, the Clean Water Act and federal budget cuts.

2 FOOTBALL PLAYERS WOUNDED IN LATEST VENTURA COUNTY VIOLENCE; SHOOTING: BULLETS 
START FLYING DURING AFTER-SCHOOL FIGHT. ONE WESTLAKE HIGH STUDENT IS IN STABLE 
CONDITION AFTER BEING HIT IN THE HEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Westlake High football players were wounded Thursday in a shooting on a 
Thousand Oaks street corner as animosity between teen-age rivals led to 
after-school bloodshed for the second time this week in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors David Behling and Scott Smith were shot at noon just outside North 
Ranch Park, where they and a dozen friends had converged to watch a fistfight 
expected to take place between two other Westlake High students. Behling was 
wounded in the head and remained hospitalized in stable condition Thursday, 
while Smith, who was shot in the shoulder, was treated and released from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 What had been planned as a one-on-one punching match between junior Curtis 
Simmons and a rival swiftly turned into mayhem, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons' antagonist arrived at the North Ranch Park with a group of older 
friends, who began hitting the opponent with pieces of wood, witnesses said. 
When Simmons fled, one of his adversaries opened fire with a small handgun, 
spraying half a dozen bullets into a knot of frightened onlookers, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shocking. It was stunning. I can't believe it," football player Mike 
Priebe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behling, who was shot in the base of the skull, was being held for observation 
at Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village. Doctors said the bullet smashed 
his neck and fractured his skull behind the left ear. They removed the bullet 
and were monitoring the youth for possible infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was struck in the right shoulder by a bullet and crouched on the 
pavement to comfort the more seriously wounded Behling. Smith was treated in 
the hospital's emergency room and released Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies had made no arrests by late Thursday, although they were interviewing 
dozens of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp said detectives had not determined whether the 
incident was gang-related. Friends of the victims said the fight was the 
culmination of a long-running feud between Simmons and the other youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming just two days after the fatal stabbing of a ninth-grader outside a Simi 
Valley junior high, the incident was a reminder that even campuses in the 
nation's safest cities can foster bloody rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Westlake's a little paradise here, but you're not immune anywhere," said Dr. 
Frank Gillingham, director of the Westlake emergency room. "All this stuff is 
pretty foreign to Westlake, but we know it's coming. We don't have our heads 
stuck in the sand. When you have children, you think you will move farther out 
(from the city). But eventually there will be no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura County prosecutors charged a 13-year-old junior high 
student with murder in connection with the death of Chad Hubbard, the 
14-year-old Simi Valley boy who was fatally stabbed as he boarded a bus home 
from school Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, also from Simi Valley, was charged with murder and will be 
arraigned in Juvenile Court this morning. Friends say the stabbing was the 
culmination of a months-long dispute between the two boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he younger than 16, the youth cannot be tried as an adult. If found 
guilty, he can be detained by the California Youth Authority until he is 21.

EX-BORDER PATROL AGENT ACQUITTED IN 1992 SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury in Phoenix acquitted a former Border Patrol agent Thursday in 
the slaying of an unarmed drug-smuggling suspect who was shot in the back as he 
fled through a canyon toward the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had charged Michael Andrew Elmer, 30, with civil rights violations 
and obstruction of justice in the 1992 shooting of Dario Miranda Valenzuela, a 
26-year-old Mexican national. Elmer shot Miranda with a high-powered rifle, 
allegedly attempted to hide the body and persuade his partner to cover up the 
incident, then went drinking with fellow agents instead of reporting the death, 
according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 A state jury had previously cleared Elmer of murder and obstruction of justice 
in the incident near Nogales, Ariz. Elmer resigned from the Border Patrol after 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal jury deliberated about 4 1/2 hours before deciding the highly 
sensitive and emotional case, the first in memory in which the government has 
charged a Border Patrol agent in a shooting death, according to prosecutors. 
The reactions Thursday ranged from jubilation to outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelve neutral people sat down and analyzed the evidence and came to a 
decision," said Michael Piccarreta, Elmer's lawyer. "That's what the system is 
all about. . . . It was a self-defense shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Piccarreta argued that Elmer was a frightened soldier in a harrowing war on 
drugs who made a split-second decision to fire after mistaking a canteen on the 
fleeing Miranda's belt for a holster. 
</P>
<P>
 But a prosecutor said that the jury made its decision in spite of uncontested 
evidence, including testimony from the agent's partner, that Elmer recklessly 
and knowingly committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have trouble convicting police officers," said Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Thomas Perez, who added that the government had spent almost a year preparing 
the case. "Elmer and his partner were two reckless individuals who decided that 
the rules didn't suit them, so they made up their own rules, which ultimately 
had deadly consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Circumstantial evidence that Miranda was involved in drug running may have 
played a role in the verdict, Perez said. Miranda was carrying a small bag of 
marijuana, and cocaine was found in his system. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant rights advocates and representatives of the Mexican government said 
they were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a decision that we find inexplicable," said Nicolas Escalante, consul 
general of Mexico in Phoenix. "We felt that the government presented the proof 
brilliantly. . . . It is lamentable." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing Miranda's family in a civil lawsuit declared that the 
speedy verdict indicates that the jury was racially biased in favor of the 
white Border Patrol agent and against the Mexican victim. The jury consisted of 
eleven whites and one African American. 
</P>
<P>
 "It clearly states that the jury system does not work," said lawyer Jesus 
Romo, who is handling a civil case brought by the slain man's family. "The 
consequences of this verdict are enormously adverse to our community. . . . It 
will instill more fear in the victims. They are already very afraid to report 
incidents of abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal civil rights prosecutions of alleged Border Patrol misconduct are 
rare. Border incidents often occur in remote areas and involve illegal 
immigrants, who tend to be reluctant witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a string of incidents in the Arizona Border Patrol sector and 
elsewhere in past years have revealed that the patrol's slow-moving internal 
oversight system is hampered by a code of silence among some agents. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Miranda shooting took place in June, 1992, some described it as the 
Rodney G. King case of the Border Patrol. The setting was a dangerous 
drug-running corridor where heavily armed agents had been fighting a tense 
battle against traffickers, a campaign that degenerated into widespread use of 
warning shots and other unauthorized tactics, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 About two months after Elmer's first acquittal on state charges in December, 
1992, federal prosecutors began preparing the case alleging that he violated 
the civil rights of Miranda and another suspected courier accompanying him, and 
obstructed justice by trying to enlist his partner, Agent Thomas Watson, in a 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was the government's star witness against Elmer. He testified that he 
fired warning shots upon spotting the suspected drug runners and that Elmer 
then fired six or seven times at Miranda from a distance of about 150 feet. 
Watson said he feared for his life when Elmer, holding his rifle in his hands, 
dragged the body toward the international boundary, told him he planned to bury 
the body the next day and asked "Do you have a problem with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Elmer then went to a parking lot to drink beer with fellow members of a drug 
interdiction team. Watson reported the shooting about 15 hours later; he was 
fired by the patrol for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony against Elmer also featured officials from the Border Patrol 
academy who described his training and an expert who asserted that there was 
enough light in the canyon for Elmer to see that Miranda was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it acknowledged that Elmer broke Border Patrol rules, the defense 
contended that Elmer was being unfairly second-guessed for a justified reaction 
to what he perceived as a threat to his life. The jurors, who were brought to 
the scene of the shooting for a firsthand look, clearly sympathized with the 
difficult task of the Border Patrol at an increasingly militarized border, 
Piccarreta said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he rejected assertions that the race of Elmer, Miranda or the jury played 
a role in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those comments are racist, that anyone from any race would ignore the 
evidence or ignore the law," Piccarreta said. "It had nothing to do with race."

2 SENATORS ASSAIL IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE; CONGRESS: CRITICS SAY ADMINISTRATION 
PLAN FAILS TO STRENGTHEN BORDER PATROL ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Administration's two-year, $540.5-million program to cut down illegal 
immigration while encouraging legal immigrants to become citizens drew sharp 
criticism Thursday from two senators with influence over the Justice 
Department's purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers said the effort falls short of Congress' desire to build up the 
Border Patrol along the U.S.-Mexican boundary, indicating that the entire 
effort could have trouble getting off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But immigrant advocate groups -- usually quick to condemn border crackdowns -- 
generally offered qualified support of what the Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund praised as a "balanced approach" mixing enforcement with a 
citizenship drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
subcommittee that controls Justice Department funding, and Pete V. Domenici 
(R-N.M.), ranking minority member of the panel, said that the initiative "does 
not conform with congressional direction" to hire 600 new Border Patrol agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, formally unveiled Thursday by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and 
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner, calls for 
adding 620 Border Patrol agents in the current fiscal year, but only 350 would 
be new hires. The other 270 would be agents reassigned from support duties and 
administrative work. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the Border Patrol now has about 4,100 agents, one-quarter of them 
posted in the San Diego area, the busiest crossing point for illegal entrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Reno, Hollings and Domenici said they expect the Justice 
Department to seek congressional approval before transferring agents from 
administrative tasks back to the border. Administration officials want to 
replace the desk workers with less costly contract personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and John McCain 
(R-Ariz.) joined Hollings and Domenici in a separate letter asking Reno why all 
of the $45 million already appropriated for hiring 600 new Border Patrol agents 
is being spent in San Diego and El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 "The citizens of Arizona and New Mexico are also entitled to assistance as 
Southwest border states that are constantly confronted with illegal immigration 
and drug trafficking," the five senators wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the program Thursday, Reno and Meissner said that its immediate 
focus is on the San Diego and El Paso sections of the 2,000-mile border because 
those areas account for 65% of illegal immigrant apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with bolstered enforcement, officials announced a wide-ranging, 
$30-million plan to promote naturalization of foreign nationals residing in the 
United States legally. The plan includes extensive public education and 
streamlined procedures designed to persuade immigrants to become U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates have long called on the federal government to bolster 
citizenship programs, which they say the INS has treated as a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to become citizens and participate in the democratic process," 
said Carlos Vaquerano, spokesman for the Central American Resource Center, a 
Los Angeles assistance group. 
</P>
<P>
 While supporting the citizenship initiative and the accompanying Border Patrol 
buildup, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund stressed the 
importance of improved training and supervision of agents and the creation of 
an oversight mechanism to curtail misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 In the proposal, authorities said they were revising training to emphasize 
ethics and civil rights, strengthening internal disciplinary procedures and 
creating a citizens advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers were skeptical of the plan. "We're against militarizing the 
border any more, and that's what this plan does: militarize the border," said 
Roberto Martinez, border representative for the American Friends Service 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 From another viewpoint, the Federation for American Immigration Reform 
criticized the Justice Department blueprint for not doing enough to overhaul a 
flawed immigration system. Among other steps, the group seeks tougher measures 
to crack down on illegal immigration and detect false claims of U.S. 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Other elements of the two-year effort include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing new technologies, such as lighting five miles of border east of 
San Ysidro to help detect nighttime border crossers, and automating booking and 
fingerprinting procedures to identify those who have been arrested previously. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expediting the deportations of immigrants imprisoned for crimes in 
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. The proposal calls for 
deporting such criminals immediately after they complete their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 * Upgrading the asylum process by doubling the number of INS officers and 
immigration judges handling claims. Officials hope to be keeping up with new 
asylum pleas by year's end and then attacking the backlog of 300,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stepping up enforcement of sanctions against employers who knowingly hire 
illegal immigrants by focusing on industries and employers who have a history 
of violations. 
</P>

WOMAN BLAMES PAROLE POLICY IN FATHER'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Escalating a battle over the state's handling of prison parolees, a Sacramento 
woman on Thursday blamed the murder of her father on a Wilson Administration 
policy to go easy on some ex-convicts caught violating their parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Reagan said her father would be alive today if the man now charged with 
killing him had been returned to prison rather than let go after being found in 
possession of drugs and in the company of another ex-felon six months before 
her father's death last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad's murderer should have been in prison," Reagan said at a news 
conference at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan's appearance was part of an ongoing campaign by Democrats and police 
union groups to turn the tables on Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who has spent 
most of his political career building an image as a tough crime fighter. Wilson 
will convene a two-day "crime summit" in Los Angeles on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As governor, Wilson has fended off repeated efforts by Democratic lawmakers to 
cut the growth in funding for the state prison system and has backed 
legislation -- blocked by Democrats -- to reduce the "good time" credits that 
allow prisoners to cut their sentences in half for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, a Democratic candidate for attorney 
general, said it was hypocritical for Wilson to call for stricter sentencing 
laws while also seeking to reduce the number of prisoners returned to custody 
for violating parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "They talk tough at the front door but they let them out the back door," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy under fire was adopted at the urging of a blue-ribbon commission 
appointed by former Gov. George Deukmejian to study ways to slow the growth in 
the state's soaring prison population, which has nearly tripled in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion: Stop sending ex-convicts back to prison for two months to a 
year if they commit minor violations such as using drugs, consorting with a 
known felon or failing to report on time to a parole agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a $100-million cut in proposed prison spending passed by the 
Legislature in 1992, the Administration adopted the parole policy, making one 
of its few concessions to those advocating alternatives to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 By investing $8 million in drug treatment, job placement and other counseling 
efforts designed to steer parolees straight, the Administration figured it 
could save $12 million in prison costs, officials said. Each inmate costs the 
state about $21,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of this policy and other factors, the percentage of parolees 
returned to prison dropped, from a high of 67% in 1989 to 39.2% in 1993. But 
some of those let loose have committed other crimes, and now corrections agency 
officials are scrambling to defend their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Cornwell, the man charged with killing William Reagan on a Sacramento 
street last June, had served eight years of a 16-year sentence for a string of 
armed robberies. While on parole in December, 1992, he was stopped by police 
while riding in a car driven by another man, also an ex-felon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the car police found a knife with a four-inch blade, a glass pipe used for 
smoking cocaine and a bag containing what was believed to be rock cocaine. 
Cornwell had some marijuana hidden in his shoe. The other man had a .45-caliber 
handgun in his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 Parole officers concluded that Cornwell could not be tied to the weapons or 
the cocaine. They could have returned him to prison for possessing marijuana 
and traveling with a felon. Previously, Cornwell almost certainly would have 
been sent back to prison for a few months for violating his parole. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cornwell was just the type of ex-convict that experts said should be 
helped rather than punished: He was working full time, he kept in regular 
contact with his parole officer and he seemed to be making progress in 
adjusting to life out of prison. They let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, police allege, Cornwell borrowed a gun from a friend, and, 
acting on a tip from a security guard, robbed the 68-year-old Reagan as he 
carried a satchel containing more than $9,000 to a check-cashing establishment 
run by a friend. Reagan resisted and was shot in the neck and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Brown, undersecretary of Youth and Adult Corrections, said the Wilson 
Administration believes its policy is sound even if the results can sometimes 
be tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at it with hindsight, we should have revoked him," Brown said of 
Cornwell. "But that's hindsight, and we don't get to make decisions that way." 
</P>
<P>
 In another case cited Thursday, a parolee stands charged of killing a Pasadena 
couple, Jeff Venable and Robyn Braxton. Only days before the August, 1992, 
killings, the parolee, Cedrick Singleton, was found by his parole agent to have 
violated the conditions of his release by smoking marijuana and possessing a 
knife with a five-inch blade. 
</P>
<P>
 The parole agent recommended that Singleton be returned to prison, but he was 
overruled by a supervisor, who noted that Singleton was working and was "very 
cooperative and doing an above average parole period." 
</P>
<P>
 Releasing Singleton, Brown said, was a mistake in judgment, but not one that 
can be attributed to Administration belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make errors," Brown said. "We are judging human behavior. When 
anybody makes a decision, from the policeman on the street who decides (who) to 
arrest, to the judge who sets bail, to the probation officer, there are going 
to be errors." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration was defended Thursday by one of the most persistent critics 
of the state's prison policies. Vincent Schiraldi, executive director of the 
Center for Juvenile and Criminal Justice, said Wilson was right to shift some 
funds from prisons to prevention and should do more of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an area crying out for reform," said Schiraldi, who served on the 
commission that recommended the change. "The governor should be credited with 
allowing a reform to occur and not dinged for being soft on crime."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SENATE COMMITTEE OKS SALES TAX HIKE; REVENUE: 
BILL WOULD INCREASE LEVY BY A QUARTER-CENT FOR 26 MONTHS TO HELP FUND QUAKE 
RELIEF EFFORTS. IT IS OPPOSED BY WILSON ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Over opposition from the Wilson Administration, a legislative committee 
Thursday approved fast-track legislation authored by Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown that would impose a $1.5-billion sales tax increase to help repair damage 
from the Northridge earthquake. Similar to a law enacted after the 1989 Loma 
Prieta earthquake, the new bill would add a tax of one-quarter of a cent on the 
dollar starting March 1. It would expire April 30, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee approved the proposal by a 6-1 
margin over Republican opposition, but it faces a rough road ahead without 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's support. It needs a two-thirds favorable vote of 
both the Senate and Assembly, which can occur only with GOP backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) indicated, 
however, that a compromise likely would evolve. Each said he would vote for 
virtually any plan that could win two-thirds approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Other options under discussion include submitting a major bond issue to 
voters, a gasoline tax increase for highway repairs, or possibly some 
combination of all three. Brown said he wants a sales tax because it would 
produce extra revenue immediately for reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The action represented the first significant step that the Legislature has 
taken to help finance the recovery efforts. Statewide, the sales tax currently 
varies from a low of 7.25% to a high of 8.5%, depending on local sales tax 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who is running for reelection, has refused to commit himself to a 
state earthquake recovery program because firm government estimates of the 
massive damage have not been completed and it is unknown how much emergency aid 
the federal government will provide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington on Thursday, the House approved $8.6 billion in federal 
earthquake aid for California. Funds from the Brown bill would augment the 
federal assistance and be spent on a variety of services, ranging from housing 
and transit facilities to public schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Olsen, deputy director of the state Department of Finance, reiterated 
Wilson's position to the Democratic-dominated committee Thursday. He said it 
would be premature to approve the tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown disagreed, saying the Legislature must move swiftly to get a recovery 
program ready for implementation when damage estimates are final.  
</P>
<P>
 In an indirect criticism of Wilson, he told reporters, "It makes no sense 17 
days after the quake for the state government to have done nothing except 
accept photo ops." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the cooperation in 1989 between the Legislature and GOP Gov. George 
Deukmejian in quickly enacting a sales tax increase after the Loma Prieta 
disaster in Northern California, Brown said Deukmejian "just responded as human 
beings would respond. He did not weigh the political ups or downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Wilson is probably more sensitive to the politics than George Deukmejian 
was," Brown said, noting that Deukmejian was not running for reelection at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's bill, hastily fashioned Monday from another bill that dealt with bank 
and corporation taxes, had proposed a half-cent increase in the sales tax for 
13 months. But the committee reduced it to a quarter-cent for 26 months, 
chiefly because a new poll shows the public is more favorable to a smaller 
increase that would be spread over a longer period. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Sen. Tom Campbell (R-Stanford) argued for delaying action until there 
are more definitive damage estimates and until decisions are made on whether 
certain labor-backed laws should be relaxed during the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell told Brown, "I might support the bill and I might not support the 
bill . . . I have not yet heard from the governor's office." 
</P>
<P>
 The remark infuriated Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), whose constituents 
suffered heavy losses. "To say that you are not for it, but want to be clear 
you are not against any of these measures is not a profile in the kind of 
leadership we need," Hayden scolded Campbell. "To say you want to wait for him 
into another week is to beg the question of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 All five of the committee's Democrats and an independent, Sen. Quentin Kopp of 
San Francisco, voted for the bill. Campbell abstained while Republican Sen. Rob 
Hurtt of Garden Grove voted against it. Hurtt said he favored cutting the state 
budget rather than raising the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 A hike of a quarter-cent would raise the sales tax in Los Angeles to 8 1/2 
cents on the dollar.

MEDIA; HONG KONG READERS HAVE A NEW PAPER; AS CHINESE RULE NEARS, THE 
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE EASTERN EXPRESS VOWS TO BE INDEPENDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE COURTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 As most of the media here keep a wary eye on China in the prelude to this 
British colony's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, a new English-language 
newspaper is promising editorial independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival this week of Eastern Express, Hong Kong's third English-language 
newspaper, coincides with a growing concern over the political orientation of 
the colony's newspapers and television networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriental Press Group Ltd., publisher of the colony's most widely read 
Chinese-language newspaper, announced the decision to publish the new, 
six-day-a-week paper in September after the controversial sale of the dominant, 
English-language South China Morning Post. It was sold by Rupert Murdoch, the 
conservative international media magnate, to Robert Kuok, a pro-Beijing 
business tycoon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few months, a steady flow of journalists from the Post and other 
publications in Hong Kong have defected to Eastern Express. Prompting some of 
these departures has been concern over press freedoms and job security under 
Beijing rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Hong Kong press corps have said they believe that Eastern 
Express' vow to stake out a position of "rigorous independence" is particularly 
important at a time when self-censorship is steadily creeping into the local 
media. But so far, fears that Kuok, an adviser to China on Hong Kong affairs, 
would seek to impose pro-China views have not materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Sing Tao Group, which owns the English-language newspaper the 
Standard, is considering publishing a paper in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Express Chief Editor Stephen Vines said these developments could lead 
to a less independent attitude toward China at both the Post and the Standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way to avoid political biases and self-censorship is by having the 
support of the management of the company, who are committed to the independence 
of the paper," Vines said. "Our paper will be vigorously independent . . . but 
with one prejudice shown in favor of the people of Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Express takes a unique approach by placing emphasis on analytical, 
"magazine-style" articles rather than day-to-day news stories. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an editorial in the first edition, which included goodwill 
messages from former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Eastern Express 
will give an unbiased view as papers here become more polarized in the 
Sino-British dispute over Gov. Chris Patten's proposals for democratic reform 
in Hong Kong. (China is resolutely opposed to those proposals.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Will we be pro- or anti-China? Or will we be pro- or anti-(Hong Kong) 
government? The answer is simple. We will be neither," the editorial said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts here see business reasons for introducing a new English-language 
newspaper with just 3 1/2 years to go before the colony reverts to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Post bears a label of being pro-China, then there is a vacuum for an 
independent newspaper in Hong Kong" to fill, said Kenneth Leung, journalism and 
communications chairman and lecturer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
"Newspapers are also commercial in nature . . . and advertisers look to papers 
which are influential." 
</P>
<P>
 The colony's English-language newspaper battle is well under way, and 
casualties seem unavoidable. Some analysts here say the Standard, which has a 
circulation of about 48,000, has the most to lose. The Post circulates 110,000 
copies, while Eastern Express is striving for a circulation of 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Post, one of the world's most profitable papers, earned $75 million in 
operating profit on revenue of $129 million in the year that ended last June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 BuG. Warburg Securities (Far East) Ltd. released a report in October stating 
that competition from Eastern Express "is going to result in strong cost 
pressures for SCMP (South China Morning Post Holdings), if not yet loss of 
revenue, and is particularly ill-timed for SCMP in that it is facing a decline 
in advertising revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Post nor the Standard is standing still. Both papers have 
introduced design changes and added new sections -- though they say these 
modifications were planned well in advance of the announced launch of Eastern 
Express.

ELECTIONS; VENICE AND NEIGHBORING CITY MAY END A 68-YEAR 'MARRIAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Should Beauty and the Beast patch up their differences, or will divorce roil 
the waters of the fabled Venetian lagoon? Sunday will tell, when voters in the 
delicate island of Venice and the brawny mainland city of Mestre decide whether 
to remain together as one metropolis under the same mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cities have been yoked administratively since 1926, when Venice was 
Venice and Mestre was a fledgling factory town. The tide has turned. Today, if 
Venice is soul, Mestre is strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice's population, a dwindling 100,000, is less than half that of Mestre, a 
throbbing, modern center for factories, shipyards and Italy's largest 
petrochemical plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent decades, Mestre has become a magnet for tens of thousands of young 
Venetians lured by better jobs, better housing, cars, accessible entertainment 
and neighborhoods not besieged by tourists and tourist prices. While Venice was 
busy being La Serenissima, Mestre acquired its own dynamic and etched its own 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the decisive -- and divisive -- question is whether the two partners 
would be better able to grapple with big-city problems that are at once common 
and diverse if each had its own government. Battle lines are sharply drawn, and 
polls say the election is too close to call. The votes will be counted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In context, the election is a shard of national political splintering after 
nearly half a century of rule by party barons who manipulated a corrupt, 
closely held system mortally wounded by scandal. Old ways, old rules and old 
faces are all hostages to reform that will climax in landmark national 
elections March 27-28. 
</P>
<P>
 In Venice, many concerned citizens, such as lawyer Mario D'Elia, believe that 
their museum city would be better off if it didn't have to share resources with 
blue-collar mainlanders little concerned with resisting the sea, preserving art 
and dredging canals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mestre is terra ferma; Venice is acqua ," D'Elia said in an interview. "Their 
problems are different. Venetians have a right to Venetian political leaders. 
Mestre, a forgotten city, has never been properly structured. It has the same 
right to local leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Separating Venice and Mestre has been an issue for decades, but divorce failed 
in 1979 and 1989 referendums. This time, there is more support both in Venice 
and in Mestre, where the make-or-break ballots will be cast, given the relative 
weight of the electorates.

 Some Mestrini bought a full-page newspaper advertisement this week to support 
separation as in the best interests of both communities. "Autonomy is a general 
principle of freedom and democracy which allows self-determination by 
communities with the aim of evaluating their individual characteristics," their 
ad proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Sunday's call for separation cite both political and practical 
objections. "We'd both lose, especially financially," said Venice Mayor Massimo 
Cacciari, a philosopher and stalwart of the former Italian Communist Party who 
won office in December. Cacciari denounces the referendum as an attempt by the 
dying political Establishment to divide and conquer as a means of preserving 
its power. 
</P>
<P>
 Paolo Costa, an urban economist who is rector of Venice's Ca' Foscari 
University, said separation would "be a giant step backward." He argued that a 
metropolitan government with broad decision-making powers could better protect 
both Venice's heritage and Mestre's development. People should live and work 
under the same administration, he said, noting that 40,000 workers commute 
daily from Mestre to jobs in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 The two communities share problems seen from different perspectives, Costa 
said in an interview. Both are anxious to reduce lagoon pollution, but one is a 
tourist city and the other an industrial port. Venice has the tourist 
attractions; Mestre has most of the tourist hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the temperamental differences of the two cities will be manifest. 
Amid the start of Carnival, many Venetians will be dressed in period costumes: 
Masked revelers will be allowed to vote in some precincts.

MIA KIN CITE LOSS OF LEVERAGE ON HANOI; TROOPS: THE REMAINS OF A CALIFORNIA 
AIRMAN WERE IDENTIFIED LAST MONTH. RELATIVES OF THE MISSING FEAR END OF TRADE 
EMBARGO MEANS HE MAY BE THE LAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On May 14, 1968, Navy Lt. (j.g.) Barry E. Karger, a native Californian, was 22 
years old, piloting an A-4F aircraft over North Vietnam's Quang Binh province 
when he radioed: "I'm rolling in!" 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25 years would pass before Karger's fate would be known. Last month, 
his remains -- three teeth in a fragment of his lower jaw -- were dug out of a 
river where his plane crashed after it was shot down while he was dropping 
electronic sensors along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Karger, who had been considered 
"missing in action/body not recovered" all these years, was now positively 
enrolled among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But with President Clinton's decision Thursday to lift the trade embargo 
against Vietnam, many activists and family members of the 2,238 others still 
officially missing fear that he will be the last one positively identified. 
Without the embargo as leverage, they said, Vietnam will no longer feel the 
need to cooperate with America's efforts to recover POW-MIAs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should do anything for Vietnam," Karger's sister, Sheryl 
Mossman of Medford, Ore., said Thursday. "I wouldn't walk across the street for 
Vietnam. I wouldn't send them a bag of flour. They have no regard for human 
life and, no matter what we do, it doesn't mean anything to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But in announcing his decision, Clinton pointed to several key areas in which 
progress has been made in resolving the POW-MIA issue and repeated his belief 
that the Vietnamese will continue to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that since last July, the remains of 39 American servicemen have been 
recovered and sent home. He said the number of "discrepancy cases" -- where it 
is possible servicemen could have survived -- has also been reduced since July, 
from 135 to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said Vietnam and Laos had grown more helpful in conducting 
searches along their common border and continued to release documents that 
could help answer many of the lingering questions about missing Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Military personnel working with the Hanoi government have also said that they 
expect Hanoi to continue working closely with American officials to open up 
more crash sites and to make more records available. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have discounted allegations by some activists that POWs are still 
living in Vietnam who will be killed now that they no longer serve as 
bargaining chips for improved business relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese," said Lt. Col. David Fredrikson, a spokesman for the Joint 
Task Force Full Accounting office in Honolulu, "already give us pretty much all 
that we ask for." The task force was established to investigate cases of 
missing servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrikson just returned from a December trip to Vietnam, where U.S. military 
officials worked with the Hanoi government digging up sites that might hold 
American remains. "The Vietnamese say they consider this a humanitarian issue, 
whether there's an embargo lifted or not," Fredrikson said. "They say they want 
to help American families find answers to their questions." 
</P>
<P>
 To dramatize that point, he said, Vietnamese officials allowed U.S. field 
teams to dig through a civilian graveyard in search of American remains. He 
said that family members of Vietnamese interred there even allowed the American 
teams to dig up Vietnamese graves. 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence of Americans was found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fredrikson did not discount the possibility that Vietnam's cooperation may 
have been linked to hopes that the embargo would be lifted. "There is so much 
economic need in that country for some of the things the Western world can 
provide that it obviously is on everyone's mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years since the Joint Task Force Full Accounting office was 
established, the remains of 29 individuals have been identified. But with new 
technological advances, officials said they hope more identifications can be 
made from remains now at the military laboratory in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 They also noted that Vietnam has approved more excavations and that U.S. 
investigative teams are scheduled to travel there this month. "These are air 
crash and battle sites," he said. "There will be a lot of digging." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the year, he said, the task force expects to run out of crash sites to 
explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrikson and other task force members acknowledged that it will be 
impossible ever to identify all the missing, particularly fliers lost over the 
ocean. And he said that all reports of live POWs are investigated but that so 
far, all have proven to be false. "There has not been anything to lead us to 
believe there is a live (missing serviceman) there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon also determined last month that a new Russian document claiming 
that Vietnam held 1,205 American prisoners in 1972 -- more than twice as many 
as were released a year later -- was full of "inaccuracies, inconsistencies, 
exaggerations and fabrications." 
</P>
<P>
 But ex-Green Beret J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam 
Veterans Coalition in Washington, said Thursday that his group believes up to 
200 Americans may still be captive in Vietnam and Laos. He said U.S. visitors 
to Vietnam, as well as Vietnamese, have reported seeing Americans in prison and 
labor camps -- even in caves north of Hanoi. Without the embargo, he suggested, 
their lives will be endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a few of these people suddenly now stumble out of there, the Vietnamese 
will be seen as liars and world opinion will flare up against them, and any new 
American business they're trying to get will dry up," Burch said. "I'm sure 
there are people who will want to kill them rather than take a chance that they 
might eventually surface."

 As many as 500,000 workers staged a 24-hour strike Thursday, with some 
blocking roads and burning tires, to protest a government increase in fuel 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Workers Front claimed that half a million members, mostly public 
sector teachers, university professors and doctors, heeded the call for the 
daylong strike, but that figure could not be confirmed.

<P>
 Key events in the history of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam (1954-1975) 
and highlights of America's postwar involvement (1975-1994): 1954-1975 
</P>
<P>
 * 1954: After the defeat of French Expeditionary Forces at Dien Bien Phu, 
France recognizes independence of Vietnam. It agrees to withdraw military 
forces immediately from the area that became North Vietnam, and by 1956 from 
South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1956: With support of the United States, Ngo Dinh Diem is installed in 
Saigon as president of an independent Republic of Vietnam, setting up the rival 
claims to legitimacy that led to the Vietnamese civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1961: President John F. Kennedy decides to ignore the limits on foreign 
military advisers imposed by Geneva Accords of 1954, and begins buildup of 
American forces in South Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1964: Armed with Tonkin Gulf resolution, which gave him a free hand to 
protect U.S. forces, President Lyndon B. Johnson launches first strikes of the 
air war against North Vietnam, and imposes an embargo on Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1965: U.S. sends first organized combat units to Vietnam, beginning with 
U.S. Marines landing in Central Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1968: Viet Cong launch Tet offensive, attacking more than 100 cities in the 
south, and undermining Gen. William C. Westmoreland's claims that Communists 
had been put on the defensive. President Johnson decides not to seek 
reelection; Richard M. Nixon is elected after claiming he had a "secret plan" 
to end the war. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1969: Peace negotiators, representing the United States and three Vietnamese 
factions, open Paris peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1970: Domestic opposition to the war crests, partly in reaction to National 
Guardsmen shooting to death four students at Kent State University during an 
anti-war protest demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1973: United States signs peace agreement, which calls for withdrawal of 
U.S. military from the South, and the release of prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1975: Vietnamese Communist forces capture Saigon and the remainder of the 
country, triggering an exodus of South Vietnamese refugees, who continued 
fleeing the country for years. 1975-1994 
</P>
<P>
 * 1975: First wave of Vietnamese refugees begin arriving in the United States, 
the first planeloads going to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The second wave, 
the so-called boat people, who continued to flee the Communists by every means 
imaginable, began arriving in the United States the next year. The largest 
single Vietnamese community takes root in Orange County, and an area of 
Westminster becomes known as Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1977: Washington begins normalization talks with Hanoi, but breaks them off 
when Vietnam invades neighboring Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1988: Vietnam begins cooperating with the United States to help determine 
the fate of more than 2,000 U.S. troops still missing and unaccounted for at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1989: Vietnam completes its withdrawal from Cambodia, fulfilling a condition 
for improved relations with the United States and some European nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990: In a sign of further relaxation, Vietnam's foreign minister Nguyen Co 
Thach makes an unprecedented visit to Washington, pledges to do everything 
possible to resolve the issue of MIAs in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991: Hanoi and Washington agree to opening of a U.S. government office in 
Hanoi to settle issue of missing American troops. By December, Washington lifts 
ban on organized U.S. travel to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992: President Bush allows U.S. companies to open offices in Vietnam to 
position themselves for lifting of the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: President Clinton announces that United States would no longer block 
an International Monetary Fund loan package to Vietnam. He eases sanctions to 
allow U.S. firms to participate in international development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * January, 1994: Senate passes non-binding resolution calling on Clinton to 
lift the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 3, 1994: Clinton lifts trade embargo.

TALKS WITH SYRIA BACK ON TRACK, ISRAEL OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a 15-month deep freeze, Israeli and Syrian peace negotiators have 
regained some lost momentum during their latest two-week round of peace talks, 
which ended Thursday, Israeli Ambassador Itamar Rabinovitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 He likened the new attitude to the one that produced the only significant 
progress the two sides have made -- an October, 1992, agreement on four of five 
articles of a draft peace pact. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a senior Israeli official said there were no breakthroughs on the key 
issues of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights and the nature of 
peace between the two bitter antagonists. The official said that higher-level 
talks, perhaps between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Syrian 
President Hafez Assad, will be required to break the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States suggested a 
two-week recess so the delegations can confer with their governments. He said 
the talks will resume Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the Washington talks is entirely on the Israel-Syria track 
because Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are engaged in 
higher-level meetings elsewhere.

PERRY IS SWORN IN AS DEFENSE SECRETARY; MILITARY: ASPIN'S DEPUTY TAKES OATH 
SAME DAY SENATE VOTES, 97 TO 0, TO BACK NOMINATION. CONFIRMATION CAPS ALMOST 
TWO-MONTH SEARCH FOR A REPLACEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 William J. Perry was sworn in Thursday as President Clinton's new secretary of 
defense, ending a 7 1/2-weeklong effort by the Administration to replace 
departing Secretary Les Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old former Stanford University engineering professor took the oath 
of office in a private ceremony at the Pentagon after the Senate voted, 97 to 
0, to confirm his nomination. Earlier, the Senate Armed Services Committee had 
endorsed the appointment unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote Thursday followed a 3 1/2-hour hearing before the Armed Services 
panel on Wednesday during which Perry, who has served as Aspin's deputy for 11 
months, won unabashed plaudits from senators for his stand on national security 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The new defense chief faces a spate of challenges and problems in guiding the 
military Establishment through its post-Cold War cutbacks. One of his first 
assignments will be to present the Administration's new defense budget to 
Congress next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The confirmation was rushed through at the request of the Administration, in 
part, so Perry could attend an international conference of defense ministers in 
Munich this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is expected to leave late today and return to Washington Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-technology expert who has become known as the godfather of the 
radar-evading Stealth bomber, Perry has spent the bulk of his career in the 
defense industry, as a consultant on super-secret weapons projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is expected to move easily into broader defense issues, from ensuring 
military preparedness to developing a national strategy for U.S. intervention 
in situations such as those in Somalia and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton initially nominated retired Navy Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, a Texas 
businessman, to replace Aspin, who resigned under White House pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was embarrassed politically when the admiral backed out of the 
nomination, saying that he did not want to face criticism from Congress and the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of consultations, the White House eventually asked Perry to take 
the job, and announced his nomination formally on Jan. 24. Perry served in the 
Pentagon during the late 1970s as undersecretary of defense for research and 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to go along with policies hammered out by Aspin on such issues 
as the size of the armed forces, homosexuals in the military and women in 
combat and to leave most key staff positions virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 But colleagues said that they expect him to be more decisive and articulate 
than his predecessor and better at managing the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 They also predicted that he will abandon Aspin's efforts to thrust the Defense 
Department into the heart of the Administration's foreign policy-making 
apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin, who had agreed to remain in the post until his successor was sworn in, 
had come under criticism from opponents of the Administration's policies, and 
took the blame for a failed U.S. raid in Somalia on Oct. 3 that resulted in the 
deaths of 18 servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin earlier had refused a request to send more tanks to support U.S. troops 
in the troubled African nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 55-year-old former Wisconsin congressman has been praised in recent 
days for having shepherded the Pentagon through such controversies as the 
gays-in-the-military issue and for initiating the "bottom-up review," a 
sweeping overhaul of basic defense policy.

GEORGIA EXPLOSIONS KILL 2 AS YELTSIN VISITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Two explosions ripped through an apartment in this tense capital Thursday, 
killing two people and injuring the Georgian defense minister, while less than 
a mile away the Russian and Georgian presidents signed agreements to allow 
Russian military bases and troops in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 A Georgian spokesman blamed the bombings on terrorists opposed to closer 
military links with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no evidence that the assassination was linked to President Boris 
N. Yeltsin's first state visit to the former Soviet republic, and the one-day 
summit proceeded as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia's deputy defense minister, Col. Nikolas Kekelidze, was in bed in his 
downtown apartment when a powerful, remote-controlled bomb exploded at 4 a.m., 
killing him and a woman who was identified by friends as his mistress. The 
blasts also damaged nearby buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin arrived in Tbilisi at 10 a.m. under unprecedented security. About 200 
dilapidated buses were used to block roads into the city, and hundreds of 
Georgian police officers lined the streets along which Yeltsin's motorcade 
traveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's security staff had already insisted that the Russian president not 
spend a night in Tbilisi, where they said his safety could not be guaranteed, 
Russian and Georgian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second bomb went off in Kekelidze's apartment at 1 p.m., as Yeltsin and 
Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze were signing 26 different agreements on 
military and economic cooperation in a government building not far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgian Defense Minister Georgy Karkarashvili, who had come to inspect the 
considerable damage done by the first explosion, suffered a slight concussion 
from the second blast. Apparently the apartment had been booby-trapped; a 
grenade was set to detonate when investigators opened the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Karkarashvili offered his resignation earlier this week in protest of the 
closer ties to Russia, but Shevardnadze had not accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources suggested that pro-Russian forces carried out the bombings, but 
there was also speculation that the motive instead stemmed from Kekelidze's 
business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 A Georgian Defense Ministry statement said the bombings were "very well 
planned and professionally executed" and represented "one more link in a chain 
of terrorist murders, none of which have been solved." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the demise of the Soviet Union, no former republic has had a stormier 
relationship with Moscow than Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia has fought three civil wars since 1991 -- and blames elements in the 
Russian defense Establishment for giving separatists arms, intelligence and 
volunteers. Last spring, Shevardnadze declared that Georgia was "effectively at 
war with Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of how fast things have changed, on Thursday, President Yeltsin 
became the most feted guest in Georgia since independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Shevardnadze called the Russian-Georgian friendship treaty "one of the major 
events in 200 years of history between our two peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 A protocol signed by the two leaders will allow for three Russian bases to be 
set up in Georgia: in Tbilisi, in Batumi on the Turkish border and in 
Akalkalakhi, near the Armenian border. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements also permit the deployment of Russian border guards on the 
frontiers of the former Soviet republic, envision Russian arms sales to Georgia 
and pledge Russian help in setting up a Georgian national army. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some protesters bitterly attacked what they saw as a Georgian sellout 
to a resurgent, imperialist Russia, Shevardnadze emphasized how much bad ties 
with Moscow had weakened his country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The temporary coolness in our relations was a serious mistake which must be 
corrected," Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>

Efron from Moscow.

UKRAINE LAWMAKERS OK NUCLEAR ARMS CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parliament gave tacit approval Thursday for this country to begin scrapping 
200 of its more than 1,500 nuclear warheads as part of a deal struck last month 
in Moscow. But lawmakers refused to declare Ukraine a non-nuclear state, as the 
United States, Russia and their own president have demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the resolution on nuclear arms, passed by 260 of the 296 Ukrainian 
lawmakers Thursday, was so vaguely crafted and hinged on such legal 
technicalities that many deputies could not say what its effect will be. "I 
have no idea what we voted for," complained legislator Ihor Dercacz. 
</P>
<P>
 A top government official said President Leonid Kravchuk will interpret the 
measure as a green light to begin transferring the first 200 weapons to Russia 
in return for fuel for Ukrainian nuclear power plants. "We are going ahead" 
with disarmament, the official said. "I can't see anything that can get in the 
way now." 
</P>
<P>
 During President Clinton's visit to Moscow in January, Clinton, Kravchuk and 
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin signed an agreement committing Ukraine to 
giving up its nuclear weapons in seven years in exchange for American economic 
aid, security guarantees and nuclear fuel. But the conservative Parliament has, 
so far, proven ambivalent about whether giving up the world's third-largest 
nuclear arsenal will leave Ukraine defenseless against possible Russian 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, Parliament approved the START I disarmament treaty in principle 
but said it applied to fewer than half of the 176 nuclear-tipped strategic 
missiles on Ukrainian soil. Lawmakers then added tough conditions that made 
their approval meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk and his government told Parliament on Thursday that the deal struck 
in Moscow satisfies most of those conditions -- and that Ukraine will become a 
pariah nation if it refuses to sign. "To be left by oneself in the 
international community, even if you think you are right, is a losing game," 
Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko said.

HUGE, ANCIENT PORT CITY UNCOVERED IN MEXICO; ARCHEOLOGY: DATING FROM THE 
DECLINE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, IT FLOURISHED FOR 500 YEARS ON VERACRUZ STATE'S 
COAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The remains of a huge, ancient port city believed to have flourished for 500 
years during the decline of the Roman Empire have been discovered on Mexico's 
Gulf Coast, the National Geographic Society announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 150 earthen pyramids and other buildings, the biggest 100 feet 
high, the port seems to have been North America's largest coastal city 1,500 
years ago. The site, in the state of Veracruz, has been named El Pital for a 
nearby town. 
</P>
<P>
 Although digging has not begun at the site, an examination of the surface has 
already yielded artifacts and information that establish the city's importance 
as a multiethnic political, commercial and agricultural center from AD 100 to 
600. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pital could provide important clues to gaps in ancient Mexican history in 
areas bordering the seats of the Mayan and Aztec empires, said American 
archeologist S. Jeffrey K. Wilkerson of the Institute for Cultural Ecology of 
the Tropics in Tampa, Fla. He is directing the exploration, which is partly 
funded by National Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pital residents probably traded with their contemporaries at Teotihuacan, 
site of the famous pyramids north of the capital that were built by a 
civilization that predated the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is likely to have been an early rival of El Tajin, a later city 40 
miles away that until now was the biggest archeological site in northern 
Veracruz. El Pital appears to have been larger than El Tajin, controlling an 
area that included more than 40 square miles of suburbs and farmland and 
probably influencing an area several times that large. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery could also have significant ecological implications because the 
ancient civilization seems to have supported more than 20,000 people -- similar 
to the population of the area today -- using farming techniques less harmful to 
the environment than the intensive chemical agriculture now practiced there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (population) density we're seeing far exceeds anything that preceded it 
in this area and even those that follow until the end of the 20th Century," 
Wilkerson said. "Something special was going on technologically that allowed 
that to happen and that has not occurred in the intervening 1,500 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The fields around El Pital were made highly productive by some of the largest 
earth-moving projects of their time. Canals were dug to drain wetlands or to 
channel fresh water into rich estuaries that brackish water would otherwise 
have left infertile. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also appear to have constructed an artificial island to guard the 
two slow-moving rivers that provided access to their city from the Gulf of 
Mexico. One of those rivers is the Nautla, Mexico's 26th-largest river, notable 
because it floods every year, like the ancient Nile, leaving farmers a layer of 
rich silt. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's demise may have been connected to a megacycle of El Nino, a 
climatic phenomenon that resulted in six months a year of the cold, windy rains 
known as nortes , Wilkerson theorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cocoa farmers still lived in the region at the time of the Spanish 
conquest, but disease had mainly wiped them out by the end of the 16th Century. 
The jungle reclaimed the area until plantation owners cleared it again in the 
1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's farmers rely on chemicals to fertilize plantations in what is now one 
of Mexico's most important banana and citrus regions. Those chemicals have 
stained ancient ceramic fragments -- whose varied patterns led scientists to 
believe that the area was multiethnic -- and even obsidian, an extremely dense 
volcanic material seldom penetrated, Wilkerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides everyday ceramics, archeologists have found a mask that resembles the 
image of the ancient rain god Tlaloc and a four-inch clay head believed to 
depict a sacrificed ballgame player. Residents of El Pital seem to have been 
major fans of ballgames: Eight courts have already been identified in the area. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extensive site with huge monuments for that period," said Enrique 
Nalda, technical secretary of Mexico's National Institute of Archeology and 
History, which granted Wilkerson a permit to explore the El Pital area. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Wilkerson discovered El Pital because the institute nearly two 
years ago refused to allow him to continue working in an area farther upriver, 
where he has carried out investigations over the last three decades.

BLM DIRECTOR STEPS DOWN AFTER DISPUTES WITH WESTERN OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Baca, the Clinton Administration's embattled Bureau of Land Management 
director, resigned under pressure Thursday after angering a host of Western 
legislators and governors with his efforts to reform the management of public 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca's departure is the first sign of open dissension between the 
Administration and environmentalists over how aggressively to press for change 
in the use of public lands by miners, ranchers and the timber industry. It came 
after three governors -- Colorado's Roy Romer, Wyoming's Mike Sullivan and 
Idaho's Cecil D. Andrus -- sought Baca's removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt made clear that Baca, a favorite of 
environmentalists for his views on land reform, has been too confrontational. 
But Babbitt vowed that Baca's resignation would not blunt the Administration's 
drive for land-use reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim and I have different approaches to management style and consensus 
building," Babbitt said Thursday. "The management styles of the department's 
bureau directors need to mesh. They need to work with me." 
</P>
<P>
 One Administration official said Baca had an "in-your-face" style that made 
him a "lightning rod" for controversy and distracted from Babbitt's efforts to 
gain cooperation from traditional opponents to land-use reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11,800-person Bureau of Land Management -- part of the Department of the 
Interior -- oversees 270 million acres of public lands located primarily in 
Western states and supervises mineral leasing and mining on an additional 300 
million acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca's forced resignation stunned and angered environmentalists and drew sharp 
words from some of the Administration's most ardent environmental allies on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) said Baca "had the unenviable job of dragging 
a lot of privileged, pampered and powerful interests kicking and screaming into 
the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller added that the Administration "carries a very heavy burden" to 
demonstrate it is not backing away from an ambitious agenda of reform just 
because it has met resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is a dreadful mistake," said Deborah Seas of the Sierra Club. 
"It's going to send a chilling message to every political appointee. It says if 
you make waves, your head is going to roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had wrangled with Baca welcomed his departure. Sen. Conrad Burns 
(R-Mont.), who has clashed with the Administration over grazing reform, said 
Baca "seemed to be out of step with Western values and that has been a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Baca may be replaced by Ken Salazar, who resigned Thursday from 
his post as director of Colorado's Department of Natural Resources.  
</P>
<P>
 Political appointees at the Interior Department, who are overwhelmingly drawn 
from the ranks of environmental activists, were described as "stunned and 
stony-faced" in a meeting with Babbitt on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca had been offered another job in the Interior Department -- deputy 
assistant secretary for land management and minerals -- but declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Administration, Baca had been state land commissioner in 
New Mexico and was co-chairman of the President Clinton's 1992 campaign in that 
state.

FARRAKHAN SUSPENDS AIDE OVER BIGOTED REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chastened by expressions of disapproval from the Congressional Black Caucus 
and the U.S. Senate, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan suspended a top 
aide Thursday for making what he called "repugnant" and "mean-spirited" remarks 
about Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 But the controversial black leader modified his rebuke of Khalid Abdul 
Muhammad by insisting: "I stand by the truths that he spoke." He then accused 
the Jewish Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Vice President Al Gore -- 
both of whom had criticized Muhammad's remarks -- of being anti-black. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's announcement at a press conference came a day after the Senate 
condemned the remarks in a unanimous resolution and the caucus publicly backed 
away from a "sacred covenant" of cooperation that it only recently had entered 
with the Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's move climaxed weeks of controversy that began on Nov. 29 during a 
speech at Kean College of New Jersey, when Muhammad referred to Jews as 
"bloodsuckers of the black nation." He said that they control government, the 
news media and other black activists. He also heaped insults on other persons 
and groups, including Pope John Paul II, whom he called "a cracker," and 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League called attention to the comments and condemned 
Farrakhan in a full-page newspaper ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan explained his action against Muhammad by saying: "In that instance, 
he was not representing us. He was representing himself. I found the speech . . 
. repugnant, malicious, mean-spirited and spoken in mockery of individuals and 
people, which is against the spirit of Islam." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "While I stand by the truths that he spoke, I must condemn in the 
strongest terms the manner in which those truths were represented." 
</P>
<P>
 The black Muslim activist said that he had relieved Muhammad of his duties 
"until he demonstrates that he is willing to conform to the manner of 
representing Allah and the honorable Elijah Muhammad (founder of the Nation of 
Islam)." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan said that he remains convinced, however, that the Anti-Defamation 
League is prejudiced against blacks and is trying to destroy him and his Nation 
of Islam by publicizing the speech. He called the Jewish organization 
"self-centered, bigoted and malicious," adding that Gore is conspiring with it 
against black people as part of "racism at the highest levels of government."  
</P>
<P>
 Gore had criticized Muhammad's remarks as "the vilest kind of racism," telling 
the United Jewish Appeal that "America is a tolerant country but we should not 
tolerate hatred and racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Foxman, head of the Anti-Defamation League, Thursday rejected any 
characterization of his group as anti-black. He said that Farrakhan's comments 
about the organization are an example of "double-think and hate." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), chairman of the black caucus, 
labeled Muhammad's remarks "evil and vicious" and said "nowhere in American 
life can we give sanctuary to such garbage." BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation of Islam is a splinter group based in New York that grew out of the 
1960s movement given prominence by the late Malcolm X. It traces its roots to 
the black pride and black nationalism that swept Africa after World War II.

FEMA DISCONTINUES UNREQUESTED QUAKE CHECKS; DISASTER: IN AN EFFORT TO GET AID 
TO VICTIMS QUICKLY, EMERGENCY FUNDS WENT TO ALL RESIDENTS IN CERTAIN ZIP CODES 
-- EVEN SOME WHO DID NOT WANT HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said Thursday that they are 
discontinuing the expedited delivery of disaster assistance that resulted in 
the mailing of hundreds of checks to people who did not ask for emergency 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster housing checks for up to $3,450 each were issued to residents based 
on ZIP codes in areas hit hard by the Northridge earthquake, even though some 
of the check recipients were still living in their homes and did not need 
emergency housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem stemmed from an effort to get aid to victims as quickly as 
possible and from the tremendous backlog of applications, which hampered normal 
verification procedures, said Morrie Goodman, FEMA's director of public 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA usually requires inspection of applicants' homes to determine the extent 
of damage and eligibility for aid programs. But in this case there were not 
enough inspectors to go around and checks for needy victims could have been 
delayed for weeks, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, as an agency, it was better to send the checks than to wait until we 
had inspectors out there," he said. The agency has increased its ranks of 
inspectors to about 800 and hopes to have 1,500 in the field by next week, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope shortly that we will be able to match demand with the numbers of 
inspectors," Goodman said. "We will be concentrating more on specific needs as 
inspectors go out to homes and will be downplaying the use of ZIP codes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, FEMA invited those who received disaster housing checks in error to 
return them. Officials also emphasized that everyone who received a check will 
be asked to account for the money and can expect a visit from a government 
inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman said confusion among some quake victims who received unanticipated 
checks may stem from the registration process. When victims call FEMA's 
registration hot line, he said, they automatically apply for the entire range 
of FEMA assistance programs, regardless of whetherthey request a specific form 
of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goodman also encouraged quake victims to use the money for any 
FEMA-administered program, including home repairs, motel or hotel rooms, if 
victims have been displaced; longer-term relocation; replacement of damaged 
items and crisis counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims who received emergency housing checks and think they are not 
entitled to them may return them to: FEMA, Disaster Temporary Housing Branch, 
P.O. Box 8020, Redwood City, Calif. 94063.

S&L FUNDS USED FOR CLINTONS, PROBERS SAY; INVESTIGATION: $7,300 IN DEPOSITS WAS 
DIVERTED TO MAKE A PAYMENT ON A BANK LOAN TIED TO THE WHITEWATER REAL ESTATE 
VENTURE, GOP STAFFERS SAY.

 Federally insured deposits were diverted from Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan 
of Little Rock, Ark., in 1985 to make a $7,300 payment on a personal bank loan 
owed by then-Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife as part of their investment in the 
Whitewater real estate development, congressional investigators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 James B. McDougal, owner of the thrift and the Clintons' business partner in 
the Whitewater venture, used the Madison funds to make the payment on a loan 
that Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton had obtained to build a model home on the 
site of the development, Republican staff investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 If corroborated by the federal inquiry into the Whitewater deal, the payment 
would be evidence that federally insured funds were used to subsidize the 
Clintons' controversial, ill-fated real estate venture with McDougal and his 
former wife, Susan. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7,300 payment was not a formal loan to the Clintons, the investigators 
said, but rather an informal payment that helped them at a time when the 
Whitewater development was experiencing difficulties. The development 
eventually failed and Madison was later closed by federal regulators in a 
bailout that cost the U.S. Treasury more than $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons, who became business partners with the McDougals in 1978, have 
said they were purely passive investors in Whitewater and were unaware of any 
improper or illegal actions by McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, 
however, are pressing for a full public accounting of what they believe was a 
cozy business relationship between the then-governor and McDougal that may have 
permitted Madison to operate without strict state regulatory oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clear evidence of a small amount of fire amidst the smoke," said Rep. 
Jim Leach (R-Iowa), ranking Republican on the committee, whose staff uncovered 
the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the above circumstances," said a memo written to Leach by his staff, 
"it would appear that federally insured deposits, which with the later failure 
of Madison became in effect taxpayer obligations, were transferred for the 
direct personal benefit of the former governor." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons and Whitewater took a tax deduction for interest paid on the 
loan. White House aides have said it was an accidental double deduction. 
However, the new information may raise the question of whether the Clintons 
also failed to report the payment on their tax return as personal income. 
</P>
<P>
 As the memo to Leach noted: "What remains unclear is the larger question of 
whether the funds provided by Madison to reduce the Clintons' liability were 
proper or properly reported as income for income tax purposes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If Madison provided any direct or indirect assistance to Whitewater, 
presumably half the value of such (assistance) would redound to the advantage 
of each of the half-owners. In any regard, the above money transfer underscores 
that then-Gov. Clinton had personal liabilities reduced by a payment from 
Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such payment presumably carries ethical as well as tax implications and is 
part and parcel of the $47-million to $60-million estimated taxpayer loss at 
Madison." 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal, who became a friend of Clinton in the late 1960s, when both men 
worked for Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.), was removed from control of 
Madison in 1986 after federal regulators concluded that he had followed unsound 
practices. He was later tried and acquitted on charges of bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found that McDougal sent a check for $7,322.64 to Security Bank 
of Paragould, Ark., on Nov. 8, 1985, to cover a payment due on a $20,800 loan 
that the Clintons had taken out earlier to satisfy the balance on another loan 
from an institution owned by McDougal, Madison Bank & Trust of Kingston, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Bank was owned by a Clinton-appointed state banking commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The check written by McDougal was drawn on a Whitewater account, even though 
the account did not have sufficient funds at the time to cover it, 
investigators said. McDougal later deposited a $7,500 check into the Whitewater 
account that was drawn on Madison Marketing, a subsidiary of the savings and 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1986 federal Home Loan Bank Board examination, Madison 
Marketing was virtually a sham entity used to divert money from the savings and 
loan to insiders, particularly Susan McDougal.

HILLARY CLINTON, HIRED BY U.S., SETTLED LAWSUIT AGAINST FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton represented federal regulators in a savings and loan 
case against a family friend and political supporter, eventually settling a 
$3.3-million complaint for $200,000, a federal official confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is trying to determine whether Mrs. 
Clinton, or her employer, the Rose Law Firm, submitted to the government the 
required notification of a potential conflict of interest, FDIC spokesman David 
Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant, Dan Lasater, had personal and political ties to President 
Clinton that have been widely reported. The discovery that Mrs. Clinton settled 
the government's lawsuit against Lasater in 1987 was first reported in Thursday 
editions of the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 Law and accounting firms generally are barred from representing the government 
in S&L cases if they have represented the thrift, or have personal ties to any 
officials or targets of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 They are required to notify the federal agency -- in Mrs. Clinton's case the 
now-defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corp. -- of any conflicts before 
getting such contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Caputo, the First Lady's press secretary, said she did not know whether 
Mrs. Clinton had supplied FSLIC officials with the required notification. But 
she defended Mrs. Clinton's legal work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our view is that Mrs. Clinton, while she was a lawyer at the Rose firm, acted 
with the utmost integrity and professionalism," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FSLIC, for which Mrs. Clinton settled the suit, was dissolved in 1989 
during a reorganization of banking agencies. Its records were turned over to 
the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasater, who ran a bond trading firm, signed deals with several thrifts, 
including First American Savings & Loan in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, to 
trade Treasury bond futures. First American hired the Rose firm to sue 
Lasater's bond firm for fraud, Barr said. First American was later seized by 
federal regulators, who pursued the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose firm assigned the Lasater case to Mrs. Clinton and Vincent Foster, 
the White House lawyer who committed suicide in July, the Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton and Foster negotiated the confidential settlement, the report 
said.

RENO OKS FASTER ACCESS TO DEATH REPORT ON FOSTER; INFORMATION: RULING COVERS 
ANY RECORDS TIED TO GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY OR HIGH NEWS INTEREST. BUT THE RECORDS 
ON THE LAWYER'S SUICIDE REMAIN UNRELEASED. 
</P>

<P>
 Criticized for withholding documents about a White House lawyer's suicide, 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno authorized expedited release Thursday of records that 
bear on the government's integrity and have high news interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Park Police and FBI reports on attorney Vincent Foster's death still 
were not released, and Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern said he had no 
way to predict when they would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Before any release, Stern said, special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. must 
review the records to be certain that their release will not hinder his 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 At President Clinton's request, Reno appointed Fiske last week to look into 
all matters related to Clinton's investment in a failed Arkansas land 
development, its links to a failed Arkansas savings and loan and any related 
matters, including Foster's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents related to the Whitewater land development were found in Foster's 
office after his death July 20. The FBI investigated the belated discovery and 
handling of a torn-up note by Foster critical of the FBI and other Washington 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster was found shot to death in a suburban park, and the Park Police ruled 
it a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times reported in today's editions that federal law enforcement 
officials who have seen the U.S. Park Police report said it suggests that 
Bernard Nussbaum, counsel to the President, impeded the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials, who were not identified, told the newspaper that the report 
shows Nussbaum interfered with interviews by directing that White House lawyers 
sit in on them -- a charge that has been reported previously. Nussbaum has said 
the Park Police never objected to any of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wall Street Journal filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York 
last week to get the Foster documents, arguing that the Justice Department had 
"constructively and improperly denied" their release. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno ordered a new category of records eligible for expedited release under 
the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 FOIA requests for FBI documents routinely take up to two years to be 
processed; requests for Justice Department documents have a six-month backlog. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests would be moved to the top of the list for processing if the Justice 
Department's public affairs director concluded that there was "exceptional 
media interest" and the records involve "questions about the government's 
integrity which affect public confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is "to permit the public to make a prompt and informed assessment of 
the propriety of the government's actions in exceptional cases," Reno's 
implementing directive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said that Reno's policy applies immediately to all Justice agencies and 
that she would use her authority to recommend that all agencies of the 
executive branch adopt similar policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, expedited release was available only for documents needed to 
prevent physical harm or to avoid a loss of rights, such as missing a deadline 
to file a damage claim. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Reno also disputed fired FBI Director William S. 
Sessions' assertion that a power struggle kept the bureau out of investigating 
Foster's death. Sessions was fired by Clinton the day before the death.

PANEL REOPENS GAYS-IN-MILITARY HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Republicans forced a new round of hearings on the gays-in-the-military 
controversy Thursday, prompting the Pentagon to delay publishing long-awaited 
final regulations on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hours before the new regulations were to have been made public, the 
Senate Armed Services Committee announced that, at the insistence of its GOP 
members, it would conduct further hearings. It said that the sessions could 
start as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, the Defense Department said that the regulations, which 
had been scheduled to be distributed today, would be delayed indefinitely -- 
ostensibly because of the heavy volume of paperwork involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials on both sides said that the delay was prompted by eleventh-hour 
objections by Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), one of the Senate's most vocal opponents 
of allowing homosexuals to serve in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides insisting on new hearings, Coats has demanded changes in the wording 
of some of the regulations. Congressional insiders said that the alterations 
are not major, but the Pentagon has opposed them as unnecessary. The two sides 
have been negotiating for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear how long the latest dispute would delay 
publication of the new regulations. Pentagon officials said that they expect a 
holdup of only a couple of weeks, but some analysts warned that it could be 
longer if tempers flare. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the acquiescence of the Armed Services Committee Thursday, there were 
indications that the panel's leadership was embarrassed over Coats' move. 
Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) had been working closely with the Defense Department 
and had endorsed the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, GOP strategists said that the push for new hearings had only 
lukewarm backing from the panel's Republicans. Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), 
the committee's ranking minority leader, publicly supported Coats' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the new policies that Clinton has ordered -- dubbed "Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell, Don't Pursue," after the changes that they would make, would result 
in only modest differences from restrictions on homosexuals currently enforced 
in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Les Aspin's successor as defense secretary, William J. Perry, 
provided Nunn's committee with detailed answers to legal questions about the 
new regulations but apparently failed to persuade Coats, at least, that the 
wording in the rules is sound. BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The series of new regulations essentially continue the longstanding ban on 
homosexual activity in the military, but prohibit "witch hunts" against 
suspected gays and mandate more humane handling of such cases than has been the 
practice in the past. The Pentagon made public the broad outlines of the new 
regulations on Dec. 22. They were drafted by former Defense Secretary Les 
Aspin. The regulations were designed in part to follow legislation Congress 
passed last year setting down restrictions on service by homosexuals. President 
Clinton initially had sought to lift any ban on gays in the military but ran 
into heated opposition on Capitol Hill.

ODD COUPLE BEHIND HEALTH PLAN THAT RIVALS CLINTON'S; CONGRESS: REPS. JIM COOPER 
AND FRED GRANDY ARE IN DIFFERENT PARTIES. BOTH BACK A PROPOSAL WITHOUT STRICT 
COST CONTROLS OR EMPLOYER MANDATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They would seem an unlikely pair to have emerged, for the moment at least, as 
the chief threat to President Clinton's health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a relatively junior -- and largely unknown -- Tennessee Democrat who 
aspires to the Senate seat once held by Vice President Al Gore. The other, 
though rapidly becoming an accomplished legislator, is best known to the nation 
as a character in a television sitcom who bumbled around the deck of a cruise 
ship in short pants and knee socks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) are the driving force 
behind a health plan that is now the only one in Congress commanding 
significant support on both sides of the aisle. And with the endorsement of 
their approach by the Business Round table and a tacit embrace by the nation's 
governors, Cooper and Grandy have left the backers of Clinton's plan scrambling 
to regain their momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 How long Cooper and Grandy will stay out in front remains to be seen. To a 
significant degree, their present support comes from groups more interested in 
using them to derail the Clinton plan than in writing the Cooper-Grandy 
blueprint for health care into law. 
</P>
<P>
 The political appeal of their plan -- widely known as "Clinton lite" -- lies 
largely in what it does not contain: strict cost controls or any mandate that 
employers provide insurance for their workers. Especially among the business 
interests already lobbying hard on health care, those two features of the 
Clinton plan are its most controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are also its chief tools for achieving the President's twin goals of 
health coverage for every American and cost containment. The cost containment 
element in the Cooper-Grandy plan is less stringent than Clinton's and it makes 
no claim to assuring health care for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the "lite" approach are stepping up their fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper in particular is finding himself the object of blistering criticism 
within his own party for his decision to challenge the most important domestic 
initiative of the first Democratic President in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's being used by the Republicans and all the special interest groups that 
want to defeat the President. I don't know that he sees it. I'll give him the 
benefit of the doubt," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of 
the House Energy and Commerce health and environment subcommittee. Cooper ranks 
fifth from the bottom in seniority on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's enjoying this national attention, but it's also in his Senate campaign's 
self-interest to go out and do a lot of fund raising with those interest 
groups," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's had his best day," said Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV 
(D-W.Va.). "To some extent, Jim Cooper is a creation of the media. . . . He's 
just declared himself to be the alternative and the press has bought it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others contend that the two lawmakers and their plan -- which also has a 
handful of Democratic and Republican sponsors in the Senate -- are a rare 
breath of bipartisanship in an institution where most major issues are decided 
along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're real heroes," said Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), ranking 
Republican on the Ways and Means health subcommittee on which Grandy sits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thomas supports a competing health proposal, he described Cooper and 
Grandy as "doughboys who threw themselves on the barbed wire so that others 
could crawl through." 
</P>
<P>
 Only five months ago, Grandy noted in an interview Thursday, they were just 
two more lawmakers peddling ideas for health care reform that no one was taking 
particularly seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining how the partnership developed, Grandy, whose career before he was 
elected to Congress included nine years playing Gopher on television's "Love 
Boat," said: "He (Cooper) wasn't getting as far as he wanted to go and I 
obviously wasn't getting anywhere with my bill." 
</P>
<P>
 So, though Grandy recalls that he and Cooper previously had "said maybe four 
words to each other," they and a few like-minded colleagues met to see if they 
could fashion a single package. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy and the Republicans put aside some of their party's traditional 
distaste for government intrusion and agreed to a requirement that small 
businesses join health-purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, 39, said he is still somewhat stunned by the attention he and the bill 
are getting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like Cinderella," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his idea is playing well in Tennessee, where he is campaigning for 
Gore's old Senate seat. Like the vice president, Cooper is a political 
blueblood in the state. His father, Prentice Cooper, was a three-term governor 
half a century ago, and his grandfather was Speaker of the Tennessee House. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old, Harvard-educated Grandy, who has worked hard to shed his 
television image, also has higher political aspirations. He is running for 
governor of Iowa.

ADMINISTRATION IS REASSESSING ITS HEALTH PLAN STRATEGY; REFORM: BUSINESS 
GROUP'S REJECTION CALLS FOR NEW TACTICS. OFFICIALS SEEK TO WIN SUPPORT FROM 
LABOR, ADVOCATES FOR ELDERLY AND CONGRESSIONAL ALLIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Stung by business rejection of their health proposal, Clinton Administration 
officials reassessed their strategy Thursday, hoping to regroup with support 
from labor, advocates for the elderly and their allies in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the health care debate, the President and his allies have been 
tugged between opposing strategies -- either accommodating business in the 
hopes of gaining their support or building a coalition strong enough to force 
business to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who worked with business leaders while governor of Arkansas, has 
often advocated the former path, hoping that if he worked with business leaders 
on issues of concern to them -- such as last year's debate over the North 
American Free Trade Agreement -- they would work with him on such issues as 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Several top aides, including Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty and Robert 
E. Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council, have advocated that 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wake of the rejection of his health plan by the Business Roundtable 
-- an organization of the nation's largest corporations -- in favor of a 
competing, more conservative plan offered by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), 
officials admitted that their wooing of business so far has achieved relatively 
little. And they seemed to be preparing for a tack to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Clinton and his senior aides insisted that nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't read too much into it. This is the beginning of what will be a 
protracted legislative discussion," Clinton said, referring to the Business 
Roundtable vote and a separate statement Thursday by the Chamber of Commerce 
opposing Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to work with everybody," said Clinton's senior adviser George 
Stephanopoulos. "This is just legislative jockeying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stephanopoulos conceded that Clinton and his aides are "disappointed" that 
the Roundtable, many of whose members Clinton had courted last year during the 
long debate over NAFTA, had turned against the White House on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Clinton's allies were far more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a special place in hell waiting for Bob Winters," said Sen. John D. 
(Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W. Va.), referring to the chief executive of Prudential 
Insurance Co., who drafted the business group's resolution attacking Clinton's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockefeller has been one of Clinton's chief allies in the health care battle 
and has sought to work with Prudential and other large insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sadness," said another senior official, "is that we really think health 
reform is in the interest of business, particularly the big businesses, most of 
whom provide health insurance for their workers. But it appears their reaction 
was more ideological than pragmatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democrats, including some within the White House, insisted that Clinton 
and his aides should have expected that sort of response and that the idea of 
gaining support from groups like the Roundtable was fundamentally flawed to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tactical error," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an amazing idea to ever think they'd get the Business Roundtable to 
endorse their bill," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who is one of 
the key legislators on health issues. "These organizations are the mainstay of 
the Republican constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 Some business leaders and conservative legislators suggested after the 
Roundtable's vote that the White House should begin negotiations with Cooper 
and with moderate Republicans to forge a compromise bill. But Administration 
officials rejected that notion. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Clinton aides appear to be pinning considerable hopes on the ability 
of liberal Democrats in the House to defeat Cooper's plan, allowing the 
Administration to negotiate later from a position of greater strength. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that no congressional votes on the issue are expected for at least 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Others suggested that as attention increasingly focuses on Cooper's plan, 
support for it will wane. "Cooper is the flavor of the month," said an 
Administration official, "put it under the hot lights for a few weeks and watch 
it melt." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Administration aides and advisers separately pointed to the battle 
over health reform in Washington state in 1992 as a model of what may be ahead. 
"They passed it without any business support," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats, many of whom have long feared that Clinton was going too 
far to accommodate moderates, already have begun aiming their fire at Cooper's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's bill "cannot pass. It does not have the votes in my committee and 
will not have the votes in the House," Waxman flatly predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other problems, Waxman noted, a central feature of Cooper's plan is to 
remove the tax deductibility of most health plans that companies give their 
workers, thus driving up the costs of health insurance for the great majority 
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper argues that step would give people incentive to choose cheaper health 
plans but such proposals have seldom been attractive in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials did their part Thursday to reduce support for 
Cooper's plan. Bruce C. Vladeck, a senior official of the Health and Human 
Services Department, for example, spoke to the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons and warned that efforts in Congress to water down Clinton's proposal 
would endanger prospects for government-provided long-term care and drug 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, for his part, wooed the same group, suggesting that he might sweeten 
his plan by adding some sort of long-term care package.

NEW SPACE AGE IS DAWNING AS SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF

<P>
 Discovery rose with the sun and launched a new space age Thursday, carrying 
into orbit the first Russian aboard a U.S. shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of Russia's space program praised the liftoff, which is considered a 
prelude to a shared space station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is remarkable that this launch has been on schedule, and everything is 
well, going all right," Russian space director Yuri Koptev told the shuttle 
launch team. "I hope that in our future cooperative projects, everything will 
be going as well, or right on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Koptev promised to return the favor early next year with a punctual Soyuz 
launch of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration astronaut to Russia's 
Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery blasted off at dawn, piercing a clear sky on its way to a 
218-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the five Americans on board for the eight-day science mission was 
cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who wore a Russian flag patch on the shoulder of his 
orange flight suit.

HE SAID, SHE SAID / PATRICK MOTT AND ANN CONWAY: NO ONE'S BODY (OR MIND) IS 
PERFECT, NOR IS ANY PLAYBOY SURVEY 
</P>

 I t arrived in the mail a couple of weeks ago, screaming about the chance to 
win big money, cars and Other Valuable Prizes, and all you, the lucky 
recipient, had to do was complete the two-page "1994 Playboy Perfect Woman 
Poll."  
</P>
<P>
 It sounded pretty intriguing until we looked at some of the questions and 
criteria, which appeared to have come straight out of 1957 and must have been 
specifically calculated to make Andrea Dworkin rigid with fury.  
</P>
<P>
 So . . . is the idea of constructing the perfect woman, or man, a worthwhile 
exercise or a resounding 10 (10 being just shy of Nazism) on the politically 
incorrect scale?  
</P>
<P>
 HE: I say it's fairly harmless because, let's face it, we all do it to one 
degree or another. I have a weakness for red hair and a kind of astringent 
smile. Big deal. But the Playboy survey details you to death. It wants to know, 
for instance, whether you think the perfect woman ought to have -- I'm not 
making this up -- an "innie" or an "outie" belly button. It's like a personal 
ad run amok. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: For the record, I prefer "innies." They're great for eating celery in bed 
(you can put salt in an "innie"). 
</P>
<P>
 I get a kick out of the way this poll is organized. Such originality. There 
are sections dealing with vital statistics; beauty; body parts ("What one 
feature about a woman's face do you look at most?"); brains (Choose one: "I 
believe the perfect woman should have common sense or lots of dollars and 
cents"); fashion; lifestyle/work style, and sexual attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbage! Where's the section on values? When are the sexes going to figure out 
that it's our shared value systems, not body parts, that keep us loving each 
other? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Well, we ought to acknowledge that Playboy has never really been on the 
sharpest cutting edge of sexual politics. The airbrush is not exactly a 
philosophical tool. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest category to values on the sheet is lifestyle and workstyle, which 
gives the respondent a smorgasbord of choices that suggest a myopically narrow 
focus. The perfect woman, it implies, would love to do only one or two of the 
following: eat, dance, spectate, work, talk, draw, participate or travel, and 
would favor the indoors, the outdoors, music, motorcycles, talk radio or 
convertibles. She could also be career-minded, goal-oriented, family-oriented, 
a homemaker at heart or good with children and in-laws. Each of these choices 
has a little box next to it for the respondent to check. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd say that if 90% of those boxes weren't checked, the resulting perfect 
woman would be either a crashing bore or just plain mean. 
</P>
<P>
 Another limiting question, under the "brains" designation: The perfect woman 
would have an interest in art, English, history, finance/math, physiology, 
sciences, foreign languages, political science, psychology or "other." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that all?  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I'm going to pretend like this is a questionnaire about the perfect M-A-N 
and fill in the blanks on the body parts section. 
</P>
<P>
 What one feature about a man's face do you look at most? (check one, it says): 
cheekbones, chin, ears, eyebrows, eyes, lips, nose, teeth, other . I look at a 
man's teeth the most. (I keep my eye on their level of dental hygiene and their 
smile.) 
</P>
<P>
 The perfect man's lips would be: full, thin, thick, pouty (check one). Forget 
pouty and thick. Mens' lips should be slightly full. My, I didn't know I cared 
about such things. 
</P>
<P>
 But while we're at it, what feature do you look at the most on women? And what 
about her lips? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: You've really been reading the questionnaire carefully, haven't you? OK, 
OK, I'll bite on this one. If a woman has an easy, sunny smile and the kind 
eyes to back it up, I always figure there's a lot behind that smile and those 
eyes that's worth finding out about. 
</P>
<P>
 Lips? Who cares? I'm sick to death of that yahoo parade of bee-stung lips 
pouting at me from the covers of fashion magazines. Give me an open, expressive 
face and you can slap any pair of lips on it you like. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Here's the killer question: "Other than her face, if a woman could have 
only one absolutely perfect physical feature, it should be . . . Please 
Specify." Then the form gives you a little hint (like you're too dumb to figure 
it out): "In other words, are you a 'leg man,' or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 I've wanted to ask a man this for years. Is is true that men categorize their 
attraction for women this way? Are there really leg men? Derriere men? Breast 
men? And if so, why? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Answers, in order: Yes, yes, yes, yes and I don't know. And it's not a 
phenomenon limited to men. Sure, I've talked to a lot of guys who would 
automatically rule out a stunning woman if she had anything but blond hair. 
I've also heard lots of women deep-six an otherwise terrific guy because he 
wasn't tall. If you don't look at the total person and instead fixate on 
something as irrelevant as the size of a bra or a wallet, you deserve what you 
get. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: In spades.

 That beer commercial that combines two disparate sports -- like full contact 
football with golf? Apparently such twisted fantasies are common. Take designer 
James La Fave, who included authentic pro hockey jerseys in his snowboard 
apparel line, Poorhouse. "It can be worn instead of a T-shirt, and you won't 
get wet or scraped up from granules of ice," he says. The $50 top is sold at 
his Laguna Beach shop, Galaxy, and other Poorhouse distributors. Like a Virgin

 Move over Hard Rock Cafe. The craze to collect hats and tees has spread to the 
Virgin Megastore chain. "Our best-sellers are items listing the city," notes 
spokesman Patrick Kelly. Products from the "Newport Beach" store (actually in 
Costa Mesa) have become among the hottest, adds Kelly, who gets requests to 
send baseball caps from stores in Tokyo, Paris and the U.S. (but you'll have to 
go there yourself). Great sales in O.C. have triggered the company to expand 
the L.A. store's apparel department. So is it the thrill wearing a sign stating 
"Virgin"? "It is the logo, but people love what it represents -- our company, 
the record label, the airlines," Kelly says. "Our corporate culture is known 
for going against the grain." Monster Protection

 From the ever-expanding apparel collection at Sesame Street come aprons for 
bakers of all ages ($17-$20). Most styles feature that prince of pastry -- 
Cookie Monster. And it's more than parents who are tying one on. "There's a 
whole group of middle school to college-aged kids who have become a big market 
for us," says a spokeswoman. With the apron dress still a part of fashion, 
these covers could look tasty as nightclub wear over a dress or jeans. Hear Us

 While most would cast aside print ads as trash (and most deserve such a fate), 
there are those that warrant being torn out and tacked to the wall or kept in a 
journal. For a decade, Donna Karan's poignant, black-and-white campaign has 
celebrated the modern woman and all she can achieve -- whether it's running a 
household or a nation. "Donna believed it was much more personal, the story of 
being a woman, than showing fashion editorial," says company spokeswoman Patty 
Cohen. Karan's favorite images are now available in a hard-cover coffee table 
book ($25). With only 5,000 printed, the book could earn $70,000 for the 
American Red Cross. Selections are on exhibit at Nordstrom, South Coast Plaza 
from Monday through Feb. 13. ROSE APODACA

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: FASHION; DRAMA -- AND WORKMANSHIP -- REMAIN IN RICHARD 
TYLER'S SOFT SIMPLICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing short of amazement erupted among fans of Richard Tyler when word got 
out that the designer -- who balances his schedule between Los Angeles and 
Manhattan -- would make an appearance at a presentation for his spring '94 
collection last Friday at the Robert Mondavi Wine & Food Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a designer who, in addition to creating the extensive signature 
collection that seems to earn him endless kudos each season, has in the past 
year taken the helm at Anne Klein & Co., where he has skillfully yielded 
everything from suits to shoes for the American fashion house. 
</P>
<P>
 If that weren't enough for Tyler and his business partner/ wife, Lisa 
Trafficante, the pair became parents less than two months ago to a son, Edward. 
The three were on hand at the Nordstrom-sponsored event and, in their usual 
amiable demeanor, found the energy to socialize after the runway show with the 
many strangers who have come to love and respect Tyler's flair for style and 
workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 His waltz last spring, when he was last in Costa Mesa, with overly theatrical 
clothes has turned to a simpler approach -- though the drama lingers. The 
velvets and tapestries have been replaced with ethereal silks, satins and 
chiffon. White and red have been softened to ivory and pink. 
</P>
<P>
 With this line, Tyler continues his love for vintage costumes, treating 
fabrics to give them an appearance of lost time. Creamy duchess satin is "aged" 
with soy sauce and made into exquisite blouses. There were jackets that looked 
pulled out of a century-old trunk. Six members of Tyler's expert staff spent 
"days and days," he said, stitching pin-stripes of colored thread and applying 
velvet ribbons, only to be pressed with a hot iron and ripped at sections for a 
distressed look. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worn and abused, however, every piece bared the trademark tailoring that 
earned Tyler a clientele of the famous and not-so-famous. The workmanship is so 
precise that the clothes can be worn inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 Suits -- Tyler's forte -- appeared as gray as Wall Street. But the influence 
was more schoolboy than menswear, shown with boots that hit above the ankle. 
Jackets fit snugly or flounced at the waist in the spirit of the Gibson Girl. 
Foot-long skirts barely covered; Tyler assured that a 17-inch version will be 
shipped instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The designer took his wife's advice and paired barely-there pink silk and 
chiffon blouses with the gray suits. "Pink instead of white to soften the 
look," Tyler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another theme continued from fall is the touch of Edwardian. Blouses and 
jackets feature leg-of-mutton sleeves; some are gathered from wrist to 
shoulder. Narrow pants and jackets in bold stripes of black and white or purple 
and green look dandy. 
</P>
<P>
 For evening, Tyler's view on glamour was restrained, wrapped in pewter organza 
or black taffeta. Even his mesh bodysuits, with florid lace swirls just barely 
covering, revealed a certain subtlety.  
</P>
<P>
 His inspiration for the line are "the suffragettes," said the Australian-born 
designer. In micro minis? And what about the bosom-flashing blouses and skirts 
slit up the thigh? "Freedom," he said. "The collection has to do with freedom."

COUNTY JAIL EXTERMINATION EFFORTS HAVE RATS, ROACHES ON THE LAM; VERMIN: 
CONDITIONS ARE 'SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED' AT FACILITIES THAT WERE INFESTED A YEAR 
AGO, ACCORDING TO INSPECTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The number of escapes continues to mount at the Orange County Jail, but guards 
and prisoners alike are cheering these departures. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual county health inspection reports show that rats and cockroaches -- 
known to be so bold as to hitch rides on food delivery carts -- are breaking 
out under the heavy fire of local exterminators. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, when at least two prisoners were bitten in separate attempts to 
capture invading rodents, conditions at the Central Men's Jail and the 
Intake/Release Center have "significantly improved," according to inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The most encouraging note may have been sounded this week by Dr. Hugh F. 
Stallworth, Orange County's new public health officer, when he responded to 
questions about vermin problems at the jail: "I'm hearing about inmates biting 
inmates. No animal bites, yet." 
</P>
<P>
 According to written reports about inspections of all five county jail 
facilities during the past year, only the Central Men's Jail and the 
Intake/Release Center, both in the Santa Ana Civic Center complex, continued to 
battle longstanding infestation problems. 
</P>
<P>
 During their most recent reviews, inspectors did find live roaches on the 
walls and floor of the first-floor refrigerator where prisoners' sack lunches 
are stored at the Intake/Release Center. And there were occasional sightings of 
rat droppings, indicating that a "rodent problem still exists." 
</P>
<P>
 But it does not compare to conditions found only a year before, when 
inspectors noted that rats and roaches had infiltrated administrative offices, 
kitchens and food storage areas in both the Intake/Release Center and the 
Central Men's Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 In only a month's time, the inspectors wrote in the earlier report, nine mice 
were trapped while roaming an electrical control room next to the 
Intake/Release Center's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, in the Central Men's Jail, rats were munching away on 
packaged food stored in a basement tunnel. And it was reported that the 
"magnitude of the . . . cockroach problem suggests that more aggressive pest 
control is needed." 
</P>
<P>
 "One live adult (roach) was found in a bulk oatmeal container," inspectors 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, jail officials have gone to war. They have consulted with the 
Orange County Vector Control District, hired private exterminators and sealed a 
network of holes, gaps and other openings that once served as vermin freeways 
inside the local lockups. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best gauge of apparent success in this fight might come from 
inmate rights attorney Dick Herman, who said Thursday that he has not fielded a 
prisoner complaint about roaches or rats in some months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The complaints were fairly common about a year ago," Herman said. "I would 
hear about the rats in the main jail and the mice in the (Intake/Release 
Center). But it hasn't come up in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 However, even amid the vermin complaints, Herman said, some inmates assigned 
to isolation areas for discipline reasons actually seemed to develop a peculiar 
affinity for cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being all alone like that in a little cell, the roaches became like pets to 
some of them," Herman said. "They would train them, or the roaches would just 
keep them from going crazy."

BLACK HISTORY PARADE MARCHES; BACK AFTER LAPSE; CULTURE: ORGANIZER SAID TWO 
YEARS OF FAILURE MADE HIM DETERMINED TO PROVE COMMUNITY CAN AND WILL SUPPORT 
ITS OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After the county's Black History Parade failed to materialize for the past two 
years, Chuck Mosely grew tired of hearing that the black community couldn't 
generate enough enthusiasm for its own event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got involved in this because of the media. They were my impetus," said 
Mosely, one of the organizers of the parade marking Black History month that 
will be held here Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, all I heard was that the black community couldn't foster enough 
support to hold a parade. I thought that was a fallacy and decided to work to 
prove that it was possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosely and two other African American business owners from Orange County, 
Ernesta Wright and Ray Brently, vowed there would be no repeat of the problems 
that plagued the 1992 and 1993 parades, which fizzled because of lack of funds 
and organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money and organizational problems were the result of a lack of unity within 
the African American community," Mosely said, echoing the parade theme 
"Building Unity Within the Community." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosely, Wright and Brently took the reins from the Orange County Black 
Historical Commission. forming the M.W.B. Foundation, which uses the first 
letter in each member's last name. Their first order of business was to build a 
network within the African American community, which numbers just 55,000, or 
about 2% of the county's population. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew when we started out the community would be apathetic because of what 
happened to the last two parades," Mosely said. 
</P>
<P>
 So last March, the group began sending out flyers to the county's African 
American households, asking for financial support and listing upcoming 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked: The foundation raised about $35,000 and, by January, its mailing 
list had grown from a few hundred to more than 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation held five fund-raisers between last March and this January, 
including an art show in July, a community bazaar in September, a celebrity 
basketball game in October and a dance benefit in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will begin at 10 a.m. and is expected to last 90 minutes. It will 
start at the intersection of Broadway and 15th Street, and end near Santa Ana 
Stadium, where the cultural fair will be held until 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade promises to be the largest in its 12-year history, Wright said. 
Organizers expect about 5,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Carroll, an NBC correspondent in Los Angeles, will serve as grand 
marshal. Local African American businesses, six high school bands, two floats, 
five high school ROTC drill units, numerous city officials, equestrians and 
clowns will also participate.

SANTA ANA'S ANTI-CAMPING LAW OVERTURNED; COURTS: APPEALS JUSTICES SAY MEASURE 
AIMED AT CLEARING CIVIC CENTER OF HOMELESS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WOULD 'DESTROY 
LIBERTY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saying that the homeless of Santa Ana were essentially being told to "clear 
out of town by sunset," a tartly worded appeals court ruling struck down as 
unconstitutional the city's anti-camping ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ordinance were allowed to stand, it "would turn the county jail into a 
poorhouse and thus . . . destroy liberty," the court said. "Punishment for 
poverty -- which the camping ordinance surely is -- is cruel and unusual 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal here also found that the city's 1992 
ordinance prohibiting the homeless from camping on public property is vague and 
bars people from being able to live and move based on class. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the homeless in California and in major cities including 
Baltimore and Miami have been closely following the legal battle over the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal charges against at least a dozen homeless people cited for violating 
the Santa Ana ordinance were dropped because of the appellate court decision.  
</P>
<P>
 "The court of appeals has said very plainly that the city cannot drive the 
homeless out," Harry Simon, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society of Orange 
County, which challenged the ordinance, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Assistant City Atty. Robert Wheeler said city officials are 
"disappointed" in the decision, which was released late Wednesday, and will 
appeal to the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance was adopted at a time when things were really out of hand in 
the Civic Center plaza" in mid-1992, Wheeler said. "It was a tent city (of 
homeless people). Yet that didn't come out in the court's opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana City Councilwoman Lisa Mills said that the court's decision was not 
surprising but that the city must continue on its legal course. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Civic Center wasn't meant to be a place to sleep," Mills said. People 
"don't feel safe going to the Civic Center anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign prohibition went into effect in September, 1992, and soon 
afterward the Legal Aid Society filed suit in Superior Court. That court upheld 
the ordinance and Legal Aid appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, the city passed a second, separate anti-camping ordinance, 
patterned after a U.S. Park Service law, to clear the homeless from the Civic 
Center area only. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon asked Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis to temporarily 
block police from enforcing that law in January, but Polis said the city's 
second ordinance was likely to pass constitutional muster and allowed 
enforcement to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 However, advocates for the homeless still intend to challenge that second 
ordinance in a few months, Simon said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance that was struck down in the appellate ruling, homeless 
people were essentially told to "clear out of town by sunset; and that, of 
course, is what this ordinance is all about, a blatant and unconstitutional 
infringement on the right to travel," Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. wrote in the 
decision.  
</P>
<P>
 Crosby wrote that the city "claims denying petitioners the use of sleeping 
bags and blankets outdoors does not outlaw necessities of life because the 
homeless can sleep somewhere else. Where? Some of the homeless declarants did 
prefer the outdoors to an overcrowded armory, but none expressed a preference 
to living as a way of life in a Civic Center parking structure or doorway 
during the cold, rainy January evenings when they were cited. They had no 
better place to go than some public location." 
</P>
<P>
 The court's action was hailed by Christopher Mears, an attorney who has 
represented several Santa Ana homeless clients in civil and criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision "makes you feel like you're not alone, howling in the 
wilderness," he said. "This whole program of criminalizing homelessness 
violates the Constitution . . . but unfortunately the city views the 
Constitution and enforcement of it as a game." 
</P>
<P>
 But praise for the ruling wasn't universal. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Teir, general counsel for the American Alliance for Rights & 
Responsibilities in Washington, a group supporting the city's efforts, said: 
"Winning this case and establishing a constitutional right to sleep in the 
public place of your choice . . . furthers the deterioration of cities and 
makes it uncomfortable for middle-class people to live in them."

ANAHEIM AND DISNEY MOVE CLOSER TO PACT; EXPANSION: CITY AND THEME PARK REPORT 
PROGRESS IN NEGOTIATIONS OVER NEW WESTCOT RESORT DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Negotiations on the $3-billion Disneyland expansion project have led to 
"conceptual" agreement on several issues between the city and Disney, but 
officials stressed Thursday that a proposed development agreement is still 
three months away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not struck a deal, nor a tentative deal," City Manager James D. Ruth 
said. "However, we have significantly closed the gap on several major deal 
points and reached a basic agreement on several others." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides gave updates on the negotiations Thursday, hailing significant 
progress but dismissing outright the notion of a breakthrough. "We've got a 
ways to go" before reaching a tentative agreement, said Kenneth P. Wong, senior 
vice president for Disney Development Co. "The fact that we are still 
negotiating is proof positive that there is no deal yet." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Wong added, "where the mood may have been pessimistic a while ago, it's 
optimistic now. . . . We have made great progress over the last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither city nor Disney officials would elaborate on what points have been 
successfully negotiated. City officials did say, however, that several vital 
issues are still unsettled, including construction time-lines, financial 
liability and land acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the "conceptual agreements" would be reduced to writing by attorneys 
and he expects a detailed development agreement to be finalized in the next 90 
days and then presented to the Planning Commission and City Council for review 
and approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still hurdles to overcome (and) . . . much work needs to be done," 
said Deputy City Manager Tom Wood, who is the city's lead negotiator in the 
project. "However, we continue to be optimistic that we can reach a final 
agreement. . . . We look forward to making this project a reality for 
everyone's benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the Disneyland Resort would include 5,600 hotel rooms, an 
amphitheater, a seven-acre lake, a shopping district and a new theme park next 
to Disneyland called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also calls for two of the largest parking structures in the nation 
and about $800 million in public financing to pay for those garages as well as 
sewers, streets and landscaping. Disney officials say the company cannot afford 
to build the project without assistance from the city, county and state. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's request for public money requires the city and Disney to have a 
development agreement that spells out exactly when the project will be built 
and how it will be financed. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the project's potential economic and social benefits to the state, 
including the creation of some 24,000 new jobs, Gov. Pete Wilson has agreed to 
contribute $60 million in state transportation money for freeway off-ramps and 
one of the parking structures. The federal government has earmarked at least 
$15.5 million and indicated it would provide a total of $131 million for the 
construction of a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city is still working out the details of its financial 
contribution, which could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said the city would finance its share through "future tax revenue" 
generated by the project and would not dip into its general fund. Furthermore, 
he said a parking authority may be established to sell bonds to fund the 
parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations began three years ago and discussions picked up in June after 
the city approved the environmental impact report on the expansion plan. 
Several months ago, the city and Disney were far apart on many issues, 
officials said, but many of those differences have been resolved since the 
beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Thursday cautioned, however, that a development agreement with 
Disney is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're nowhere near an agreement," Councilman Bob D. Simpson said. "Sure 
there's been progress, but not a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler said a celebration would be premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have this thing put to bed yet," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly said apparent agreements on many of the issues is "good news . 
. . but there are things that still need to be worked out. The reality in 
government is the deal is not final until the gavel comes down and there is a 
vote," he said.

A FRESH START; VIETNAMESE VOLUNTEERS HELP YOUTHS AT JUVENILE HALL CELEBRATE 
LUNAR NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her name is Xuan, meaning "spring," and this is the fourth winter she has 
spent apart from her family since she ran away from home in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the first lunar new year the 16-year-old will spend locked inside 
the Orange County Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dreary surroundings of the detention center, the Tet holiday, which 
arrives Thursday, would have been dismal indeed if Vietnamese volunteers had 
not visited Wednesday to help Xuan and other Vietnamese youths celebrate what 
is for them the most important day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers "make me cry," said Xuan, who has been at Juvenile Hall since 
July and expects to stay there five more months, her sentence for a crime she 
would only describe as "serious." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel homesick, and if they didn't bring Tet here, I'd be really sad," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Tet is a holiday that brings families together, Thanksgiving 
and Christmas rolled into one. Like other cultures' New Year celebrations, it 
is also seen as a time to start afresh, a chance to forget the past year and 
seek new beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 At Juvenile Hall, 11 boys in blue uniforms and two girls in maroon and gray 
uniforms gathered about 7:15 p.m. for a Catholic Mass in Vietnamese to 
celebrate the holiday. Afterward, the volunteers passed out plates of red 
sticky rice with sausage, sweetened fruit candy and red envelopes of lucky 
money -- actually foil-wrapped chocolate coins. 
</P>
<P>
 Xuan is one of nearly 40 Vietnamese youths at the facility, who comprise about 
10% of the total population, said Tony Carrasco, a chaplain for the Catholic 
Detention Ministry at Juvenile Hall. The teens' full names are not being 
published because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese Catholic volunteers come to the facility on the first Wednesday of 
each month to hold Mass and conduct Bible study for the youths. Some also come 
back individually for one-on-one counseling with the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday night's Mass, the Rev. Thanh Van Nguyen encouraged the 
inmates to use the new year as a second chance to turn away from a life of 
crime. He recounted how he had looked forward to Tet as a child because 
everything was new. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got new clothes, new shoes, a new haircut, all to welcome the new year," 
Nguyen told the teens. "My parents told me not to cry on Tet or I'd cry all the 
time throughout the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The young listeners laughed, and he continued: "They also said that if I 
behaved on the first day then the rest of the year would be good for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The promise prompted a boy to ask, kiddingly: "What if we're in jail at the 
start of the new year? Will we be in jail for the rest of the year?" And there 
was more laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, if you are good in jail on New Year's Day then you'll get to leave here, 
because you've changed," Nguyen answered with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning serious, the priest added: "I'm sure on New Year's Day, a family day 
in our culture, your parents will miss you very much. I ask you to do what you 
can to hurry home to them." 
</P>
<P>
 After he ended the Mass, the youngsters wrote New Year's wishes for their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chien, a boy of 14 whose name means "battle," wrote: "Wish my family a happy 
new year. Sorry I can't be there with you." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has been at Juvenile Hall for a month and will stay three months 
more after being convicted on car theft charges. This is his sixth time in 
Juvenile Hall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's sermon might sound good, Chien said, "but it's unrealistic. It ain't 
easy to do. But it's nice they came here to be with us because (otherwise) we 
can't celebrate in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a 16-year-old boy sang a Vietnamese song to the accompaniment of a 
guitarist. In the ballad, a son tells his mother he won't be coming home this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy impressed the volunteers with his knowledge of the song's lyrics. 
Asked how he had learned the ballad, he grinned and answered: "Karaoke." 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 p.m., the teens were required to return to their cells in single file, 
just as they had arrived. But this time they were holding plates full of 
Vietnamese treats. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight affected volunteer Hong Nguyen, 21, who came to the Mass inside the 
jail for the first time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish there had been more time to talk to them," said Hong Nguyen, who is a 
secretary with the Garden Grove Police Department. "They're really torn between 
the world we want them to live in and the world that they actually live in."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CHECKING OUT MOBILE LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many of the students at Edison Elementary School, Lupe Osorio, 9, has 
never been to the local library because it's too far to walk. But that doesn't 
stop her from getting all the books she wants: The library comes to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing inside a 35-foot-long bookmobile trailer crammed with shelves of 
books and magazines, Lupe said she loves to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they didn't come, I'd be sad," she said after giving the librarian a 
Valentine's Day card thanking her for coming to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe was one of more than 45 students who lined up after school to check out 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a program started in 1961, the Santa Ana Library reaches out to the 
community using mobile libraries designed to encourage students and other 
residents to take advantage of library services. The program costs about 
$620,000 a year, spokeswoman Cathy Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992-93 fiscal year, the mobile libraries circulated 272,000 books, 
making it the second busiest program in the state. Only the Los Angeles city 
library system, which has three times as many bookmobiles, had a higher 
circulation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the best innovations the library's ever done, " said Margy Treen, 
54, after checking out a dozen books. "I use it every week."  
</P>
<P>
 The bookmobile offers the same services as the main library. Students and 
other patrons can get library cards, check out books, videos and 
audiocassettes, and pay overdue book penalties. The library's two bookmobiles 
serve 30 locations citywide each week, Librarian Chris Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a small desk inside the bookmobile, Maynard stamped children's 
selections with a sticker telling the books' due date. During a brief lull, she 
said that many of the bookmobile's patrons would not have library services if 
it weren't for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For many residents, including children and the elderly, the library is hard to 
reach. Others sometimes don't realize services are free, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During her visit, Lupe gathered 21 children's books she planned to read over 
the next two weeks. Being able to read books along with her younger brothers 
helps them learn to read, she said, adding: "It's important. It makes me feel 
good."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 2 CITIES WILL JOIN ANTI-GANG PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors this week approved contracts that will allow 
two cities, Lake Forest and Mission Viejo, to join the 11 communities that are 
part of the Orange County Probation Department's gang-suppression program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was created to better monitor known and suspected gang members on 
probation for earlier crimes, and to mount a more concerted effort to reform 
them, said John Robinson, probation field services chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, a deputy probation officer will be assigned to work within 
the two cities, closely monitoring people who are on probation and "have a 
strong indication of gang association," county reports show. 
</P>
<P>
 The probation officer will be teamed with sheriff's deputies and a school 
district representative in the area to devise anti-gang strategies and put 
together gang-education seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two cities are not known as gang hot spots, Lt. Randy Blair, who 
heads the Sheriff's Department's 33-deputy detachment in Mission Viejo, said 
local politicians, police and residents are committed to heading off trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to passively sit by and let it happen here," Blair said. "We 
are going to be aggressive in our posture." 
</P>
<P>
 For the probation officer assigned to Lake Forest and Mission Viejo, the 
county will cover 45% of the annual $475,928 cost because the officer also will 
assist a broader South County anti-gang effort. The two cities will split the 
remainder.  
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old program's member cities are Anaheim, Dana Point, Fullerton, 
Garden Grove, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, La Habra, Lake Forest, Mission 
Viejo, Orange, San Juan Capistrano, Santa Ana and Westminster. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; CITY LIMITS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council approved two ordinances this week that will tighten controls 
on campaign contributions received by City Council candidates and on gifts 
received by council members, city employees and members of appointed boards. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 4-1 vote Tuesday, with council member Mark Goodman dissenting, the 
council approved an ordinance limiting individual campaign contributions to 
$350. Council candidates will have to disclose the names of individuals 
contributing $50 or more to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying his position was not "politically correct," Goodman objected to the 
ordinance, claiming it would favor incumbents who are able to rely on their 
broader recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're making it easier for the incumbents to get the money and you're 
shutting off the challengers," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, there is no limit on individual contributions, and only 
contributions of $100 or more must be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign-financing ordinance was drawn up by a special council-appointed 
committee which studied similar laws adopted by other cities and Orange County 
government. Members of the committee were residents Elaine Gennawey, Rice Brown 
and Larry Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee had proposed a $250 contribution limit but the council raised it 
to $350 on the recommendation of council member Patricia C. Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, the financing restrictions will also apply to people or 
groups who spend or incur costs of more than $1,000 in supporting or opposing 
candidates in an election year. The $1,000 figure was a reduction by the 
council from the committee's recommendation of a $2,000 threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the related item, the council voted unanimously in support of an ordinance 
prohibiting elected and appointed officials and city employees from being 
involved in decisions in which a person who is doing business with the city has 
given them gifts valued at $100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance is stricter than the state law requirement of gifts valued at 
$250 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Terry Dixon said officials and employees would still be allowed to 
attend dinners and events sponsored by nonprofit organizations, provided that 
meals or other items they receive are not funded by individuals or companies 
doing business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the city, Southern California Edison representative Susan K. 
Peterson expressed concern that the gift ordinance would restrict city 
officials from attending workshops the utility sponsors in and out of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "These workshops are educational and provide community and governmental 
leaders with valuable information to assist in solving local and regional 
issues," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon agreed that a trip sponsored by Southern California Edison could keep a 
council member from voting on an issue, but he said the likelihood of the 
utility coming to the city for approval of an action is slim. 
</P>
<P>
 Violating the restrictions of the ordinance would be a misdemeanor, and 
failing to comply with its reporting requirements would be considered 
infractions on the first two offenses and a misdemeanor on subsequent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the campaign financing ordinance and the gift ordinance will be brought 
back for a final vote of the council Feb. 15.RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY ATTORNEY QUITS POST, CITES ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Atty. James G. Rourke said Thursday that he has retired as a municipal 
employee and has given up his medical and life insurance benefits to keep his 
employment from becoming an issue during campaigning for the April 12 city 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rourke, 67, said he will stay on as a contract attorney for the city 
through his law firm, Orange-based Rourke, Woodruff & Spradlin, which already 
provides legal services to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain people are trying to make me an (election) issue," said Rourke, who 
has worked for the city since 1953. "But I'm not supporting any candidate, nor 
am I opposed to any candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Four candidates are contesting the two City Council seats at stake in the 
election and two of them, Michael Doyle and Tracy Worley, have said that the 
city must find ways to cut legal expenses, including possibly hiring an 
in-house attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates, incumbents Leslie Anne Pontious and Charles Puckett, 
said they are satisfied with Rourke's work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to council members on Jan. 24, Rourke said he would give up his 
benefits, including participating in the Public Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Ron Nault said the city pays about $1,700 a month for 
Rourke's life and medical insurance premiums and contributions to the 
retirement plan and a so-called deferred compensation plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city joined PERS in the 1960s, contributions to PERS on Rourke's 
behalf have reached more than $90,000. Rourke said he expects pension payments 
from PERS of about $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rourke's announcement has added a new twist to the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 This week, Doyle and Worley, who are seeking public office for the first time, 
were endorsed by the police and city employee unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Bonner, who heads the employee union, said it is backing Doyle and Worley 
because they appear to be more sensitive to the views of the employees about 
labor problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Bonner said union representatives interviewed the candidates to seek their 
ideas on certain issues. Pontious declined to be interviewed by the unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be a conflict of interest to seek their endorsement," 
Pontious said.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PERMIT TO CONTROL DRAINAGE FROM POOLS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several hundred residents who drain their swimming pools into the county's 
network of flood control channels will now have to buy a $100 permit to do so, 
a county official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent county survey showed more than 300 homeowners have run drainage pipes 
from their pools to nearby channels or storm drains, according to Al Vasquez, 
manager of public property permits. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are concerned that chemical-laced water may follow the 
channels to environmentally sensitive areas. Another concern, Vasquez said, is 
that the pipes may be emptying water into earthen channels in a way that might 
weaken them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the connections were done without construction permits, and some are 
the amateur handiwork of the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have trucks going up and down the channels for maintenance purposes, and 
the erosion from some of these (drainage pipes) might compromise the strength 
of the channel and cause an accident," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the permit process allows the county to have more control of 
such poolside drainage systems and would defray some of the cost of inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey that turned up the connections was performed to make sure the 
county meets new federal water pollution guidelines. The $100 permits are for 
three-year use of the channels, with a $100 renewal fee assessed every three 
years.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; CITY DELAYS APPROVAL OF RAIL OVERPASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much to the exasperation of Metrolink rail officials, the City Council this 
week delayed approving a commuter rail bridge over Lake Forest Drive, saying 
residents haven't been given proper notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who need to know about this work have not been notified by the city or 
your agency," Mayor Marcia Rudolph said."Why is this all of a sudden in our 
hands? Where is the public input?" 
</P>
<P>
 The rail overpass would join an existing commuter rail bridge over Lake Forest 
Drive between Jeronimo Road and Muirlands Boulevard. Metrolink officials say 
two lanes of the busy roadway would be closed intermittently for up to six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Regional Rail Authority officials said that under state 
law, they could charge the city about $80,000 in construction fees unless the 
bridge was approved immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 State law permits the rail authority to charge 10% of the total project costs, 
a charge that is usually waived, said Lou Cluster, a project engineer for the 
rail authority. "If we experience delays . . . we will have to revisit why Lake 
Forest should be exempted from these costs." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a rail authority spokesman contacted Thursday said that "chances are 
pretty much zero" that the agency would be charging Lake Forest for any portion 
of the bridge costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted them to know that we waive these costs to be a good neighbor," 
said Francis Oaxaca, a spokesman for the rail authority, a five-county agency 
that manages the Metrolink commuter rail line. "It was not a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was how Rudolph perceived Cluster's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this costs us a few bucks, that's OK," she said. "I understand the implied 
threat, but our people need to know" about this bridge project. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; BLANKET THROWN ON HEATER STARTS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire broke out in the bedroom of a duplex Wednesday night after a 5-year-old 
boy threw a blanket over a portable floor heater, which ignited the blanket, 
fire officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boy was apparently trying to hide the fact that he had turned the heater 
on," said Anaheim Fire Investigator Mike Doty. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started shortly after 8 p.m. in the duplex in the 3400 block of 
Canoga Place. It took 14 firefighters from the Anaheim and Buena Park fire 
departments about 20 minutes to bring the blaze under control, Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was home with his 13-year-old brother and 4-year-old sister. The three 
were able to escape from the home without harm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fire was confined to the bedroom, there was extensive smoke and 
water damage to the rest of the home, which is now uninhabitable. The fire 
caused $15,000 in damage, officials said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; JUMPERS HEARTILY SUPPORT FUND DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 600 students at St. Pius V Catholic School jumped rope Thursday morning 
to raise money for the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to eight children jumped at a time, with the jump-rope often getting the 
best of them. Some, however, successfully jumped "double Dutch," using two 
ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun activity and it gives them an awareness of the heart association 
and what they do for people," said sixth-grade teacher John Jason, who 
organized the jump-rope-a-thon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason said the school raised about $3,000 for the association with various 
activities last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County schools, organizations and civic leaders are also raising 
money for the association this month, which is American Heart Month.  
</P>
<P>
 Liz Lin, spokeswoman for the American Heart Assn. in Orange County, said 
fund-raising activities this month include a ball and a "cardiac arrest" event, 
in which civic and business leaders are "arrested," then bailed out when they 
give a donation. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to raise about $300,000 this month, Lin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin said the money goes to supporting cardiac research and educational 
awareness programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Pius V's event gave the children a good dose of exercise and fun. It 
also provided a chance to help others, students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are people out there who need help, we help them because they're our 
brothers and sisters," said eighth-grader Jennifer Armas, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Her classmates agreed that indeed it's a good feeling to give, especially to 
those who have heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to try to make the world perfect so there's no hurt," said 
Amanda Israel, 13. "So if we do it, it makes us feel good because we're living 
out God's plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kreuz, 13, said students participate in many fund-raising and charitable 
activities during the school year, including collecting food, clothing and toys 
for the homeless. Recently they gave games and blankets to victims of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just a whole bunch of kids trying to help each other," added Margaret 
Rodriguez, 13.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PANEL REJECTS PLANS FOR BEACH DOG PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Parks, Beaches and Recreation Commission decided that North Star Beach 
near the Dover Shores community is no place for a dog park.  
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people attended the commission hearing Tuesday night to discuss the 
proposed four-acre park, where dog owners would have been allowed to leave the 
leash at home.Most of the supporters were pet owners and the main opposition 
came from residents of Dover Shores. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, it was decided that a dog park is not appropriate, because 
county- and city-owned North Star Beach is designated as a tidelands, according 
to Nancy Beard, recreation superintendent who wrote the staff report to the 
commission. Because of that designation, the land's lease stipulates that it 
must be used for aquatic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission then voted 7 to 0 to make no recommendation to the City Council 
and instead begin again to look for a suitable place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog park is not dead," Beard said. "The commission is anxious to find an 
appropriate location in Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the proponents of the specialized park vow to scour the city in 
search of another site.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; POLICE IDENTIFY BODIES FOUND IN CAR TRUNK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Thursday were still looking for clues in the shooting deaths of two 
men whose bodies were found in the trunk of an abandoned Cadillac convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified as Francisco Javier Lopez, 31, of Arizona, and 
Anastacio Parra Sarabia, 30, of Mexico, said Anaheim Police Sgt. Steve Rodig. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have four detectives working the case, but we still don't have any 
apparent motive for the homicides," Rodig said. "At this point, we have no 
leads or suspects." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and Sarabia each had several gunshot wounds in the upper torso and head, 
police said. Their bodies were discovered Wednesday after police were called to 
investigate the Cadillac, which had been abandoned at a remote rock quarry near 
Santa Ana Canyon Road and Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The car apparently had been left at the quarry Friday night. It had not been 
reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good possibility that the victims were killed at another location from 
where they were found," said Rodig, who declined to comment further on any 
aspects of the investigation. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; LOW-RANKED FIRM GETS CITY CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has awarded a three-year contract for ambulance service to a 
company that was fined two years ago for double-billing patients and was the 
lowest-ranked of five companies vying for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency Ambulance Service paid a $30,000 fine in September, 1992, after 
investigators for the district attorney's office discovered that the company 
was collecting money from both patients and their insurance companies for 
ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
 The company agreed to make about $70,000 in restitution and pay the fine but 
did not admit to any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Philip Davis, owner of Emergency Ambulance, the double-billing 
was done by an employee in the billing office and he was not aware of it until 
notified by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a problem and when it came to our attention we cleared it up," 
Davis said. "We changed our procedures so it won't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, City Manager Robert D'Amato said that neither he nor the council, 
which on Tuesday picked Emergency Ambulance from the field of five, was aware 
of the company's previous billing problems when the council awarded the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato said he talked to Davis after a reporter asked about the fine and was 
satisfied that the problem was a billing-procedure error. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has since installed a computerized billing system and changed 
some of its policies," D'Amato said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even before the past billing problems were discovered, Emergency Ambulance 
figured to be an also-ran in the competition for the contract. The company's 
proposal received 898 points out of a possible 1,050, more than 100 points 
behind the highest-rated company, Southland/Lifefleet.  
</P>
<P>
 The companies had been rated by a five-member panel that included 
representatives of the city, County Fire Department, Sheriff's Department and 
Emergency Medical Services Agency. After spending eight hours reviewing the 
proposals, the panel recommended Southland/Lifefleet, which has held the city's 
contract for 25 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members ignored the panel's recommendation because they want an 
ambulance station built in the city and Southland/Lifefleet planned to continue 
dispatching ambulances from its Anaheim headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologically, it makes me feel safer knowing an ambulance would actually 
be (in the city)," Councilwoman Maria Moreno said.  
</P>
<P>
 But instead of choosing the next highest rated bidder, Medix Ambulance 
Service, which proposed building a station and staffing it with two ambulances, 
the council chose Emergency Ambulance Service, which agreed to supply one 
ambulance to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Medix received 996 points, 11 points behind Southland/Lifefleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael L. Maertzweiler defended the decision, saying Emergency 
Ambulance was preferred because the company also serves nearby cities. DANIELLE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; COUNCIL TURNS DOWN PERMIT FOR POOL HALL

<P>
 Billiards players will have to chalk up their cue sticks elsewhere because the 
City Council this week denied a permit for a 5,600-square-foot billiards and 
pizza business. 
</P>
<P>
 The council cited overwhelming opposition to the proposed Yorba Linda Family 
Pizza and Entertainment Center as well as potential parking problems in 
reaching its unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several council members praised David Duncan's plan for a smoke-free, 
alcohol-free billiards and pizza establishment, they all said the Lakeview 
Shopping Center was not the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Duncan has attempted to win the necessary permits to 
lease a building in the southeast part of the center. He proposed putting in 17 
pool tables and a 1,200-square-foot dining area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby business owners and residents protested the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Meyers, the owner of B&B Pharmacy in the shopping center, presented the 
city with a petition with about 1,300 names protesting the proposed business, 
and dozens of residents sent letters and spoke at two public hearings against 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Although business owners confined their criticism to the parking problem, a 
number of residents have said a pool hall would bring trouble to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the pastor of a nearby church said the project would attract "the 
wrong crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe this type of business will contribute to the youth," said 
Richard Cunningham of Calvary Baptist Church and School. 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident said a billiards room would attract gamblers.  
</P>
<P>
 Council member Henry W. Wedaa said the volume of opposition could not be 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (1,300) people sign a petition, when a church and school object, I have 
to support their position," Wedaa said.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Massage, tattoo and acupressure businesses will be permitted to open in 
Placentia's town center areas, the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 3-2 vote, the council approved an ordinance that will allow those 
businesses to operate in the city's most visible business corridor.The council 
also approved a separate ordinance that requires such businesses to receive a 
conditional use permit and submit to police and health department scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Michael L. Maertzweiler and Maria Moreno opposed the 
ordinance, saying tattoo parlors and massage and acupressure establishments 
don't belong in the Town Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe (adopting the ordinance) is opening a Pandora's box," Moreno 
said. "Just go down Harbor Boulevard in Garden Grove or Stanton," she said, 
referring to areas with adult-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance came about in reaction to the opening of a tattoo parlor in a 
shopping center on Placentia Avenue. At the time, the city did not have any 
ordinances or regulations covering tattoo parlors, so the county health 
department refused to inspect the business. 
</P>
<P>
 With passage of the ordinance, health officials will now inspect any tattoo 
parlor at the city's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Massage and acupressure therapists also will be regulated in an attempt to 
screen out establishments that are covers for prostitution rings, city 
officials said. Each employee must be fingerprinted and undergo a background 
check by police. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 The Chamber of Commerce and the city will sponsor a series of "Shop La Palma" 
promotional events at local shopping centers over the next six to eight months 
in an effort to get residents to recycle dollars back into the town's estimated 
700 small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously voted Tuesday night to waive an estimated $200 in 
permit fees for the marketing events.The council is hoping the "Shop La Palma" 
campaign will help boost local business sales and city tax revenue.

 "We have to protect every business we have," City Manager Pamela Gibson said. 
"We can't afford to lose one business because there is nowhere to grow in our 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council allocated $5,000 in July to fund the local business campaign. 
The city's general reserve fund has been hit hard by reductions in state 
funding and dips in sales tax revenue over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of an estimated seven promotional events is scheduled for Feb. 19 
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the La Palma Convenience Center, at Valley View 
Street and La Palma Avenue. In addition to a sidewalk sale, the event also will 
feature a deejay, a raffle and clowns.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials said one promotional event will be scheduled at a different local 
shopping center each month. A week before the events, coupons good at the 
businesses being promoted will distributed to the city's 4,000 households, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to either introduce the public to, or have them revisit, their local 
businesses and shopping centers," chamber President Charlene Hatakeyama said. 
"We are hoping for a good response from La Palma."MARTIN MILLER

PANEL: LESSONS CAN LESSEN HEALTH TROUBLES; MEETING: AT A BLACK HEALTH ISSUES 
FORUM, PARTICIPANTS AGREE TEACHING SELF-ESTEEM CAN HELP REMEDY PROBLEMS. 
</P>

 Fostering self-esteem and purpose within Orange County's youngest blacks will 
cure many of the health problems that are threatening the very survival of that 
population, the county's top health official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have met the enemy and they is us," said Dr. Hugh F. Stallworth, Orange 
County's new public health officer, quoting the comic strip character Pogo. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth and other speakers at the county's first conference focusing on 
black health issues contended that blacks, by teaching their children values 
such as self-reliance and respect for others, can go far to curb the high rates 
of infant mortality, homicide, child abuse and HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We engage in an extraordinary rate of self-destructive behavior," Stallworth 
told the group, which included numerous black social workers and physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Greenwood, Orange County's deputy director of public health, said about 
120 people attended the conference, twice as many as expected.  
</P>
<P>
 The daylong event was arranged by the Orange County Health Care Agency with 
help from several black organizations, including the Black Chamber of Commerce. 
Health officials said they intend to hold another such conference next year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the dual objective of Thursday's conference was to highlight the 
health concerns of blacks, such as their higher susceptibility to diabetes, and 
to unify the county's widely scattered black population, which numbers less 
than 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A recurrent theme of the conference was the need to teach more effective 
parenting skills. Blacks have an extraordinarily high number of child deaths 
caused by physical abuse, the speakers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Guine, child abuse consultant for Los Angeles County Public Health 
Department, said the violence was spawned in the era of slavery when parents 
learned to train their children "with a whip," just as they were trained by 
their masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Guine said black adults who were themselves abused as children must learn 
"there is nothing wrong with loving a child and having a spoiled child." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Dawson, director of the Center for the Study of Black-on-Black Crime at 
the Cal State Los Angeles, said, "Communication is the key to good discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to this conference, Greenwood said county health officials will be 
working with each of the county's various ethnic groups in an effort to 
generate grass-roots support for addressing each group's distinct health 
problems.

POLICE WARNING PUBLIC ABOUT 2 SCAMS; CRIME: SPANISH-SPEAKING IMMIGRANTS SEEKING 
CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND RECENT WIDOWS HAVE BEEN TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Police officials from Fullerton and South County are warning the public about 
two scams, one targeting construction job-seekers and the other preying on 
recent widows. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, police said somebody is offering to find Spanish-speaking 
immigrants construction jobs in exchange for a $100 fee to join a union. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, according to Sgt. Glenn Deveney, a Mexican citizen was 
approached by a man in the lobby of an Anaheim hospital and offered a job in 
exchange for the money. The Mexican citizen agreed and drove the man to Union 
Bank in Santa Ana, where the enrollment to the union was to take place, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican citizen was then asked to drive the man to a Fullerton apartment 
complex, supposedly to pick up a pager that would call him to construction job 
sites. However, the man disappeared into the complex and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the man suspected in the scam is asked to 
contact the Fullerton Police Department at (714) 738-715. 
</P>
<P>
 In South County, sheriff's investigators said that at least one man has been 
telephoning women from Mission Viejo to San Clemente, using information from 
obituary notices. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five times over the past 15 months, the man identified himself as a 
bank official or police officer investigating employee thefts of depositors' 
funds, sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the names Douglas, Kramer, McDonald and Sgt. O'Donnell, the man asked 
the women's help in catching the suspected thief by withdrawing $2,500 to 
$5,400 in $100 bills, using checks payable to cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The widows are told the money is to be put into an envelope and taken to a 
nearby location to be turned over to the same man, or a second man, to be 
checked for fingerprints. Sometimes, the man picking up the cash flashed a 
badge, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police describe the man as white, 50 to 55 years old, 160 to 170 pounds, with 
a full gray or white beard or a salt-and-pepper mustache. Occasionally, he 
wears a small fishing cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's ripping off these old people like crazy," sheriff's Investigator Stanley 
Interrante said. Anyone with information is asked to call Interrante at (714) 
647-7031.

COSTA MESA MAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF BABY DAUGHTER; CRIME: THE INFANT, WHO HAD 
BEEN LEFT IN HER FATHER'S CARE, DIED OF HEAD INJURIES AFTER HER MOTHER FOUND 
HER UNCONSCIOUS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Costa Mesa man was arrested on suspicion of murder Thursday after his 
4-month-old daughter died of head injuries at Children's Hospital of Orange 
County, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 David M. Golub, 25, is suspected of inflicting the injuries that resulted in 
the death of his daughter, Dominique Angela Ann Golub, who was discovered 
unconscious Wednesday night by her mother, Dawn Pepe, said Costa Mesa police 
spokesman George Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother came home from work and noticed that the baby was not reacting 
properly," Wilson said. Golub "told her that the baby had fallen off the sofa 
and hit her head," the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple then rushed the baby to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. Doctors 
there suspected child abuse and contacted police. The child was transferred to 
Children's Hospital in Orange, where she died at 11:30 a.m., Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After interviewing the child's parents, the investigation focused on the 
father as the person responsible for the child's injuries," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors at the six-unit apartment complex in the 300 block of Hamilton 
Street, where the couple moved a month ago, said they tried to comfort a 
grief-stricken Pepe. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was out here screaming and crying this morning, saying that her baby was 
dying," said neighbor Jim Easter, 29. "She was just hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
 Easter's wife, Tammy, comforted the 23-year-old mother before she returned to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her to think positive," said Tammy Easter, 28. "It's just such a sad 
situation. They looked like a young family who were just beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The Easters said they frequently saw the couple taking the baby for a walk in 
her stroller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd see (Golub) strolling the baby around just as any father would," Jim 
Easter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the couple's former landlord, Barbara Bruce, said that they had been 
having financial problems and were unable to pay the rent on a two-bedroom 
house in Costa Mesa that they rented from her seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed to have a lot of bad luck, with one bad thing happening after 
another," Bruce said. "They showed up to rent the house with all their 
belongings in a U-Haul truck with no place to go, and my heart just went out to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce said the couple agreed to move out at the beginning of January when they 
couldn't pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had their problems, but that baby was just absolutely beautiful," Bruce 
said. "She had dark eyes and dark hair and looked just like a little China 
doll. She was adorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce said the last time she visited the couple at the house, it was set up 
with baby furniture and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Golub was being held at Costa Mesa City Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. He was 
expected to be transferred to County Jail, police said.

4 TEENS PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN SPEARING DEATH

 Four San Clemente youths pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges of murder, 
assault and conspiracy stemming from a confrontation that left a 17-year-old 
boy fatally injured with a paint roller rod through his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants -- Julio Perez Bonilla, 17, Rogelio Vasquez Solis, 17, Hector 
Penuelas, 17, and Saul Penuelas, 18 -- made their first appearances in 
Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel since a Juvenile Court judge ruled last month 
that they should be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to one count of murder, 10 counts of felony assault and one felony 
count of throwing an object at a moving vehicle, the defendants each face a new 
count of conspiracy and a sentencing enhancement alleging gang involvement, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, who are among six arrested and charged in connection with the 
Oct. 15 confrontation at Calafia County Beach Park in San Clemente, remain in 
custody on $250,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Woods of San Clemente fell into a coma after the attack and died about 
three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and police say Woods was among 10 friends in three vehicles who 
were pelted with rocks, beer cans, paint rollers and other items by about 10 to 
15 people as they tried to avoid a confrontation with the group in the beach 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence has been introduced suggesting who threw the paint roller that 
struck Woods.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen J. Biskar, who represents Saul Penuelas, said 
he intends to eventually ask that the trial be moved to another county because 
of "substantial publicity" surrounding the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants will be back in court March 8 for a preliminary hearing to 
determine if they should be tried in Superior Court on the charges. A fifth 
defendant faces trial on all counts, while a sixth, who plead guilty to 
voluntary manslaughter, awaits sentencing.

DISNEY, CITY PLAN ICE RINK FOR YOUTH, MIGHTY DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. and city officials said Thursday they are working on a 
joint venture to build an ice rink that would be used as a practice facility 
for the Mighty Ducks and a community youth center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney's proposal is very exciting," City Manager James D. Ruth said."Not 
only will it accommodate the Ducks, it will be used to attract, train and 
educate our young people about the game of hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said plans for the rink are in the early stages, but he expects them to 
be formalized soon. He said under Disney's proposal, the city would provide the 
land and Disney would build the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A specific site has not yet been chosen, and costs aren't known, but Ruth said 
it will probably be built in downtown Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth P. Wong, senior vice president of the Disney Development Co., 
confirmed that the company is looking into the venture with the city, but 
declined to elaborate on the details of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an idea that we've been discussing for some time," Wong said. "It will 
involve youth, the community and hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said Disney is also thinking about creating a hockey program aimed at 
troubled youth to steer them away from gangs and drugs and into organized 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ruth, the facility would probably be used more by the community 
than the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ducks will probably be in there only a couple hundred hours a year," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks now practice at the Glacial Garden Ice Arena in Anaheim. MATT LAIT

TEEN RIDING IN ALLEY HAS BIKE, $200 STOLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old boy who was riding his bicycle in an alley Wednesday evening was 
robbed of $200 in cash by two youths who knocked him to the ground, then rode 
off on his bike, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was riding in the 17300 block of Jacquelyn Lane about 7:20 p.m. 
when the robbery occurred, said Police Lt. Charles Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two suspects, believed to be 12 and 16 years old, threatened the use of a 
gun, but no weapon was seen," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was shaken but not injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said investigators do not know why the victim was carrying so much cash, 
which the robbers took from his front shirt pocket.

SUIT BY EX-LEISURE WORLD WORKER CLAIMS HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Leisure World employee has filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment 
and discrimination by a top official of the company that operates the sprawling 
residential community. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta A. McNiel's suit names the Lake Forest-based Professional Community 
Management Inc., which runs Leisure World, and Senior Vice President and 
General Manager Russell L. Disbro as defendants.McNiel, 40, who was the 
financial services director for the corporation until her dismissal in May, 
1993, filed the lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court on Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Disbro and his lawyer, Stanley E. Tobin, as well as other corporation 
officials could not be reached for comment Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, McNiel, who joined the corporation in July, 1985, as accounts 
manager, accused Disbro of sexually harassing her and of breaking a policy not 
to fire an employee without reasonable cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the defendants are accused of fraud and deceit. 
</P>
<P>
 McNiel's lawyer, Eric Lampel, said his client was a "thoroughly professional" 
woman with a high-powered position who was fired "because she wouldn't play 
ball. . . . She would not submit to (Disbro's) sexual advances."

EX-CONGRESSMAN SUES DMV FOR ALCOHOL TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Orange County Rep. Jerry M. Patterson has charged in a lawsuit that he 
was improperly tested for sobriety after his arrest on suspicion of drunk 
driving Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lawsuit, filed Wednesday against the Department of Motor Vehicles, 
Patterson said that the breath test was administered in an ineffective way by 
an improperly trained operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit claims that Patterson drank three to four glasses of wine between 
noon and 2:20 a.m., 40 minutes before his arrest, and had not eaten that day, 
but that he was not drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, a Democrat from Garden Grove who was defeated by current U.S. Rep. 
Robert K. Dornan in 1984, declined to comment on the lawsuit Thursday. DMV 
officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, currently Dana Point's city attorney, was stopped in Newport Beach 
while driving his 1991 Volkswagen van westbound on Coast Highway. The arresting 
officer said Patterson was driving 85 m.p.h. in a 50-m.p.h. speed zone and that 
he failed to stop at a red light. 
</P>
<P>
 The arresting officer observed that Patterson "seemed unsteady on his feet" 
and that his breath exhibited "a moderate odor of an alcoholic beverage," the 
report states.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Patterson tested at 0.08 -- just high enough to be legally 
drunk under California law -- when they administered a breath test at the 
police station. A blood test conducted 50 minutes later registered 0.07, which 
is below the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said he may have appeared unsteady because he is fitted with an 
artificial leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said in the lawsuit that if his driver's license is restricted 
because of his arrest it would damage his employment as an attorney and will 
ultimately result in an "astronomical increase in his insurance premiums," if 
not cancellation of his coverage.

 Boulle obituary -- An obituary in Thursday's Times on Pierre Boulle, the 
French author of the best-selling novel "Bridge on the River Kwai," incorrectly 
stated that the screenplay for the film of the same title was written only by 
Carl Foreman using the name Michael Wilson. The screenplay was credited to the 
non-English-speaking Boulle as stated, but was actually written by both Foreman 
and Wilson, two blacklisted screenwriters who posthumously received the Academy 
Award for the script in 1985. Boulle died Sunday in Paris at the age of 81.

SQUARE ONE; JANICKI, HEALTHY AGAIN, IS READY TO RESUME HIS ANGEL CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Janicki couldn't believe it was happening. God, not again. How is it 
possible to work so hard to be in total control, and have no control at all? 
</P>
<P>
 He was trying to live out a childhood dream, only to have a nightmarish 
throbbing in his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 April 9, 1993, was supposed to be the most glorious night of Janicki's life, 
the dawning of a professional baseball career. Everyone was there. His entire 
family. Friends. Neighbors. Coaches from high school and Little League. No one 
wanted to miss this moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki's professional debut already had been delayed six months because of a 
stress fracture diagnosed during the 1992 Olympic trials, but on this night, 
pitching for Palm Springs, he felt invincible. He wanted to show the world why 
the Angels selected him in the first round of the 1992 draft, and why in a few 
months he would be pitching at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt in my mind I was going to be there before the year was 
over," said Janicki, who led UCLA's pitching staff in strikeouts his final two 
seasons. "The way I was feeling, nothing was going to hold me back." 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki recalls being nervous, walking the first Riverside batter he faced, 
and he vividly remembers the sound of his 30-member cheering section 
</P>
<P>
 screaming wildly after his first professional strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked to the mound in the second inning, exuding confidence, but suddenly, 
he felt himself losing arm strength. He shrugged it off, but on the very pitch 
he struck out a batter, he heard a loud pop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the same sound I heard during the Olympics," Janicki said, "but I 
thought it was just old scar tissue popping out of the joint. I said, 'Hey, 
cool.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki stood defiantly on the mound, not about to let anything ruin this 
night, and concentrated on the next batter. The moment he released the ball, 
pain seared his body. He wasn't sure just what happened, but this definitely 
wasn't cool. 
</P>
<P>
 He summoned the trainers and walked down the right-field line to the 
clubhouse, stunning his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were crushed, absolutely crushed," said Deidre Dunkin, who married Janicki 
three months later. "No one knew what to say, so we cried." 
</P>
<P>
 While Janicki's entourage stood in silence outside the clubhouse, Janicki was 
inside acting like a crazed man. He started screaming, throwing chairs, wildly 
tearing off his uniform until teammate Dominick Johnson grabbed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was as distraught as I've ever seen a player," Johnson said. "I mean, he 
lost it, he just lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as weird and scary a moment as I've ever been involved in. All he 
could say was, 'I did it again. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'God, I did it again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki finally emerged from the clubhouse. Everyone piled into the family 
motor home. People spoke in hushed tones, wondering whether Janicki would pitch 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete and Deidre never heard them. They were sobbing in the back of the RV, 
more scared than at any other time in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to see a doctor the next day in Palm Springs, and the news was even 
worse than he imagined. The magnetic resonance imaging test revealed that the 
ulnar bone in his elbow actually had snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 The news reached the Angels quickly, and although no one dared to say anything 
publicly about Janicki's future, the whispers and facial expressions divulged 
their belief: Janicki's baseball career was over. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one problem: Janicki refused to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki and his wife awoke early this Wednesday after a restless night, fought 
through rush-hour traffic and were sitting in Dr. Lewis Yocum's office by 9. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the day he was to undergo a CAT scan of his right elbow. The 
examination, and Yocum's diagnosis, would determine whether Janicki would be 
packing his bags for spring training in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The ulnar bone is perfectly healed. 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki is cleared for spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, baseball world. It's Pete again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't trying to be naive through all this," Janicki said. "I knew it was 
serious. I know it's not normal just to throw a pitch and have your elbow 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I really believed that I could be back. I just knew it couldn't end like 
this. I mean, I'm a good pitcher with a good arm, but I have bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, the most frustrating part of the whole thing was that nobody could 
zero in on why it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Janicki heard all the possible reasons: poor pitching mechanics . . 
. doesn't drink enough milk . . . threw too many split-finger fastballs in 
college . . . the man upstairs simply doesn't want him to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing was rotten. Here he was, engaged to be married, and he might be 
without a job. Deidre reassured him that nothing had changed. She's a 4.0 
student in business school, and with her brains, they'll do just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "His whole being in college was baseball," Deidre said. "That's all he had. 
That's what made this so hard because he's dreamed of this so long. We told 
ourselves that things would work out in baseball, and if they didn't, we'll 
still be just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 If either ever entertained the notion that Janicki would have to seek an 
alternative career, the words were never spoken. Even when doctors advised 
Janicki that he likely would have to undergo major surgery -- complete with 
screws, pins and bone grafts -- their optimism never wavered. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Janicki pleaded for the doctors to wait. If it wasn't healed by the 
end of June, he'd go ahead with the surgery. If it could heal by itself, 
Janicki knew he'd have a much better chance of returning. 
</P>
<P>
 The bone scan in May revealed no progress had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, it was healing nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Janicki and Deidre married. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, he had bone spurs removed from his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, he was pitching off a mound, in front of all of the Angels' top 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In two weeks, he will be returning to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show people that I belong," Janicki said. "I want to show them that 
I was the best pitcher in the draft, and they're still getting the same guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who are paying $155,000 to Janicki this season, remain cautiously 
optimistic. Janicki has been working out in front of scout Darryl Miller, and 
Angel farm director Ken Forsch has been working on his delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe Janicki is ready to resume his career, where he likely will start 
at Class-A Lake Elsinore this season. Their biggest fear is the unknown. Will 
it happen again? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that should keep him from coming back," Angel General Manager 
Bill Bavasi said, "but our concern is that he stays back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really looks like everything's going to be fine, but of course, we thought 
the same last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's healthy, I really believe he'll have one hell of a career. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be soon finding out."

MIKE PENNER: BALTIMORE WAITING FOR THE 'WHATEVERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend of mine who lives in Baltimore is eagerly anticipating the arrival of 
the Rams, Raiders, Redskins and that Canadian Football League expansion entry 
to his fair city and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to have at least five football teams here very soon," my friend 
says. "We're also talking to the Patriots, the Bengals and the Buccaneers. 
We'll take any team. I mean, people here are excited about the Canadian league. 
We don't have the team yet, but they've already hired a coach and named the 
team. The Colts. The Baltimore Colts of the Canadian Football League. We're 
bringing back the Colts." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest rumor making the rounds in Baltimore, according to my friend, "has 
us asking USC to move here. We've heard about the earthquake damage at the 
Coliseum. They've got to play somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore needs these football teams, my friend says, because the city has 
been in a state of severe depression since the original Colts left in 1984 and 
has "a massive inferiority complex. People here actually think they have a 
superiority complex -- they're better than everyone else -- but it's just the 
opposite. They really won't feel good about themselves until they have a 
football team called the 'Baltimore' whatevers." 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Jack Kent Cooke's plan to move the Redskins to Laurel, Md., a 
working-class burg 20 miles to the south of Baltimore, is regarded a half-baked 
solution at best. Cooke's team will still be called the "Washington" Redskins. 
Baltimore wants the "Baltimore Redskins." Or the "Baltimore Rams." Or the 
"Baltimore Raiders." Or all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring down the Patriots and Baltimore can have its own division. The NFC West, 
East, Central and Greater Baltimore-And-Vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Final standings, 1995: 
</P>
<P>
 Balt. Patriots 13-3 
</P>
<P>
 Balt. Raiders 11-5 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Redskins 8-8 
</P>
<P>
 Balt. Rams 5-11 * 
</P>
<P>
 (* Rams go 0-6 within division. Jerome Bettis rushes for more than 1,200 yards 
again, triggering the automatic free-agency clause in his contract. Average 
attendance dips to 37,000. John Shaw contemplates move to St. Louis, Hartford, 
San Antonio or Amarillo, Tex., which is offering an unprecedented "sweetheart" 
deal: City plans to buy off Rams' regular-season and playoff opponents, thereby 
enabling Chuck Knox to finally coach in a Super Bowl.) 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland-as-football-mecca will take some getting used to, considering its 
heritage. Once they took the Colts away, what is there? 
</P>
<P>
 John Hopkins University produces outstanding vascular surgeons and lacrosse 
players. The University of Maryland has placed many basketball teams in the 
NCAA tournament, many more on NCAA probation, but is fairly nondescript on the 
gridiron. Boomer Esiason played there. So did Frank Reich, my friend proudly 
notes. "Maryland's known for its backup quarterbacks," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore itself is renowned as the birthplace of aluminum siding, which no 
doubt makes it appealing to Ram quarterbacks, and Bromo Seltzer, which makes it 
attractive to Ram coaches. Lately, though, Baltimore has become known as the 
city ready and willing to build a beautiful 60,000-seat football stadium across 
the street from Camden Yards, lease it to the first caller for $1 a year and, 
for a limited time only, throw in all the revenue from parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams and the Raiders are lining up at the door, and it isn't because of 
the blue crab at Bo Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're offering to build them a new stadium for free," says my friend, who 
begins to turn cynical at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of saying, 'Let's spend $200 million on prisons in Maryland,' they 
say, 'Let's spend $200 million on a new stadium so the criminals can terrorize 
the fans at football games.' " 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't realize Baltimore had such a crime problem, I say to my friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Baltimore's right next to D.C.," he says, "so, by comparison, it seems 
like a garden spot. But we've broken the city record for most murders for two 
consecutive years now. Last year, there were close to 400 in the downtown 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend mentions Barry Levinson, who, in 10 years, has gone from directing 
warm, nostalgic glimpses of life in Baltimore during the 1950s ("Diner") to 
producing a television series set in contemporary Baltimore titled "Homicide." 
In one episode, a woman is shot while walking out of Camden Yards after an 
Oriole game. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore wants to feel good about itself again and, as Unitas once said, 
professional football is the opiate of the masses. So this is what Anaheim and 
Los Angeles are competing against -- a city desperate enough to give Al Davis 
its key, a city desperate enough to want the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Irsay did this to Baltimore. Robert Irsay and Paul Tagliabue. Irsay 
pirated the Colts away to Indianapolis while Baltimore was asleep, Tagliabue 
awarded the NFL's last two expansion franchises to Charlotte and Jacksonville, 
thus depriving the world of "Boogie" Weinglass and the Baltimore Bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually," my friend says, "the fans here voted and the name they came up 
with for the expansion team was the Ravens, because Edgar Allan Poe was born in 
Baltimore. But the team went with Bombers because 'Boogie' Weinglass makes 
bomber jackets." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as well, my friend says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't see anyone rooting for a football team whose motto was 
'Nevermore.' "

RAMS' ZAMPESE HIRED TO LEAD COWBOY OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he was "our guy from the word go," Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones on 
Thursday hired offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese of the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Zampese, 57, agreed to a three-year contract. He replaces Norv Turner, who was 
named coach of the Washington Redskins on Wednesday. Turner was an assistant 
under Zampese in Anaheim before taking over the Cowboys' offense in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been speculated Zampese wouldn't leave California, but he said the 
opportunity to coach Dallas' high-powered offense was a sufficient lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think first of all, it's the possibility of going to a Super Bowl," Zampese 
said. "I think that's what we all aspire to do in this profession."  
</P>
<P>
 Zampese had one year remaining on his contract with the Rams, and the team 
could have stopped him from talking with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ram organization has been just super to me, and it showed a lot of class 
in the manner in which they handled this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that talk of the Rams possibly moving from Anaheim Stadium -- 
Baltimore and St. Louis are among the cities courting the team -- also affected 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The uncertainty of that was a consideration, but not the major 
consideration," he said. "The football team that I am joining was the major 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Zampese has been the Rams' offensive coordinator for seven seasons. Last year, 
he coached the league's fifth-best running offense, which featured 1993 rookie 
of the year Jerome Bettis. who finished second to Dallas' Emmitt Smith in the 
NFL rushing title. 
</P>
<P>
 Zampese discouraged suggestions that there are differences between him and Ram 
Coach Chuck Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been so much talk about Chuck and myself (not working well 
together), but he never, ever interfered with the offense. He allowed me to do 
anything I wanted to do, and like any head coach, when you're losing, he wanted 
to know what we could do to improve our chances of scoring. Chuck has been just 
super in every way." 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Ram staff in 1987, Zampese was in charge of the "Air 
Coryell" offense of the San Diego Chargers under Don Coryell. He was the 
Chargers' offensive coordinator from 1983 to 1986, and receivers coach from 
1979 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the Chargers' defensive backs coach in 1976 but left to scout for the 
New York Jets from 1977 to 1978.

STRIKING OILS; A CUSTOM CONCOCTION OR PERSONAL POTION FROM ONE OF O.C.'S 
SPECIALTY SHOPS MAKES A ONE-OF-A KIND GIFT, SCENT WITH LOVE, FOR THAT ONE AND 
ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valentine's Day is coming, and love is in the air -- along with the scents of 
banana, watermelon, magnolia, cucumber and other exotics used to make 
custom-blended products that pamper the body. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of specialty shops in Orange County offer shampoos, body 
lotions, oils and after-shaves custom-made with scents of their customers' 
choosing. Many prefer these do-it-yourself body care products because they're 
more personal than the pre-formulated lotions and oils sold in department and 
drug stores. Would-be cupids can concoct massage oils and other love potions 
specifically for their beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing up your own shampoo or lotion is like playing scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shops offer customers a fragrance counter where they can sample the 
different scents by pulling wands from test tubes filled with perfume oils. 
Once they've picked a scent (anything from almond to ylang-ylang), they wait 
while the unscented lotion or other body product they've chosen is blended with 
a few drops of the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Often choices don't stop at the nose. Sometimes a shopper can pick the color 
of the shampoo or the thickness of the lotions. He can even select the size of 
the bottle, which usually can be returned for a refill at a small discount. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get our body lotions in the thickness you want, the size you want, 
the scent you want. Sometimes by the time people are done making all of their 
choices, they hate me," jokes Patti Werrlein, owner of Scents of the Soul in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Her customers can choose from lotions in six thicknesses, foaming bath and 
shower gel in five colors, shaving gel and after-shave, massage oils and two 
kinds of shampoo and conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Each product can be scented with any of the 160 perfume oils. There's coconut, 
orange blossom, cucumber ("it's great in a shower gel"), passion fruit, mango, 
vanilla, daffodil, blueberry, wisteria and watermelon. When a customer smells 
more than three perfume oils, Werrlein offers them a whiff from a tin of coffee 
beans to cleanse the nasal palate. 
</P>
<P>
 Oatmeal is usually popular with children, Werrlein says. Patchouli oil is one 
of her more popular scents, but she can't stand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it smells like oil and dirt," she says, wrinkling her nose. Yet five 
minutes later, a woman walks into her boutique requesting a half-ounce of 
patchouli oil -- straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Werrlein also offers "designer duplicates" that mimic brand-name fragrances. 
The copy-cat oils come in 40 women's fragrances (Chanel No. 5, Giorgio) and 20 
fragrances for men (Obsession, Eternity). They're less expensive than the real 
thing; most products come in four sizes, from two ounces to 16, and average $1 
an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often they can get a fragrance in a really light lotion that isn't sold over 
the counter," Werrlein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Custom-blending allows buyers to control the amount of scent they want in a 
product, says Heidi Blanton, manager of Millefleurs in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can have a light or heavy fragrance by adjusting the amount of oil," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Millefleurs carries lotions in three colors, body sprays, bath gels, shampoo 
and conditioners and body and massage oils that can be scented in one or more 
of 65 fragrances. The products come in four- and eight-ounce bottles and cost 
about $1 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 While fragrance oils might smell like orchids, honeysuckle and other plants, 
they're mostly synthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computer technology can copy the scent of any plant," Blanton says. 
</P>
<P>
 A rose extract might cost $200 an ounce if it were a true essential oil, 
Werrlein says. A half-ounce of her rose petal oil is $10; she says they smell 
identical, and a whiff of the sweet stuff is convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 For purists interested in the therapeutic properties of scents, Bare 
Escentuals in Fashion Island Newport Beach offers more than 15 pure plant 
extract oils, such as eucalyptus, rosemary and chamomile, to flavor their line 
of massage oils and lotions, Vitamin E body lotion, shampoo, conditioner and 
shower gel. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the 70 scents offered in the shop are synthetic. Products average 
$1 per ounce and come in different sized refillable bottles. Adding the extract 
oils costs extra -- from 5 cents to 33 cents a drop depending on the herb. Most 
products require a couple of drops an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives people their own special identity. When you go into a department 
store you're limited," says Vanessa O'Connor, vice president of stores for Bare 
Escentuals in San Francisco. "Here you create your own scent. If you like 
floral and cinnamon, you can mix them together." 
</P>
<P>
 Scents should be tried on the body before buying, suggests Amanda Smart, 
manager of the Body Shop in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. Fragrances smell 
differently than in the test tube because the skin absorbs the oil, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Body Shop stores in South Coast Plaza, Brea Mall and MainPlace/Santa Ana 
offer foaming bath oil, lotions and massage oils that can be blended in 22 
fragrances. Customers can visit the stores' perfume tester bars and use glass 
dippers to choose from an earthy masculine scent such as sandalwood or a sweet 
fragrance such as rose or lilac. Their products also fall in the $1-an-ounce 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you feel unique when you're choosing your own scent rather than 
wearing what other people are wearing," Smart says.
